40|$|Background Allopregnanolone {{plays a role}} in {{the stress}} {{response}} <b>and</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> <b>Alterations</b> in the estrogen milieu during the perinatal period influence brain development in a manner that persists into adulthood. Accordingly, we showed that a single administration of estradiol benzoate (EB) on the day of birth decreases brain allopregnanolone concentrations in adult female rats. Objective We examined whether the persistent decrease in allopregnanolone concentrations, induced by neonatal EB treatment, might affect sensitivity to stress during adulthood. Methods Female rats were treated with 10 μg of EB or vehicle on the day of birth. During adulthood, the response to acute foot shock stress was assessed by measuring changes in brain allopregnanolone and corticosterone levels, aswell as extracellular dopamine output in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Results Neonatal EB treatment enhanced stress-stimulated allopregnanolone levels in the hypothalamus, as well as extracellular dopamine output in the mPFC; this latest effect is reverted by subchronic progesterone treatment. By contrast, neonatal EB treatment did not alter stress-induced corticosterone levels, sensitivity to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis negative feedback, or abundance of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Conclusions The persistent decrease in brain allopregnanolone concentrations, induced by neonatal EB treatment, enhances stress-stimulated allopregnanolone levels and extracellular dopamine output during adulthood. These effects are not associated to an impairment in HPA axis activity. Heightened sensitivity to stress is a risk factor for several neuropsychiatric disorders; these results suggest that exposure to estrogen during development may predispose individuals to such disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCadmium (Cd) is a {{toxic metal}} and can induce and/or promote {{diseases}} in humans (cancer, aging diseases, kidney and bone diseases, etc.). Its toxicity involves many mechanisms including the alteration of copper (Cu) <b>and</b> zinc (Zn) <b>homeostasis</b> leading to {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) production, either directly or through the inhibition of antioxidant activities. Importantly, ROS can induce oxidative damages in cells. Cadmium, Cu and Zn are also able to induce glutathione (GSH) and metallothioneins (MT) synthesis in a cell-type-dependent manner. As a consequence, the effects induced by these three metals result simultaneously from the inhibition of antioxidant activities and the induction of other factors such as GSH and MT synthesis. MT levels are regulated {{not only by the}} p 53 protein in a cell-type-dependent manner, or by transcription factors such as metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF- 1) and cellular Zn levels but also by cellular GSH level.

40|$|Abstract LCAT is a {{key enzyme}} of reverse {{cholesterol}} transport that is essential to maintain HDL-mediated lipid transport <b>and</b> cholesterol <b>homeostasis.</b> <b>Alterations</b> in LCAT expression {{have a profound effect}} on plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations. Previously LCAT mRNA and activity were shown to be regulated by several inflammatory cytokines, including the pleiotrophic cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). A series of full-length and sequential deletion LCAT promoter constructs were used to determine whether inflammatory stimuli affect LCAT transcription and to further identify functional, cytokine-responsive promoter regions that mediate this response. Using transfected HepG 2 cells, results indicate that treatment with IL- 6 induced a 2. 5 -fold activation of full-length LCAT promoter activity. A minimal (� 1514 bp to � 1508 bp) IL- 6 response element with high sequence homology to the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family member, STAT 3, was mapped within the distal promoter and shown to be sufficient to mediate the IL- 6 response. Further, overexpression of STAT 3 significantly enhanced the effect of IL- 6 on LCAT promoter activity. These data suggest that the IL- 6 responsive transcription factor, STAT 3, contributes to LCAT transcriptional regulation.

Thus, the identification of potential mediators of metabolic processes could be important for increasing understanding of these diseases. To examine the role of AnxA 6 in a metabolic context, C 57 BL/ 6 mice lacking AnxA 6 (AnxA 6 KO) were fed a high fat diet (HFD) to induce an obese and insulin resistant phenotype. HFD feeding revealed that AnxA 6 KO mice were less susceptible to diet induced obesity, despite consuming more food. An oral glucose tolerance test showed similar glucose disposal in WT and AnxA 6 KO mice. However, a pyruvate tolerance test resulted in sustained hyperglycaemia in AnxA 6 KO mice, without concomitant defects in insulin release or signalling. In fact, insulin signalling was enhanced in livers of AnxA 6 KO mice. Aberrant hepatic glucose handling was underscored by the presence of increased glycogen accumulation in livers from AnxA 6 KO mice, and glycogen in autophagic vesicles. Lipid profiling revealed increased lipolysis and increased high density lipoprotein in AnxA 6 KO mice. AnxA 6 KO mice had reduced hepatic steatosis, and a reduction in lipid droplet (LD) accumulation was observed in cells with AnxA 6 knockdown. Conversely, cultured hepatocytes overexpressing AnxA 6 had increased LD accumulation. Thus, loss of AnxA 6 alters both lipid <b>and</b> glucose <b>homeostasis,</b> <b>and</b> the complex phenotype observed may be a result of impaired metabolic fuel switching (known as metabolic flexibility).

40|$|ABSTRACT While {{research}} has identified {{an important contribution}} for metals, such as iron, in microbial pathogenesis, the roles of other transition metals, such as copper, remain mostly unknown. Recent evidence points to a requirement for copper homeo-stasis in the virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans based on a role for a CUF 1 copper regulatory factor in mouse models and in a human patient cohort. C. neoformans is an important fungal pathogen that results in an estimated 600, 000 AIDS-related deaths yearly. In the present studies, we found that a C. neoformansmutant lacking the CUF 1 -dependent copper transporter, CTR 4, grows normally in rich medium at 37 °C but has reduced survival in macrophages and attenuated virulence in a mouse model. This reduced survival and virulence were traced to a growth defect under nutrient-restricted conditions. Expression studies us-ing a full-length CTR 4 -fluorescent fusion reporter construct demonstrated robust expression in macrophages, brain, and lung, the latter shown by ex vivo fluorescent imaging. Inductively coupled mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was used to probe the copper quota of fungal cells grown in definedmedium and recovered from brain, which suggested a role for a copper-protective func-tion of CTR 4 in combination with cell metallothioneins under copper-replete conditions. In summary, these data suggest a role for CTR 4 in copper-related <b>homeostasis</b> <b>and</b> subsequently in fungal virulence. IMPORTANCE Crytococcus neoformans is a significant global fungal <b>pathogen,</b> <b>and</b> copper <b>homeostasis</b> is a relatively unexplored aspect of microbial pathogenesis {{that could lead to}} novel therapeutics. Previous studies correlated expression levels of a Ctr...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a {{multifactorial disease}} in which environmental, immune and genetic factors are {{involved}} in the pathogenesis. Although biological therapies (antibodies anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha or anti-integrin) have considerably improved the symptoms and quality of life of IBD patients, some drawbacks have emerged limiting their long-term use. In addition, prevention of relapses and treatment of resistant ulcers remains a clinical challenge. In this context, {{a better understanding of the}} pathophysiology of IBD and the development of novel therapeutic intervention would benefit from further basic and preclinical research into the role of the cellular microenvironment and the interaction between its cellular constituents. In this context, the role of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and the gut immune response has fuelled an increased interest in the last few years. Recent advances, summarized in this review, have highlighted the ENS as playing a key role in the control of IEB functions <b>and</b> gut immune <b>homeostasis,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>alterations</b> of the ENS could be directly associated in the development of IBD and its associated symptoms...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} evident that an {{autoimmune}} component {{could play a}} role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and/or progression. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify neuronal antigenic targets specifically recognized by serum autoantibodies and to investigate their cellular effects and their possible pathogenetic role. We identified, by an immunoproteomic approach using mouse brain proteins, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase beta subunit as a new autoantigen in AD. Using an ELISA assay we found that serum anti-ATP synthase autoantibodies were present in 38 % of patients with AD, but in no age-matched healthy subjects or in patients with Parkinson's disease or atherosclerosis. Analytical cytology studies, using SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell line, showed that ATP synthase autoantibodies were capable of inducing the inhibition of ATP synthesis, <b>alterations</b> of mitochondrial <b>homeostasis</b> <b>and</b> cell death by apoptosis. These findings suggest that autoantibodies specific to ATP synthase can exert a pathogenetic role via a mechanism that brings into play the impairment of the extracellular ATP <b>homeostasis</b> <b>and</b> the <b>alteration</b> of mitochondrial function triggering cell death by apoptosis.

40|$|Gram {{negative}} pathogens {{are protected}} against toxic electrophilic compounds by glutathione-gated potassium efflux systems (Kef) that modulate cytoplasmic pH. We have elucidated {{the mechanism of}} gating through structural and functional analysis of Escherichia coli KefC. The revealed mechanism can explain how subtle chemical differences in glutathione derivatives can produce opposite effects on channel function. Kef channels are regulated by potassium transport and NAD-binding (KTN) domains that sense both reduced glutathione, which inhibits Kef activity, and glutathione adducts that form during electrophile detoxification and activate Kef. We find that reduced glutathione stabilizes an interdomain association between two KTN folds, whereas large adducts sterically disrupt this interaction. F 441 is identified as the pivotal residue discriminating between reduced glutathione and its conjugates. We demonstrate a major structural change on the binding of an activating ligand to a KTN-domain protein. Analysis of the regulatory interactions suggests strategies to disrupt <b>pathogen</b> potassium <b>and</b> pH <b>homeostasis...</b>|$|R
40|$|The human {{complement}} system {{plays an important}} role in the defense against invading <b>pathogens,</b> inflammation <b>and</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> Invading microbes, such as bacteria, directly activate the {{complement system}} resulting in the formation of chemoattractants and in effective labeling of the bacteria for phagocytosis. In addition, formation of the membrane attack complex is responsible for direct killing of Gram-negative bacteria. In turn, bacteria have evolved several ways to evade complement activation on their surface in order to be able to colonize and invade the human host. One important mechanism of bacterial escape is attraction of complement regulatory proteins to the microbial surface. These molecules are present in the human body for tight regulation of the complement system to prevent damage to host self-surfaces. Therefore, recruitment of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface results in decreased complement activation on the microbial surface which favors bacterial survival. This review will discuss recent advances in understanding the binding of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface at the molecular level. This includes, new insights that have become available concerning specific conserved motives on complement regulatory proteins that are favorable for microbial binding. Finally, complement evasion molecules are of high importance for vaccine development due to their dominant role in bacterial survival, high immunogenicity and homology as well as their presence on the bacterial surface. Here, the use of complement evasion molecules for vaccine development will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{studies on}} {{risk factors for}} {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) have mainly focused on diet, and being overweight is now recognized to contribute significantly to CRC risk. Overweight and obesity are defined as an excess of adipose tissue mass and are associated with disorders in lipid metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and retinoid-activated receptors (RARs and RXRs) are important modulators of lipid metabolism <b>and</b> cellular <b>homeostasis.</b> <b>Alterations</b> in expression <b>and</b> activity of these ligand-activated transcription factors might be involved in obesity-associated diseases, which include CRC. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) also plays {{a critical role in}} lipid metabolism and alterations in COX- 2 expression have already been associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes in epithelial tumors. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the hypothesis questioning the relationship between alterations in the expression of nuclear receptors and COX- 2 and the weight status among male subjects with CRC. Method The mRNA expression of the different nuclear receptor subtypes and of COX- 2 was measured in 20 resected samples of CRC and paired non-tumor tissues. The association between expression patterns and weight status defined as a body mass index (BMI) was statistically analyzed. Results No changes were observed in PPARγ mRNA expression while the expression of PPARδ, retinoid-activated receptors and COX- 2 were significantly increased in cancer tissues compared to normal colon mucosa (P ≤ 0. 001). The weight status appeared to be an independent factor, although we detected an increased level of COX- 2 expression in the normal mucosa from overweight patients (BMI ≥ 25) compared to subjects with healthy BMI (P = 0. 002). Conclusion Our findings show that alterations in the pattern of nuclear receptor expression observed in CRC do not appear to be correlated with patient weight status. However, the analysis of COX- 2 expression in normal colon mucosa from subjects with a high BMI suggests that COX- 2 deregulation might be driven by excess weight during the colon carcinogenesis process. </p...|$|R
