30|$|The {{relationship}} between agile <b>project</b> <b>speed</b> and company experience was 118.16 (df = 15, p< 0.001), a high association. This evidence {{points out that}} companies with more experience in agile methods tend to report faster project speeds. We also found an association between worries around Regulatory compliance and company size (χ ^ 2 = 32.86, df = 5, p< 0.001), indicating that larger companies exhibit an inclination to worry more about regulations when adopting agile. Finally, we found an association between the management skills barrier and company experience (χ ^ 2 = 22.93, df = 5, p< 0.001). The trend is that more experienced agile companies perceive management skills as an important issue to fully spread agile practices throughout the organization.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Agile {{projects}} are showing greater promise in rapid fielding {{as compared to}} waterfall projects. However, {{there is a lack}} of clarity regarding what really constitutes and contributes to success. We interviewed project teams with incremental development lifecycles, from five government and commercial organizations, to gain a better understanding of success and failure factors for rapid fielding on their projects. A key area we explored involves how Agile projects deal with the pressure to rapidly deliver high-value capability, while maintaining <b>project</b> <b>speed</b> (delivering functionality to the users quickly) and product stability (providing reliable and flexible product architecture). For example, due to schedule pressure we often see a pattern of high initial velocity for weeks or months, followed by a slowing of velocity due to stability issues.

40|$|It may be {{that project}} {{managers}} are looking in the wrong places to find improvements. Rather than searching for tools and techniques, the best leverage probably comes from removing barriers.

Speed bumps reflect imbalance, so I will explain how creating balance is an attribute of a great organization.

40|$|AbstractAs {{correlation}} of broadband seismic noise begins {{to be used}} for long-term monitoring of geological objects, we assess the theoretical feasibility to monitor CO 2 geological storage with this method. We use the Ketzin pilot <b>project</b> <b>speed</b> profile in order to compute the theoretical speed perturbation of Rayleigh waves, and we compare them to natural variations recorded on the field using a broadband network. Our results show that, if we consider a theoretical demonstrator-scale injection at the Ketzin site, the perturbation induced by the CO 2 bubble is greater than recorded natural variations. We show that the method is sensible to CO 2 bubble cross-sections: a 3 D tomography is therefore possible with a carefully placed network. For a CO 2 geological storage geology similar to Ketzin, the minimum cross-section that can be detected is 100000 m 2, 500 meters wide if the whole 200 m reservoir level is filled...|$|E

40|$|When {{faced with}} the need for change, {{businesses}} struggle with issues such as <b>project</b> <b>speed,</b> complexity, deliverable quality, and ownership of results within the organization. Incorporating facilitated work sessions into the project lifecycle to produce specific deliverables accelerates creation of the deliverable, contributes to process and deliverable quality, and ensures early ownership of results.
