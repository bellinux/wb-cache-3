He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in <b>physical</b> <b>space</b> available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H.

5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the <b>physical</b> <b>space</b> within a galaxy beyond the {{influence}} of each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E

Additionally, this study seeks to challenge the heightened prominence of extrinsic motivation in gamification research and practice by proposing a methodology that uses intrinsic model. This is important to transmedia producers who develop experiences that span across both digital and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces.</b> This research lays the groundwork for an operational framework that can be applied across digital and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces.</b> This study will use Quantic Foundry’s Gamer Motivation Model to explore how digital motivation models can be applied to and explored in <b>physical</b> <b>spaces</b> and events.

For example, "there is an authorized path to exit the building from every room. " In contrast, individual access-control components, such as doors and turnstiles, can only enforce local policies, specifying when the component may open. In practice, {{the gap between the}} system-wide, global requirements and the many local policies is bridged manually, which is tedious, error-prone, and scales poorly. We propose a framework to automatically synthesize local access control policies from a set of global {{requirements for}} <b>physical</b> <b>spaces.</b> Our framework consists of an expressive language to specify both global requirements and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces,</b> and an algorithm for synthesizing local, attribute-based policies from the global specification. We empirically demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on three substantial case studies. The studies demonstrate that access control synthesis is practical even for complex <b>physical</b> <b>spaces,</b> such as airports, with many interrelated security requirements...|$|R

The system resilience function is formulated as a power-form product of the survival probabilities of cyber and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces,</b> each with a corresponding correlation coefficient. The contest success functions based on the reinforcement and attack levels are used to estimate the survival probabilities of cyber and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces.</b> We present the provider strategies based on the Nash equilibrium of the game, and analyze the sensitivities with respect to cyber and physical correlation coefficients, target revenues and costs. The results show that these correlation coefficients affect the cyber and physical reinforcement strategies, and also provide {{new insights into the}} system resilience. I...|$|R

40|$|Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are {{characterized}} by the interplay between digital and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces.</b> This characteristic has extended the attack surface that could be exploited by an offender to cause harm. An increasing number of cyber-physical incidents may occur depending on {{the configuration of the}} <b>physical</b> and digital <b>spaces</b> and their interplay. Traditional investigation processes are not adequate to investigate these incidents, as they may overlook the extended attack surface resulting from such interplay, leading to relevant evidence being missed and testing flawed hypotheses explaining the incidents. The software engineering research community can contribute to addressing this problem, by deploying existing formalisms to model digital and <b>physical</b> <b>spaces,</b> and using analysis techniques to reason about their interplay and evolution. In this paper, supported by a motivating example, we describe some emerging software engineering challenges to support investigations of cyber-physical incidents.
