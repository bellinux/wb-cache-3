5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include meadow brome Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria. Associated calcicole species include meadow cranesbill Geranium pratense, clustered bell-flower Campanula glomerata, cowslip Primula veris, hoary plantain Plantago media, salad burnet Sanguisorba minor and lady’s bedstraw Galium verum.The meadow is surrounded by old hedgerows with a variety of species such as ash Fraxinus excelsior, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, field maple Acer campestre, spindle Euonymus europaeus, dogwood Cornus sanguinea, and buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus.

30|$|Salix purpurea L. is a willow species {{native to}} much of Europe (north to the British Isles, Poland, and the Baltic States), western Asia, and North Africa (Argus 1997; Skvortsov 1999; Sulima et al. 2009). It is a {{deciduous}} shrub growing 1 – 3  m tall, with purple-brown to yellow–brown shoots, green foliage, and small purple or red catkins produced in the early spring. S. purpurea has frequently been cultivated for its commercially important biomass. <b>Purple</b> <b>willow</b> bark contains a particularly valuable raw material traditionally used {{for the production of}} natural aspirin and other salicylic glycosides with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects (Skrzypczyńska 2001; Hakmaoui et al. 2007; Aliferis et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{identify}} {{the productivity of}} the genus Salix L. plants and study the relationship between its structural elements. Methods. Field study, laboratory analysis, analytical approach. Results. It {{was found that the}} height of a three-year plants of species ranged from 86. 0 to 775. 1 cm, of hybrid forms – from 197. 0 to 488. 0 cm. Average diameter of three-year plants varied in the range of 19. 10 to 52. 94 mm (species) and from 28. 04 to 49. 23 mm (hybrid forms). The highest stability for complex of morphological characters was observed in bog willow samples. It was determined that among species basket willow (16. 94 t/ha) and white willow (21. 19 t/ha) were the most productive for dry biomass yield per 1 hectare, among hybrid forms – <b>purple</b> <b>willow</b> × basket willow (23. 36 t/ha) and basket willow × bog willow (18. 57 t/ha). It was established that the value of the plants productivity was characterized by moderate, significant and close correlations with the average diameter of plants, length and number of shoots of the second order. Conclusions. A comprehensive assessment of productivity traits of three-year plants from willow collection was conducted, index of dry matter yield per 1 hectare was defined. The links between quantitative traits that characterize the contribution of some of them in productivity index were investigated. Method of cluster analysis was used to group samples for the similarity of complex agronomic characters. Basket willow and white willow as well as such hybrid forms as basket willow × bog willow and <b>purple</b> <b>willow</b> × basket willow were recommended to use as a source material for selection of samples with high productivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} use of Salix {{species in}} the manufacture of various products has been attracting interest towards the Salicaceae family in South America. This paper reports the physical and mechanical parameters of Salix viminalis L. (purple osier), Salix x rubens Schrank (basket willow), Salix purpurea Linné (<b>purple</b> <b>willow)</b> and Salix sp., cultivated in the Canoas River Valley, in the Serra Catarinense region of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The evaluations were conducted with raw material, the most commonly used format in handcrafts, and the results indicate there are differences in physical and mechanical properties among the species. Salix viminalis and Salix purpurea were similar in density and in their modulus of elasticity, and had higher values of tensile and strength modulus than Salix x rubens and Salix sp...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{bioengineering}} {{techniques that}} use vegetation as a structural element gained {{popularity in the}} field of natural and man-made slope stabilisation due to their ability to combine safety and environmental conservation elements. In spite of such popularity, little research has been done to quantify their effect on slope stability. This work presents a simple scheme for the evaluation of the Factor of Safety for slopes reinforced by brush layering, {{which is one of the}} most common techniques adopted in slope stabilisation works. The proposed model is based on the limit equilibrium principle and accounts for geotechnical soil properties (cohesion, friction angle, unit weight of soil), soil saturation, slope steepness, and brush layer design parameters (number of stems per meter, length and diameter of stems, distance between brush layers). The model provides the value of the Factor of Safety for a given slope and soil depth. Laboratory pullout tests were carried out in order to estimate relevant parameters of cuttings of <b>purple</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix purpurea L.) and to perform a slope stability analysis via the model...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{understood}} that soil microbial communities control nutrient cycling, trace metal biogeochemistry and bioavailability in both aquatic and terrestrial systems, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are not entirely clear. The objective of this work was to describe the microbial community composition, dynamics, and mechanisms controlling heavy metal biogeochemistry in the rhizosphere of <b>purple</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix purpurea L.) growing in the heavy metal affected circum-neutral histosols of Elba, NY, {{as well as to}} explore microbial metal mobilization in the African dust deposited on Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies. After extensive site characterization examining both spatial and temporal biogeochemistry of sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) at the Elba site, I focused on the composition of the willow rhizosphere microbial community and specific activities leading to enhanced metal mobilization. Cloning of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed a diverse and uniquely adapted microbial consortium present in the S. purpurea rhizosphere included members of Acidobacteriales, Actinomycetales, Planctomycetales, Verrucomicrobiales, Myxococcales, Sphingobacteriales, as well as members of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria. Culture-based techniques yielded a large proportion of isolates belonging to Bacillales, but also revealed members of Actinomycetales, Xanthomonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Burkholderiales to be contributing to heavy metal mobilization via siderophore production. In Trinidad and Tobago, I utilized the African dust microbial culture collection of the University of the West Indies to quantify the proportion of organisms capable of producing siderophores and thereby releasing bioavailable iron (Fe) into downwind ecosystems. I found that roughly 65 % of organisms collected during African dust events produced siderophores, and all classes of siderophores were detected. The proportion of siderophore-producing isolates in Elba and in African dust was similar, and greater than in other reported soil systems. Increased siderophore production could be a result of heavy-metal stress; in the soils of Elba, Zn, Cd, Cu are inherently high, while in the African dust, typically Cu and molybdenum (Mo) are enriched. In these unique and disparate soil systems, microbial siderophore production appears to be shared mechanism for selective heavy metal mobilization or immobilization, demonstrating a powerful means by which soil microorganisms may impact biogeochemistry around the world...|$|E
