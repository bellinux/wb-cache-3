50|$|The % purity is 100% × (specific {{activity}} of enzyme sample / specific {{activity of}} <b>pure</b> <b>enzyme).</b> The impure sample has lower specific activity {{because some of}} the mass is not actually enzyme. If the specific activity of 100% <b>pure</b> <b>enzyme</b> is known, then an impure sample will have a lower specific activity, allowing purity to be calculated.|$|E
50|$|However, CLECs have an {{inherent}} disadvantage: enzyme crystallization is a laborious procedure requiring enzyme of high purity, which translates to prohibitively high costs. The more recently developed cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), {{on the other}} hand, are produced by simple precipitation of the enzyme from aqueous solution, as physical aggregates of protein molecules, {{by the addition of}} salts, or water miscible organic solvents or non-ionic polymers. The physical aggregates are held together by covalent bonding without perturbation of their tertiary structure, that is without denaturation. Subsequent cross-linking of these physical aggregates renders them permanently insoluble while maintaining their pre-organized superstructure, and, hence their catalytic activity. This discovery {{led to the development of}} a new family of immobilized enzymes: cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs). Since precipitation from an aqueous medium, by addition of ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol, is often used to purify enzymes, the CLEA methodology essentially combines purification and immobilization into a single unit operation that does not require a highly <b>pure</b> <b>enzyme.</b> It could be used, for example, for the direct isolation of an enzyme, in a purified and immobilized form suitable for performing biotransformations, from a crude fermentation broth.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} activity of an enzyme is another common unit. This is {{the activity of}} an enzyme per milligram of total protein (expressed in μmol min−1mg−1). Specific activity gives a measurement of enzyme purity in the mixture. It is the moles of product formed by an enzyme in a given amount of time (minutes) under given conditions per milligram of total proteins. Specific activity {{is equal to the}} rate of reaction multiplied by the volume of reaction divided by the mass of total protein. The SI unit is katal kg−1, but a more practical unit is μmol mg−1 min−1. Specific activity is a measure of enzyme processivity, at a specific (usually saturating) substrate concentration, and is usually constant for a <b>pure</b> <b>enzyme.</b> For elimination of errors arising from differences in cultivation batches and/or misfolded enzyme etc. an active site titration needs to be done. This {{is a measure of the}} amount of active enzyme, calculated by e.g. titrating the amount of active sites present by employing an irreversible inhibitor. The {{specific activity}} should then be expressed as μmol min−1 mg−1 active enzyme. If the molecular weight of the enzyme is known, the turnover number, or μmol product per second per μmol of active enzyme, can be calculated from the specific activity. The turnover number can be visualized as the number of times each enzyme molecule carries out its catalytic cycle per second.|$|E

30|$|The {{preparation}} of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) {{is a relatively}} recent enzyme immobilization technique developed {{in the group of}} Prof Roger Sheldon (Sheldon 2011).

In the next step, the aggregate is cross linked with different reagents and it is not a very complex process. The best known reagent for {{preparation of}} CLEA is glutaraldehyde (Sheldon 2011). The CLEA technology combines both purification and immobilization into a one-step process and it does not need highly <b>pure</b> <b>enzymes</b> (Hwang and Gu 2013).

The MAb detected a unique protein band from crude embryo extracts of each species with the correct molecular mass (50 kilodaltons) and relative charge (RF = 0. 5 and 0. 3) of the respective enzymes. Competition experiments with substrates indicated that the glycosyl dinucleotide binding sites of the enzymes are probably not involved in MAb-enzyme recognition. Western blotting of samples from vegetative tissues of P. vulgaris detected {{a low level of}} O-glucosyltransferase but not O-xylosyltransferase, in leaves. These findings suggest the occurrence of two genes in P. vulgaris coding for O-glycosylation enzymes with tissue-specific expression. The MAb will be used to screen expression libraries and to obtain <b>pure</b> <b>enzymes</b> for amino acid sequencing and for the production of additional MAbs...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} this {{laboratory}} (1) on the inactivation of dilute solutions of crystalline trypsin in 0. 005 N hydrochloric acid by x-radiation {{at room temperature}} showed that the reaction yield, that is, the number of micromoles of trypsin per liter inactivated per 1000 roentgens (r), increases markedly as the initial concentration of trypsin is increased from 0. 1 to 200 micromolar (~). On the other hand, Dale and his coworkers (2) demonstrated that the reaction yield for the inactivation of aqueous solutions of crystalline carboxypeptidase by x-rays is constant for concentrations of enzyme between 6 and 600 /~M. Only a slight rise in the reaction field for the inactivation of aqueous solutions of crystalline pepsin by high voltage electrons was observed by Bellamy and Lawton (3) when the concentration of pepsin was increased from 2. 8 to 140 ~s. These are the only <b>pure</b> <b>enzymes</b> that have been studied extensively over a wide concentration range. Fricke's observations (4) on the reactivity of hydrochloric acid in radiation studies raised the question whether the continuous rise in reaction field wit...|$|R
