It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009.

The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009.

25|$|The VOC had {{two types}} of shareholders: the participanten, who {{could be seen as}} non-{{managing}} members, and the 76 bewindhebbers (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock companies at the time. The innovation {{in the case of the}} VOC was that the liability of not just the participanten but also of the bewindhebbers was limited to the <b>paid-in</b> <b>capital</b> (usually, bewindhebbers had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be permanent during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} {{the impact of}} macroeconomic and institutional conditions on cross- country variation in nascent entrepreneurship. Some authors have found significant effects of macroeconomic and institutional variables in their papers. We use data from 56 countries involved in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor project. We analyse these data from 2006 - 2012 period using econometric panel data methods. Our results do not confirm the impact {{of most of the}} included variables. The results show that the established entrepreneurship rate seems to influence the nascent entrepreneurship rate positively. We also find weak negative effect of amount of <b>paid-in</b> minimum <b>capital</b> associated with starting business. We test the hypothesis of U-shape relation between economic development and nascent entrepreneurship rate. Our results support this hypothesis only in the model without any control variable. The influence of economic development on nascent entrepreneurship rate is insignificant in our full model. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
