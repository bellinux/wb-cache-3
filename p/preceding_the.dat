In this case, only <b>the</b> auxiliary verb <b>precedes</b> <b>the</b> subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of [...] ("be") or [...] ("do"). Particles like the negative [...] ("not") <b>precede</b> <b>the</b> inflected verb. Examples: ...|$|R

After establishing baseline rates, the reinforcement schedule associated with the blue and yellow components was altered so that one was now an extinction schedule and the other was a variable-interval 1 -min schedule.
