Because of the toxic effects of nitrite, to replace the use of nitrite mostly natural additives. Tomato industries yield a high amount of by-products mainly <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> and seeds. Since <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> is rich in lycopene, it can be added directly in 0 %, 3 % and 6 % (w/w) in meat mixture used in beef sausage manufacture. This study is designed to investigate the chemical properties of nitrosomyoglobinand oxidation level, sensorial properties and microbiological analyses of beef sausage which have been produced by both reducing the nitrite level and adding <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> powder. All samples have been stored at- 18 °C for 3 months. As the level of nitrite was reduced, the oxidation level of the beef sausage was increased significantly. Addition of <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> decreased the level of oxidation when compared to the samples which did not contain <b>tomato</b> <b>peel.</b> According to this result it can be stated that <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> retards the oxidation reaction. Nitrosomyoglobin (NOMb) content of the samples was decreased along with the decreased level of nitrite. Hardness values of treated samples were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those of control samples.

40|$|AbstractThe nine {{carotenoid}} pigment compounds of <b>tomato</b> <b>peels</b> {{were identified}} by HPLC analysis. The main component of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peels</b> was lycopene, phytoene, phytofluene, β-carotene, cis-lycopene and lutein. Consequently, the higher stability of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peels</b> was observed in alkaline pH ranging from 7 to 10 and temperature ranging from 40 to 70 °C. Meanwhile, the degradation of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> did not exceed than 16. 20 % of total pigments after 180 min incubation at 100 °C. On the other hand, the antioxidant activity of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> was also studied by the Rancimat test at 110 °C on sunflower oil by adding 50 – 200 ppm of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peels.</b> However, sunflower oil containing 50 – 200 ppm recorded higher induction period than 200 ppm BHT. Supplementing ice cream with carotenoids lyco-red extract increased the Radical Scavenging Activity RSA and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) in the ice cream by increasing the concentration of adding lyco-red extract. On the other hand, analysis of variance for sensory evaluation of prepared ice cream indicated that, ice cream containing 3 % and 2 % of carotenoids (lyco-red) extracted from <b>tomato</b> <b>peels</b> had the highest scores for flavor, body and texture, melting and color and the best mix compared with that prepared with 1 %, 4 % and 5 % which recorded the lowest scores in all tested quality attributes...|$|R

To study the effect of <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> and seed powder on physicochemical and nutritional properties of the tomato ketchup samples, the parameters including lycopen, total solid, brix, total sugars, reducing sugars, protein, fat, ash, fiber, vitamin C, pH, color (L, a/b) were evaluated. Rheological properties of the ketchup samples (consistency and viscosity) were determined and compared with control samples.

Addition of <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> and seed powder resulted in an increase in total solid, brix, ash, fiber, protein, fat, consistency and viscosity of the ketchup samples.

40|$|In this investigation, the {{influence}} of the application of Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) of different intensities (3 - 7 kV/cm and 0 - 300 μs) on the carotenoid extraction from <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> and pulp in a mixture of hexane:acetone:ethanol was studied with the aim of increasing extraction yield or reducing the percentage of the less green solvents in the extraction medium. According to the cellular disintegration index, the optimum treatment time for the permeabilization of <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> and pulp at different electric field strengths was 90 µs. The PEF permeabilization of tomato pulp did not significantly increase the carotenoid extraction. However, a PEF-treatment at 5 kV/cm improved the carotenoid extraction from <b>tomato</b> <b>peel</b> by 39 % as compared with the control in a mixture of hexane:ethanol:acetone (50 : 25 : 25).

The presence of acetone in the solvent mixture did not positively affect the carotenoid extraction when the <b>tomato</b> <b>peels</b> were PEF-treated. Response surface methodology was used to determine the potential of PEF for reducing the percentage of hexane in a hexane:ethanol mixture. The application of a PEF-treatment allowed reducing the hexane percentage from 45 to 30 % without affecting the carotenoid extraction yield.

The total carotenoid, lycopene, and β-carotene extraction yields were increased by the use of pectinase, cellulase, endo-xylanase, and proteinase enzymes in comparison with the non-enzyme-treated samples. The increase in the extraction yield was affected by the enzymes used, the enzyme concentration, the pretreatment time and temperature. Maximum total carotenoid (55. 15 mg/ 100 g d. w.), β-carotene (35. 85 mg/ 100 g d. w.), and lycopene (15. 44 mg/ 100 g d. w.) extraction yields were obtained in peels pretreated with mixed cellulase (100 U g − 1) and endo-xylanase (400 U g − 1) for 4 h at 50 °C.
