50|$|It is a {{cultivar}} (cultivated variety) of {{the species}} Pyrus communis, {{commonly known as the}} European Pear. The fruit has a bell shape, considered the traditional pear shape in the west, and its green skin turns yellow upon later ripening, although red-skinned derivative varieties exist. It is considered a summer pear, not as tolerant of cold as some varieties. It is often eaten raw, but holds its shape well when baked, and is a common choice for canned or other <b>processed</b> <b>pear</b> uses.|$|R
30|$|Apple and pear (Malus domestica and Pyrus communis) are anatomically hard to distinguish, {{therefore}} they are discussed together. The wood {{of those two}} species is still appreciated for furniture making and veneer production. Nevertheless, the wood could be challenged much more. In former times apple and pear were often utilized because of their combination of high resistance against abrasion, hardness, strength and comparable low sliding friction (Fig.  5). It was used for planes, spindles, cogwheels, shafts, axis and rolls. There are also other parameters like lubricity, {{which is one of}} the properties difficult to measure. They can be evaluated by analyzing historical objects representing the result of a long-term empirical <b>process.</b> <b>Pear</b> and apple were conspicuously often used for friction bearing where the named property is of great importance. Folkloristic literature mentions rolls for prayers beads [19], pounders [20], plows [21], oil presses [22] and windmills [21].|$|R

After 360 min of osmotic treatment of pears, WL ranged from 23. 71 to 31. 68 % at 20 °C, from 24. 80 to 40. 38 % at 35 °C and from 33. 30 to 52. 07 % a...|$|R
40|$|Awareness of {{the need}} to {{consider}} a consumption context when measuring the consumer's hedonic evaluation of a food product led researchers to investigate differences among responses given by consumers in different contexts. Previous studies measured the effects of evoking a consumption context, by using photographs or a written scenario, on hedonic evaluations of consumers for food products. This study investigated the influence of evoking a consumption context on hedonic evaluation of minimally <b>processed</b> cactus <b>pear</b> (Opuntia ficus-indica) fruit, using pictures and memories of pleasant personal experiences. A hedonic scale method for measuring food preferences was used. Hedonic evaluation of minimally <b>processed</b> cactus <b>pear</b> fruit with sensory differences by a sample of consumers (n= 150) when measured in the evoked context 'when having a pleasant personal experience' was compared with that of another sample (n= 150) measured outside context. Furthermore, sensory evaluation of 'experts' (n= 20) was accomplished. Differences in rating sensory attributes were found among the three samples. To test hedonic differences between the two samples of consumers, data sets were analyzed using ANOVA. A significant difference was observed between groups of consumers. Having obtained the rankings of sensory attributes, correlation between consumers' and experts' evaluations was measured using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. This study highlights that the influence of a positive evoked context on hedonic evaluation of sensory attributes of minimal <b>processed</b> cactus <b>pear</b> may influence consumer's purchasing behavior. Future research will explore the effect of evoking a consumption context comparing different fruit and whether this measure reflects product liking in actual consumption context...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{tree fruit}} {{production}} {{has attracted a}} significant interest over the last decade. Total US sale of organic food was about $ 13. 8 billion for 2005, and is growing at near 20 % annually (OTA, 2006). Fresh fruits and vegetables are the largest category of organic food sales (Dimitri and Greene, 2002). The state of Washington is the leading state in organic apple production, accounting for about 38 % of total US organic apple acres. Certified Washington State organic apple acreage increased from well below 500 total acres in the late 1980 s to 7, 642 acres in 2006 with an additional 4, 100 acres in the transition <b>process.</b> <b>Pear</b> is another major fruit grown in Washington, occupying about one third of national acreage. Certified organic pear acreage is 1, 251 acres with 276 acres in transition (Granatstein, Kirby and Feise, 2007). Due to the reasons we have discussed in the last report (Wang and Ge, 2006), the organic apple and pear certified acreages dropped since their peaks in 2002 and with {{a slight increase in}} 2006 for apples (Granatstein and Kirby, 2006). In this updated project, we estimate an inverse demand function to reveal the price response to quantities for organic apples and pears separately from 2003 to 2006. This demand function includes multiple grade fruits so that the cross grade effect can be evaluated. Specific objectives of this paper include, (1) estimating the percentage of low grades fruits marketed in recent years; (2) investigate the general price respond to quantities supplied to market; (3) studying the relationship between crop size of the lower grade fruits and the price response of higher grade fruits; and (4) analyzing the price boosting effect from a reduction in lower grade supplies...|$|R
40|$|Processing of pears as a fresh-cut product {{could offer}} added value and {{introduce}} a product {{into the market}} that offers greater convenience and health benefits for consumers. Cultivar selection {{is one of the}} most important considerations for fresh-cut fruit processing because characteristics such as flesh texture, skin colour, and browning potential can vary greatly among cultivars. Four pear cultivars (‘Flor de invierno’, ‘Passe-Crassane’, ‘Ercolini’ and ‘Conference’) and four antioxidant treatments, that is, (NS) 50 g L- 1 NatureSeal® AS 1 (Agricoat) solution, (AsAc) 20 g L- 1 ascorbic acid + 10 g L- 1 citric acid + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution, (CaAs) 20 g L- 1 calcium ascorbate + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution and (NaAs) 20 g L- 1 sodium ascorbate + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution, were tested to obtain a high-quality fresh-cut pear. For the selected cultivar and treatment, the nutritional changes and physicochemical, microbial and sensorial quality were evaluated under conditions that simulated commercial application followed by storage at 4 °C and a simulated cold chain break at 8 °C. The ‘Conference’ pear was selected as the best cultivar based on its physicochemical characteristics (high levels of soluble solids content and low acidity), low increase in browning index, and visual acceptance after 7 days of storage. The results demonstrated that CaAs maintained the fresh-cut pear quality after 8 days of storage at 4 °C and also after a cold chain break. Furthermore, application of the selected treatment produced an increase in the ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of minimally <b>processed</b> <b>pear</b> samples. These values were reduced during shelf life, but the total phenolic content at the final sampling point was higher than that of fresh-cut pears after processing without treatment.

40|$|This dissertation, {{which is}} also {{referred}} as the Summary of Learning of a professional doctorate, is intended to 'pull together all the learning that had taken place' situated at the workplace. As this doctorate is oriented towards professional practice, {{with its emphasis on}} theory informing practice and practice in turn refining theory, it therefore includes distilled professional learning from the past as well as the learning synthesised from the workplace based projects. This in turn forms the basis and framework to which, new 'working' knowledge is formulated and contributed. This 'thesis' entitled strategic planning, discusses two key topics of competitive strategy formulation and strategy implementation effectiveness are studied through two sequential integrated workplace based projects. Managers are sometimes tasked with the responsibility of formulating competitive business strategies. Mintzberg (2005), once criticised managers that they 'analyse and plan like mad; they just don’t strategize'. This criticism is rightly justified because managers are often at a loss when required to formulate strategies. The managers engaged {{in the development of the}} Strategy Formulation Process (SFP), strategy models based primarily on Porter’s (2004) work on competitive strategy, the Integrated Situation Assessment Framework (ISAF) and other various strategy models reported that they have become more equipped and knowledgeable to undertake such future assignments. Likewise, the managers engaged in the development of the strategy implementation evaluation <b>process</b> (<b>PEAR),</b> Situation Implementation Effectiveness Evaluation (SIEE) model and matrix based on the academic work of the strategy evaluation by Johnson, Scholes and Whittington in 2008 have also reported that these new tools and processes are helpful in their understanding of how to evaluate the strategy and their implementation effectiveness. Their reflection and learning point to 'change' and new knowledge in terms of both academic and functional knowledge which has benefited both business stakeholders and related community have been documented. The application of Action Research methodology, appropriate for workplace based learning is reaffirmed through my collaboration with these managers in solving these two workplace problems. Real time distilled learning is acquired through reflection-in-action during the projects and past learning is distilled through reflection-on-action which when combined makes up the total reflective learning experience through workplace based learning. ...|$|R
40|$|Type-B {{response}} regulators (B-RRs) are transcription {{factors that}} {{function in the}} final step of two-component signaling systems. In model plants, B-RRs {{have been shown to}} play important roles in cytokinin signal transduction. However, the functions of B-RRs in pear have not been well studied. In this report, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 11 putative genes encoding B-PpRR proteins based on the published genome sequence of Pyrus bretschneideri. A phylogenetic tree of the B-PpRR family was constructed, and the motif distribution, chromosome localization, and gene structure of B-PpRR family genes were determined. Gene transcript profiles, which were determined from transcriptome data, indicated that B-PpRR genes potentially function during pear fruit development, bud dormancy, and light/hormone-induced anthocyanin accumulation. Treatment of the fruitlets of 'Cuiguan' pear (Pyrus pyrifolia), which never accumulates anthocyanin, with the cytokinin N-(2 -chloro- 4 -pyridyl) - N'-phenylurea (CPPU) clearly induced anthocyanin accumulation. Anthocyanins accumulated in the skin of fruitlets by 16 days after CPPU treatment, along with the significant activation of most anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Analyses of B-PpRR transcript levels suggested that B-PpRR genes mediated this accumulation of anthocyanins. These findings enrich our understanding of the function of B-PpRR genes in the physiological <b>processes</b> of <b>pear...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the convective drying process used for cylindrical samples of two different pear varieties, one originating from Europe (Pyrus communis) and the other from Asia (Pyrus pyrifolia), submitted to two blanching treatments, as well as determine some coefficients referring to heat and mass transfer and thermodynamic parameters of the process, being: enthalpy (Delta H*), entropy (Delta S*) and Gibbs energy of activation (Delta G*). All samples were dried in a forced air oven at temperatures of (62, 76, 84 and 92) degrees C until reaching a constant mass. The heat and mass transfer coefficients referring to the constant and falling- rate drying periods were obtained by adjusting the experimental data to wet bulb temperature and liquid diffusion models, respectively. The heat and mass transfer coefficients varied linearly with temperature. Blanching altered the drying behavior of the two varieties {{in relation to the}} non- blanched samples, mainly at the elevated drying temperatures of 84 degrees C and 92 degrees C. Delta H* and Delta S* decreased while Delta G* increased with the elevation of drying temperature; therefore, it was possible to verify that variation in the diffusion <b>process</b> in <b>pears</b> during drying is dependent on energetic contributions of the environment...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the raising}} {{dehydration}} techniques more recently developed is instant decompression controlled vacuum (DIC; Détente instantannée Contrôlée), which causes {{a modification of}} microand macrostructure of food causing {{an expansion of the}} product, which improves their texture, color and rehydration capacity. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate specifically cultivars of pear (Conferencia) and apple (Reineta) from Bierzo (León, Spain) as raw material during processing from dehydrated process (DIC) and determines their suitability for snack industrial applications. To this end, samples of each fruit species were taken at harvest (0 weeks), and after 6 and 12 weeks of storage, peeled and sliced in two formats (2 and 4 mm). Several parameters were measured before (ºBrix, firmness and weight loss) and after (moisture content and water activity) DIC process. Results indicate that apple shows more stable for any format-studied compare to <b>pear</b> during DIC <b>process,</b> since it presented less variability (17 %) than pear (46 %) according to the applied format. The format modifies aw values registered during the entire DIC process; because 2 mm slices have lower water activity and moisture content values than 4 mm slices. Apple marks hardness parameters along its storage (< 4. 5 kg·cm- 2), that provided greater firmness and consistency than pear along storage, so all studied parameters reflected that apple was more suitable for DIC <b>process</b> than <b>pear...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Thermal {{stabilization}} of chlorophyll and anthocyanin on pear peels during thermal process {{was investigated in}} this study. The green color of peels-on thermally <b>processed</b> (canned) <b>pears</b> was successfully retained by complexation of magnesium-free chlorophyll with zinc ions, and the red pigments were stabilized through anthocyanin-stannous complexation and polymerization of pear peel materials Blanching de-waxed green pears (Bartlett and Comice) in zinc solution (1, 300 - 5, 200 ppm) prior to canning resulted in attractive green color on the peels-on canned pears. Zinc pheophytin a {{was found to be}} the major zinc chlorophyll derivative created from pheophytin a and zinc ions in finished canned pears. The higher the zinc concentration in blanching solution and the longer the blanching time (6 - 18 min), the higher the chromacity of the color in canned green pears. The color of canned pears was highly stable during storage and did not show significant change after 19 wk of storage at 38 °C or at least 35 wk of storage at 10 °C under intensive illumination. Red D'Anjou pears were tested with various individual metallic ions in aqueous solutions for pigment complexation with anthocyanins. A formula containing stannous, hydrochloric acid, formalin, and tannic acid was then developed as a pretreatment for stabilizing anthocyanins on the peels of red <b>pears</b> during thermal <b>process.</b> The stabilization was achieved through complexation with stannous ions which integrated the pigments in a cross-linked macromolecular matrix. Tannic acid and formaldehyde were the key reagents for the polymerization of pear peels. The effectiveness of the developed formula was found to be significantly enhanced by steam-heating of treated red pears prior to canning. This study significantly improved our understandings on the principles of pigment retention during thermal process, especially for red anthocyanins in processed fruits and vegetables. Developed procedures can be used to stabilize green and red pigments on pears, as well as other fruits with pigmented peels, contributing in developing high value processed fruit and vegetable products...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the phenolic constituents of Bartlett pears and to evaluate the processed samples for extent of discoloration and to relate the two. Pears were obtained from three orchards in the Medford area and from three orchards at each of the three elevations, 500, 1700, and 2300 feet, in the Hood River area. Four replications were made. Values for the total phenol content of the pears ranged from 54. 3 to 120. 8 milligrams per 100 grams of fresh pear tissue. The leuco-anthocyanin content of the pears ranged from 6. 4 to 21. 0 milligrams per 100 grams of pear tissue and the flavanol content ranged from 11. 3 to 44. 8 milligrams per 100 grams of pear tissue. The pH of the pears ranged from 3. 70 to 4. 09. Color of the <b>pears</b> <b>processed</b> for twenty-five, thirty-five and forty-five minutes was measured.

40|$|The sun-dried pear of S. Bartolomeu (Pyrus communis L. var. S. Bartolomeu) is a {{traditional}} sweet food product of unique elastic properties and reddish brown colour. Alternative drying methodologies to replace the traditional open air sun-drying procedure are under devel- opment, namely the use of greenhouses with and without air convection and a hot air tunnel. To test whether the Maillard reactions {{can contribute to the}} colour of this tra- ditional product, the profiles of free and bound amino acids constituents of the pulp of fresh pears as well as <b>pears</b> <b>processed</b> according to different drying methodologies were evaluated. Also, the occurrence of furosine, car- boxymethyllysine (CML) and carboxyethyllysine (CEL), indicative of Maillard reaction, was diagnosed and quan- tified. The drying of the pears affects the free amino acid profile, increasing proline content and decreasing aspartic and glutamic acids. Although the proteic amino acid profile was not significantly modified with the drying process, a loss of the relative content of Lys was observed. This loss was related with the increase in the amount of furosine, CML and CEL formed during the drying of the fruits. Although all drying methods tested promoted the increase in the amount of CML, CEL and furosine, this increase was higher {{in the case of the}} traditional sun-drying and green- house processing, where the fruits presented reddish brown colour, and lower for the hot air tunnel processing, where the fruits became less intense. These results allow affirming that the drying process promotes the occurrence of Mail- lard reaction, contributing to the characteristic reddish brown colour of the final product...|$|R
