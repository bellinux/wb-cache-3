40|$|An innate {{desire of}} many vision {{researchers}} IS {{to unravel the}} mystery of human visual perception Such an endeavor, even ~f it were not wholly successful, is expected to yield byproducts of considerable significance to industrial applications Based on the current understanding of the neurophysiological and computational processes in the human bran, {{it is believed that}} visual perception can be decomposed into distinct modules, of which feature / contour extraction and recognition / classification of the features corresponding to the objects play an important role. A remarkable characteristic of human visual expertise is its invariance to rotation shift, and scaling of objects in a scene Researchers concur on the relevance of imitating as many properties as we have knowledge of, of the human vision system, in order to devise simple solutions to the problems in computational vision. The inference IS that this can be more efficiently achieved by invoking neural architectures with specific characteristics (similar to those of the modules in the human brain), and conforming to rules of an appropriate mathematical baas As a first step towards the development of such a framework, we make explicit (1) the nature of the images to be analyzed, (11) the features to be extracted, (111) the relationship among features, contours, and shape, and (iv) the exact nature of the problems To this end, we formulate explicitly the problems considered in this thesis as follows Problem 1 Given an Image localize and extract the boundary (contours) of the object of Interest in lt Problem 2 Recognize the shape of the object characterized by that contour employing a suitable coder-recognizer such that ~t IS unaffected by rotation scaling and translation of the objects Problem 3 Gwen a stereo-pair of Images (1) extract the salient contours from the Images, (ii) establish correspondence between the points in them and (111) estimate the depth associated with the points We present a few algorithm as practical solutions to the above problems. The main contributions of the thesis are: • A new algorithm for extraction of contours from images: and • A novel method for invariantly coding shapes as pulses to facilitate their recognition. The first contribution refers to a new active contour model, which is a neural network designed to extract the nearest salient contour in a given image by deforming itself to match the boundary of the object. The novelty of the model consists in the exploitation of the principles of spatial isomorphism and self organization in order to create flexible contours characterizing shapes in images. It turns out that the theoretical basis for the proposed model {{can be traced to the}} extensive literature on: • Gestalt perception in which the principles of psycho-physical isomorphism plays a role; and • Early processing in the human visual system derived from neuro-anatomical and neuro-physiological properties. The initially chosen contour is made to undergo deformation by a locally co-operative, globally competitive scheme, in order to enable it to cling to the nearest salient contour in the test image. We illustrate the utility and versatility of the model by applying to the problems of boundary extraction, stereo vision, and bio-medical image analysis (including digital libraries). The second contribution of the thesis is relevant to the design and development of a machine vision system in which the required contours are first to be extracted from a given set of images. Then follows the stage of recognizing the shape of the object characterized by that contour. It should, however, be noted that the latter problem is to be resolved in such a way that the system is unaffected by translation, relation, and scaling of images of objects under consideration. To this end, we develop some novel schemes: • A pulse-coding scheme for an invariant representation of shapes; and • A neural architecture for recognizing the encoded shapes. The first (pulse-encoding) scheme is motivated by the versatility of the human visual system, and utilizes the properties of complex logarithmic mapping (CLM) which transforms rotation and scaling (in its domain) to shifts (in its range). In order to handle this shift, the encoder converts the CLM output to a sequence of pulses These pulses are then fed to a novel multi-layered neural recognizer which (1) invokes template matching with a distinctly implemented architecture, and (11) achieves robustness (to noise and shape deformation) by virtue of its overlapping strategy for code classification The proposed encoder-recognizer system (a) is hardware implementable by a high-speed electronic switching circuit, and (b) can add new patterns on-line to the existing ones Examples are given to illustrate the proposed schemes. The them is organized as follows: Chapter 2 deals with the problem of extraction of salient contours from a given gray level image, using a neural network-based active contour model It explains the need for the use of active contour models, along with a brief survey of the existing models, followed by two possible psycho-physiological theories to support the proposed model After presenting the essential characteristics of the model, the advantages and applications of the proposed approach are demonstrated by some experimental results. Chapter 3 is concerned with the problem of coding shapes and recognizing them To this end, we describe a <b>pulse</b> <b>coder</b> for generating pulses invariant to rotation, scaling and shift The code thus generated IS then fed to a recognizer which classifies shapes based on the pulse code fed to it The recognizer can also add new shapes to its 'knowledge-base' on-line. The recognizer's properties are then discussed, thereby bringing out its advantages with respect to various related architectures found in the literature. Experimental results are then presented to Illustrate some prominent characteristics of the approach.

30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new audio and speech broadband coding technique {{based on the}} combination of a <b>pulse</b> excitation <b>coder</b> and a standardized parametric coder, namely, MPEG- 4 high-quality parametric coder. After presenting a series of enhancements to regular pulse excitation (RPE) to make it suitable for the modeling of broadband signals, it is shown how pulse and parametric codings complement each other and how they can be merged to yield a layered bit stream scalable coder able to operate at different points in the quality bit rate plane. The performance of the proposed coder is evaluated in a listening test. The major result is that the extra functionality of the bit stream scalability does not come at the price of a reduced performance since the coder is competitive with standardized coders (MP 3, AAC, SSC).|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} the {{suitability}} of UWB for WSN by simulating a DS-UWB digital transmission system using matlab. DS-UWB is a single-band approach that uses narrow UWB pulses and time-domain signal processing combined with direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques to transmit and receive information. Due to signal spreading, transmitted power becomes very low which paves to low probability of detection and co-existence with other systems. Simple lower order modulation scheme is considered such as binary PSK PAM due to low data rate requirements of WSN. Bit error rate (BER) performance has been evaluated for both modulation technique and simulation {{results show that the}} <b>pulse</b> repetition <b>coder</b> has significant impact on performance as well as control on data rates and reliable reception.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model integrating {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) and biokinetics was established to model an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor in this study. The EGSB reactor treating synthesized municipal wastewater was operated at ambient temperature. The model provided satisfactory modeling results regarding hydrodynamics and biokinetics. The model shows that influent distribution was evenly distributed. In addition, butyrate and propionate degradation rates linearly decreased along the flow direction in the reactor. However, acetate degradation rate increased first and decreased later. VFA degradation rate distributions were different at each reactor cross section. VFA degradation rates near reactor wall were lower than VFA degradation rates at reactor axis. Moreover, a <b>pulse</b> high influent <b>COD</b> concentration had a tiny impact on effluent quality, which indicates that the reactor was stable while treating synthesized wastewater at adopted conditions...|$|R

Many studies were done in the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{but in spite of}} promising results commercial uptake was lacking. The development of pulse trawling was again taken up in the 1990 s by a private company (Verburg:Holland Ltd.) in The Netherlands. Meanwhile questions about ecosystem effects of introducing pulse beam trawling in the Dutch flatfish fishery were raised by the European Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and the Inter: national Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and discussed at the meeting of the ICES Working Group on Fishing Technology and Fish Behaviour (WGFTFB) in 2006.
