50|$|In 1992 a new gel {{dosimetry}} formulation {{was proposed}} by Maryanski et al, {{which was based}} on the polymerisation of acrylamide and N,N’-methylene-bis-acrylamide (bis) monomers infused in an aqueous agarose matrix. This system was given the acronym BANANA due {{to the use of the}} chemical components (bis, acrylamide, nitrous oxide and agarose). This type of gel dosimeter did not have the associated diffusion problem of Fricke gels and was shown to have a relatively stable <b>post-irradiation</b> dose distribution. The polymerisation reaction occurred by cross-linking of the monomers induced by the free radical products of water radiolysis. In 1994 the BANANA formulation was refined by replacing agarose with gelatine and given the acronym BANG (bis, acrylamide, nitrogen and aqueous gelatine), the first of a series of new polymer gel formulations. In 1994 this formulation was patented and became commercially available through MGS Research Inc. as BANG®. Subsequently, due to the naming of the commercial product, PAG became the polymer gel dosimeter acronym of choice for most authors. Numerous authors subsequently published results of work investigating different compositions and formulations of polymer gel dosimeters which were summarised by Lepage et al.|$|E
50|$|Heavy charged {{particles}} are very effective at producing chromosomal exchanges with RBE values exceeding 30 in interphase (as visualized using premature chromosome condensation) and 10 at the <b>post-irradiation</b> mitosis for energetic Fe ions. The detailed RBE vs. LET relationship {{that was found}} for total exchanges {{is similar to that}} of earlier studies of mutation and in vitro neoplastic transformation. For all of these endpoints, RBE peaks at around 100 to 200 keV/μm before it decreases at very high-LET. However, the quality of chromosome damage is different when heavy ions are compared to sparsely ionizing radiation. Large differences in gene expression are observed between x-rays and HZE ions, thus reflecting differences in damages response pathways. Qualitative differences in the type of gene mutations have also been reported. Novel multicolor fluorescence painting techniques of human chromosomes have clearly demonstrated that high-LET α-particles and Fe-ions induce many more complex rearrangements will ultimately lead to cell death. In fact, only a small fraction of the initial damage is transduction of late chromosomal damage has also been measured in the progeny of human lymphocytes that were exposed with much higher frequency in the progeny of cells that were exposed to heavy ions compared to gamma rays.|$|E

40|$|This study quantifies {{some major}} physico-chemical factors that {{influence}} the validity of MRI (PAGAT) polymer gel dosimetry: temperature history (pre-, during and <b>post-irradiation),</b> oxygen exposure (<b>post-irradiation)</b> and volumetric effects (experiment with phantom in which a small test tube is inserted). Present results confirm the effects of thermal history prior to irradiation. By exposing a polymer gel sample to a linear temperature gradient of ~ 2. 8 °C cm− 1 and following the dose deviation {{as a function of}} <b>post-irradiation</b> time new insights into temporal variations were added. A clear influence of the temperature treatment on the measured dose distribution is seen during the first hours <b>post-irradiation</b> (resulting in dose deviations up to 12 %). This effect diminishes to 5 % after 54 h <b>post-irradiation.</b> Imposing a temperature offset (maximum 6 °C for 3 h) during and following irradiation on a series of calibration phantoms results in only a small dose deviation of maximum 4 %. Surprisingly, oxygen diffusing in a gel dosimeter up to 48 h <b>post-irradiation</b> was shown to have no effect. Volumetric effects were studied by comparing the dose distribution in a homogeneous phantom compared to the dose distribution in a phantom in which a small test tube was inserted. This study showed that the dose measured inside the test tube was closer to the ion chamber measurement in comparison to the reference phantom without test tube by almost 7 %. It is demonstrated that physico-chemical effects are not the major causes for the dose discrepancies encountered in the reproducibility study discussed in the concurrent paper (Vandecasteele and De Deene 2013 a Phys.

30|$|<b>Post-irradiation</b> {{annealing}} {{was discussed}} for {{the recovery of}} irradiation damage and mechanical properties recently [9 – 11]. For <b>post-irradiation</b> annealing above 600  °C, the recovery of damage structure and tensile properties occurred and irradiation hardening completely disappeared in V- 3 Fe- 4 Ti- 0.1 Si. No significant recovery of irradiation hardening could be observed in the irradiated specimens after <b>post-irradiation</b> annealing at 500  °C for 2  h [12]. The research of irradiation damage of recovery by <b>post-irradiation</b> annealing of EUROFER base steels showed that repeated intermediate annealing treatment at 550  °C made RAFM steel withstood much higher nominal damage dose rates. After annealing, the embrittlement further decreased, while the hardening also decreased. Meanwhile, annealing at 500  °C {{was supposed to be}} the minimum temperature for starting recovery [13] of EUROFER base steels. Temperature below 500  °C should also be explored for the possibility of the recovery process from irradiation hardening in an operating mode maintenance process of a fusion reactor because the temperature will be kept in the regime where liquid lithium will circulate in the blanket module for cooling the decay heat after neutron exposure even in the suspension period of the operation of a fusion reactor. Investigating the recovery process from irradiation hardening and the <b>post-irradiation</b> annealing at a lower temperature would require a long-term annealing treatment to extend the temperature regime to a lower temperature and thus promote easier self-healing treatment in the reactor [14].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} and correlate human telomerase {{reverse transcriptase}} (hTERT) mRNA expression with telomerase activity (TA) after ionizing irradiation of HeLa cells. Materials and methods: TA and hTERT mRNA expression were evaluated, at 24 -h intervals, in HeLa cells cultured {{for up to}} 144 h, before and after treatment with increasing doses of 6 MV photon ionizing radiation (5 - 20 Gy), using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively.

A prototype phantom was constructed for accurate irradiation of HeLa cells. Results: Treated cells showed a decrease in viability with increasing radiation dose, and a correlation was observed with post-treatment period. TA and hTERT mRNA expression of HeLa cells increased for the first 24 h after irradiation. The maximal increases were approximately two times the un-irradiated cell levels at 24 h <b>post-irradiation,</b> followed by a decrease {{and a return to}} the control levels 72 h <b>post-irradiation.</b> The time-course of telomerase activation after 24 h, differed among radiation doses.

Methods: Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were irradiated with a single 8 gray (Gy) fraction for 15 - 20 min and examined for bile secretion at different time intervals (18, 48, 72 h) after irradiation. For collection of biliary secretions, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal (i. p.) urethane (1. 25 g/kg) and equipped with biliary cannulas inserted into the bile duct through the sphincter of Oddi.
