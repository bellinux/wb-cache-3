5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow and his <b>pronator</b> teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm <b>pronator</b> and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Excessive {{pronation}} (or eversion) at {{ankle joint}} in heel-toe running correlated with lower extremity overuse injuries. Orthotics and inserts are often prescribed {{to limit the}} pronation range to tackle the problem. Previous studies revealed that the effect is product-specific. This study investigated the effect of medial arch-heel support in inserts on reducing ankle eversion in standing, walking and running. Methods Thirteen <b>pronators</b> and 13 normal subjects participated in standing, walking and running trials {{in each of the}} following conditions: (1) barefoot, and shod condition with insert with (2) no, (3) low, (4) medium, and (5) high medial arch-heel support. Motions were captured and processed by an eight-camera motion capture system. Maximum ankle eversion was calculated by incorporating the raw coordinates of 15 anatomical positions to a self-compiled Matlab program with kinematics equations. Analysis of variance with repeated measures with post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons was performed on the data among the five walking conditions and the five running conditions separately. Results Results showed that the inserts with medial arch-heel support were effective in dynamics trials but not static trials. In walking, they successfully reduced the maximum eversion by 2. 1 degrees in normal subjects and by 2. 5 – 3. 0 degrees in <b>pronators.</b> In running, the insert with low medial arch support significantly reduced maximum eversion angle by 3. 6 and 3. 1 degrees in normal subjects and <b>pronators</b> respectively. Conclusion Medial arch-heel support in inserts is effective in reducing ankle eversion in walking and running, but not in standing. In walking, there is a trend to bring the over-pronated feet of the <b>pronators</b> back to the normal eversion range. In running, it shows an effect to restore normal eversion range in 84 % of the <b>pronators.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether tibialis anterior muscle activity influences the rate of rear-foot motion during walking. Two-dimensional rearfoot mo-tion was recorded from 23 feet. The feet were assigned to one of two experimental groups.

The late <b>pronators</b> (N = 11) reached maximal pronation only after 40 % of the stance phase. The results of a C-test showed that there was a significant difference (P c. 05) in the time to minimal tibialis anterior muscle activity between the two groups. These results indicate that tibi-alis anterior muscle activity can influence rearfoot motio...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveBotulinum toxin type A (BtA) {{injection}} in {{the therapeutic}} treatment of muscle hypertonicity {{has been documented}} to reduce spasticity in specific muscle groups, with the effect lasting 1 – 3 months. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combined effect of an intensive occupational therapy (OT) programme following BtA injection in the treatment of spastic <b>pronators</b> in children with cerebral palsy. MethodsThis study used a pre/post intervention measurement design. Five children with cerebral palsy and hand function impairment were enrolled for intervention and followed-up longitudinally at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. All patients received BtA injection to left <b>pronators</b> followed by OT according to treatment guidelines and standard assessment protocol. Outcome measures included change in spasticity, active range of motion (AROM), sensibility, power grip strength and functional hand grips. ResultsSignificant improvements in muscle tone, AROM, sensibility and functional hand grips were observed over time. The restoration of hand function and sensibility lasted up to 12 months after injection. In addition, we observed that four children gained sensibility, which did not demonstrate any tendency to diminish with time. ConclusionA combination of BtA injection and OT is effective for reducing spasticity in the <b>pronators</b> of children with cerebral palsy...|$|R

25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles {{in the palm of}} hand and {{at the base of the}} thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel. This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal tunnel syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or <b>pronator</b> teres syndrome.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are {{positioned}} more vertically under the body {{than in most}} other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities. This strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis. Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front. Since the limb bones are placed {{on top of each}} other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation; the [...] "palm" [...] of the manus faces backward. The <b>pronator</b> quadratus and the <b>pronator</b> teres are either reduced or absent. The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or [...] "cushion pads" [...] beneath the manus or pes, which distribute the weight of the animal. They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra [...] "toe" [...] similar in placement to a giant panda's extra [...] "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution. As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} body the serratus {{anterior}} works eccentrically to prevent winging of the scapula. The muscles of the rotator cuff include the subscapularis (which protects {{the front of the}} joint), and the infraspinatus and teres minor (which work to externally rotate the humerus against the pull of the pectoralis and coracobrachialis). The pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and triceps work eccentrically. The <b>pronators</b> and the intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles are also active.|$|R
50|$|Peroneal group: peroneus longus arises on the {{proximal}} {{aspect of the}} fibula and peroneus brevis below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral malleolus. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while peroneus brevis reaches {{the proximal}} part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest <b>pronators</b> and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.|$|R
50|$|The forearm {{contains}} many muscles, including the flexors and extensors of the digits, a flexor of the elbow (brachioradialis), and <b>pronators</b> and supinators that turn the hand to face down or upwards, respectively. In cross-section the forearm {{can be divided}} into two fascial compartments. The posterior compartment contains the extensors of the hands, which are supplied by the radial nerve. The anterior compartment contains the flexors, and is mainly supplied by the median nerve.The flexor muscles are more massive than the extensors, because they work against gravity and act as anti-gravity muscles. The ulnar nerve also runs the length of the forearm.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pronator</b> teres {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} <b>pronator</b> syndrome) is compression of the median nerve {{between the two}} heads of the <b>pronator</b> teres muscle. The <b>Pronator</b> teres test {{is an indication of}} the syndrome—the patient reports pain when attempting to pronate the forearm against resistance while extending the elbow simultaneously. The physician may notice an enlarged <b>pronator</b> teres muscle. Tinel's sign the area around the <b>pronator</b> teres heads should be positive. The key to discerning this syndrome from carpal tunnel syndrome is the absence of pain while sleeping. More recent literature collectively diagnose median nerve palsy occurring from the elbow to the forearm as <b>pronator</b> teres syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pronator</b> teres pronates the forearm, {{turning the}} hand posteriorly. If the elbow is flexed to a right angle, then <b>pronator</b> teres will turn the hand {{so that the}} palm faces inferiorly. It is {{assisted}} in this action by <b>pronator</b> quadratus.|$|E
25|$|Two muscles on {{the lateral}} {{side of the}} leg form the peroneal group. The peroneus longus and brevis both have their origins on the fibula and they both pass behind the lateral malleolus where their tendons pass under the peroneal retinacula.

The brevis is attached on the lateral side to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal. Together the two peroneals form the strongest <b>pronators</b> of the foot. The peroneus muscles are highly variable and several variants can occasionally be present.|$|R
40|$|SummaryTechnologies {{applied to}} runner’s {{footwear}} design have increased {{over time in}} order to reduce specific-sport injuries such as Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis. Localized padding and controlled soles for <b>pronators</b> and supinator have shown good clinical results, respectively. There are still controversies in runner’s footwear design, such as, material selection and duration, training surface and type. Several {{studies have shown that the}} use of specific sport footwear reduces the incidence of these lesions. However there is lack of evidence type 1 or 2 to support these findings. Currently footwear selection is based according to fashion and market offers.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the effect a supination splint {{would have on}} upper limb function of cerebral palsy children for six months after receiving Botox® injections. Design Ten children attending weekly therapy enrolled in this prospective Quasi-experimental design where each child acted as his own control. Intervention was a supination splint and stretch massage. Assessment was based on pre- and post-intervention records of Modified Ashworth Scale, goniometry, Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), and an independent panel assessment of videotaped records of hand function. Results Results show that spasticity declined in the forearm <b>pronators,</b> wrist flexors and thumb adductors. Active movement improved significantly in forearm supination and wrist extension.

50|$|Klumpke's {{paralysis}} {{is a form}} of paralysis {{involving the}} muscles of the forearm and hand, resulting from a brachial plexus injury in which the eighth cervical (C8) and first thoracic (T1) nerves are injured either before or after they have joined to form the lower trunk. The subsequent paralysis affects, principally, the intrinsic muscles of the hand (notably the interossei, thenar and hypothenar muscles) and the flexors of the wrist and fingers (notably flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus). Forearm <b>pronators</b> and wrist flexors may be involved, as may dilators of the iris and elevators of the eyelid (both of which may be seen in the case of associated Horner's syndrome). The classic presentation of Klumpke's palsy is the “claw hand” where the forearm is supinated and the wrist and fingers are flexed. If Horner syndrome is present, there is miosis (constriction of the pupils) in the affected eye.|$|R
40|$|Seven {{children}} were operated on for pronation eontractures of the forearm due to obstetric brachial plexus injuries. All underwent extensive preoperative evaluations {{to determine the}} extent of injury, secondary deformities, and capacity to perform a few basic tasks. Sequential video studies were used to document hese findings. Operative procedures performed included various combinations of tendonlmuscle lengthenings and/or transfers. Postoperative evaluations focused fun tion rather than gains in active range of motion and the patientlparental assessment of he benefit of the procedure by response to a questionnaire.

40|$|We {{measured}} wet mass (MM), linear dimensions, {{and fiber}} length (FL) for each antebrachial muscle and calculated physiological {{cross sectional area}} (PCSA) for six strepsirrhines, six platyrrhines and seven catarrhines spanning nearly the entire primate body size range (from Galago to Gorilla). These variables were studied for each muscle and across muscles groups (flexors, extensors, and “others” – i. e., supinator, <b>pronators,</b> etc.) using RMA regression (alpha = 0. 05). Total forearm (TFor) PCSA is tightly correlated with TFor MM across the whole sample and within each suborder and is slightly positively allometric across the whole sample and within strepsirrhines and catarrhines (but not platyrrhines). Similar correlations and allometry between MM and PCSA are found within the flexor and extensor compartments. However, FL is not highly correlated with total MM variables and instead correlates with locomotor patterns. Thus primate forearm muscles have relatively consistent (though slightly positively allometric) crossections, but vary according to FL, suggesting locomotor adaptations in stretch and flexibility, but not force production. Therefore the variation in the anatomy of the epicondyle likely relates to adaptations for mechanical advantage and not muscle force as has been previously hypothesized...|$|R

Mirror therapy is a technique that aims to improve the motor function of the paretic limb. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of mirror therapy, associated with conventional physiotherapy, for range of motion (ROM), degree of spasticity of the affected upper limb, and the level of independence in the activities of daily living (ADL) of chronic patients after stroke. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental (before and after) study. The study included ten stroke survivors undertaking physiotherapy and presenting with upper limb paresis. The following gauges were used for the present study: goniometry, the Modified Ashworth Scale, Fugl-Meyer and Barthel Index. Fifteen sessions were performed, each lasting 30 minutes, consisting of stretching of the flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist and elbow, <b>pronators</b> and supinators, followed by mirror therapy with gradual functional exercises.

40|$|Introduction: Approximately 15 {{million people}} suffer a stroke annually, up to 40 % {{of which may}} develop spasticity, which can result in {{impaired}} limb function, pain and associated involuntary movements affecting motor control. Robust clinical data on spasticity progression, associated symptoms development and functional impairment is scarce. Additionally, maximal duration of muscle tone reduction following botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections remains undetermined. The ONTIME pilot study aims to explore these issues and evaluate whether abobotulinumtoxinA 500  U (Dysport®; Ipsen) administered intramuscularly within 12 weeks following stroke delays the appearance or progression of symptomatic (disabling) upper limb spasticity (ULS). Methods: ONTIME is a 28 -week, phase 4, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory pilot study initiated at four centres across Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Subjects (n =  42) with moderate to severe ULS (modified Ashworth scale [MAS] score ≥ 2) in elbow flexors or <b>pronators,</b> wrist flexors, or finger flexors will be recruited. Subjects will be randomised 2 : 1 to abobotulinumtoxinA 500  U or placebo (single dose 2 – 12 weeks after first-ever stroke).

Follow-up visits will be 4 -weekly {{to a maximum of}} 28 weeks. Discussion: This pilot study will facilitate the design and sample size calculation of further confirmatory studies, and is expected to provide insights into the optimal management of post-stroke patients, including timing of BoNT-A therapy and follow-up duration...|$|R
40|$|The Para {{athletics}} wheelchair-racing {{classification system}} employs best practice {{to ensure that}} classes comprise athletes whose impairments cause a comparable degree of activity limitation. However, decision-making is largely subjective and scientific evidence which reduces this subjectivity is required. To evaluate whether isometric strength tests were valid {{for the purposes of}} classifying wheelchair racers and whether cluster analysis of the strength measures produced a valid classification structure. Thirty-two international level, male wheelchair racers from classes T 51 - 54 completed six isometric strength tests evaluating elbow extensors, shoulder flexors, trunk flexors and forearm <b>pronators</b> and two wheelchair performance tests-Top-Speed (0 - 15 [*]m) and Top-Speed (absolute). Strength tests significantly correlated with wheelchair performance were included in a cluster analysis and the validity of the resulting clusters was assessed. All six strength tests correlated with performance (r= 0. 54 - 0. 88). Cluster analysis yielded four clusters with reasonable overall structure (mean silhouette coefficient= 0. 58) and large intercluster strength differences. Six athletes (19 %) were allocated to clusters that did not align with their current class. While the mean wheelchair racing performance of the resulting clusters was unequivocally hierarchical, the mean performance of current classes was not, with no difference between current classes T 53 and T 54. Cluster analysis of isometric strength tests produced classes comprising athletes who experienced a similar degree of activity limitation. The strength tests reported can provide the basis for a new, more transparent, less subjective wheelchair racing classification system, pending replication of these findings in a larger, representative sample.

40|$|As {{recreational}} running {{increases in}} popularity, {{there is also}} an associated increase in injuries secondary to the biomechanical foot fault of excessive pronation which is defined as either a maximum degree of pronation greater than 13. 0 degrees and/or pronation occurring beyond the first 25 percent of stance. 1 - 3 Many studies have indicated a positive correlation between excessive pronation and various injuries such as joint subluxation, overuse injuries, chondromalacia patella, shin splints, stress fractures, sacroiliac dysfunction and Achilles tendon injuries. 2 - 8 The {{purpose of this study was}} to research: 1) the relationship between. selected kinematic and metabolic variables and 2) kinematic changes over time between neutral and rearfoot control running shoes during a 30 minute run. Nine female recreational runners classified as symptom free excessive <b>pronators</b> served as subjects. Through motion analysis and V 02 uptake, data was compared while subjects ran in two shoe conditions 2 ̆ 2. a neutral and a rearfoot control running shoe. Results yielded from 2 -factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOV A) tests indicated that the maximal angle of pronation was found to be statistically significant between the two shoe conditions (p=O.

No significant difference was noted in either variable between the shoe conditions. V 02 was significantly decreased with repeated measures (p= 0. 002), but showed no significant difference between the shoe conditions. The implications of these results suggest that while the rearfoot control shoe is effective in limiting the maximal angle of pronation in this population, metabolic efficiency does not improve over the duration of a 30 minute submaximal run. This study further suggests that the rearfoot control shoe may reduce the risk of injury by decreasing the maximal angle of pronation to within normal limits...|$|R
50|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior extensor retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the weight-bearing leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The extensor digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the lateral condyle of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the weight-bearing leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The extensor hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the extensor digitorum, is inserted on the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the hallux, and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the weight-bearing leg.Two muscles on the lateral side of the leg form the peroneal group.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} if {{running distance}} to first running-related injury varies between foot postures in novice runners wearing neutral shoes. Design A 1 -year epidemiological observational prospective cohort study. Setting Denmark. Participants A total of 927 novice runners equivalent to 1854 feet were included. At baseline, foot posture on each foot was evaluated using the foot-posture index and categorised into highly supinated (n= 53), supinated (n= 369), neutral (n= 1292), pronated (n= 122) or highly pronated (n= 18). Participants {{then had to}} start running in a neutral running shoe and to use global positioning system watch to quantify the running distance in every training session. Main outcome measure A running-related injury was defined as any musculoskeletal complaint of the lower extremity or back caused by running, which restricted the amount of running for at least 1 week. Results During 1 year of follow-up, the 1854 feet included in the analyses ran a total of 326 803 km until injury or censoring. A total of 252 participants sustained a running-related injury. Of these, 63 were bilateral injuries. Compared with a neutral foot posture, no significant body mass index-adjusted cumulative risk differences (RD) were found after 250 km of running for highly supinated feet (RD= 11. 0 % (- 10 % to 32. 1 %), p= 0. 30), supinated feet (RD=- 1. 4 % (- 8. 4 % to 5. 5 %), p= 0. 69), pronated feet (RD=- 8. 1 % (- 17. 6 % to 1. 3 %), p= 0. 09) and highly pronated feet (RD= 9. 8 % (- 19. 3 % to 38. 8 %), p= 0. 51).
