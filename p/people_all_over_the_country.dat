5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

According to the New York Times, Ocean Grove's gay and Methodist populations coexisted peacefully until a 2007 {{controversy}} over whether gay couples could conduct civil unions at the Camp Meeting Association's Boardwalk Pavilion. Also according to the New York Times, [...] "Ocean Grove has long been considered a community that embraced gay residents." [...] In 2007, a representative of Garden State Equality, a LGBT rights advocacy organization, said: [...] "I'm hearing from gay <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> who thought Ocean Grove was the leading light for gay tolerance and that's not the case anymore." ...|$|E

[...] While it was widely believed that emcee Phil Baker ad-libbed the popular game shows Take It Or Leave It and $64 Question, most of the shows were actually written by Block. An example of what [...] appears to be casual conversation, but was actually a joke written by Block, was for entertainer Kenny Murray to say to his television studio audience: [...] "I don't care whether you laugh at my jokes or not. But it will be pretty embarrassing for you if <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> find out you don't {{have a sense of}} humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1979 {{proved to}} be the year in which Lynch finally {{realised}} that his grip on power had slipped. The first direct elections to the European Parliament took place in June saw the electorate severely punish the ruling Fianna Fáil party. A five-month postal strike also led to deep anger amongst <b>people</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> On 27 August 1979 the Provisional IRA assassinated Earl Mountbatten of Burma in County Sligo. On the same day the IRA killed 18 British soldiers at Warrenpoint in County Down. A radical security review and greater cross-border co-operation were discussed with the new British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. These discussions led Síle de Valera, a backbench TD, to directly challenge the leadership in a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy on 9 September. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at 28 September, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding the North which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from the north. The result was embarrassing for Lynch.|$|E

Sometimes this leads them to entertaining delusions; and sometimes it leads them to committing actions hurtful to others or to themselves. My husband has lost all control over his own craving for strong drink. He requires to be kept from liquor, as other madmen require to be kept from attempting their own lives, or the lives of those about them. It's a frenzy beyond his own control, with him--just as it's a frenzy beyond their own control, with them. There are Asylums for mad <b>people,</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> at the public disposal, on certain conditions. If I fulfill those conditions, will the law deliver me from the misery of being married to a madman, whose madness is drink?'--'No,' says the lawyer. 'The law of England declines to consider an incurable drunkard as a fit object for restraint, the law of England leaves the husbands and wives of such people in a perfectly helpless situation, to deal with their own misery as they best can.' ...|$|E
