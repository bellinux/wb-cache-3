5|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> is {{commonly}} measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E
5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density <b>plasma</b> (<b>temperature</b> 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E

40|$|The linear Vlasov {{dispersion}} relation for {{the lower}} hybrid density drift instability is studied in a four component (hot electrons and protons, cold electrons and protons) plasma. The introduction of a cold ion population monotonically reduces the maximum growth rate of the instability. Reduction of the ratio of temperatures of the cold and hot plasmas reduces both the real frequency and {{the growth rate of}} the instability. Near a ratio of the cold and hot <b>plasma</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 0. 01 a higher frequency branch of this instability emerges and for a fixed ratio of cold and hot electron density exhibits an increasing maximum growth rate as the ratio of the cold and hot <b>plasma</b> <b>temperatures</b> decreases further.

These runs demonstrated that ZETA was not {{suffering from the}} same stability problems that earlier pinch machines had seen and their plasmas were lasting for milliseconds, up from microseconds. The length of the pulses allowed the <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> to be measured using spectrographic means; although the light emitted was broadband, the Doppler shifting of the spectral lines of slight impurities in the gas (oxygen in particular) led to calculable temperatures.|$|E

25|$|He {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} electron temperature and in 1924 invented the diagnostic method for measuring both temperature and density with an electrostatic probe, now called a Langmuir probe and commonly used in plasma physics. The current of a biased probe tip is measured {{as a function of}} bias voltage to determine the local <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> and density. He also discovered atomic hydrogen, which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process; the first plasma weld ever made.

25|$|In 1968 {{a meeting}} of fusion {{researchers}} took place in Novosibirsk, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was even close to matching. The latest of their designs, the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000eV, compared to about 10eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem {{like the one that}} had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovitch.|$|E
2500|$|Filament {{cavities}} are cooler {{clouds of}} gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images {{because they are}} empty of hot plasma. In fact, {{the sum of the}} magnetic pressure and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure [...] can be calculated by the state equation of a perfect gas [...] , where [...] is the particle number density, [...] the Boltzmann constant and [...] the <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature.</b> It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the <b>plasma</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases with respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect renders sunspots apparently dark in the photosphere.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the spatial and {{temporal}} distribution of abundances of chemical elements in large "gradual" solar energetic-particle (SEP) events, and especially the source <b>plasma</b> <b>temperatures,</b> derived from those abundances, using measurements from the Wind and Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft, widely separated in solar longitude. A power-law relationship between abundance enhancements and mass-to-charge ratios [A/Q] of the ions {{can be used to}} determine Q-values and source <b>plasma</b> <b>temperatures</b> at remote spacecraft with instruments that were not designed for charge-state measurements. We search for possible source variations along the accelerating shock wave, finding one clear case where the accelerating shock wave appears to dispatch ions from 3. 2 +- 0. 8 MK plasma toward one spacecraft and those from 1. 6 +- 0. 2 MK plasma toward another, 116 deg away. The difference persists three days and then fades away. Three other SEP events show less-extreme variation in source temperatures at different spacecraft, in one case observed over 222 deg in longitude. This initial study shows how the power-law relation between abundance enhancements and ion A/Q-values pro-vides a new technique to determine Q and <b>plasma</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the seed population of SEP ions over a broad region of space using remote spacecraft with instruments that were not originally designed for measurements of ionization states.

2500|$|The high {{temperature}} of the Sun's corona gives it unusual spectral features, which led some in the 19th century {{to suggest that it}} contained a previously unknown element, [...] "coronium". Instead, these spectral features have since been explained by highly ionized iron (Fe-XIV). [...] Bengt Edlén, following the work of Grotrian (1939), first identified the coronal spectral lines in 1940 (observed since 1869) as transitions from low-lying metastable levels of the ground configuration of highly ionised metals (the green Fe-XIV line at 5303Å, but also the red line Fe-X at 6374Å).
