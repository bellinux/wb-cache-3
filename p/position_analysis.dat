40|$|There {{has been}} {{exponential}} {{growth in the}} number of studies of destination image appearing in the tourism literature. However, few have addressed the issues of destination <b>positioning</b> <b>analysis</b> and the role of affective perceptions. This article analyzes the market positions held by a competitive set of destinations through a comparison of cognitive, affective, and conative perceptions. Cognition was identified by trialing a factor analytic adaptation of importanceperformance analysis. Affect was measured using an affective response grid, while conation was gauged by stated intent to visit. The alignment of the results from these techniques identified leadership positions held by two quite different destinations on two quite different dimensions of destination attractiveness. It is suggested that this method of <b>positioning</b> <b>analysis</b> offers a practical means for destination marketers faced with the challenge of identifying the one or few features from their diverse and multiattributed product range that could be developed to differentiate their destination in a meaningful way to consumers...|$|R

PAQ was developed at Purdue University by McCormick, E.J., & Jeanneret, and Mechame in 1972. The PAQ method involves a series of detailed questioning to produce many analysis reports.

[...] PAQ uses simple wording and less complex questions than more in-depth job analysis methods. Research has shown PAQ to be an easy and effective method for human resource and other departments in the hiring process. In 1975 Ekkehart Frieling criticized PAQ, stating it is not possible to use one method to differentiate and classify equally all conceivable occupations. [...] Other criticisms state that the PAQ was written at the college level while the incumbents had the education of 10th to 12th grade level, and that PAQ was developed for all jobs but has been demonstrated as limited to 194 jobs and six dimensions.|$|E

5000|$|Individual {{psychological}} assessment (IPA) {{is a tool}} used by organizations to make decisions on employment. IPA allows employers to evaluate and maintain potential candidates for hiring, promotion, and development by using a series of job analysis instruments such as <b>position</b> <b>analysis</b> questionnaires (PAQ), occupational analysis inventory (OAI), and functional job analysis (FJA). These instruments allow the assessor to develop valid measures of intelligence, personality tests, {{and a range of}} other factors as means to determine selection and promotion decisions. [...] Personality and cognitive ability are good predictors of performance. [...] Emotional Intelligence helps individuals navigate through challenging organizational and interpersonal encounters. [...] Since individual differences have a long history in explaining human behavior and the different ways in which individuals respond to similar events and circumstances, these factors allow the organization to determine if an applicant has the competence to effectively and successfully do the work that the job requires. These assessments are administered throughout organizations in different forms, but they share one common goal in the selection process, and that is the right candidate for the job.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} way to model space syntax {{is to use}} an even {{distribution}} of lines or isovists. In <b>positioning</b> <b>analysis,</b> an uneven distribution of isovists is used in order to integrate social structures into the spatial analysis. These models {{can be used to}} analyse spaces highly influenced by social or cultural organisations. In offices, organisational structures can produce a constant bias in patterns of, for example, face-to-face interaction. Furthermore, labelling space according to organisational structure has sometimes been found to be as powerful a barrier as physical walls. In this study, these ‘constant biases’ are treated as being more important as origins rather than as mere biases. <b>Positioning</b> <b>analysis</b> is based on examination of spatial configuration of selected positions that enable these biases to be turned into parts of the analytic model. The selected positions should represent the organised entity of interest and form a subset within the general integration model. This set of points can be analysed configurationally through their spatial relationships, which can then be used together with traditional space syntax models. Thus the subset is described both from internal and external relationships, a fruitful approach in many cases. Applying this methodology when analysing face-to-face interaction in offices has provided strong correlations, which have produced two interesting results: face-to-face interaction correlates both with subsets of spatial distribution and with the integration patterns within the subset. At the same time, our analyses of how department stores and libraries spatially organise commodities and categories provide further support for how an <b>analysis</b> of spatial <b>positioning</b> answers key spatial strategy questions. Brands, types, and other categories position themselves in relation to one another as well as to a general integration and control patterns using modulations of a small set of spatial relations. Basing the configurative models on spatial relations of categories rather than on general spatial relations of an evenly distributed grid provides remarkably clear information. These findings are used to argue for working with <b>positioning</b> <b>analysis</b> parallel to traditional space syntax analysis, especially regarding examining spaces that are highly influenced by social or cultural organisation, such as offices, department stores, libraries, and museums.
