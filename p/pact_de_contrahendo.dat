40|$|Resumé Agreement on the Future Agreement {{according}} to the arrangement of Commercial Code The thesis deals with the institute of a contract about a future contract {{in the sense of}} a commercially legal adjustment. Although the focus is on the analysis of the legal institute {{according to}} its currently valid arrangement, the thesis also contains a brief historical excursus about the development of the pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> institute. The reason for it is the fact that a contract about a future contract is a legal institute with a long history which dates in the Roman law, where there cannot be any doubt that the long historical development of the institute of a contract about a future contract contributed to the forming of its current form and concept. From the point of view of the valid legal adjustment of a contract about a future contract implemented by the code of law the thesis deals with single necessities of this legal institute, as to say with the subjects which can conclude a contract about a future contract with essential necessities which condition its valid negotiation. It is also dealt with the consequences of breaking the obligations following from concluding pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo.</b> Collaterally with the analysis of the valid commercially legal adjustment of the pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> institute there [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A pactum <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo</b> is a {{contract}} aimed at concluding another contract. Examples include the option contract (in terms {{of which the}} grantor’s right to revoke his offer is restricted) and the preference contract (whereby the grantor gives a preferential right to conclude a specific contract should he decide to conclude this contract). An option contract constitutes two offers: a substantive offer and an undertaking or option to keep the offer open. If the option holder accepts the first offer by exercising the option, the main contract is created.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a general}} {{requirement}} {{for the creation of}} contractual obligations that their contents must be certain, or capable of being rendered certain. Courts generally try to interpret a contract as valid, rather than as void for uncertainty. In some circumstances, obligations may be void for uncertainty if they are pacta <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo,</b> or because they use vague language or are of indefinite duration. The parties may agree on a mechanism for determining what has to be performed. Where this mechanism {{takes the form of a}} power granted to a third party, or possibly even to one of the parties to determine what has to be performed, the courts will (depending on the type of contract) uphold the contract, provided that the power has been exercised reasonably.|$|R
5000|$|The {{defendants}} {{responded that}} because Avegno's mortgage contained the <b>pact</b> <b>de</b> non alienando (in which the mortgagor agrees not to alienate/encumber the premises to the prejudice of the mortgage), {{he was the}} only necessary party to Morgan's suit. The effect of such a stipulation was well settled in Louisiana. In Nathan v. Lee, 2 Martin N.S. 32, the effect was decided to be that"the mortgagee is not bound to pursue a third possessor, but may have the hypothecated property seized in via executina as if no change had taken place in its possessors, because any alienation or transfer made in violation of the <b>pact</b> <b>de</b> non alienando is ipso jure void, {{as it relates to the}} creditor, and that this effect of the pact is not annulled by the provisions of the Civil Code in relation to mortgages, and the rules laid down for pursuing the action of mortgage." ...|$|R
50|$|In Stanbrough v. McCall, 4 La. Ann. 324, {{the court}} {{reviewed}} the cases {{on this subject}} and held that where a mortgage contained the <b>pact</b> <b>de</b> non alienando, a party that purchases the property from the mortgagor cannot claim to be in any better condition than such mortgagor, and cannot plead any other exception, and that any alienation {{in violation of the}} pact is null.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this rigorosum thesis is {{to deal with the}} preparatory {{institute}} of private contractual law, pactum <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo,</b> under the influence of a qualified change of circumstances. This institute passed through to the contemporary legislative conception long progress, currently in the Czech Republic its simultaneously regulated into two effective codes and in connection with recent re-codification of the Czech private law, the explicit regulation is also contained in the new Czech Civil Code. The thesis focuses on the preliminary agreement being concluded according to the effective Czech Civil Code, on its purpose, utilization and function. The thesis also characterises its subjects, subject- matter, content and the process between entering into the preliminary agreement and the future agreement. The thesis deals in detail with the extinguishment of obligation deriving from under the influence of changes in circumstances. In several cases the thesis provides alternative approaches to a particular issue, presents judicial opinions of legal experts and pursues case law. The thesis also describes the development of regulation of agreement to make contracts in the context of Czech law within the range, which was appropriate to the subject, the thesis refers to similar legal institutes and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In 2015, the International Court of Justice {{ruled that}} Bolivia’s claim against Chile could {{proceed to the}} merit stage, setting up this Article’s {{discussion}} of perhaps the most intractable border dispute in South American history – Bolivia’s attempt to reclaim from Chile a ‘sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean’. This Article investigates the international law and deeply commingled regional history pertaining to the Atacama Desert region, the hyperarid yet resource-rich region through which Bolivia seeks to secure its long-lost access to the sea. Investigating the factual circumstances (effectivités), the post-colonial international legal principle of uti possidetis, territorial temptations arising from resource discoveries, and the duty to negotiate based on a pactum <b>de</b> <b>contrahendo,</b> a pactum <b>de</b> negotiando, or unilateral declarations, this Article concludes this case is less suited for adjudicative settlement than resolution by the principal three parties involved in the region – Bolivia, Chile, and Peru – primarily because the parties have, {{over the course of}} this protracted dispute, constructed intersubjective modalities for a shared sovereignty arrangement facilitated by sub-regional economic growth relations. A regional reconstruction of sovereignty in the northern Atacama region presents the better prospect for resolution than is possible through the limited outcomes presented by formal third party dispute settlement...|$|R

5000|$|On April 3, 1862, Bernard Avegno, {{the owner}} of the disputed property, mortgaged it to Israel C. Harris to secure {{promissory}} notes made by Avegno, payable to his own order and endorsed by him, totaling 500, which he delivered to Harris. The mortgage contained the <b>pact</b> <b>de</b> non alienando, by which the mortgagor agreed not to sell, alienate, or encumber the mortgaged property to the prejudice of the mortgage. The notes and mortgage were afterwards transferred by Harris to Charles Morgan. The mortgage was still in force, when on January 20, 1865, the United States filed, in Louisiana District Court, a libel of information against the property, to condemn it as confiscated under the Act of July 17, 1862, 12 Stat. 589, entitled [...] "An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes". A writ of seizure was issued to the marshal, who, dated February 14, 1865, stated that he had seized the libeled property.|$|R
50|$|The pact led {{to similar}} pacts {{such as those}} of Córdoba, the two Castiles, Valladolid, the Galician-Asturian <b>pact</b> in Santiago <b>de</b> Compostela, the Basque-Navarran pact at Eibar and lastly the Madrid Agreement of 30 July 1869.|$|R

5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{ended in}} 1983. De la Rúa {{intended}} {{to run for}} president but lost in the primary elections of the UCR to Raúl Alfonsín, who was elected in the general election. De la Rúa ran for the post of senator instead, defeating the Peronist Carlos Ruckauf. He ran for re-election as senator in 1989 but, despite of his electoral victory, the electoral college voted for the Peronist Eduardo Vaca. De la Rúa was elected deputy in 1991 and returned to the senate in 1993. President Carlos Menem, elected in 1989, wanted to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election in 1995, which was opposed by the UCR. Alfonsín signed the Pact of Olivos with Menem, negotiating terms to support the proposal. De la Rúa led the opposition to the pact within the UCR, but Alfonsín prevailed in the internal dispute. This damaged the relationship between both leaders, but helped the party to retain a number of radicals who were against the <b>pact.</b> <b>De</b> la Rúa could not prevent the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. As a result, Menem was re-elected in 1995. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time, being surpassed by the Frepaso, a new party composed by former Peronists.|$|R
50|$|Díaz {{escaped from}} jail during La decena trágica ("the Ten Tragic Days"), the Huerta-led coup d'état that overthrew and assassinated Madero. A few days later, after Madero's arrest, Díaz signed the Embassy <b>Pact</b> (Pacto <b>de</b> la Embajada), {{facilitated}} by American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson which installed Huerta as President and allowed Díaz {{to run as}} presidential candidate on the next election. Huerta did not honor {{his part of the}} agreement and sent Díaz to Japan as an ambassador. At his return Díaz was constantly harassed by Huerta causing him to go into exile to New York City and later Havana.|$|R

Through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These were successfully concluded on 28 May 1902 with three <b>pacts,</b> Pactos <b>de</b> Mayo. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other an eighteen months' advance notice. The United Kingdom purchased the two Chilean battleships, while Japan took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered. Two Argentine cruisers and Chile's Capitán Prat were demilitarized.|$|R

The proposed {{constitution was}} prepared by a constituent assembly {{that did not}} only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s {{and then with the}} Program Unity <b>Pact</b> (Pacto <b>de</b> Unidad Programático) established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.|$|R

IRA leaders such as Liam Lynch were prepared to accept this compromise. However, the proposal for a republican constitution was vetoed by the British as being contrary to the terms of the treaty and they threatened military intervention in the Free State unless the treaty were fully implemented. Collins reluctantly agreed.

5000|$|In the Avegnor case, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} {{there was such a}} privity between a person whose life estate had been {{condemned}} under the Act of July 17, 1862, and his heirs, that the latter were bound by a suit and decree to enforce a mortgage executed by their ancestor containing the <b>pact</b> <b>de</b> non alienando, to which the ancestor alone had been made a party defendant. It is sustained by Wallach v. Van Riswick, ubi supra, as will appear by the following passages from that Court's opinion:"If it be contended that the heirs of Charles S. Wallach," [...] the person whose property had been condemned,"cannot take by descent unless their father, at his death, was seized of an estate of inheritance, e.g., reversion or a remainder, it may be answered that even at common law it was not always necessary that the ancestor should be seized to enable the heir to take by descent. Shelley's Case is that where the ancestor might have taken and been seized, the heir shall inherit. Fortescue, J., in Thornby v. Fleetwood, 1 Str. 318.""If it were true that at common law the heirs could not take in any case where their ancestor was not seized at his death, the present case must be determined by the statute. Charles S. Wallach was seized of the entire fee of the land before its confiscation, and the act of Congress interposed to take from him that seizing for a limited time. That it was competent to do, attaching the limitation {{for the benefit of the}} heirs. It wrought no corruption of blood. In Lord de la Warre's Case, 11 Coke 1a, it was resolved by the justices""{{that there was}} a difference betwixt disability personal and temporary and a disability absolute and perpetual, as where one is attainted of treason and felony, that is an absolute and perpetual disability, by corruption of blood, for any of his posterity to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as heir to him or any ancestor above him, but when one is disabled by Parliament (without any attainder) to claim the dignity for his life, it is a personal disability for his life only, and his heir, after his death, may claim as heir to him or to any ancestor above him.""There is a close analogy between that case and the present.""Without pursuing this discussion further, we repeat, that to hold that any estate or interest remained in Charles S. Wallach after the confiscation and sale of the land in controversy, would defeat the avowed purpose of the confiscation act and the only justification for its enactment, and to hold that the joint resolution was not intended for the benefit of his heirs exclusively, to enable them to take the inheritance after his death, would give preference to the guilty over the innocent.

Outrageous lies are told so often so that they eventually got used to them. In fact are repeated lies so often that they believe it is true. That is wishful thinking.” Armenia cited the comments as coming from a country whose president comments Armenia are xenophobic and contrary to “international law in our world. Raising a defence budget is not something to be proud of it as other countries think of development goals and many countries do not have such resources,” yet is said that Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev threatens war with Armenia. He also commented on higher defence spending and other related measures. He added that Azerbaijan is a country where someone who killed a foreigner, an Armenian, can get away with it. The murderer in question, he said, was Ramil Safarov who murdered a sleeping person in bed and was a coward but was glorified and declared a national hero. Azerbaijan tactics, he said, regarded the best offence as good defence and that it tries to manipulate the world to save them, but no one can manipulate despite Azerbaijani oil money thus Azerbaijan has no legal or moral right to Nagorno-Karabakh to tell them how or where to live and how independent it ought to be. He accused Azerbaijan’s leadership of speaking in two languages: one with conflict resolution and the other always blaming Armenia. Azerbaijan said they have isolated Armenia and that it is paying a price for it, but UN resolutions call on Azerbaijan to cease hostilities. Despite the 1994 peace <b>pact</b> with the <b>de</b> facto Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijani authorities continue firing on the Line of Contact but should instead start withdrawing snipers which would be CBMs. if Azerbaijan wished to return refugees and IDPs, it should follow the OSCE-Minsk Group to yield pay offs in a right away.|$|R
