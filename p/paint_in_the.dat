5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey <b>paint.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> very last scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to <b>paint.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting their students should continue to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E

5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E

Until age twelve he knew nothing of professional artists, although art had surrounded him in childhood. He delighted in peasant embroidery, and in decorated walls and stoves. He was able to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peasant style. He studied drawing in Kiev from 1895 to 1896.|$|E
25|$|After high school, Hess {{attended}} Brooklyn College. Initially, {{he studied}} medicine. However, within a year, {{he shifted his}} focus to arts and began painting. He then moved to Europe where he traveled widely, studying the paintings in museum collections. He copied works by old masters to improve his painting technique. In England, Hess learned to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of John Constable, selling his paintings through a New York City art dealer. While in England, he also became interested in sculpture. The work of Henry Moore was especially influential on his development as an artist. Moore's abstract works captured human figures as well as aspects of landscape and nature. Following Moore's artistic vision, Hess began producing abstract style sculptures.|$|E

Whistler sued for libel, the case reaching the courts in 1878.

The three of them favoured productions described, contrastingly, by Elder as [...] "groundbreaking, risky, probing and theatrically effective", and by the director Nicholas Hytner as [...] "Euro-bollocks that never has to be comprehensible to anybody but the people sitting out there conceiving." [...] Directors who did not, in Harewood's phrase, [...] "want to splash <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of the public" [...] were sidelined.

A sum of $25,000 cash and in-kind {{services}} was raised with fundraising and annual Preservation Balls; {{it was later}} matched by the City of Bridgeport's Board of Park Commissioners with another grant of $25,000. During {{the night of the}} 1996 Preservation Ball the lighthouse was mysteriously lit, but Grimshaw did not arrange the illumination. D'Entremont writes that [...] "maybe the spirit of Kate Moore had grown tired of waiting for the restoration." [...] The 1998 restoration was conducted under the direction of David Barbour, a local architect. The restoration included masonry repairs, reglazing the lantern room, rust removal from the railings, new doors and windows with vandal-proof steel panes. The lighthouse was repainted with graffiti-resistant <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original paint and mortar colors. The light, relit in 2000, does not serve as an active navigational aid. The light is powered by solar panels {{on the top of the}} lighthouse; it was donated by United Illuminating and Bridgeport Energy. In 2004, vandals smashed the solar panels and new panels with protective cages were installed in 2007.|$|E

500|$|In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role {{to a more}} {{unconventional}} one. James began {{spending more}} time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's [...] "pass-happy" [...] offense. Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically-great levels, peaking in 2014 when he registered a 64.9 true shooting percentage. During this period, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James' free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as [...] "average". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NBA. Despite these changes, he has remained an elite offensive player who is capable of beating defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
