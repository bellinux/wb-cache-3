25|$|Following the {{completion}} of his term as governor, Pinchot and his wife took a seven-month cruise to the South Seas. In 1926, Pinchot had competed in a combative Republican Senate primary for the seat which he had also sought a dozen years earlier as a Progressive. Boies Penrose, who had defeated Pinchot {{in the general election}} of 1914, died at the end of 1921, and Governor Sproul had appointed lecturer and Republican National Committeeman George <b>Pepper</b> <b>to</b> the seat. Pepper won a special election held in 1922, but was challenged by both Pinchot and Congressman William Scott Vare, the head of Philadelphia's powerful political machine. Pinchot took a strongly supportive stance on the issue of Prohibition, while Vare vowed to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment within two years, and Pepper sought to straddle the issue. In the end, Pinchot finished a distant third, behind Pepper and Vare, who went on to defeat former Labor Secretary William Wilson in the general election. However, while Vare's election victory was recognized by the Senate, he was never officially seated, as allegations of impropriety were eventually brought before a special Senate committee. In January 1927, Pinchot testified before the committee, producing several thousand illegal paper ballots, and in 1929, Vare's election credentials were rejected by Senate, and the seat was declared vacant.|$|E

25|$|Together with Agatha, {{he begins}} investigating. They {{discover}} a viscous substance {{left behind by}} the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. The Doctor and Agatha question the guests while Donna searches the bedrooms for clues. While searching, Donna hears a strange buzzing noise. Opening the curtains, she sees, instead of a harmless, trapped bee like she expected, there is a ridiculously gigantic wasp outside. It smashes through the window and attacks Donna, but she fights back with light from a magnifying glass and it embeds its sting in the door but escapes through the window before the Doctor and Agatha arrive. The Doctor examines the wasp's sting embedded in the door, and collects a honey like-substance from the sting. The alien kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala, by crushing her with a gargoyle, and the Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase it but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor deduces that the creature is a Vespiform, an extraterrestrial wasp species that lives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Suddenly, the Doctor is poisoned with cyanide in lemonade laced with bitter almonds. His Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify, with Donna's help. The poisoning inspires him to add <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> the dinner meal, since the piperine in it would act as an insecticide. As they eat, the guests hear the wasp but the lights in the room are blown out before the alien's identity is revealed. When the lights are restored, they discover that Lady Eddison's necklace has been stolen and that her son Roger has been stabbed in the back with a bread knife.|$|E

500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way."

Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but not quite a modern curry. As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson was {{involved}} in another administrative dispute during the Australian leg of the campaign. Cec Pepper—whom teammates Miller and Dick Whitington {{regarded as one of}} the best all rounders in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection—appealed for leg before wicket against Australian captain Don Bradman in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire Jack Scott, prompting Bradman—who was also a member of the Australian Board of Control and the board of the South Australian Cricket Association—to ask Scott whether Pepper's behaviour was acceptable. As he was an employee of the SACA, Scott answered to Bradman, and he lodged a complaint about <b>Pepper</b> <b>to</b> the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was [...] never selected for Australia. Cricket historian Gideon Haigh said that [...] "Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [...] selection panel ... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand". Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf, to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no pressure had been placed on the selectors to exclude Pepper.|$|E
500|$|The breed {{originates}} {{from the}} dogs {{being used in}} the border country of Scotland and England. During the 1600s, they were used for hunting badgers and otters. Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown, dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins. These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier, although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers. The head of this family was Willie [...] "Piper" [...] Allan, who was born in nearby Bellingham. He kept dogs for the hunting of otters. Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in Eslington Park. Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan's dogs after he successfully removed the otters, which Allan refused. Allan died on 18 February 1779, and his dogs passed into the care of his son James. James's son eventually inherited the dogs and sold a dog named Old <b>Pepper</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border. Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan's dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth's manor.|$|E
