5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SCI suffer disorders of depression, and {{the suicide}} rate {{is as much}} as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores how the {{expressed}} {{health needs}} of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities {{resonate with the}} mandate of Article 25 ‘Health’ of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The perceptions of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities are investigated, regarding their access to, and expectations of, health care. Their views are compared to those of health workers, senior bureaucrats and United Nations delegates. A qualitative approach {{was taken to the}} research presented in this thesis, framing the research methodology on indigenous enquiry. An exploratory case study approach was taken to compare three jurisdictions: Australia, Mexico and New Zealand. It presents the views of 50 participants including 18 indigenous persons with disabilities, 19 health workers, 10 decision makers and 6 United Nations Delegates. The findings suggest that the health needs of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities are largely underserved and misunderstood by health departments. Poverty, discrimination and disenfranchisement emerged as being the possible major determinants of the ill health experienced by indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. This thesis concludes that is necessary to build capacity and rights literacy across indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities, particularly with respect to the CRPD; alongside with a legitimate redistribution of resources and decision-making in response to the expressed health needs of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> disabilities...|$|R

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E

5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
