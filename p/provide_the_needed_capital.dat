40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{is seen as}} a way to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> inflow to stimulate growth in a domestic economy. FDI can also result in increased employment levels, managerial skills and increase in technology. In efforts to attract FDI, host countries have undertaken various policy incentives to attract foreign investors. This study analyses the trends and determinants of inward FDI to South Africa for the period 1975 - 2005. The study starts by reviewing FDI literature on its determinants and provides the macroeconomic background and FDI related policies undertaken in South Africa. The trend and sectoral analysis provides the actual nature of FDI flows to South Africa. An empirical model linking theoretical and empirical determinants of FDI is estimated using the Johansen cointegration and VECM framework. The study also augments the cointegration framework with impulse response and variance decomposition analyses to complement the long and short run determinants of FDI. Dummy variables are used in each of the estimated FDI models {{to take into account the}} possibility of structural breaks. Results show that relative to the size of the economy and to other developing countries, South Africa still receives low levels of inward FDI. Only are few years are exceptional i. e. 1997, 2001 and 2005. From the sectoral distribution, the financial sector is now the major recipient of FDI followed by the mining and manufacturing sectors. The emergence of the financial sector could suggest that FDI motives could have shifted from the natural resource seeking and market seeking to efficiency seeking FDI. The United Kingdom emerges as the major source of FDI to South Africa followed by United States of America and Germany. Empirical analysis indicated that openness, exchange rate and financial development are important long run determinants of FDI. Increased openness and financial development attract FDI while an increase (depreciation) in the exchange rate deters FDI to South Africa. Market size emerges as a short run determinant of FDI although it is declining in importance. Most of the impulse response analysis confirmed the VECM findings. Variance decomposition analysis showed that FDI itself, imports and exchange rate explain a significant amount of the forecast error variance. The influence of market size variable is small and declining over time...|$|E

40|$|Capitalist {{systems are}} privateownership systems {{distinguished}} by openness to implementing new commercial ideas – ideas for {{new products and}} methods – and by decentralized, pluralistic mechanisms for selecting the ideas to finance and <b>providing</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> and incentives. <b>The</b> economic system in the U.

The sort of system in continental western Europe is so constrained by institutions and regulations intended {{for the protection of}} stakeholders and “social partners ” that it goes by other names – corporatism or the social market economy. China’s system must be called “state capitalism” because its financial sector is staterun. How these three systems affect innovation and economic performance is a topic of lively discussion today. To many proponents – Schumpeter, for example – and critics – Marx, for one – capitalism’s strength is its dynamism – the readiness and adeptness with which it moves forward. No doubt this dynamism derives in part from the creativity of business people and the acuity of the financiers judging which entrepreneurial ideas to back. 1 Yet our understanding of the mechanisms and economic institutions involved, and why capitalism’s dynamism is apparently hard to match, has not advanced far since the seminal insights of the early modern theorists of capitalism – notably Knight, Hayek and M. Polanyí. I first review their legacy, which is not widely known. I then sketch elements of a model building on their insights, examine some of its implications and discuss recent and postwar experience from its perspective. 1.

Commerce in Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 This study {{examines}} the economic sense in policies that promote or aim {{to attract more}} Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by specifically focusing on the determinant of FDI and how they impact the economic growth of South Africa. The study empirically identifies and investigates the determinants of FDI on South African economic growth as well as FDI attraction and its correlation with economic growth over the period 1994 to 2010 through the utilization of Cointegration and Error-Correction Model to identify the variables in explaining FDI in South Africa. This study analysis trends and the determinants of FDI {{as well as their}} impact on the South African economy. FDI is seen as <b>the</b> means of <b>providing</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>capital</b> injection to stimulate growth in the host economy. FDI can as well result in increased employment rate, managerial skills and technological increase. Multinational Corporation (MNC) should agglomerate {{in such a way that}} is consistent with country specific externalities. There is somewhat weak evidence that FDI generates positive spillover effects to the host country. In instances where FDI generates positive productivity spillovers for domestic market economy, FDI subsidies and incentives should be warranted particularly where they have been proven to have a catalytic role in FDI attraction. The study also indicates a positive and significant impact of reform on FDI in South Africa. The study considers trade Openness, GOP per capita as well as the Cost of labour variables on explaining FDI inflows. All variables indicate correct signs and are statistically significant except for cost of labour. There is some mild evidence that labour cost impedes FD I inflows. The infrastructure levels as well as other variables are directly related to FDI. In its endeavour to attract FDI, the host country undertakes various policy incentives to attract foreign investors. All these outcomes have important implications for improving the national economy which can be helpful in the allocation of funds and resources much needed for FDI attraction. This study clearly emphasizes the role of policy in FDI attraction as well determining short-run and long-run growth in South Africa by firstly <b>providing</b> <b>the</b> macroeconomic background. Secondly, it reviews FDI literature on its determinants and related policies undertaken in South Africa. It further establishes a linear empirical relationship between these determinants, and variables to determine the direction of the causality as well as contribute to the debate on the relationship between FDI and growth through regression analysis. It assesses the growth implications of FDI in South Africa and the regional economic implications by subjecting FDI to Granger causality tests within the cointegration framework. The results suggest that in the host country, there exist a positive correlation between FDI and economic growth. In relation to other developing countries as well as the size of the economy, South Africa still receives low levels of FDI inflows with exception of 1997, 2001 and 2005. The major contributors are financial sector, mining and manufacturing sectors. One can conclude that the South African government should consider encouraging capital-intensive FDI through capacity building and further development of skilled labour force. The empirical analysis indicates that openness, the rate of exchange as well as the financial development and improved labour costs are important long run determinants of FDI. The study sets up further research that may be helpful in exposing the South African economy with greater FDI potential as well as indentify regional specific interventions needed to improve certain conditions to receive more FDI. The effects of trade liberalization imply that African countries require African specific solution. Policies that have been successful in other countries may not suggest that they equally successful in African countries. Master...|$|R

40|$|With limited funds {{available}} for social investment, policymakers and philanthropists are naturally interested in supporting programs {{with the greatest}} chance of effectiveness {{and the ability to}} benefit the largest number of people. When a program rises to the fore with strong, proven results, it makes sense to ask whether that success can be reproduced in new settings. Program replication is premised on the understanding that many social problems are common across diverse communities [...] and that it is far more cost-effective to systematically replicate an effective solution to these problems than to continually reinvent the wheel. When done well, replication of strong social programs has the potential to make a positive difference not just for individual participants, but indeed for entire communities, cities and the nation as a whole. Yet despite general agreement among policymakers and philanthropists about the value of replication, successful efforts to bring social programs to scale have been limited, and rarely is replication advanced through systematic public policy initiatives. More often, replication {{is the result of a}} particular social entrepreneur's tireless ambition, ability to raise funds and marketing savvy. The failure to spread social program successes more widely and methodically results from a lack of knowledge about the science and practice of replication and from the limited development of systems [...] at local, state or federal levels [...] to support replication. Fortunately, there seems to be growing awareness of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to invest in such systems. For example, the 2009 Serve America Act included authorization for a new Social Innovation Fund that would "strengthen the infrastructure to identify, invest in, replicate and expand" proven initiatives. The Obama administration recently requested that Congress appropriate $ 50 million to this fund, with a focus on "find(ing) the most effective programs out there and then <b>provid(ing)</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>needed</b> to replicate their success in communities around the country. " But more than financial capital is required to ensure that when a program is replicated, it will continue to achieve strong results. Over the past 15 years, Public/ Private Ventures (P/PV) has taken a deliberate approach to advancing the science and practice of program replication. Through our work with a wide range of funders and initiatives, including the well-regarded Nurse-Family Partnership, which has now spread to more than 350 communities nationwide, we have accumulated compelling evidence about specific strategies that can help ensure a successful replication. We have come to understand that programs approach replication at different stages in their development [...] from fledgling individual efforts that have quickly blossomed and attracted a good deal of interest and support to more mature programs that have slowly expanded their reach and refined their approach over many years. There are rarer cases in which programs have rigorous research in hand proving their effectiveness, multiple sites in successful operation and willing funders prepared to support large-scale replication. Regardless of where a promising program may be in its development, our experience points to a number of important lessons and insights about the replication process, which can inform hard decisions about whether, when and how to expand a program's reach and total impact. In the interest of expanding programs that work, funders sometimes neglect the structures and processes that must be in place to support successful replication. These structures should be seen as the "connective tissue" between a program that seeks to expand and the provision of funding for that program's broad replication. This report represents a synthesis of P/PV's 30 years of designing, testing and replicating a variety of social programs and explains the key structures that should be in place before wide-scale replication is considered. It is designed to serve as a guide for policymakers, practitioners and philanthropists interested in a systematic approach to successful replication...|$|R

40|$|The {{revitalization}} of the South Bronx {{over the last}} thirty years has been fundamentally shaped by contradiction and struggles over the nature of revitalization itself. In this dissertation, I develop a framework for and a history of the politics of revitalization in the South Bronx. Two conflicting visions of revitalization emerged out of the crisis of the 1970 s. Radical and left-liberal visions of revitalization were based on a deep distrust of for-profit landlords and the dynamics of real estate markets inspired by the dramatic abandonment of the South Bronx by landlords and banks in the 1970 s. This type of revitalization has involved the creation of alternative ownership structures and housing practices to give South Bronx residents, organizations and communities and some measure of autonomy from external forces causing poverty, exploitation and housing abandonment. A more politically moderate vision of revitalization influenced by the city's neoliberal turn after the fiscal crisis of 1974 - 5 advocates the repair of real estate markets with subsidies and appropriate regulation so that the power of the private sector can be harnessed to rebuild devastated neighborhoods, and so those neighborhoods can benefit the city through tax revenues and housing for workers and the homeless. This largely state-sponsored form of revitalization has involved the creation of flows of capital through government subsidies, fostering the growth of a responsible for-profit landlord class, and facilitating complex public-private partnerships to produce affordable housing. Both of these strands of revitalization were included in the institutions the New York City government developed in the late 1970 s to revitalize devastated neighborhoods. Radical forms of revitalization have been included because there were few alternatives in neighborhoods abandoned by landlords and banks. Policymakers often preferred working with for-profit actors when and where possible, and the moderate vision of revitalization has gained ground over {{the last thirty years}}. A Bronx-specific revitalization was proposed by Bronx officials, planners and boosters in the late 1980 s to reverse the tendency for the Bronx {{to be used as a}} regional dumping ground for unwanted people and uses. To achieve this, Bronx planners proposed transformative, large-scale redevelopment, including the redevelopment of the residential neighborhood of Melrose Commons. Melrose residents would have been displaced by the original plan, but they protested, organized very effectively, and demanded to be included in the prosperity finally planned for their neighborhood. Because the Bronx revitalization coalition was internally contradictory, the resident activists and planning professionals were able to develop a collaborative planning process. They proposed a hybrid revitalization where existing Melrose residents were the basis for future growth. This struggle brought to the fore the question of whether existing Bronx residents would be the basis of revitalization, or if their removal would be. Struggles around revitalization are structured by the funding mechanisms that <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>needed.</b> Because those funding mechanisms are constructed, they are a potential site of struggle. In the 1990 s, a flow of capital into revitalization was created by forging a relationship between the financial industry and affordable housing development through the Community Reinvestment Act and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. The systematization of this flow of capital has contributed to the alienation of revitalization from South Bronx residents and organizations, and it has become a site of contestation. Like gentrification, the {{revitalization of}} the South Bronx has been a part of the return of capital, people and industry to the city. My dissertation begins to answer the question of how revitalization and gentrification relate to each other by examining the politics of revitalization, specifically the extent to which South Bronx residents, especially poor and working class residents, are able to shape revitalization efforts and fight their own displacement...|$|R
