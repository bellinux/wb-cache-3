5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas <b>Panton,</b> but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, <b>Panton</b> was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E
25|$|William <b>Panton</b> (c. 1740 – 26 February 1801) was {{the head}} of a group of five Scottish merchants who founded the {{powerful}} and influential trading firm of <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company in 1783 at St. Augustine, then the capital of British East Florida. They formed a partnership to trade with the Indians of Florida and the Spanish borderlands on the southern frontier of the British colonies. <b>Panton,</b> the son of John <b>Panton</b> and Barbara Wemyss, was born on the family farm at the Mains of Aberdour on the south coast of the Moray Firth in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.|$|E

25|$|Forbes was Gordon's {{maternal}} nephew. In 1774 <b>Panton</b> and Philip Moore {{formed a}} partnership {{that lasted for}} several years, and in 1776 <b>Panton</b> started his own trading house with Thomas Forbes in Savannah known as <b>Panton,</b> Forbes and Company. They began to trade with the growing population of white colonists, and speculated in lands, acquiring large tracts in both Carolina and Georgia. Soon after the American revolution broke out, they being determined loyalists, their properties were confiscated. They migrated to East Florida, now a British province and rapidly developing with the infusion of British capital and enterprise, and established themselves on the St. Marys River.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panton</b> {{emigrated to}} Charleston, South Carolina with his countryman, Thomas Forbes, in 1765. He {{got into the}} Indian trade as an {{apprentice}} with the firm of John Gordon, a Scots immigrant from Aberdeenshire who established a vast trade network in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the 1760s. <b>Panton</b> served as Gordon's clerk from 1765 until 1772, when Gordon appointed him one of his attorneys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company made {{a fortune}} in the Indian trade and would become the largest mercantile company on the {{southern}} frontier in the 1790s. Working in partnership with Alexander McGillivray, {{they were able to}} expand their operations from East Florida and the Bahamas to the Mississippi River. McGillivray, an influential chief of the Upper Creek (Muscogee) towns, was an intimate associate of <b>Panton</b> and is generally considered to have been a silent partner in the firm. <b>Panton</b> had promised him a one-fifth share of the company's profits once it obtained Spanish approval. McGillivray, always sickly, died in 1793, and was buried with Masonic honors in Panton's garden at Pensacola on 18 February of that year.|$|E

25|$|Many {{different}} {{traders and}} trading houses had vied for {{a share of}} the Indian trade on the southern frontier, but few survived long. <b>Panton,</b> Leslie, & Company made an alliance with Alexander McGillivray, the quarter-blood leader of the Upper Creeks, who became a virtual silent partner in the concern. William <b>Panton</b> knew his father, Lachlan McGillivray, a prosperous Scots planter and a deerskin trader himself, and had recognized Alexander's ability since he was a child.|$|E

25|$|In December 1775, the British {{governor}} of East Florida, Patrick Tonyn, appointed <b>Panton</b> official trader for the Creek Indians, and in 1778 the British Indian agent, Col. Thomas Brown, charged <b>Panton</b> {{with responsibility for}} the giving of presents to the Creeks and Cherokees, {{a necessary part of}} diplomacy with the Indian tribes. On l0 January 1783, he received a license signed by Governor Tonyn, Brigadier General Archibald McArthur, commander of British forces in East Florida, and Thomas Brown, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, to carry on trade with the Indians and supply them with British manufactures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company also {{operated}} as {{merchants in}} the Bahamas, organizing shipping of cotton {{and other local}} products, and acting as agents for merchants in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1783, <b>Panton</b> and William Alexander {{moved to}} Nassau in the Bahamas, which then {{became the center}} of the firm's operations, where it stored trade items in large warehouses.|$|E
25|$|The firm's five {{founding}} partners—William <b>Panton,</b> Thomas Forbes, John Leslie, William Alexander, and Charles McLatchy—formed <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company at St. Augustine, {{the capital}} of British East Florida, in late 1782 or early 1783. They were all Scotsmen who had traded with the colonists and Indians of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida {{before and during the}} American Revolution. It was a matter of survival for them to remain loyal to the Kingdom of Great Britain, as most of their trade goods, especially guns, lead, and gunpowder, came from the mother country, and rebelling against the British would have cut off those supplies.|$|E
25|$|Farmer {{sailed to}} the East Indies in November 1773. On 19 February 1775 Seahorse fought {{a battle with}} two of Hyder Ali's ketches off Anjengo. John <b>Panton</b> {{replaced}} Farmer in June 1777.|$|E

25|$|Working in {{partnership}} with Alexander McGillivray, <b>Panton,</b> Leslie, & Company were able to expand their operations from East Florida and the Bahamas to the Mississippi River. <b>Panton</b> had promised McGillivray a one-fifth share of the company's profits once it obtained Spanish approval. With headquarters at Spanish Pensacola, by 1795 the company had a near monopoly on trade with Native American tribes in the southeast, its presence reaching northward from its headquarters in Pensacola to Fort San Fernando (formerly known as Chickasaw Bluffs) {{on the site of}} present-day Memphis, and westward as far as New Orleans, with posts at Mobile and several locations in Florida, the Bahamas, and around the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} deerskin trade declined gradually {{after the}} American Revolutionary War, but the resourceful Scottish merchants found {{new opportunities for}} trade with the Indians even as they lost political and economic influence in the former British colonies of South Carolina and Georgia. <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company and its successor, John Forbes & Company, were actively involved in Indian affairs and had sway over international diplomacy in the region. All the original partners were from northern Scotland. <b>Panton,</b> Leslie, and Forbes were born on the coast east of Inverness overlooking the Moray Firth; the birthplaces of McLatchy and Alexander are unknown. As staunch loyalists, the Scotsmen fled to St. Augustine during the war, and were allowed to stay when Spain regained Florida {{by the terms of}} the Treaty of Paris of 1783. The Spanish crown found it useful to sanction <b>Panton</b> Leslie & Company's trade with the Creeks and Seminoles, and allowed the firm to sell them British guns, ammunition, rum, and various dry goods as a means of solidifying the Spaniards' alliance with these southern tribes.|$|E
25|$|With {{the signing}} of these two treaties, McDonald and Ross {{relocated}} to Turkeytown to consolidate their efforts and business with those of Campbell closer to their Spanish suppliers and to the British trading house of <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company in Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|John Gordon, a Scots {{immigrant}} from Aberdeenshire, established a vast trade network in colonial South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the 1760s that {{laid the foundation}} of <b>Panton,</b> Leslie, and Company, which would become the largest mercantile company on the southern frontier.|$|E
25|$|Cruz {{graduated}} {{cum laude}} from Princeton University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. While at Princeton, he competed for the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel {{and won the}} top speaker award at both the 1992 U.S. National Debating Championship and the 1992 North American Debating Championship. In 1992, he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year and, with his debate partner David <b>Panton,</b> also Team of the Year by the American Parliamentary Debate Association. Cruz and <b>Panton</b> later represented Harvard Law School at the 1995 World Debating Championship, losing in the semi-finals to a team from Australia. Princeton's debate team named their annual novice championship after Cruz.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} active firms and merchants {{participating}} in the slave trade of East and West Florida were <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company, Arredondo and Son, Zephaniah Kingsley, and John Fraser. Individually and jointly they imported at least ten groups of captive Africans, totaling 1,260 people, to Florida between 1802 and 1811.|$|E
25|$|At {{a public}} sports meeting on Saturday 14 October 1905 a club {{committee}} was formed, consisting of E.H.Cameron as President, Edwards Kruse as Secretary, and George Quick as Treasurer.

25|$|In 1985, Demetrios <b>Panton</b> {{wrote to}} Islington Council to {{complain}} about abuse suffered while in Council care during the 1970s and 1980s. <b>Panton</b> received an official response in 1989, in which the Council denied all responsibility. In 1990, Liz Davies, a senior social worker employed by the borough with her manager, David Cofie, raised concerns about sexual abuse of children {{under the care of}} Islington Council. Correspondence between Hodge and the then Director of Social Work indicates that Hodge declined a request for extra investigative resources. Instead, the Cofie–Davies investigation was dismissed by council officials in May 1990 after the police declared they had found insufficient evidence of abuse; despite this, the two social workers continued their enquiries. In early 1992, Davies (not {{to be confused with the}} barrister and former Islington Councillor) resigned from her post and again requested that Scotland Yard investigate the allegations.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, and the Creeks had {{incurred}} enormous {{debts to}} <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company; they eventually ceded {{millions of acres}} of land to the United States, using the proceeds to pay off those debts. This resulted in the United States acquiring {{millions of acres of}} land within the current boundaries of Alabama and Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|The firm fixed {{prices to}} undersell its {{competitors}} in Georgia and South Carolina, dispatched agents throughout the Indian country, and carried Spanish government communiques among the tribes. Although <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company were a legitimate trading firm, they smuggled goods {{across the border}} and manipulated the market to their advantage in other ways, practices probably common to any trading firm operating on the frontier at the time.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, the Museum {{opened its}} first gallery to be {{exclusively}} dedicated to furniture. Prior {{to this date}} furniture had been exhibited {{as part of a}} greater period context, rather than in isolation to showcase its design and construction merits. Among the designers showcased in the new gallery are Ron Arad, John Henry Belter, Joe Colombo, Eileen Gray, Verner <b>Panton,</b> Thonet, and Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|E
25|$|On {{election}} day itself, despite the usual early headaches, voting went smoothly. Palacio noted in her end of year report that no petitions for recounts were presented for any election. Nevertheless, The Guardian newspaper of March 16 saw an article written by then {{member of the}} Elections and Boundaries Commission and editor Herbert <b>Panton,</b> which criticized the electoral process. For more, see the Guardian article.|$|E
25|$|By 1786, when Spain granted <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company a {{monopoly}} over the Indian trade in East and West Florida, the firm owned 250 slaves and nineteen individual land grants in the Floridas encompassing 12,820 acres. Most {{of the slaves}} worked on company plantations and cattle ranches, but a few had specialized jobs: e.g., the company rented out its slave Langueste to the Spanish government as an Indian interpreter.|$|E
25|$|The Danish Porcelain Factory ("Royal Copenhagen"), {{including}} Bing & Grøndahl, {{is famous}} {{for the quality of}} its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen (1914–1972), Finn Juhl (1912–1989), Hans Wegner (1914–2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902–1971), Poul Kjærholm (1929–1980), Poul Henningsen (1894–1967) and Verner <b>Panton</b> (1926–1998). Georg Jensen (1866–1935) is known the world over for modern design in silver.|$|E
25|$|As in Louisiana, the Spanish {{government}} {{took advantage of}} the system already in place, adapting it to its own purposes. <b>Panton,</b> Leslie & Company, under very liberal terms from the Spanish point of view, held their monopoly as long as the Spanish controlled Florida; their influence with the Indians was essential to Spanish policy in its relations with the various tribes, and an important means of maintaining Spanish interests in the region before the surrender of the whole country to the United States.|$|E
25|$|William <b>Panton</b> {{was present}} at the conference, and agreed with the Indians to {{establish}} a store at such a place as he or his co-partners might find suitable between the forks of Flint river and the mouth of the Apalachicola River, provided that letters of license were issued to him and his partners William Alexander, John Leslie, Thomas Forbes, and Charles McLatchy. The agreement was confirmed by the Crown, and the traders were granted the necessary license, although the store was not built until 1786.|$|E
25|$|The hall retains {{more of its}} {{original}} neoclassical decorative features than many other rooms in the house; the walls' plasterwork panels and ceiling are all original, as are the Spanish mahogany doors (these had been removed during the 1920s, but were {{returned to the house}} in 1954). Only the white marble fireplace is not original to the house, but salvaged from the now demolished <b>Panton</b> Hall. The furniture in the room, against the walls in 18th-century fashion, is in the style of William Kent.|$|E
