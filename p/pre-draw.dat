40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} cold forging processes is cold heading of steel wire or rod to produce screws, bolts, nuts and rivets. The process is limited by a complicated interplay of many factors. The cold work (<b>pre-drawing)</b> is one of them. Although several investigations into the effects of <b>pre-drawing</b> on the formability of metals during cold heading processes have been conducted, so far no attention has been given to the numerical simulations of this phenomenon. The current work aims at examining effects of <b>pre-drawing</b> on formability during cold heading through numerical simulations. Physical tests in the literature investigating the effects of <b>pre-drawing</b> on the formability of three metals are simulated using ABAQUS 6. 4, with three successive FE models: the drawing model, the cutting model and the upsetting model. A new combined linear kinematic/nonlinear isotropic hardening constitutive model is proposed and derived to account for the Bauschinger effect existing in reverse plastic deformation. The new model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit v 6. 4 by a user subroutine VUMAT, which is verified by one-element numerical tests under tension, compression and reverse loading conditions. In addition, for the purpose of comparison, the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model is also applied for the materials. The Cockroft and Latham criterion is employed to predict surface fracture. Although considerable discrepancies between the experimental and simulation results are observed, the proposed combined hardening model is more accurate in predicting material behavior in the reverse loading than the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed combined hardening material model has the potential to correctly predict the material behavior in the reverse loading process...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{drawing is}} a process that sizes and smooths the surface of steel before it is cold headed to produce bolts. The effect of the changes in the {{mechanical}} properties due to cold drawing on the surface strain and ductility during the upsetting process was analysed showing that the stress and strain state can be more readily altered by changes in the process conditions (friction and height-to-diameter ratio) to cause greater increase in the failure strains than can be achieved by <b>pre-drawing...</b>|$|R

Wintario now offered three $100,000 grand prize draws, a new top prize of $200,000, and the Mystery Bonus Wheel offered either $10,000 cash {{or a new}} car. The show had so many draws in a half-hour that <b>pre-draws</b> {{had to be done}} prior to air so that the show could allow the bigger prizes to be done live. Tickets issued now had a letter before the six-digit number. Players who matched the letter with the correct six digits would win the top prizes. The $200,000 now could be broken down by the first or last five, four or three digits.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{an approach to}} exploit temporal uncertainty in parallel and distributed simulation by utilizing time intervals rather than precise time stamps. Unlike previously published work that propose new message ordering semantics, our approach is based on conservative, time stamp order execution and enhancing the lookahead of the simulation by <b>pre-drawing</b> random numbers from a distribution that models temporal uncertainty. The advantages of this approach are that it allows time intervals to be exploited using a conventional Time Stamp Order (TSO) delivery mechanism, and it offers the modeler greater statistical control over the assigned time stamps. An implementation {{of this approach is}} described and initial performance measurements are presented. 1...|$|R
50|$|One {{exception}} to Mode 7-like effects on sprites handled neither by <b>pre-drawing</b> nor by external chips occurs in Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean, where re-rendering of sprites {{on the fly}} is done entirely by the software. In Tales of Phantasia, the player sprite vertically stretches upon walking onto a save spot, and in Star Ocean, items are squashed when popping out of an open treasure chest. Due to the extra tiles needed for such rendering and the other high system demands throughout those games (both using a form of streaming audio to circumvent the SPC700's limited capacity, and as with most high-end SNES RPGs, using a variable width font), such rendering was limited to those few scenes.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{modifications}} to the minimum energy efficiency requirements for residential water heaters have spurred {{an investigation into the}} variability in testing high-efficiency electric water heaters. While initial inter-laboratory comparisons showed excellent agreement between test results from different labs, subsequent inter-laboratory comparisons show differences between measured energy factors of up to 0. 040. To determine the source of these differences, analyses of various parts of the test procedure are performed. For one case studied, the uncertainty in test results can be as high as +- 0. 028 if instrument accuracies reach the minimum level allowed in the test procedure. Other areas of the test procedure where variability is introduced are the optional use of <b>pre-draws,</b> the location of the lower tank temperature-measuring device, the use of insulation on tank fittings, and the use of a warm-up period before the simulated-use test commences. The implications of these issues on test results are provided...|$|R
40|$|Dr. Mary Stokrocki, Professor at Arizona State University {{and faculty}} mentor, worked with art scholar-teacher Laura Hales {{who was one}} of her {{graduate}} students, to offer an art class to Yavapi third graders at the Hmañ 'Shawa Elementary School, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, Fountain Hills, Arizona. The 10 -week program was based on the theme “Our Place in the World”(www. artsednet. getty. edu) and included exploratory art criticism, art history, and creating art components. The program began with a prequestionnaire and a <b>pre-drawing</b> of what they like to do, oil pastel and watercolor resist, and ended in a clay relief. Earlier, Hales introduced third-grade students to an art inquiry discussion based on a painting of a girl by Navajo artist Shonto Begay (Clover & Jim, 1997). They learned about the concepts of foreground, middle ground, background and center of interest. Students also learned that “art is making something special!...|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, the {{appearance}} of sprite rotations must be handled through <b>pre-drawing</b> unless they are done with hardware included in the game cartridge such as the Super FX 2 chip, as with Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. A notable workaround does exist and {{can be seen in}} Contra III: The Alien Wars in the second boss battle, and in Super Mario World in the battles against Reznor (platform wall support), Iggy (battle platform), Larry (also the platform), Morton, Ludwig, Roy, and Bowser. In these examples, the boss is a [...] "background" [...] and therefore rotates through Mode 7, and the scoreboard, which is [...] "above" [...] the field of play, is also a background, but the floor of battle's cracks are, as with the players and gunfire, [...] "sprites" [...] that are redrawn under various rotations as the player rotates. However, this only allows one [...] "sprite" [...] to be manipulated at once.|$|R
40|$|Pearlitic steel rods with {{inherited}} texture (IT) {{were prepared}} from <b>pre-drawing</b> followed by austenitization treatment. Effects of inherited texture on the microstructure and mechanical properties of cold-drawn pearlitic wires were investigated. The 〈 1. 1. 0 〉 texture of ferrite increased with drawing strain and became saturated when strain reached about 2. 0. However, wires with IT showed a higher 〈 1. 1. 0 〉 texture intensity. The ratio of bent over straight pearlite colonies in wires with IT were about 20 % {{lower than that}} of wire without IT in drawing. Additionally, Wires with IT showed a greater work hardening rate. Tensile strength of wires without IT increased from 1260. MPa to 3010. MPa as drawing strain increased to 3. 5, while wire with IT exhibited an 7 % increase in tensile strength (i. e., up to 3230. MPa). Torsion angle of wires with IT were about 13 % higher than that of wires without IT. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that wires with IT have higher thermal stability...|$|R

The heating devices are brought {{into contact with the}} semi-finished product simultaneously from opposing sides. A three dimensional form part is formed by application of difference pressure between an upper side and a lower side of the semi-finished product. The heating circuit is provided with a ceramic heating layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a heating device for performing a method for thermoforming a thermoplastic semi-finished product. USE - Method for thermoforming a thermoplastic semi-finished product. ADVANTAGE - The thermoplastic semi-finished product obtains local differing forming characteristics even for small and middle-sized forming geometries without the use of <b>pre-drawing</b> pressing or irradiative heating. The method avoids the need for adjusting absorption characteristics of the product, permits fine adjustable temperature distribution within the thermoplastic semi-finished product, and permits a targeted control of a wall thickness distribution in the product...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{concerns}} the thermal and mechanical response of several commercial grades of ethylene – tetrafluoroethylene copolymer films. Differential scanning calorimetry {{was used to}} show that, although films have similar degrees of crystallinity and melting temperature, the melting endotherms and crystallisation exotherms differ between materials, suggesting small changes in composition between manufacturers. Films were deformed in tension at a range of temperatures and rates. Selected films were unloaded immediately after stretching, and measurement of the elastic recovery highlighted further differences between materials. Batches of films were pre-drawn uniaxially above the glass transition and immediately quenched. When these materials were subsequently re-drawn below the glass transition temperature, most of them exhibited much improved yield stress, modulus and tensile strength (improving by factors of 5, 5 and 4, respectively at a draw ratio of 3), but a reduced strain to failure. In most of the films, the <b>pre-drawing,</b> {{as well as the}} initial orientation of the films, is accounted for by a simple shift in the true strain axis. This is indicative of a material response dominated by entropic network stretch. It also suggests that, in the cases where strain superposition does not work, a different arrangement of crystalline lamellae may be present, limiting the extent to which improved properties can be achieved in some materials...|$|R
40|$|Information Systems {{for complex}} {{situations}} {{often fail to}} adequately deliver quality and suitability. One reason for this failure is an inability to identify comprehensive user requirements. Seldom do all stakeholders, especially those „invisible‟ or „back room‟ system users, have a voice when systems are designed. If this is a global problem then it may impact on {{both the public and}} private sectors in terms of their ability to perform, produce and stay competitive. To improve upon this, system designers use rich pictures as a diagrammatic means of identifying differing world views with the aim of creating shared understanding of the organisation. Rich pictures have predominantly been used as freeform, unstructured tools with no commonly agreed syntax. This research has collated, analysed and documented a substantial collection of rich pictures into a single dataset. Attention has been focussed on three main research areas; how the rich picture is facilitated, how the rich picture is constructed and how to interpret the resultant pictures. This research highlights the importance of the rich picture tool and argues the value of adding levels of structure, in certain cases. It is shown that there are considerable benefits for both the interpreter and the creator by providing a <b>pre-drawing</b> session, a common key of symbols and a framework for icon understanding. In conclusion, it is suggested that there is some evidence that a framework which aims to support the process of the rich picture and aid interpretation is valuable...|$|R
