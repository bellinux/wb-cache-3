We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on my chest <b>pulling</b> <b>my</b> teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|In August 2002, Hughes {{returned}} to West Bromwich Albion for a club record £2.5million– half the fee Albion had received {{for him a}} year earlier– and signed a four-year deal with the club. Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002–03 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches. Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1–0 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson. He told the press that [...] "I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not <b>pulling</b> <b>my</b> weight {{should be made to}} my face." [...] He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems. He rediscovered his form back in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 36 games in 2003–04 as West Brom secured promotion with a second-place finish. His contract at West Bromwich Albion was immediately terminated in August 2004, following his conviction for causing death by dangerous driving. He spent the next three years in prison, serving half of his six-year sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Three days later, ESPN {{released}} a statement announcing Williams and his song would not return to Monday Night Football, ending {{the use of the}} song that {{had been part of the}} broadcast on both ABC and ESPN since 1989. Williams has further expressed defiance and indifference on his website, and said he was the one who made the decision. [...] "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made MY decision," [...] he wrote. [...] "By <b>pulling</b> <b>my</b> opening Oct 3rd, You (ESPN) stepped on the Toes of The First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore Me, My Song, and All My Rowdy Friends are OUT OF HERE. It's been a great run." [...] Williams' son, Hank Williams III, stayed neutral in the debate, telling TMZ.com that most musicians, including his dad, are [...] "not worthy" [...] of a political discussion.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} for the 2011 {{season was}} set in a closed-studio setting, with Hank Williams Jr. (in his 23rd year) performing with a band {{in front of a}} live audience with large video screens in the background. The end of the opening sequence featured the team logos of that night's participants transitioning into the new ESPN Monday Night Football logo before going to a live shot. On October 3, 2011, ESPN pulled the theme song after Williams appeared on the Fox News Channel program, Fox & Friends, where he compared a golf outing involving Barack Obama, John Boehner, Joe Biden and John Kasich to [...] "Hitler playing golf with Netanyahu." [...] On October 6, 2011, it was announced that Williams would no longer be singing the theme song, and that [...] "All My Rowdy Friends" [...] would no longer be used as its theme, as Williams still owns the song. A statement from ESPN said that the network has [...] "decided to part ways with Hank Williams Jr. We appreciate his contributions over the past years. The success of Monday Night Football has always been about the games and that will continue." [...] Williams commented on the matter: [...] "After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made my decision... By <b>pulling</b> <b>my</b> opening October 3, [...] stepped on the toes of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore me, my song, and All My Rowdy Friends are out of here.

2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm <b>pulling</b> <b>my</b> hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
