The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> <b>on</b> the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E

After Cardiff manager Dave Jones' sacking, Bellamy became a {{surprise}} favourite to take over. However, the new Cardiff boss, Malky Mackay, who knew Bellamy from their days at Norwich, did not say whether he would attempt to sign Bellamy. Bellamy asked Manchester City to let him go on a free transfer after they put a £4,000,000 <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} {{proposed}} paths stayed {{much closer to}} the village center. Like the Yellow Alternative, the Purple route would begin at the intersection of NY48 and Downer Street; however, the Purple Alternative went to the northeast instead, meeting NY370 two blocks southeast of its intersection with NY31. At this point, the road would turn north for a short distance to connect to NY31. The Railroad Alternative began at the junction of NY48 and Van Buren Road south of the village and generally paralleled NY48 northwestward into the village center, where it would end at NY31 one block to the east of NY48's junction with NY31. The projected <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> <b>on</b> the Railroad Alternative was $14million, while the Purple Alternative was the least expensive of the four alignments at $11million. By March 1998, the state had selected the Red Alternative, now projected to cost $20million. Although the plans to build the road were in place, construction of the highway was delayed for years {{due to a lack of}} funding.|$|E

500|$|The {{canceled}} highway {{project was}} revisited by the State Transportation Commission in 1979 as M-275. The renewed interest {{came after a}} vote of local residents showed a desire for the road. The Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation backed the proposal {{with the support of}} local officials around the highway and the highway lobby. The 22-year-old proposal was deemed [...] "necessary" [...] by the department to alleviate highway congestion along other area highways. The Department of the Interior continued to oppose the highway on environmental grounds. M-275 would have cut through Dodge No. 4 State Park in Oakland County if completed. Another factor that helped sink the project was the rising costs. Estimates in 1979 placed a $100 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> <b>on</b> the project.|$|E
