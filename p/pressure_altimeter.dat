25|$|Expert {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, {{was referring to the}} radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (which would provide the height relative {{to the level of the}} runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.|$|E
25|$|Approaching , the {{navigator}} {{began calling}} out the radar altimeter's reading. This is not standard practice for a non-precision approach, as the radar altimeter {{does not take}} into account the contour of the terrain around the airport. Standard practice would entail calling out the readings on the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> which is set according to atmospheric pressure and thereby references the elevation of the actual airport. The terrain on approach to Smolensk airport is uneven and locally much lower than the runway level.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> {{also known}} as the {{barometric}} altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroperú Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (static ports blocked by tape, rendering all airspeed indicators and <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeters</b> unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|R

2500|$|A 2006 {{article in}} Andes Magazine offered that Ojos del Salado may {{be higher than}} Aconcagua, {{although}} the argument was premised on older, less accurate altitude surveys.

50|$|The weather {{conditions}} {{consisted of a}} 7 kilometer (4 nm) visibility limited by a Broken (Ceiling) layer of Cumulonimbus clouds 2,000 feet above the aerodrome, a 16 °C temperature, and an <b>altimeter</b> <b>pressure</b> decrease (QNH 3031 to QNH 3024).|$|R
2500|$|The Terrain Awareness Warning System (abbreviated TAWS, {{although}} more correctly {{referred to as}} an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System or EGPWS) fired its first audible warning [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] at 10:40:06. This was because the Smolensk airport, as a former military airfield not open to international flights, {{was not in the}} system's database and therefore the system did not recognize that the airplane was approaching an airport. Six seconds later, someone (most likely the captain or navigator) pressed a button on the captain's FMS panel commanding standard barometric pressure be set on the captain's main electronic altimeter. This had the effect of increasing the altimeter's reading by as the TAWS takes readings from this particular altimeter, this had the additional effect of silencing the warning. The captain's secondary (mechanical) and the copilot's main electronic <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeters</b> continued to read correctly. As the descent continued, the crew realized they had started descent too late. To compensate for this, they increased their vertical speed to , twice the prescribed rate for a normal approach. The aircraft did not have enough drag to maintain speed with this rate of descent, so even though the autothrottles commanded idle power from the engines, the speed of the aircraft increased to approximately [...] higher than specified.|$|R
50|$|Altitude can be {{determined}} based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure. The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a barometer is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is called a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> or barometric altimeter. A <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> is the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes. Hikers and mountain climbers use wrist-mounted or hand-held altimeters, {{in addition to other}} navigational tools such as a map, magnetic compass, or GPS receiver.|$|E

50|$|On {{the flight}} deck, the {{definitive}} instrument for measuring altitude is the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> {{which is an}} aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry did not {{determine}} a particular cause. The aircraft had flown {{into the ocean}} for no apparent reason, and so the board focussed on the altimeter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{activity}} is to measure air pressure. Students record atmospheric pressure using a barometer or altimeter. Intended outcomes are that students gain an understanding that barometric or <b>altimeter</b> <b>pressure</b> varies and its increase or decrease indicates an upcoming change in the weather. Students also learn that the air has weight. Supporting background materials for both student and teacher are included.

5000|$|In aviation, {{pressure}} altitude is the indicated altitude when an altimeter {{is set to}} an agreed baseline pressure setting under certain circumstances where the aircraft's altimeter {{would be unable to}} give a useful readout of altitude. Examples would be landing at a very high altitude or near sea level in conditions of exceptionally high air <b>pressure.</b> Old <b>altimeters</b> were typically limited to show altitude when set between 950 mbar and 1030 mbar. [...] "Standard" [...] pressure, the baseline used universally, is 1013.25 hPa, equivalent to 1013.25 mbar or 29.92 inHg (inches of mercury). This setting is equivalent to the air pressure at mean sea level (MSL) in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). Pressure altitude is primarily used in aircraft performance calculations and in high-altitude flight (above the transition altitude).|$|R
50|$|The radio {{altimeter}} gave a true {{reading of the}} airplane's altitude {{when it was over}} the sea. Over land, the {{radio altimeter}} only gave the altitude over the land below. Without knowing the elevation of the land, it wasn't possible to know the true altitude. The <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> gave the same readings over land or sea, but it could not distinguish between a change in air pressure caused by a change in altitude and a change in air pressure caused by a change in barometric pressure. Therefore, the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> was only accurate to a range of altitudes. By using both altimeters together over the ocean, it was possible to determine the true altitude, the true air pressure at that altitude and the pressure at other altitudes at that point.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{levels are}} used to ensure safe {{vertical}} separation between aircraft, despite natural local variations in atmospheric air pressure. Historically, altitude has been measured using a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> which is essentially a calibrated barometer. An altimeter measures ambient air pressure, which decreases with increasing altitude following the barometric formula. It then calculates and displays the corresponding altitude.|$|E
5000|$|Altimeter {{setting is}} the value of the {{atmospheric}} pressure used to adjust the sub-scale of a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> so that it indicates the height of an aircraft above a known reference surface. This reference can be the mean sea level pressure (QNH), the pressure at the nearby surface airport or the pressure level of [...] which gives the standard flight levels ...|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} altitude (TA) is the altitude {{above sea level}} at which aircraft change {{from the use of}} local barometer derived altitudes to the use of flight levels. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft altimeters are usually set to show the altitude above sea level. Above the TA, the aircraft <b>altimeter</b> <b>pressure</b> setting is normally adjusted to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 hectopascals (millibars) or 29.92 inches of mercury and aircraft altitude will be expressed as a flight level.|$|R
30|$|EXAMPLE 2 : A {{digital camera}} returns an image (Observation), with a spatial {{receptive}} field {{equal to the}} size of the aperture and a temporal receptive window equal to the shutter speed. The aperture is “the size of the adjustable opening inside the lens, which determines how much light passes through the lens to strike the image sensor” [64], and the shutter speed is “the amount of time the digital camera’s shutter remains open when capturing a photograph” [65]. The receptor of the camera is the image sensor, but the size of the aperture determines the actual portion of the image sensor that is stimulated during the production of an image. The shutter speed determines the duration of the image sensor’s exposure to light. It is acknowledged here that resolution has been defined in the literature (for example, [66]) as a function of imaging aperture and the wavelength of the light. This is the optical resolution (which has sometimes also been called spatial resolution). It is inversely correlated with aperture, and measures the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer. However, in line with previous work [5, 67], the term ‘discrimination’ is reserved for the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer (the optical resolution). Approximating spatial resolution (as defined in this work, see Section Introduction) with spatial receptive field intends to inform about a different notion, and tell instead about the portion of the observer which was stimulated while producing the observation. It also reflects intuition, namely: the larger the aperture, the smaller the optical resolution (smallest details the lens can resolve), and consequently the larger the amount of spatial detail in the final image (spatial resolution). Further examples of receptors for technical observers include thermistors (for medical digital thermometers), bulbs (for clinical mercury thermometers), telescopes (for laser altimeters), aneroid capsules (for <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeters),</b> bulbs (for psychrometers), to name a few.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] - Our {{proposed}} {{project was}} mainly based on GSM networks and controller. Barometer is a well-organized tool for determining atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> The <b>altimeter</b> {{is a tool}} which calculates the vertical distance in accordance with a reference level. The barometric altimeter, computes the altitude according to the atmospheric pressure. Accuracy and size are the major issues in altimetry. MEMS based Barometric Altimeter is implemented using the following two terminals of embedded barometer Module. Even though {{the size of the}} MEMS based Barometric Altimeter is reduced, it provides more accuracy. The measured parameters are transmitted through commands using GSM modem from the controller to the mobile network. In the other end the GSM data is received and the readings are compared and the corresponding adjustments are made by the controller by vertical wheel adjustments. This process will be continued to achieve the equal level. This methodology can be used to measure the altitude at different places by means of separate arrangement...|$|R
50|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{can also}} determine altitude by trilateration with {{four or more}} satellites. In aircraft, altitude determined using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> without using some method of augmentation. In hiking and climbing, {{it is not uncommon}} to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as 400 feet depending on satellite orientation.|$|E
50|$|The actual {{height of}} an {{aircraft}} {{is based on}} the use of a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (see flight level for more detail). The heights quoted here are thus the nominal heights under standard conditions of temperature and pressure rather than the actual heights. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate altimeters to the same standard setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure, so little risk of collision arises.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 the {{standard}} vertical separation {{was set to}} 1,000 feet from the surface to FL290, and 2,000 feet above FL290. This was because {{the accuracy of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (used to determine altitude) decreases with height. Work on reducing this to 1,000 feet at all levels began almost immediately, {{but it was not until}} the 1990s that air data computers (ADCs), altimeters and autopilots became sufficiently accurate to make this a reality.|$|E
50|$|Having {{finished}} the mapping run and now needing oxygen, Zeamer immediately dove from twenty-five thousand feet to eight-to-ten thousand, estimating his altitude from {{a change in}} manifold <b>pressure</b> since the <b>altimeter</b> had been destroyed. At this point, a fifth crew member was wounded, the radio operator, as a pursuing Zero drove {{over the top of}} the diving B-17. After the precipitous dive, both the wounded assistant flight engineer and navigator, who Zeamer would later describe as looking like a beet with his blood-covered head and face, successfully extinguished the oxygen fire using only their hands and rags.|$|R
40|$|Many TWERLE {{balloons}} floating at {{an altitude}} of about 12. 5 km, traversed the Antarctic during its 1975 / 6 summer. The balloons' positions were accurately determined by the Nimbus- 6 satellite, which also received their sensors' data: radio <b>altimeter,</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature. Subtracting the altimeter readings from the calculated balloon altitude above sea-level (a. s. l.) provides the Antarctic surface elevation at the balloon subtrack. The balloon altitude a. s. l. is calculated from daily synoptic maps covering latitudes south of 45 deg S. These maps are prepared using the regular radiosonde network supplemented by four times as many TWERLE balloons...|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{altimeters}} {{measure the}} relative pressure {{difference between the}} lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground. Within the United States and Canada, these readings are provided in inches of mercury. Ground readings vary with weather and along {{the route of the}} aircraft as it travels, so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control. Aircraft operating at higher altitudes (at or above what is called the transition altitude, which varies by country) set their barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29.92 inHg (1 atm = 29.92 inHg) or 1013.25 hPa (1 hPa = 1 mbar) regardless of the actual sea level <b>pressure.</b> The resulting <b>altimeter</b> readings are known as flight levels.|$|R
