50|$|This {{is where}} the duty to settle comes in. To {{discourage}} the insurer from gambling with the insured's assets {{in pursuit of the}} remote possibility of a defense verdict (under which it can avoid having to pay the plaintiff anything at all), the insurer is subject to a duty to settle reasonably clear claims. The standard judicial test is that an insurer must settle a claim if a reasonable insurer, notwithstanding any policy limits, would have settled the claim. This does not require an insurer to accept or <b>pay</b> <b>settlement</b> offers that actually exceed policy limits, but in that instance, the insurer must discharge its duty to settle by at least making an attempt to bring about a settlement in which it would have to pay only its policy limits (either because the plaintiff agrees to lower their demand or the insured or another primary or excess insurer agrees to contribute the difference).|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the Consent Decree of the United States' basic steel industry which reformed plant seniority systems to accommodate issues of equal employment opportunity. The plant-by-plant litigation brought under Title VII and Executive Order 11246 {{is shown to}} be the main catalyst which brought representatives of the steel industry, of the United Steel Workers of America, and of the appropriate government agencies to negotiate this industry-wide solution. The principal terms of the steel industry Consent Decree are: the establishment of a mechanism to implement the Decree; the uniform institution of plant-wide seniority; the retention of pay rates after transfer to a position that provides a lower pay rate than the previous position; the establishment of goals for minority representation in trade and craft jobs; and a back <b>pay</b> <b>settlement.</b> The analysis of these provisions reveals two related points. Black representation in trade and craft jobs increased in the four year period after the Decree, with an indication that the increase was greater than pre- 1974 employment trends would have predicted. However, 1978 black/white employment figures indicate that underutilization of blacks in these positions still persists. ...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary The aim of {{this project}} is to {{describe}} how the recession and the National Minimum Wage affected <b>pay</b> <b>settlements</b> in the UK over the period 1977 - 2011. The recent recession was the first since {{the introduction of the}} National Minimum Wage (NMW) so the Low Pay Commission (LPC) faces new problems determining the NMW when earnings and GDP growth in the economy are sluggish or negative. This research explicitly exploits the information available over the whole 1977 - 2011 period, which relates to the recessions of the early 1980 s and 1990 s and the most recent recession of 2008 / 9, to provide general insights into the relationship between <b>pay</b> <b>settlements</b> and economic forces in times of recession. The first task of the project was to extend the data collected for the previous report (Dolton et al 2011) up to the latest available, August 2011. Using data from Incomes Data Services (IDS) and Industrial Relations Services (IRS, now XpertHR) combined with data derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (Ashe). This yields data for the period 1977 - 2011. These data were then augmented with aggregate annual data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on a number of economic variable...|$|R
