50|$|The {{ashy-bellied white-eye}} (Zosterops citrinella) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Zosteropidae found in the Lesser Sunda Islands and {{northern}} Cape York Peninsula. It is sometimes called the <b>pale</b> <b>white-eye</b> or pale-bellied white-eye, but {{should not be confused}} with the pale-bellied white-eye (Zosterops consobrinorum).|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is small}} (about 8-9 cm long) with {{yellowish}} olive upper parts, a white eye ring, yellow throat and vent. The belly is whitish grey but may have yellow in some subspecies. The sexes look similar. The species is widespread and {{is part of}} a superspecies complex that includes Zosterops japonicus, Zosterops meyeni and possibly others. The taxonomy of the group is still unclear with some island populations being distinctive while some subspecies are not well supported. The population from Flores, Indonesia for instance is found closer to the <b>pale</b> <b>white-eye.</b> The family itself is now questioned since they are nested along with the Stachyris babblers.|$|E
