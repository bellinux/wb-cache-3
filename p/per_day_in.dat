5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet.

5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses.

5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> children or 20g <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions.
