Each 1972 Regency owner received a distinctive sterling silver key ring as a gift. If they were lost, the keys could be dropped in a mailbox, and Tiffany's would return them to the owner. A total of 2,650 75th anniversary Ninety-Eight Regency cars were built, all of them four-door hardtops. In 1973 the non-anniversary Regency stayed in the line up slotted just above the LS.

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the <b>power</b> <b>split</b> device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a blower motor and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E

Assuming equal power allocation across subcarriers, we formulate the problem to maximize the aggregate harvested power of all users while satisfying secrecy rate requirement of individual user by joint subcarrier allocation and optimal <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> ratio selection. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose two suboptimal algorithms {{to solve the problem}} in the dual domain.

40|$|Scavenging {{energy from}} ambient radio signals, namely {{wireless}} energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver replenishes energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that {{is assumed to be}} known at the receiver. We derive the optimal <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver <b>power</b> <b>splitting.</b> Finally, we extend the result for DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system and investigate a low-complexity <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> scheme termed antenna switching.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiple access systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission. In particular, we focus on <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can <b>split</b> the received <b>power</b> into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can <b>split</b> the received <b>power</b> only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> ratios. In both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which {{takes into account the}} circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. Subsequently, by exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are proposed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> (PS) -based simultaneous wireless {{information and}} power transfer (SWIPT) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel networks where multiple transceiver pairs {{share the same}} frequency spectrum. As the PS model is adopted, an individual receiver splits the received signal into two parts for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Aiming to minimize the total transmit power, transmit precoders, receive filters and PS ratios are jointly designed under a predefined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints. The formulated joint transceiver design and <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve directly. In order to effectively obtain its solution, the feasibility conditions of the formulated non-convex problem are first analyzed. Based on the analysis, an iterative algorithm is proposed by alternatively optimizing the transmitters together with the <b>power</b> <b>splitting</b> factors and the receivers based on semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Moreover, considering the prohibitive computational cost of the SDP for practical applications, a low-complexity suboptimal scheme is proposed by separately designing interference-suppressing transceivers based on interference alignment (IA) and optimizing the transmit power allocation together with splitting factors.
