40|$|To improve students’ {{transitions}} between successive educational levels, continuing learning pathways {{are being}} designed and implemented in many countries. This study {{was carried out}} {{to examine the effects}} of the Green Lycea (GL) as critical cases of continuing learning pathways in vocational education in The Netherlands. The GL were compared with a traditional pathway (<b>pre-vocational</b> secondary <b>education</b> and secondary vocational education offered as separate programmes) in terms of students’ learning performance and transitions. GL students and comparable students following the regular pathway yielded the same mean final exam scores for four core subjects in the first phase of their educational programmes, despite the fact that GL students took this exam one year earlier than regular students because of the acceleration of the learning trajectory in the GL programme. Regarding the students’ transitions, the GL and the traditional pathway yielded comparable percentages of students who either did or did not obtain a <b>pre-vocational</b> secondary <b>education</b> diploma; For the GL, however, the percentage of students who proceeded in secondary vocational education was higher. To conclude, it seems to be possible to improve students’ transitions between successive educational levels (with their learning performance being an important precondition) through continuing learning pathways such as the GL. In this regard, GL design characteristics as described and examined in this study can be valuable ingredients for continuing learning pathways internationally as well. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{origins and}} {{developments}} of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> are traditionally {{traced back to}} Prime Minister James Callaghan’s speech on 18 th October 1976 at Ruskin College, near Oxford. An assertion {{of this study is}} that this is a fallacy, with evidence of the existence of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> dating back many years before this date. Further it is contended that Callaghan’s speech was not the catalyst for change in aspects of secondary education that many have suggested. The speech was neither a deliberate attempt by Callaghan to challenge the accepted modus operandi of the educational establishment nor an effort to raise standards. On the contrary, this study will argue that Callaghan’s intervention in education was a conscious attempt to distract the attention of commentators away from the worsening social and economic conditions within the U. K, which Callaghan had inherited from Harold Wilson. The above will be argued primarily through placing the emphasis on an aspect of secondary education which has attracted very few words of analysis or explanation namely, <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education.</b> A definition of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> will be constructed in order to help raise the status of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> by means of establishing a greater understanding and awareness. The emphasis on PVE will also allow for a direct comparison to be made between the content of Callaghan’s words of 18 th October 1976 with the content of the Tomlinson Report published on 18 th October 2004 helping to establish that Callaghan was neither a catalyst for change or making particularly original claims. The study will use the resources of the City of Birmingham as well as the local and national press to help substantiate many of the assertions, thus mimicking a practice used by the authoritative education historian Professor Roy Lowe (1988). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} for the study is to enhance {{our understanding of how}} young people learn and engage with vocational subjects within the lower secondary years of compulsory education. The concept of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> has recently emerged to describe the initial transitional phase of preparing young people for employment in specific occupational areas in the UK. Although there has been extensive research undertaken in work-based apprenticeship learning, very little research has emerged in <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> among 14 - 16 year olds in schools. The research undertakes such an enquiry based upon a case study of North Lanarkshire secondary schools. This local authority has been selected as it {{has one of the highest}} rates of young people participating in <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> in secondary education and has been identified by a recent OECD report as a potential exemplar of best practice in this field. However, concerns remain regarding how to integrate the pre-vocational curriculum with the academic curriculum, whether pre-vocational courses can engage high achievers and, more specifically, how effectively the subject is taught within schools...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative research project on <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> in lower secondary schools in seven European countries. The primary {{aim of the}} study was to better understand how the formal <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> curriculum is interpreted and shaped by individual teachers. The countries covered are Austria, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Scotland. Two research methods have been used. First, a content analysis of the relevant curricula was carried out, focussing on how, and to what extent, <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> competencies are embedded in the official curriculum in the seven countries covered by the study. Second, 75 teachers took part in qualitative expert interviews about their implementation of the relevant curriculum. This research builds upon previous studies in education and employment and in particular, on a theoretical framework that explores the differences between the ‘prescribed' curriculum and the ‘enacted' curriculum. This study will argue that, although it is possible to identify a distinct pre-vocational curriculum within each region in the seven countries, this curriculum is, in practice, taught very differently within the schools and that the differences in curriculum implementation can be explained, amongst other factors, by the availability of resources and the initial and further training of teachers...|$|E

This research studies {{the relationship between}} school policy regarding school-absenteeism of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools and pupil's self-experiences regarding school and school-absenteeism. School-absenteeism {{is a big problem}} for pupils, {{as well as for the}} school and the environment. School-absenteeism is an indicator for early school leaving and is also related to risky behavior. Initially schools took measures by addressing school management and tackling disciplinary problems. Yet, often personal factors like physical/psychological/cognitive problems and negative self-experiences are important factors related to school-absenteeism that are left unaddressed. This research consists of two questionnaires. One questionnaire measures the school policy of 10 <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools. The other questionnaire measures self-experiences of 700 pupils of 3 selected <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools. Both questionnaires will be conducted in the region of Twente in the Netherlands.

30|$|The Dutch {{compulsory}} schooling {{law requires}} children {{to go to}} school until the age of 18 or until pre-university, upper secondary general education or upper secondary vocational education is successfully finished (i.e. if a degree is attained). For children enrolled in pre-university of upper secondary general education the law simply enforces that children are in education until they are 18  years old and in general these children manage to successfully finish the educational program. However, the situation is dramatically different for vocational education. Students who successfully finish <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education</b> are, on average, 16  years old and obliged by law to continue with a vocational training program even if they do not prefer to do so. As a result of this law many children enrol in a vocational training program (level 2, 3 or 4) after successfully finishing <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>education,</b> but might drop out legitimately without a degree after 1 or 2  years when they become 18  years old. This context partly explains, at least for the Netherlands, why dropout in vocational education is relatively high.|$|E
