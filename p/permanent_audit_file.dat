40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the current topic quality control in the {{auditing}} profession. The quality of audit services is under the international harmonization {{as well as the}} financial reporting to achieve the results of audit procedures to be internatinally comparable. The thesis is very closely focused on the form and performace of quality control of Czech audit entities done by the independent authority The Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic, respectively by the control entiy named Supervisory Committee. The aim of the thesis is to verify the hypothesis related to year-on-year increase in audit procedures and the <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> quality with the assumption that the increase of quality is enhanced by the quality control from the side of internal or external quality controller. The hypothesis {{is at the end of}} the thesis verified as a reset of the practical part of the thesis in which is analyzed and assessed quality of specific <b>audit</b> <b>file.</b> The <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> was chosen intentionally for the purpose of the aim of thesis, to compare the quality of <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> before and after the internal quality control. The result of this comparison is that the quality of audit procesuders and <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> is strongly positively dependent on the quality control and performace of quality control is effective...|$|R

40|$|An {{inherent}} {{aspect of}} an audit {{is the level}} of task complexity that junior auditors (staff and senior level associates) endure on a daily basis. This complexity directly impacts an auditor’s ability to form an appropriate problem representation, which in turn impacts judgment performance. One of the key components of this process is having sufficient knowledge for purposes of problem representation; without it, the auditor’s problem representation and ultimately judgment performance are negatively impacted. Conversely, audit teams can positively influence the conciseness of problem representation and performance by way of effective task-specific knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer in the audit field occurs during three distinct phases: when an auditor reviews prior and/or current year workpapers; when an auditor requests help; and/or during the workpaper review process. For purposes of efficiency and increasing (i. e. improving) problem representation, prior to any deleterious effects, it’s critical that the audit profession understand how to maximize the knowledge transfer as soon as possible after the auditor’s initial assignment of the task. Because auditors commonly will immediately refer to audit programs in the current year documentation in the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> to gain an understanding of the task, maximizing the knowledge transfer within the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> is critical to increasing auditor judgment performance. I propose utilizing media richness theory to establish an increased media rich transfer of knowledge via the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> from the <b>audit</b> managers (expert) to junior auditors (novice). Procedure screens within the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> would likely be categorized as “written, formal” mediums within the media richness theory, because the source of information is impersonal. However, if audit firms can successfully transform the transfer of information within the <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> from being solely formal document screens to also incorporate personal source characteristics, they will successfully increase the information richness, which will allow for a more successful transfer of knowledge and subsequently the ability for the auditor to more effectively form a problem representation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{designed and}} implemented an intelligent tutoring system for teaching computer intrusion detection to potential or current system administrators of computer networks. The Intrusion- Detection Tutoring System (IDTS) is an intelligent tutoring system built using Quintus Prolog and METUTOR general-purpose tutoring software written by Professor Rowe. The operating {{environment of the}} IDTS is a virtual one, based on UNIX; it uses some common UNIX commands and file hierarchy. After both student and tutor analyze a static <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> to find suspicious and or malicious behavior, the student tries to fix the damage, and the computer critiques the student's actions using means-ends analysis. Using its nineteen behavior rules, IDTS can classify eleven different types of intruder behavior known to exploit system vulnerabilities, and can tutor the student how to detect this behavior and how to efficiently return the system to a secure state after the intrusion has occurred. Four different <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> of varying length were tested with IDTS. IDTS correctly identified most intruder behavior in both manually and computer generated <b>audit</b> <b>files,</b> and showed it could correctly tutor on that behavior. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Problem statement: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) {{have become}} an {{important}} component of infrastructure protection mechanism to secure the current and emerging networks, its services and applications by detecting, alerting and taking necessary actions against the malicious activities. The network size, technology diversities and security policies make networks more challenging and hence there is a requirement for IDS which should be very accurate, adaptive, extensible and more reliable. Although there exists the novel framework for this requirement namely Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection (MADAM ID), it is having some performance shortfalls in processing the audit data. Approach: Few experiments were conducted on tcpdump data of DARPA and BCM <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> by applying the algorithms and tools of MADAM ID in the processing of audit data, mine patterns, construct features and build RIPPER classifiers. By putting it all together, four main categories of attacks namely DOS, R 2 L, U 2 R and PROBING attacks were simulated. Results: This study outlines the experimentation results of MADAM ID in testing the DARPA and BSM data on a simulated network environment. Conclusion: The strengths and weakness of MADAM ID has been identified thru the experiments conducted on tcpdump data and also on Pascal based <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> of Basic Security Module (BSM). This study also gives some additional directions about the future applications of MADAM ID...|$|R

The final solution should improve both flexibility in workflow orchestration as well as performance improvements when running multiple workflows simultaneously. Besides analysing the existing system and eliciting its requirements, a survey of existing solutions and technologies is made in order to architect the final solution. Although this work aims to improve the existing system from which it arose, it should be developed in an agnostic manner, so as to be integrated with any system that requires the handling of complex computational workflows...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Keypad, an <b>auditing</b> <b>file</b> {{system for}} theftprone devices, such as laptops and USB sticks. Keypad provides two important properties. First, Keypad supports finegrained file auditing: a user can obtain explicit evidence that no files have been accessed after a device’s loss. Second, a user can disable future file access after a device’s loss, {{even in the}} absence of device network connectivity. Keypad achieves these properties by weaving together encryption and remote key storage. By encrypting files locally but storing encryption keys remotely, Keypad requires the involvement of an audit server with every protected file access. By alerting the audit server to refuse to return a particular file’s key, the user can prevent new accesses after theft. We describe the Keypad architecture, a prototype implementation on Linux, and our evaluation of Keypad’s performance and auditing fidelity. Our results show that Keypad overcomes the challenges posed by slow networks or disconnection, providing clients with usable forensics and control for their (increasingly) missing mobile devices...|$|R
