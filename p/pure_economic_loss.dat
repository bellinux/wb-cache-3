Equally ground-breaking has been his contribution to the comparative law of security interests and to the comparative law of contract, as it is demonstrated by the fact that Bussani was invited twice to participate in European-wide projects financed by the European Commission for the harmonization of contract law. With Ugo Mattei (UC Hastings, Ca., and Turin U., Italy), Bussani developed an innovative comparative law methodology, mixing Rudolf B. Schlesinger’s and Rodolfo Sacco’s revolutionary findings on comparative legal studies. This new methodology is embodied in ‘The Common Core of European Private Law Project’, a project which aims to unearth, through an approach based on factual questionnaires, what is common and what is divergent between European private laws. A network of more than three hundreds European and non-European scholars participates in the project, and the latter’s results are collected in volumes published by Cambridge University Press in a peer-reviewed series named after the title of the project itself, under the direction of Bussani and Mattei. In recent years, Bussani successfully turned his mastery of comparative law methods on more public-attuned themes, starting pioneering investigations on international financial law, the comparative law of human rights, and legal globalization(s).|$|R

Due to the power being off the factory lost a large amount of money; £368 on damaged goods, £400 on the profits they would have made from those goods and £1,767 for the steel they could not make due to the power outage. The question was what Spartan Steel could claim money for. Martin & Co agreed they were negligent, and offered to pay for the damaged goods and the profit that Spartan Steel would have made on those goods, but refused to pay damages for the steel Spartan Steel could not make due to the power outage. In his judgment Denning agreed that they would only have to pay for losses associated with the damaged goods, not the money lost on the steel that could not be made due to the power outage because it counted as <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss.</b> For public policy reasons Denning would not allow the recovery of <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> stating in his judgment that: ...|$|E

One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the [...] "foreseeability" [...] doctrine. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied.

In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule. Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the [...] "benefit-of-the-bargain" [...] rule (damages identical to expectation damages in contracts) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value. Beginning with Stiles v. White (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the [...] "out-of-pocket damages" [...] rule as a minority rule. Although the damages under the [...] "benefit-of-the-bargain" [...] are described as compensatory, the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction. The economic loss rule which emerged in the 20th century would eliminate these losses if applied strictly, which has led to preclusion of the tort or an exception to allow the tort if not related to a contract.|$|E
