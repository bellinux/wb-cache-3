[...] At the Show of the Americas in 1980, Melco unveiled the Digitrac, a digitizing system for embroidery machines. The digitized design was composed at six times the size of the embroidered final product. The Digitrac consisted of a small computer, similar in size to a BlackBerry, mounted on an X and Y axis on a large white board. It sold for $30,000.

5000|$|The usual {{method of}} {{operation}} was that the message would be prepared off-line, using paper tape. All common telex machines incorporated a 5-hole <b>paper-tape</b> punch and <b>reader.</b> Once the paper tape had been prepared, the message could be transmitted in minimum time. Telex billing was always by connected duration, so minimizing the connected time saved money. However, it was also possible to connect in [...] "real time", where the sender and the recipient could both type on the keyboard and these characters would be immediately printed on the distant machine.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, DEC {{routinely}} disabled the answerback {{feature on}} Teletype Model 33 terminals because it {{interfered with the}} use of the <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader</b> and punch for binary data. However, the DEC VT100 terminals from 1978 responded to enquiry with a user-configurable answerback message, as did its successors.|$|E

5000|$|A parameter-driven {{sort-merge}} program, {{capable of}} handling very large volumes of data. Sort parameters could either be read in from the <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader,</b> for one-off sorts, or [...] "compiled" [...] in (really just stored in the program). There were extensive user [...] "hooks" [...] where user-supplied code could be put in at various stages of the sort/merge process.|$|E
50|$|The I/O systems {{underwent}} huge {{changes during}} the PDP-8 era. Early PDP-8 models used a front panel interface, a <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader</b> and a teletype printer with an optional paper-tape punch. Over time I/O {{systems such as}} magnetic tape, RS-232 and current loop dumb terminals, punched card readers, and fixed-head disks were added. Toward {{the end of the}} PDP-8 era, floppy disks and moving-head cartridge disk drives were popular I/O devices. Modern enthusiasts have created standard PC style IDE hard disk adapters for real and simulated PDP-8 computers.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{experimented with}} several {{accessories}} and enhancements for its electric typewriter. In 1942, IBM filed a patent {{application for a}} typewriter that could print justified and proportionally spaced text. This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed. [...] IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their punched-card code.Eventually, IBM settled on a 6-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945. [...] Equipping an electric typewriter with both a <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader</b> and punch created the basic foundation for {{what would become the}} Flexowriter.|$|E
5000|$|All 160 systems had a <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader,</b> and a punch, {{and most}} had an IBM Electric {{typewriter}} modified {{to act as}} a computer terminal. [...] Memory on the 160 was 4096 12-bit words. The instruction set was small and RISC-like. The CPU had a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator but no multiply or divide. There was a full complement of instructions and several addressing modes. Indirect addressing was almost as good as index registers. The instruction set supported both relative (to the current P register) and absolute. The original instruction set did not have a subroutine call instruction and could only address one bank of memory.|$|E

5000|$|Input/output {{instructions}} {{used the}} A register and separate {{input and output}} 16-bit buses. A 10-bit I/O control bus, consisting of 6 bits of device address information and 4 bits of function selection, was used. The basic processor had a single interrupt signal line, but an option provided up to 48 interrupts. [...] In addition to a front-panel display of lights and toggle switches, the system supported different types of input/output devices. A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter {{could be used as}} a console I/O device and (in the most basic systems) to load and store data to paper tape. Smaller systems typically used a high-speed <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader</b> and punch for data storage. The Honeywell family of peripherals included card readers and punches, line printers, magnetic tape, and both fixed-head and removable hard disk drives.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} of its decommissioning, the {{computer}} was all solid-state, using a combination ofRTL, DTL and TTL. It had an array multiplier, 15 index registers, 16K of 6 microsecond cycle time core memory, and 64K of 2 microsecond cycle time core memory. A NOP instruction took about 2.5 microseconds. A Multiply took 8 microseconds, and a divide 25 microseconds. It had a paging unit using 1K word pages with an associative 16-deep lookup memory. A 1 Megaword CDC drum was hooked up as a paging device. It also had several ADDS Special-Order Direct-View Storage-Tube terminals. These terminals used an extended character set which covered about all the mathematical symbols, and allowed for 1/2 line spacing for math formulas. For I/O, it had two IBM 360 series nine-track and two seven-track 1/2" [...] tape drives. It had an eight-bit <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader</b> and punch, and a 500 line-per-minute printer (1500 line-per-minute using the hexadecimal character set). Storage was three IBM 7000 series 1301 disk drives, each having two modules of 21.6 million characters apiece.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the single-chip {{microprocessor}} was {{an enormous}} catalyst to the popularization of cheap, easy to use, and truly personal computers. The Altair 8800, introduced in a Popular Electronics magazine article in the January 1975 issue, at the time set a new low price point for a computer, bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the 1970s. This {{was followed by the}} IMSAI 8080 computer, with similar abilities and limitations. The Altair and IMSAI were essentially scaled-down minicomputers and were incomplete: to connect a keyboard or teleprinter to them required heavy, expensive [...] "peripherals". These machines both featured a front panel with switches and lights, which communicated with the operator in binary. To program the machine after switching it on the bootstrap loader program had to be entered, without error, in binary, then a paper tape containing a BASIC interpreter loaded from a <b>paper-tape</b> <b>reader.</b> Keying the loader required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the [...] "load" [...] button, once for each byte of the program, which was typically hundreds of bytes long. The computer could run BASIC programs once the interpreter had been loaded.|$|E
