5|$|After {{returning}} {{her guests}} to New York, West Alsek sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, for operation by the Oriole Line. She sailed for Cardiff, {{becoming the first}} ship depending only on <b>pulverized</b> coal to cross the Atlantic, and back to Baltimore on 18 August. Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the <b>pulverized</b> coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of <b>pulverized</b> coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves, while upper class members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Pulverizing</b> {{system is}} the main energy-consumption {{equipment}} in coal-fired power plant. In China, coal-fired power plants are obliged to alter operation condition {{in response to the}} frequent change of unit load and coal quality, which results in non-standard operation condition and extra energy consumption of pulverization system in consequence. Hence it is of great significance to study energy-saving and optimization of <b>pulverizing</b> system. This paper first analyzes the influence factors on energy consumption of <b>pulverizing</b> system respectively according to literature survey. Due to the large numbers of influence parameters and their complex interactions, these parameters are certain to influence power consumption synergistically in the form of dynamic non-linear variation. This paper groups and defines these parameters into three categories, namely external parameters, constrained parameters, and controlled parameters. Based on the definition, the general model considering all the three groups of parameters is proposed, which considers all the influence factors for energy consumption under all unit conditions. Subsequently, the energy-saving and optimization proposal for the <b>pulverizing</b> system are proposed...|$|R
5|$|Thermal {{power plants}} which use oil shale as a fuel mostly employ {{two types of}} {{combustion}} methods. The traditional method is <b>Pulverized</b> combustion (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while the more advanced method is Fluidized bed combustion (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC technologies are Bubbling fluidized bed combustion (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC).|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson <b>pulverized</b> a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|The battle had firmly {{turned in}} France's favour, {{but it was}} far from over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command center from Žuráň Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The {{difficult}} position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the Russian Imperial Guard; Grand Duke Constantine, Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men <b>pulverized</b> their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Pulverize</b> is a {{major part}} of the boiler {{combustion}} system and an important part in the system of steam power plant (PLTU). Pulverizer plant serves to break chunks of coal into the coal ash was then fed to the burner. Type of feed coal into a <b>pulverize</b> is cleaned with a value product <b>pulverize</b> optimum 30 %. The percentage of this value greatly affects the production of steam in the boiler. Therefore the boiler has a very high pressure, is inflammable zone and has a dangerous and potentially very high risk, and then the system needs to be investigated. By performing an evaluation and analysis of critical points in the <b>pulverize,</b> boiler, measuring the level of danger and risk that occurs, and examine other possibilities that would occur in the worst condition by using hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies by recording the deviation values variable process, making the model Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and to simulate, it can be known the level of hazard and risk systems, so you can make recommendations and created a new work instructions [...] Key-Words: Pulverizer, Boiler, Steam power plant, HAZOP, Fault Tree Analisis. 1...|$|R

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of <b>pulverized</b> rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first <b>pulverized</b> into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, {{diamagnetic}} metal, {{though most}} common commercial grades {{of the metal}} have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be <b>pulverized</b> by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E
