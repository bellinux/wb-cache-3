Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>resistor</b> to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need a <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>resistor</b> and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|E

After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D− lines and the aforementioned <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>resistors</b> hold it in the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add {{as much as one}} bit time before the SE0 of the end of packet. This extra bit can also result in a [...] "bit stuff violation" [...] if the six bits before it in the CRC are 1s. This bit should be ignored by receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The Dallas 1-Wire {{network is}} {{physically}} implemented as an open drain master device connected {{to one or}} more open drain slaves. [...] A single pull-up resistor is common to all devices and acts to pull the bus up to 3 or 5 volts, and may provide power to the slave devices. Communication occurs when a master or slave asserts the bus low, i.e. connects the <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>resistor</b> to ground through its output MOSFET. Specific 1-Wire driver and bridge chips are also available. Data rates of 16.3 kbit/s can be achieved. There is also an overdrive mode which speeds up the communication by a factor of 10.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} guided tour of how {{everything}} was achieved by choosing the right parts, implementation and building, testing, results and of course to inspire future projects and students into making student level tachometers because they all come in different shapes and sizes. A microcontroller programmed using the Arduino software on Microsoft Windows in a combination of C and C++ was used to control various circuitry and brought the device to life with the Arduino software and a few external libraries. Various alterations and upgrades could be made to this device as this thesis only explores a fraction of the endless possibility of technologies, methods, programs, and electrical components. This thesis paper contains extensive research and will explore where tachometers came from and the current sensor technology used today such as the Hall Effect, generator, light reflected from a laser or an optical encoder that can determine position of a rotating device. The different technologies’ advantages and disadvantages will be looked into because in differing circumstances one might be better than the other. The specifications for this thesis are to measure and display the movement of a rotating machine in revolutions per minute or radians per second. The idea of the project was to make all the parts fit into a box and make it portable so getting the right battery was a cost versus function compromise. Tachometers are essentially used for measuring speed and can be in turn, control manually or automatically some aspect of the measured machine. Tachometers can be used for scheduling maintenance after certain mileage and therefore reducing costs over a machine’s lifetime. The basis for measurement is by using the Arduino’s interrupt function which will take quick and accurate time based measurements. The internal <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>resistor</b> built into the Arduino’s board will ensure no false positives are recorded when a falling edge is present on the interrupt pin. Specifications from data sheets are examined in great detail to prevent damage to any of the components and part of the method is testing along the way and looking for problems and solutions...|$|E
