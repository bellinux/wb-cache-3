40|$|Solving {{equations}} in equational Horn-clause theories is a programming paradigm {{that combines}} logic programming and functional programming {{in a clean}} manner. Languages like EQLOG, SLOG and RITE, express programs as conditional rewrite rules and goals as equations to be solved. <b>Procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> of conditional equational theories, in a manner akin to that of Knuth and Bendix for unconditional theories, also require methods for solving equations appearing in conditions. Rewrite-based logic-programming uses (conditional) narrowing to solve equational goals. Recently a different, topdown equation solving <b>procedure</b> was proposed <b>for</b> unconditional rewrite systems. In this paper, we express equational goal solving using conditional rules. Some refinements are described: the notion of operator derivability is used to prune useless paths in the search tree and our use of oriented goals eliminates some redundant paths leading to non-normalized solutions. Our goal-directed method can also be extended to handle conditional systems. I. Equational Programming Several proposed programming languages use conditional equations {{as a means of}} combining the main features of logic programming and functional programming; such languages include RITE [Dershowitz-Plaisted- 85], SLOG [Fribourg- 85], and EQLOG [Goguen-Meseguer- 86]. In this paradigm, a program is a set of rules, that is, directed (conditional) equations, and a goal is the question whether an equation s = t has a solution in the equational theory presented by the program. Computing consists of finding values (substitutions) for the variables in s and t for which the equality holds. Efficient methods of solving equations are therefore very important. So, too, is the ability to detect that equations are unsatisfiable...|$|R
40|$|Determinisation and {{completion}} of finite tree automata are important operations with applications in program analysis and verification. However, {{the complexity of}} the classical <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> determinisation and <b>completion</b> is high. They are not practical <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> manipulating tree automata beyond very small ones. In this paper we develop an algorithm <b>for</b> determinisation and <b>completion</b> of finite tree automata, whose worst-case complexity remains unchanged, but which performs far better than existing algorithms in practice. The critical aspect of the algorithm is that the transitions of the determinised (and possibly completed) automaton are generated in a potentially very compact form called product form, which can reduce the size of the representation dramatically. Furthermore, the representation can often be used directly when manipulating the determinised automaton. The paper contains an experimental evaluation of the algorithm on a large set of tree automata examples...|$|R
40|$|Neural autoregressive {{models are}} {{explicit}} density estimators that achieve state-of-the-art likelihoods for generative modeling. The D-dimensional data distribution is factorized into an autoregressive product of one-dimensional conditional distributions {{according to the}} chain rule. Data completion is a more involved task than data generation: the model must infer missing variables for any partially observed input vector. Previous work introduced an order-agnostic training <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> data <b>completion</b> with autoregressive models. Missing variables in any partially observed input vector can be imputed efficiently by choosing an ordering where observed dimensions precede unobserved ones and by computing the autoregressive product in this order. In this paper, we provide evidence that the order-agnostic (OA) training <b>procedure</b> is suboptimal <b>for</b> data <b>completion.</b> We propose an alternative procedure (OA++) that reaches better performance in fewer computations. It can handle all data completion queries while training fewer one-dimensional conditional distributions than the OA procedure. In addition, these one-dimensional conditional distributions are trained proportionally to their expected usage at inference time, reducing overfitting. Finally, our OA++ procedure can exploit prior knowledge about the distribution of inference completion queries, as opposed to OA. We support these claims with quantitative experiments on standard datasets used to evaluate autoregressive generative models...|$|R

40|$|As {{the demand}} for energy {{worldwide}} increases, {{the oil and gas}} industry will need to increase recovery from unconventional gas reservoirs (UGR). UGRs include Tight Gas Sand (TGS), coalbed methane and gas shales. To economically produce UGRs, one must have adequate product price and one must use the most current technology. TGS reservoirs require stimulation as a part of the completion, so improvement of completion practices is very important. We did a thorough literature review to extract knowledge and experience about completion and stimulation technologies used in TGS reservoirs. We developed the principal design and two modules of a computer program called Tight Gas Sand Advisor (TGS Advisor), which can be used to assist engineers in making decisions while completing and stimulating TGS reservoirs. The modules include Perforation Selection and Proppant Selection. Based on input well/reservoir parameters these subroutines provide unambiguous recommendations concerning which perforation strategy(s) and what proppant(s) are applicable for a given well.

40|$|The Research Committee of the British Thoracic Association {{conducted}} a confidential inquiry into death from asthma in adults aged 15 - 64 years resident in the West Midland and Mersey Regions during 1979. Death certificates recording the word asthma were received for 153 persons. The International Classification of Diseases code {{for the cause}} of death was obtained from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Information about the patients, their illness, and their death was obtained by interviews, questionnaires, and inspection of patients' records. A panel of three physicians assisted by a pathologist assessed the clinical and, where applicable, the necropsy findings to ascertain whether bronchial asthma was the true cause of death. Of 147 assessable patients, 89 were considered by the panel to have died from asthma. In 77 of these cases the death certificates were correctly coded, whereas in 12 (13 %) death was considered to have been wrongly attributed to another cause (falsely negative). Twenty four deaths on the other hand were considered to have been wrongly attributed to asthma (falsely positive). From this it appears that the total number of 101 certificates recording death from asthma represents a net overestimate of 13 %. Accuracy was highest in the youngest age group. There were few discrepancies between the assessment of the panel and certified cause of death when a necropsy had been performed. The most common error (17 % of all certificates) was failure to follow the <b>procedure</b> advised <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> of death certificates.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the hydrodynamic efficiency of extracardiac and intra-atrial lateral tunnel procedures in total cavopulmonary connections. Methods: Intra-atrial lateral tunnel, extracardiac tunnel, and extracardiac conduit with and without caval vein offset were performed on explanted sheep heart preparations and studied in an in vitro flow loop. A rate of fluid-energy dissipation analysis was performed for each model using simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow at each inlet and outlet of the right side of the heart. Preparations were perfused by using a steady flow blood pump at 4 flow indices (1 - 6 L/min/m 2) with the inferior vena cava carrying 65 % of the total venous return. Results: Fluid-power losses were consistently lower for the extracardiac conduit procedure compared with the two tunnel configurations (P <. 01). A further reduction in energy dissipation of up to 36 % was noted in the extracardiac procedure, with 5 mm offset of the extracardiac conduit toward the distal right pulmonary. The intra-atrial and extracardiac tunnel procedures were least efficient, with losses 73 % greater than the optimal extracardiac conduit procedure. Conclusions: The extracardiac conduit procedure provides superior hemodynamics compared with the intra-atrial lateral tunnel and extracardiac tunnel techniques. This hydrodynamic advantage is markedly enhanced by the use of conduit–superior vena cava offset, particularly at high physiologic flows that are representative of exercise. These data suggest additional rationale for the use of extracardiac conduit <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> final-stage <b>completion</b> of the Fontan circulation.

Centralized purchasing can bring advantages, such as increasing {{the efficiency of the}} purchasing process, but also disadvantages, such as the possibility of oligopoly by suppliers, generated by imperfect competition, and a diminished response to the most decentralized units. This theme {{was the subject of a}} reflection meeting, which aimed to promote a debate on the national framework aspects of this process, challenges of implementation for hospital medicines and suggestions for improvement of this process. The main ideas generated for a successful centralized purchasing indicate that the central purchasing entity should be dynamic and facilitator, should ensuring equity, safety, accessibility and quality of drugs.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) was performed on a 37 -year-old white man with an isolated 95 % right coronary artery stenosis who initially presented with type II unstable angina. Submaximal treadmill stress testing was not carried out before PTCA, but testing 3 days after PTCA was strongly positive without accompanying symptoms of myocardial ischaemia. Some 30 minutes after this test the patient experienced severe precordial pain with features of a hyperacute transmural inferior myocardial infarction. Immediate coronary arteriography delineated fresh thrombus related to the previous PTCA site. Intracoronary thrombolysis with streptokinase was successful, revealing an underlying severe stenosis at the PTCA site. PTCA was not repeated, nor was emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed. This is the second such case documented in the literature; the first patient failed to respond to intracoronary thrombolysis with streptokinase and was submitted to emergency CABG. The possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. We believe that the late thrombus formation was directly related to submaximal stress testing after successful PTCA, and recommend that testing to assess the efficacy of PTCA be deferred until at least 1 month after the <b>procedure</b> to allow <b>for</b> <b>completion</b> of the healing process.

40|$|We {{describe}} robust optimization <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> controlling total <b>completion</b> time penalty plus crashing cost {{in projects}} with uncertain activity times. These activity times arise from an unspecified distribution within {{a family of}} distributions with known support, mean and covariance. We develop linear and linear-based decision rules for making decisions about activity start times and the crashing of activity times. These rules identify decisions that perform well against all possible scenarios of activity time uncertainty. The resulting crashing strategies are implemented in both static and rolling horizon modes. Whereas the traditional planning methodology PERT does not consider correlation between past and future performance within or between activities, our methodology models both types of correlation. We compare our procedures against PERT, and also against the alternative approach of Monte Carlo simulation which assumes more information. Extensive computational results show that our crashing strategies provide over 99 % probability of meeting the overall project budget, compared to less than 45 % for the previous approaches that use the same information. Expected budget overruns are similarly improved from over 25 % to less than 0. 1 %. The relative advantages of the static and rolling horizon implementations are also discussed. We identify several managerial insights from our results. Key words and phrases: project management; time/cost tradeoff under uncertainty; robust optimization; linear decision rule...|$|R
