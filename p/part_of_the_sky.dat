Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} book of his Meteorology, Aristotle propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two {{thousand}} years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were planets, {{or at least a}} phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the Zodiac, comets could appear in any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Instead, he described comets as a phenomenon of the upper atmosphere, where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also meteors, the aurora borealis, and even the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|A few later {{classical}} philosophers did dispute {{this view}} of comets. Seneca the Younger, in his Natural Questions, observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than atmospheric phenomena. While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw no reason that a planet-like object could not move through any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, {{and it was not}} until the 16th century that Tycho Brahe demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere by measuring the parallax of the Great Comet of 1577 from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.|$|E

40|$|The recent WMAP {{data have}} {{confirmed}} that exotic dark matter together with the vacuum energy (cosmological constant) dominate in the flat Universe. Modern particle theories naturally provide viable cold dark matter candidates with masses in the GeV-TeV region. Supersymmetry provides the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), theories in extra dimensions supply the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) etc. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> dark matter can only be unraveled only by its direct detection in the laboratory. All such candidates will be called WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). In any case the direct dark matter search, which amounts to detecting the recoiling nucleus, following its collision with WIMP, is central to particle physics and cosmology. In this work we briefly review the theoretical elements relevant to the direct dark matter detection experiments, paying particular attention to directional experiments. i. e experiments in which, not only the energy but <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recoiling nucleus is observed. Since <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> observation is fixed with respect the the earth, while the Earth is rotating around its axes, the directional experiment will sample different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> at different times during the day.

2500|$|The {{greatest}} challenge is {{the sheer size}} of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire visible universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory, Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. [...] A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a narrow range of frequencies, or directed at a specific <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds {{to tens of thousands of}} light-years distance.. Indeed, at that unique time, the Sun will appear to the receptors to be by far the brightest star of the Milky Way." [...] However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} in England {{the news}} of Le Verrier's June prediction, George Airy immediately recognized the similarity of Le Verrier's and Adams' solutions.

At a July 1846 meeting of the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Observatory, with Challis and Sir John Herschel present, Airy suggested that Challis urgently look for the planet with the Cambridge 11.25inch equatorial telescope, [...] "in the hope of rescuing the matter from a state which is ... almost desperate". [...] The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July. Adams continued to work on the problem, providing the British team with six solutions in 1845 and 1846 [...] which sent Challis searching the wrong <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Only after the discovery of Neptune had been announced in Paris and Berlin did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on August 8 and August 12 but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map, it was not recognized as a planet.|$|E
