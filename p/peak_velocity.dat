Winds estimated at 260km/h (161mph) battered Ulithi, reportedly destroying every structure {{except for the}} concrete coast guard station.

An anemometer on the coast guard station measured a <b>peak</b> <b>velocity</b> of however, later analysis of the device revealed that it was broken and revolving slower than it should.

Natives sought refuge in these structures and in many instances were forced to abandon them as they fell apart during the storm.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the saccadic system {{presents}} multiple asymmetries. Notably, saccadic <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> are higher for temporal saccades, for centripetal saccades and for the abducting eye. However, we have shown that eye dominance strength influences the naso-temporal asymmetry (Vergilino-Perez et al., 2012) : while participants with weak eye dominance exhibit the classical naso-temporal asymmetry, participants with strong eye dominance exhibit higher <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> for a given saccade direction whichever the recorded eye. The current study tests the robustness of this classification by varying eye departure position, involving centrifugal and centripetal saccades, and by comparing saccades made by the abducting eye and the adducting one. Preliminary analyses on saccadic <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> indicate that our classification of eye dominance strength is found whichever the eye departure position. More precisely, participants with weak eye dominance exhibit all the classical asymmetries whichever the eye departure position, in contrast to participants with strong eye dominance that exhibit only the centripetal-centrifugal asymmetry. These results show (1) the robustness of our classification of participants based on eye dominance strength with analyses of saccadic <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> and suggest (2) that a strong eye dominance overrides the classical naso-temporal and abducting-adducting asymmetries...|$|R

In this study, a new laboratory blast technique has been presented for reducing the <b>peak</b> particle <b>velocity</b> formed by vibrational waves occurring {{as a result of}} the blast. Two different experiments were carried out in the laboratory. In the first experiment, three <b>peak</b> particle <b>velocities</b> were measured normally.

40|$|Background. Adaptation {{models of}} the {{horizontal}} disparity vergence system assume a non-adaptable transient component. They also predict identical post-adaptation dynamics during convergence and divergence movements. Method. To test the adaptation property of the transient component, a set of experiments are performed in which closed-loop vergence dynamics measured before and after sustained convergence are compared, primarily by comparing the <b>peak</b> vergence <b>velocity,</b> occurrence time of <b>peak</b> vergence <b>velocity</b> and steady-state vergence posture. Vergence dynamics after durations of 30, 60 and 90 secs of sustained convergence are compared to those after a control duration of 5 sec. Results. The <b>peak</b> divergence <b>velocity</b> is reduced by about 25 % within 30 secs of sustained vergence. However, the <b>peak</b> convergence <b>velocity</b> is unchanged for all the exposure durations. Additionally, for all durations, the <b>peak</b> divergence <b>velocity</b> is significantly higher than <b>peak</b> convergence <b>velocity.</b> In contrast to <b>peak</b> <b>velocities,</b> the occurrence time of peak convergence and divergence velocity {{did not differ significantly}} and remained unchanged for all durations. Conclusions. It is shown that the transient component is adaptable. Furthermore, the adaptation is direction dependent and affects divergence and convergence dynamics differently, thereby suggesting involvement of separate pathways for convergence and divergence in the vergence sensorimotor control...|$|R

40|$|After coarctectomy, local loss of distensibility {{is noted}} in {{addition}} to mild anatomic narrowing. We hypothesize that the increased Doppler <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> measured at the aortic isthmus in these patients partly reflect obstruction secondary to the stiff surgical scar. The hypothesis was studied in a pulsatile hydraulic model. Thirty-one patients (13. 0 +/- 4. 0 years of age), 10. 5 +/- 4. 7 years after coarctectomy by end-to-end anastomosis, were studied clinically and echocardiographically. Indexes of distensibility were calculated. The effect of isolated increased stiffness was studied in vitro with a stiff and a com pliant 1 : 1 scale latex model of the aorta mounted in a pulsatile full-scale circulation loop. Local stiffening was obtained by a rigid ring mounted around the aorta, fitted to the dimension of the unloaded aorta. For different pressure and flow regimens, pressures and Doppler velocities were measured across the ring. Mean <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> at the surgical scar were 2. 2 +/- 0. 4 m/s. Mild anatomic stenosis was present. All distensibility indexes indicated locally increased stiffness (P <. 001). In the stiff latex model, Doppler <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> increased from 1. 89 +/- 0. 04 m/s to 2. 32 +/- 0. 06 m/s (P <. 03); in the compliant model, from 1. 15 +/- 0. 03 m/s to 1. 79 +/- 0. 05 m/s (P <. 001). The increase of Doppler <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> depends on model compliance only and is independent of now rate, length of the noncompliant segment, and viscosity of the perfusion fluid. Velocities do not change when semicircular stiffening is applied. We have demonstrated in vitro that isolated local nondistensibility leads to vessel narrowing during vascular distension. The relative contribution of local scar stiffness in the increase of Doppler <b>peak</b> <b>velocities</b> after coarctectomy was hereby assessed...|$|R

LAA function is typically assessed by measurements of LAA emptying velocities using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in clinical routine. This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of assessing LAA emptying by velocity encoded (VENC) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods This study included 30 patients with sinus rhythm (n[*]=[*] 18) or atrial fibrillation (n[*]=[*] 12). VENC-CMR velocity measurements were performed perpendicular to the orifice of the LAA. <b>Peak</b> <b>velocities</b> were measured of passive diastolic LAA emptying (e-wave) in all patients. <b>Peak</b> <b>velocities</b> of active, late-diastolic LAA emptying (a-wave) were assessed in patients with sinus rhythm.
