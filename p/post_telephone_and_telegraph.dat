50|$|Originally a {{division}} of the Ministry of <b>Post,</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph,</b> what would become the ETC was established as the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE) by proclamation No. 131/52 in 1952. Under the Derg Regime, the IBTE was reorganized as the Ethiopian Telecommunications Service on October 1975, which was in turn reorganized on January 1981 as the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority. On November 1996, the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority became ETC by Council of Ministers regulation No. 10/1996. The subsequent Proclamation 49/1996 expanded the ETC's duties and responsibilities. For its international traffic links and communication services, ETC mainly uses its earth station at Sululta which transmits and receives to both Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean satellites.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{began in}} early morning of June 22, 1941, {{the first day}} of the war. The main forces of the LAF were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10am LAF held a meeting in Žaliakalnis, dividing the responsibilities. It was decided that the main goal is not to fight with the Russians, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, <b>post</b> office, <b>telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>telegraph,</b> radio station <b>and</b> radiophone. Control of the telephone allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes. The radio station was sabotaged by the Russians, therefore repair works were carried out during the night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students, driving an ambulance. Despite fears of inadequate Lithuanian forces guarding the radio, in the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the Provisional Government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.|$|R

50|$|In year 1903 Ghijsels {{studied at}} the polytechnic in Delft, where some of his fellow {{students}} included several future East Indies architects, Thomas Karsten and Henri Maclaine Pont among them. After his academic study in 1909, his first appointment was as a government architectural supervisor in Amsterdam under the firm of GA van Arkel (1910). In the same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Antonia de Regt in Rotterdam. By the end of September 1910, Ghijsels was accepted for the post of engineer by the Department of Municipal Works in Batavia, so {{he returned to the}} Dutch East Indies. From 1913, he worked for the Department of Civil Works (Burgerlijke Openbare Werken (BOW)), as well as becoming a freelance architect. Between 1913 and 1915, he designed the three-storeyed <b>Post,</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph</b> office building (Post-, Telegrafie- en Telefoonkantoor (PTT)) in Surabaya, now Gedung Telkom; the building was one of the pioneers of modern architecture in Surabaya. He also designed the <b>Post,</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Office {{on the site of the}} 1914 Colonial Exhibition in Semarang. In the same year, Ghijsels designed the Petamboeran hospital for the Royal Packet Company (Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij (KPM)) in Batavia, now Pelni Petamburan hospital Jakarta. KPM also commissioned Ghijsels to design the headquarters for the KPM, which led to the formation of the private architectural consultant AIA (Algemeen Ingenieurs- en Architectenbureau), together with architect H. von Essen and contractor F. Stoltz. The AIA was considered one of the biggest architecture consultant in the Dutch East Indies, with a building contractor. The agency expanded in 1927 with an office in Surabaya. In 1932, AIA bureau created an associate with another office in Bandung, led by architect FW Brinkman and GH Voorhoeve.|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1987, {{telecommunication}} in New Zealand {{was provided}} by a government owned monopoly—a traditional Ministry of <b>Post,</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph.</b> On 1 April 1987 —largely because of a sagging economy—the government corporatized telecommunica-tion, creating Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Ltd. (Telecom). Since 1 April 1989, open competition has been permitted in the telecommunication industry; regulation has been only by general anti-trust law. On 1 September 1990 —this time, {{as part of a}} campaign to retire a significant portion of New Zealand’s national debt—the government sold Telecom to a consor-tium of companies (from the United States and New Zealand). This paper examines the state of competition in New Zealand’s telecommunication industry. It concludes that, although competition is free by law, the telecommunication mar-ket is neither truly competitive nor truly contestable; it is, therefore, unsurprising that Tele-com (the dominant provider) continues to use its dominance to hinder competition. The paper deals in some detail with the issue of interconnection between the incumbent and com-petitive entrants—the abuse of {{which is one of the}} major ways that a dominant provider can limit competition without appearing to do so. 1...|$|E
40|$|Governments started {{regulating}} the telecommunications industry, firstly, because the governments {{thought that the}} industry possessed the characteristics of what is generally known as 'natural monopoly' and, secondly, to protect the users of telephone services from potential abuses {{that are associated with}} the monopoly power. The governmental intervention went so far that, with the exception of few countries, virtually everywhere in the world telecommunications services were provided by the government departments of <b>Post</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph</b> (PTT). However, with the technological advances made in the telecommunications industry, the industry can no longer be characterized as 'natural monopoly,' and, therefore, the primary rationale for regulating telecommunications industry is undermined. Despite the technological advancements and the move to deregulate telecommunications industry prevalent elsewhere in the world, some developing countries are adamant in maintaining their monopoly over the provision of telecommunications services. What was regulated to protect the consumers against the monopoly abuses is now regulated to extract monopoly profits from the consumers. This paper adopts the premise that whether governments regulate an industry, or deregulate it, or introduce competition in it, they should strictly adhere to the objective of governmental intervention, that is, consumer welfare...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 1, we {{construct}} {{a model to}} illustrate conditions under which a government controlled <b>Post,</b> <b>Telephone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Telegraph</b> ministry (PTT), which is a monopolist in multiple demand-complementary markets, can increase its profit by exiting some of its markets. The PTT may increase profit by exiting one market, provided that a foreign firm can supply the market at lower cost and the PTT retains market power in a complementary market, where it recovers the difference. The PTT will generally earn greater income by regulating and taxing the abandoned market than by allowing it to become competitive. However, consumer welfare would be greater if the PTT were to permit competition in the abandoned market. In Chapter 2, we use Heckman's model for consistent estimation on selected data, modified to allow for group dummies in the second-stage regression, to estimate supply of wireless telephone subscription, on a panel of data. The modification enables us to control for country-specific effects, and to adjust for the penetration that would otherwise exist in years and countries where wireless is unavailable. We find substantial bias in the estimate of the supply function. That is, equivalent economic conditions in countries where wireless is not yet available will likely result in lower levels of supply than those where wireless is available. The quantity of wireless telephones supplied is explained by time, the number of existing fixed telephone lines, and telephone company revenues, but not by prices. In Chapter 3, we {{construct a}} means of resource allocation on a data network when bandwidth becomes scarce. Our approach extends Elwalid and Mitra's (1992) model so that two users may send streams of information to a router, which employs an auction mechanism to award priority to one stream when the router is congested. The high bidder in this auction enjoys the right to transmit data without risk of loss, whereas the low bidder loses data during congested periods. The second-price auction offers its property of incentive compatibility in this real-time framework. Allocations arising from this mechanism are more economically efficient than those in which information is discarded without regard to economic value...|$|E
