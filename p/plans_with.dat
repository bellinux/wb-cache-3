40|$|The {{interleaving}} of <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> execution {{is a basic}} {{approach to}} <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information. This paper investigates {{the use of this}} approach in stationary environments. We first define a computational framework where this approach can be investigated. We then show how the interleaving of <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> execution can be used for reducing <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information to <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> complete information and constraint satisfaction. In addition, we show a restriction on our model where this reduction yields a polynomial procedure for <b>planning</b> <b>with</b> incomplete information. Finally, we discuss belief-based conditional planning; an approach which bridges part of the gap between planning while executing and general conditional planning. 1 Introduction Consider a robot in a maze. The robot is initially located in the entrance point of the maze, while its objective is to reach the exit point. The robot can move along the walls of the maze and can assume its movements won' [...] ...|$|R

Several factors emerged as consistent cross-sectional predictors of these components (work satisfaction, hours worked before commencing maternity leave, anticipated weeks of maternity leave and anticipated hours per week on the return to work).

That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal that would limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

Eight days later they were received by the Turkish military commander Rauf Orbay at the Persian town of Krynd. Leaving Krynd, the party reached Turkish-occupied Kermanshah on 14 June 1915. Some members were sick with malaria and other tropical diseases. Leaving them under the care of Dr. Becker, von Hentig proceeded towards Tehran to decide on the subsequent <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> Prince Heinrich Reuss and Niedermayer.|$|E

Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E

5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E

5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment <b>plans,</b> <b>with</b> every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up <b>plans</b> <b>with</b> the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E
