40|$|Service is the {{procedure}} {{by which a}} plaintiff informs a defendant of the claim being made against them. Personal service {{is the foundation of}} jurisdiction and is required for originating proceedings. It is also an essential requirement of natural justice. Ordinary service has less stringent requirements than personal service and is sufficient fo rinterlocutory proceedings. Special service rules have developed for certain types of parties, such as corporations and those <b>parties</b> <b>under</b> a <b>disability.</b> Special rules exist in relation to certain types of actions — for example, motor vehicle personal injury actions. Technical service rules have also developed for service out of the jurisdiction, both within and outside the Commonwealth of Australia. Where a plaintiff experiences difficulties in serving a defendant, the plaintiff may seek an order for substituted service, provided the method proposed is likely to bring the proceedingto the attention of the defendant...|$|R
