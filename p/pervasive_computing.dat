2500|$|Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has {{referred}} to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”. The lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”. A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics. According to Lonergan, the term IoT was coined before smart phones, tablets, and devices {{as we know them}} today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE), industrial Internet, <b>pervasive</b> <b>computing,</b> pervasive sensing, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart objects, cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M), ambient intelligence (AmI), operational technology (OT), and information technology (IT). Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task Group has created a [...] "common and reusable vocabulary of terms" [...] to ensure [...] "consistent terminology" [...] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711 IoT-related terms, however, without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pervasive</b> social <b>computing</b> is a {{promising}} approach {{that promises to}} empower both {{the individual and the}} whole and thus candidates itself as a foundation to the "smarter" social organizations that our new turbulent and resource-scarce worlds so urgently requires. In this contribution we first identify those that we consider as the major requirements to be fulfilled in order to realize an effective <b>pervasive</b> social <b>computing</b> infrastructure. We then conjecture that our service-oriented community and fractal social organization fulfill those requirements and therefore constitute an effective strategy to design <b>pervasive</b> social <b>computing</b> infrastructures. In order to motivate our conjecture, in this paper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss fractal social organization as a referral service empowering a social system's parts and whole.

40|$|The {{technological}} role of handheld devices {{is fundamentally}} changing. Portable computers were traditionally application specific. They were designed and optimised {{to deliver a}} specific task. However, it is now commonly acknowledged that future handheld devices need to be multi-functional {{and need to be}} capable of executing a range of high-performance applications. This thesis has coined the term <b>pervasive</b> handheld <b>computing</b> systems to refer to this type of mobile device. Portable computers are faced with a number of constraints in trying to meet these objectives. They are physically constrained by their size, their computational power, their memory resources, their power usage, and their networking ability. These constraints challenge <b>pervasive</b> handheld <b>computing</b> systems in achieving their multi-functional and high-performance requirements. This thesis proposes a two-pronged methodology to enable <b>pervasive</b> handheld <b>computing</b> systems meet their future objectives. The methodology is a fusion of two independent and yet complementary concepts. The first step utilises reconfigurable technology to enhance the physical hardware resources within the environment of a handheld device. This approach recognises that reconfigurable computing has the potential to dynamically increase the system functionality and versatility of a handheld device without major loss in performance. The second step of the methodology incorporates agent-based middleware protocols to support handheld devices to effectively manage and utilise these reconfigurable hardware resources within their environment. The thesis asserts the combined characteristics of reconfigurable computing and agent technology can meet the objectives of <b>pervasive</b> handheld <b>computing</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—There is a {{multitude}} of systems {{in the area of}} mo-bile and <b>pervasive</b> social <b>computing</b> providing and using social context for pervasive interaction between persons. Currently, it is hard to distinguish the different approaches as there is no appropriate taxonomy available yet. In this paper we introduce the STIP taxonomy to define social context in the area of social computing and further propose to use the term Situated Social Context for a more focused subset of social context for <b>pervasive</b> social <b>computing.</b> We elaborate the taxonomy with a small survey of mobile social networking systems and discuss future research challenges.

5000|$|In {{his book}} The Rise of the Network Society, Manuel Castells {{suggests}} that there is an ongoing shift from already-decentralised, stand-alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely <b>pervasive</b> <b>computing.</b> In his model of a <b>pervasive</b> <b>computing</b> system, Castells uses the example of the Internet as the start of a <b>pervasive</b> <b>computing</b> system. The logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity, in every location and every context. Castells envisages a system where billions of miniature, ubiquitous inter-communication devices will be spread worldwide, [...] "like pigment in the wall paint".|$|E
