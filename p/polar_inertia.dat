Production continued until 1936 {{during which time}} sports and touring models were available. In 1931 the DKW F1 from Germany made its debut. Buckminster Fuller adopted rear-engine, front wheel drive for his three Dymaxion Car prototypes. Other German car producers followed: Stoewer offered a car with front-wheel drive in 1931, Adler in 1932 and Audi in 1933. In 1934, the very successful Traction Avant cars were introduced by Citroën of France. The Cord 810 of the United States managed a bit better in the late 1930s than its predecessor one decade earlier.

50|$|In {{automotive}} design, a RMR or Rear Mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (now simply {{known as}} MR or Mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) {{is one in}} which the rear wheels are driven by an engine placed just in front of them, behind the passenger compartment. In contrast to the rear-engined RR layout, the center of mass of the engine is in front of the rear axle. This layout is typically chosen for its low moment of inertia and relatively favorable weight distribution (the heaviest component is {{near the center of the}} car, making the main component of its moment of inertia relatively low). The layout has a tendency toward being heavier in the rear than the front, which allows for best balance to be achieved under braking. However, since there is little weight over the front wheels, under acceleration, the front of the car is prone to lift and cause understeer. Most rear-engine layouts have historically been used in smaller vehicles, because the weight of the engine at the rear has an adverse effect on a larger car's handling, making it 'tail-heavy'. It is felt that the low <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> is crucial in selection of this layout. The mid-engined layout also uses up central space, making it impractical for any but two-seater sports cars. However, some microvans use this layout, with a small, low engine beneath the loading area. This makes it possible to move the driver right to the front of the vehicle, thus increasing the loading area at the expense of slightly reduced load depth.|$|E
40|$|The rotordynamic {{behavior}} of a hydraulic turbine is influenced by fluid-rotor interactions at the turbine runner. In this paper computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) are used to numerically predict the torsional dynamic coefficients due to added <b>polar</b> <b>inertia,</b> damping, and stiffness of a Kaplan turbine runner. The simulations are carried out for three operating conditions, one at about 35 % load, one at about 60 % load (near best efficiency), and one at about 70 % load. The runner rotational speed is perturbed with a sinusoidal function with different frequencies in order to estimate the coefficients of added <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> and damping. It is shown that the added coefficients are dependent of the load and the oscillation frequency of the runner. This affect the system’s eigenfrequencies and damping. The eigenfrequency is reduced with up to 65 % compared to the eigenfrequency of the mechanical system without the fluid interaction. The contribution to the damping ratio varies between 30 – 80 % depending on the load. Hence, {{it is important to}} consider these added coefficients while carrying out dynamic analysis of the mechanical system. Copyright © 2009 Martin Karlsson et al.

40|$|Abstract] Simulating {{internal}} airflow conditions within {{turbine blade}} internal cooling passages {{can be an}} effective tool {{to gain a better understanding}} of the interaction between angular velocity, operating temperatures, coolant effectiveness, etc. In the current research, a next generation heat rig capable of achieving 10, 000 RPM was designed and fabricated to simulate the high temperature and angular velocity histories of turbine blades. The first phase of the design consists of a tubular shaft specimen aligned with the axis of rotation that allows for coolant to be internally passed. The heat pipe is externally heated with NiCr resistive wire, and the rotation of the shaft is facilitated by a digitally-controlled motor. In order to overcome the design challenges of this system, many of the obstacles concerning mechanical strength, rotordynamics and thermal control were encountered. Developing life estimates, carrying out modal analysis to guard against low critical speeds, implementing accurate temperature control, and so on, were important considerations. Preliminary experiments were carried out on the device to determine the performance of the system.

40|$|The {{rotational}} behaviour of a stratified visco-elastic planet submitted {{to changes in}} its inertia tensor is studied in a viscous quasi-fluid approximation. This approxima-tion allows for large displacements of the Earth rotation axis {{with respect to the}} entire mantle but is only valid for mass redistribution within the planet occurring on the time scale of a few million years. Such a motion, called true polar wander (TPW), is detected by palaeomagneticiens assuming that the Earth's magnetic field remains on average aligned with the spin axis. Our model shows that a downgoing cold slab induces a TPW which quickly brings this slab to the pole for a mantle of uniform viscosity. The same slab is slowly moved toward the equator when a large viscosity increase with depth takes place in the mantle. Our model is also suitable to investigate the effects of a non-steady-state convection on the Earth's rotation. We discuss these effects using a simple mass redistribution model inspired by the pioneering paper of Goldreich & Toomre (1969). It consists of studying the TPW induced by a random distribution of slabs sinking into the mantle. For such a mass redistribution, only a strongly stratified mantle can reduce the Earth's pole velocity below l"Ma-', which is the upper bound value observed by palaeomagnetic investigations for the last 200 Ma. Our model also shows that when corrected for the hydrostatic flattening, the Earth's <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> generally corresponds to the maximum inertia, as it is presently observed.

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the bearing pedestals and motor base. As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete amortisseur. On startup, currents are induced in the rotor pole face, which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the rotor pole face will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{objective}} is to develop rotordynamical models of hydropower units, where coupling between mechanical, electromagnetic and fluid dynamical system systems is of certain interest. Both fluid-rotor and electromechanical interactions are known to change the system coefficients of the rotor system, which affects eigenfrequencies, damping, stability and response. In addition, external forces from the magnetic field and the hydraulic system can excite the rotor system. Both system coefficients and external excitations are important considerations during design and operation of a hydropower unit, in order to obtain reliable design and operations. Hydropower rotor systems differ from other rotating systems because they rotate with comparably low rotational speed and the total mass of the rotor system is high. The relative airgap in the generator is small compared to a turbo generator, which results in larger electromagnetic forces. Detailed electromechanical force models of large synchronous generators are a missing part of the scientific literature and there is an industrial need for better models. When including hydraulic forces in a rotordynamical model of a hydropower system, industrial rules of thumb are normally used. Hence, {{there is a need for}} better multi-physical models in rotordynamical models of hydropower rotor systems. The electromechanical model of synchronous generators for hydropower has been developed, from only considering radial electromagnetic forces to considering both radial and tangential force. The latter is induced due to a change in the magnetic field when the rotor is in an eccentric position, which induces current in the damper winding of the rotor and changes the magnitude and direction of the electromagnetic force. The current in the damper winding is dependent on whirling, eccentricity and change of eccentricity; hence, the electromagnetic forces are significantly dependent on the motion of the rotor. The electromagnetic forces are implemented as stiffness and damping matrices in the mechanical model, leading to significant changes in the system's eigenfrequency and damping. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to analyse fluid forces and moments acting on the turbine runner. Since rotordynamical analysis is normally carried out for a small model during a long simulation time and CFD-models normally has a large degree of freedom, it is of certain interest to develop models that are computationally efficient. The influence of the details on the upstream flow in the inlet boundary conditions have been analysed in order to obtain computationally efficient boundary conditions. It is shown that the obtained forces and moments increase from an insignificant size for a boundary condition with a perfectly distributed inlet flow to a significant size for a boundary condition, based on more information from the upstream domain. CFD has also been used to determine torsional system coefficients, such as added <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> and damping, due to the flow through a hydraulic turbine. It is shown that these coefficients have a significant effect and that it decreases the eigenfrequency and increases the damping ratio of the mechanical system. In addition to the numerical work, two different approaches to identify sources of excitations and the system's eigenfrequencies at industrial units have been suggested. The first approach uses a simplified mathematical model for the electromagnetic forces that occur due to shape deviations in the airgap of the generator, together with an assumption of the frequency content of the fluid forces on the turbine runner. The calculated frequency content at the bearings is compared with on-site measurements and an idea of the possible sources of vibrations is given. The other approach uses the changes in electromagnetic forces at a sudden loss of the magnetic field in the generator to excite the system's eigenfrequencies. It is shown that a few of the eigenfrequencies can be identified with this method. However, when the torque of the generator suddenly decreases due to the loss of magnetic field, the control system of the turbine decreases the mass flow through the turbine, leading to more separations of the flow and a broad-banded excitation that perturbs the measurements. The general conclusion of this thesis states the importance of including multi-physical interactions in a rotordynamical model for analysis of design and operation. It is further concluded that the electromagnetic forces of a synchronous generator show similar characteristics to the ones presented for asynchronous generators with both radial and tangential components, and not only a radial force component as earlier research stated. The damper winding for an asynchronous whirling acts as a damper for all the motion simulated in this thesis, since as the whirling deviates from syncronous whirl, the currents in the damper winding will change and induce a force that dampens the motion. The boundary conditions of a CFD- model of a hydraulic turbine have a large effect on the obtained resulting rotordynamical forces and moments. Hence, it is important to consider accurate inlet boundary conditions in a CFD-model for calculation of rotordynamical forces and moments. The added <b>polar</b> <b>inertia</b> and damping due to the flow through the turbine in a torsional dynamic model have a large effect on the system characteristics of the torsional system, which is an important consideration. The suggested methods for on-site measurements are concluded to be useful. However, they require a better modelling of both the electromagnetic forces (especially the model of shape deviations of the generator airgap) and the fluid-rotor interactions (especially at part discharge and transient operation). There are still several topics concerning rotordynamics in hydropower units that are of interest for further research; for example, continuing development of fluid-rotor interactions of hydraulic turbines and electromagnetic forces. Further research regarding accurate modelling of vertical bearings, as well as models for transient analysis of the whole system, are also suggested. Målet med denna avhandling är att utveckla modeller för multifysikaliska interaktioner för rotordynamiska interaktioner i vattenkraftaggregat. Av speciellt intresse är kopplingen mellan det mekaniska systemet och det elektromagnetiska systemet i generatorn, samt det strömningsmekaniska systemet i turbinen. Såväl elektromekaniska som strömning-rotor interaktioner är kända att påverka systemets karaktäristik, så som egenfrekvenser, dämpning, stabilitet och respons. Utöver detta, kan krafter från det hydrauliska systemet och elektromekaniska systemet excitera rotorsystemet. Såväl excitationer som förändring av systemegenskaper är viktiga att analysera i en rotodynamisk modell för vattenkraftaggregat. Den stora skillnaden mellan vattenkraftaggregat och andra roterande system är att vattenkraft roterar förhållandevis långsamt och har hög massa och tröghet. I generatorer är luftgapet relativt litet, i förhållande till en turbogenerator, vilket leder till stora elektromagnetiska krafter. Detaljerade kraftmodeller för stora synkrongeneratorer saknas fortfarande i den vetenskapliga litteraturen. När hydrauliska krafter inkluderas i en rotordynamisk modell för ett vattenkraftaggregat, används idag industriella tumregler.
