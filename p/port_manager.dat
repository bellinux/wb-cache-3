40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the competition among ports. In particular we study the relation between port characteristics and port market share of maritime traffic. Maritime carriers make two primary decisions that affect ports. In the long-term, they assign vessels to routes. In the short-term, they assign each shipment to a vessel and, with that vessel, a port. In this research, we assume that vessel schedules are fixed and model the assignment of shipments {{as a function of the}} attributes that describe each port. For a carrier, some assignments are simpler than other assignments. Each assignment should, however, take into account the same criteria. We begin by examining the scheduling of vessels for its effect on the assignment of shipments. We measure the impact of being a vessel's first or last port of call on a port's market share, and we discuss factors that might influence these schedules. We then examine the assignment to ports for exports of various commodity types as a function of geographic location (oceanic and inland distances), port characteristics (vessel capacity and port charges), and characteristics of vessel schedules (frequency and the order ofvisits). We use a multinomial choice model to analyze port choice. We find that the most significant factors are the geographic factors, which are beyond port control. The factors that ports can influence directly appear to be of far less significance. We also find that the choice processes vary with commodity type as well as carrier. The decisions are also found to differ between local and discretionary cargo. Our findings could affect decisions made by <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> as well as carriers or shippers. With the recognition of geographic advantages, <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> could focus marketing more effectively. Recognizing the impact of each carrier's schedules, they could suggest changes to carriers presently visiting the port or recruit new carriers to use present facilities more efficiently. <b>Port</b> <b>managers</b> could also evaluate more effectively investments designed to increase market share. Facilities or technologies could be incremented with a more accurate vision of future traffic levels at individual ports. ...|$|R
40|$|Regional ports {{adjacent}} to capital city ports have often developed as bulk ports (Hilling and Hoyle 1984), {{but for most}} there is a recognition {{that they may be}} no longer able to rely solely on the benefits of exploiting bulk commodities and trades to sustain competitive advantage and growth. To attain growth and survival there is the perception and often the reality that they need to diversify their trade base or/and enter new markets - most of which are likely to be dominated by their capital city ports. But challenging the market dominance of established capital city ports is likely to be very difficult, especially given the rationalisation of shipping networks and the restructuring of supply chains at few suitable ports - most of which in Australia are likely to be capital city ports. How will regional ports which are in the shadow of capital city ports and constantly face significant economic and competitive penalty manage to compete for growth and survival? How will regional ports manage to grow if the nature and scale of trades in their markets are severely restricted as commercial activities, mainly high-value container trades, are concentrated in the larger established capital city ports - even when there is a recognition that some container trades could be handled economically and cost-effectively in regional ports? Simple observation of the economic health of many regional ports, often ill-devised and/or poorly implemented strategies set in place by regional <b>port</b> <b>managers,</b> and of unclear and less-than-adequate conceptual frameworks for the mechanisms of port growth as set out in the literature all suggest that there is 'strategy decay' (Hamel 2002) and the need for a clear understanding of port growth, and particularly of the dynamics and mechanisms of port growth for regional ports in the shadow of their capital city ports. This study seeks to define the basis of and the mechanisms for regional port growth. The study identifies opportunity capture as the basis for defining effective growth strategies for a regional port; and argues that competition for opportunity share rather than competition for market share is the key for regional port growth. The study offers a theoretical framework which regional <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> can use to effectively capture and increase the share of valuable opportunities in the quest for growth; and empirically investigates the perceptions of regional <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> about effective growth strategies for regional ports. A detailed review of the relevant literature revealed a considerable range of factors and conditions underlying port growth; but to our knowledge, there has been no analytical testing of the proposition that opportunity capture is the appropriate mechanism for regional port growth nor has there been any rigorous attempt to define growth strategies for regional ports that are in the shadow of capital city ports. It was, therefore, necessary to collect data from port specialists in order to gain useful insights into regional port growth strategies and opportunity capture. The qualitative data collected were categorized in relevant dimensions - using content analysis - and then used to develop a more structured and formal Internet-based survey which sought to collect data from a much broader sample of regional <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> with the objective of testing their perceptions about effective regional port growth strategies; and to model opportunity choice - a critical process of opportunity capture. The determinants of opportunity choice were identified with discrete choice modelling which called for a stated choice experiment in order to investigate how regional <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> actually make opportunity selection decisions. Discrete choice modelling as used in this study to model executive judgment at strategic level is novel and constitutes an important departure from more traditional approaches. A major conclusion of the study is that regional ports that have developed in the shadow of their capital city ports have the opportunity for growth if they can capture valuable opportunities over time; and that critical to opportunity capture is entrepreneurship and market-driven strategies that regional <b>port</b> <b>managers</b> can implement and orient to provide shippers and other regional port customers with superior access to markets in which they compete for competitive advantage and market dominance. Superior access to markets is provided through supply chains that are value driven; that is, supply chains that are integrated and focus on the end-to-end, cost-effective movement of freight. Such supply chains seek to deliver competitive advantage or value to shippers and to capture value for the port...|$|R

40|$|Container port is {{one special}} type of port {{that serves the}} {{shipping}} logistics that have been packaged in a container. The existence of the port, in particular, a container port, {{is very important for}} economic development in the region, even to the country. There are three main components in the framework of the process of stevedoring that should be kept interactions, namely: input, process, and output. In a container port, input is the arrival of container ships and the arrival container itself. The input process {{is in the form of}} services to ships and process of container stevedoring. While the output is the number of containers transported. The process of container stevedoring has an indicator that serves to measure productivity as well as indicators of container service quality. In general, the service quality of container is measured to know how long the process of stevedoring is carried out. Faster implementation of stevedoring will make the shipping part be more satisfied. The performance of the port operators and also stevedoring equipment is a major factor in the process of stevedoring. Unloading operations prioritize operator working position because of the speed of stevedoring cranes (stevedoring equipment) entirely within the control of the operator. With the burden and risk of heavy work, the operator is required to always optimally and minimize errors in each job. PT XYZ is a world-class container terminal company in cooperation with an international <b>port</b> <b>manager.</b> The container terminal is a major project of Indonesia Port Corporation (IPC II) to realize the construction of an international port in Indonesia. Equipped with a capacity of 4. 5 million TEUs, (twenty-foot equivalent unit) to enable the Triple E class container ships passing through Indonesia without transshipment at other ports. Until now Triple-E ship is the largest class of container ships with a carrying capacity of up to 12, 000 - 15, 000 TEUs. Amenities of existing port terminal at the Port of Tanjung Priok only serve vessels with a maximum capacity of 6, 000 TEUs, while the growing trend of the use of container ships in the world to use vessels with a capacity of > 10, 000 TEUs in order to reduce logistics costs per TEU, so as to serve aboard Direct Call with large size must be prepared adequate facilities. Due to the high activity of stevedoring hence careful planning is needed through three operational experiments (simulation) of stevedoring at PT XYZ before operational execution begins officially. The study used the quantitative approach with descriptive and comparative design. Total sample obtained was as many as 15 operators. Data processing technique included sign test, ANOVA test, interviews with respondents and cross tab to obtain the condition of respondent (operator) characteristics in relation to the impact of loading and unloading operations experiment perceived by respondent (operator). Based on the objectives, this study succeeded in analyzing differences from the three trials of loading and unloading operations conducted at PT XYZ. There is significant difference found among the three trials performed. The average box obtained was only 11 boxes per hour in May, 17 boxes per hour in July and 20 boxes per hour in August. However, the average number of the box per hour was still below the target set by the company those were 27 - 30 boxes per hour. Whereas PT XYZ has been using the system on the loading and unloading process, the Terminal Operating System, called COSMOS. This result contradicted the expected finding since by implementing the system, the operator in the field can immediately know the exact location of containers concerning the properties and delivery schedule of the container, thus loading and unloading time will be shorter. Therefore, managerial implication formulated to meet the target set by the company namely performing the further experiment by considering any operational mistakes found in the existing loading and unloading trial and better control on equipment used. Moreover, characteristics of the operator, including age, the level of education and work experience are not needed to be taken into account in the further operational process since the follow-up trial requires considerable training thus operator will be able to control system better...|$|E
