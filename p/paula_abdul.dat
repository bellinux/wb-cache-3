25|$|One notable auditioner {{this season}} was Paula Goodspeed, a fervent fan of <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul,</b> who auditioned in Austin. In 2008, Goodspeed made {{headlines}} when she committed suicide outside Abdul's home. Abdul later claimed {{that she had}} objected beforehand to Goodspeed being at the audition because she knew Goodspeed and had been frightened by her past behavior, but the producers overrode her objection. The producers Ken Warwick and Nigel Lythgoe however denied being aware of her fears or that they would put her in danger.|$|E
25|$|American Idol {{employed}} {{a panel of}} judges who critiqued the contestants' performances. The original judges were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, pop singer and choreographer <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul</b> and music executive and manager Simon Cowell.

25|$|The seventh {{season of}} American Idol, the annual reality show and singing competition, began on January 15, 2008 and {{concluded}} on May 21, 2008. Ryan Seacrest continued {{to host the}} show with Simon Cowell, <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul,</b> and Randy Jackson returning as judges. David Cook was announced {{the winner of the}} competition on May 21, 2008, defeating runner-up David Archuleta by a margin of roughly 12 million votes out of over 97 million, which was at that time the highest recorded vote total ever recorded in the show's history. The split was 56 % to 44 %.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{season of}} reality {{television}} singing competition American Idol began on January 17, 2006, and concluded on May 24, 2006. Randy Jackson, <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul</b> and Simon Cowell returned to judge, and Ryan Seacrest returned to host. It {{is the most}} successful season to date ratings-wise, and resulted in 18 contestants (including all of the top 10 and a few semifinalists) getting record deals – nine of them with major labels. It was the first season with a male winner (Taylor Hicks) and a female runner-up (Katharine McPhee), which happened again in seasons 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15. It {{was also the first}} season of the series to be aired in high definition.|$|E
25|$|After {{the season}} began, <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul</b> {{did not return}} to the judging panel, having {{announced}} in the beginning of August 2009 that she was leaving the show due to unresolved contract negotiations. Victoria Beckham, Mary J. Blige, Shania Twain, Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne, Joe Jonas, Neil Patrick Harris and Kristin Chenoweth were brought in to star as guest judges during the auditions phase. There was no guest judge on day two of the Orlando auditions because day one guest judge Chenoweth was called back to New York City. Therefore, Simon Cowell, Kara DioGuardi and Randy Jackson appeared with only three judges on the audition panel similar to the main panel from the first to the seventh season.|$|E
50|$|This table only {{counts for}} dances {{scored on a}} {{traditional}} 30-points scale (guest judge <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul's</b> scores from Week 4, Kirstie Alley's extra 2 points from the Country-Western group dance from Week 6 and the Swing Marathon dance scores from Week 7 have been removed).|$|R

25|$|On the April 29 show, {{the five}} {{remaining}} contestants each sang two songs. Diverting from their usual format, due to time constraints, the judges' critiques after each performance were instead to be bundled until after both songs were performed. However, {{after the first}} round had finished, host Ryan Seacrest asked for comments, and judge <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul,</b> in discussing Jason Castro, delivered feedback on his second song before he had performed it. This has led to speculation that the show is scripted or rigged. The next day, Abdul claimed on Seacrest's radio show that she listened to the performance in rehearsal and in the rushed atmosphere of the show was confused and thought she was supposed to critique both.|$|E
25|$|The show {{celebrated its}} 100th episode on Tuesday, May 6, 2008, during week 8 of season 6.

New routines were performed by Apolo Anton Ohno and Julianne Hough, Mel B and Maksim Chmerkovskiy, and by Mario Lopez {{with the cast}} of A Chorus Line, {{in which he was}} starring on Broadway. The musical guest was country group Rascal Flatts.|$|E
25|$|Cowell also {{launched}} The X Factor USA in September 2011 on American broadcaster Fox. It {{was originally}} {{announced that he}} would be a judge both on the UK and US editions of the show, which aired at similar times of the year, but MTV officially reported on 17 April 2011 that this was not true: Cowell was no longer to be a judge on the UK version, but would remain a major presence backstage. He was joined by <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul,</b> L.A. Reid, Nicole Scherzinger and formerly Cheryl Cole. Cowell's act Melanie Amaro won the season, making Cowell the winning judge. Cowell and Reid returned for season 2, while Demi Lovato and Britney Spears joined the judging panel as replacements for Abdul and Scherzinger. This season launched another one of Simon's groups into worldwide fame, the group is known as Fifth Harmony.|$|E
5000|$|... "Ain't Never Gonna Give You Up", with Color Me Badd {{providing}} background vocals, is {{the third}} and final single from <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul's</b> album, Head over Heels. The song was written by Bryan Abrams, Curtis [...] "Fitz" [...] Williams, Elliot Wolff, Howie Tee, Kevin Thornton, and Mark Calderon.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Goodspeed {{committed}} suicide via {{a drug overdose}} in her car outside of <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul's</b> home in Sherman Oaks, California. She reportedly sent Abdul flowers prior to her suicide. Goodspeed had been accused in the press of being a celebrity stalker but her relatives disputed the claim.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson, <b>Paula</b> <b>Abdul's</b> name, voice, and likeness appear in this {{title for the}} first time. Ryan Seacrest {{did not return to}} voice himself as the host. He is replaced with a lesser known voice actor Johnny Jay to voice as the host of American Idol for this game.|$|R
