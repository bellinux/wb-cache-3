5|$|On 18 August 1933, Iraqi troops entered Mosul {{where they}} were given an {{enthusiastic}} reception by its Muslim inhabitants. Triumphant arches were erected and decorated with melons <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> daggers, symbolising the heads of murdered Assyrians. The crown prince Ghazi himself came {{to the city to}} award 'victorious' colours to those military and tribal leaders who participated in the massacres and the looting.|$|E

There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|Timber-roofed basilicas, {{which had}} been the {{standard}} form until the 6th century, would be displaced by domed churches from the 9th century on. In the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843 – 1204), domes were normally built to emphasize separate functional spaces, rather than as the modular ceiling units they had been earlier. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Shulaprota (pierced by sharp pointed spear/dart): Some {{people give}} shelter to birds or animals {{pretending to be}} their saviours, but then harass them poking with threads, needles or using them like lifeless toys. Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning their {{confidence}} and then killing them with sharp tridents or lances. The bodies of such sinners, fatigued with hunger and thirst, are <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> sharp, needle-like spears. Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Peter in Staple Fitzpaine was {{originally}} {{built in the}} Norman style, and has a Norman doorway reset in the south aisle. The chancel dates from the 14th century; the north aisle was added and the church refenestrated in the 15th century. The tower dates from about 1500. The south porch and the vestry are much more recent, dating from 1841. The crenellated 3-stage tower, has merlons <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> trefoil headed arches set on a quatrefoil pierced parapet. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns not be used for any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E

5|$|In Greek folklore, vampirism {{could occur}} through various means: being excommunicated, desecrating a {{religious}} day, committing a great crime, or dying alone. Other causes included having a cat jump across one's grave, eating meat from a sheep {{killed by a}} wolf, and being cursed. Vrykolakas were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people, giving rise to many folk tales with this theme. Crosses and antidoron (blessed bread) from the church were used as wards in different places. To prevent vampires from rising from the dead, their hearts were <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> iron nails while resting in their graves, or their bodies burned and the ashes scattered. Because the Church opposed burning people who had received the myron of chrismation in the baptism ritual, cremation was considered a last resort.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century Lady Chapel {{contains}} the stone shrine of SaintWerburgh which {{dates from the}} 14thcentury and which used to contain her relics. The shrine, of similar red sandstone as the cathedral, has a base <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> deep niches. The upper part {{takes the form of}} a miniature chapel containing statuettes. During the dissolution of the monasteries it was dismantled. Some of the parts were found during the 1873 restoration of the cathedral and the shrine was reassembled in 1888 by Blomfield. A carving of StWerburgh by Joseph Pyrz was added in 1993. Also in the chapel are a sedilia and a piscina. The stained glass of 1859, is by William Wailes. The chapel contains a monument to Archdeacon Francis Wrangham, made by Hardman & Co. and dating from 1846. In 1555, George Marsh, Martyr stood trial here accused of heresy.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, {{it was originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the gatehouse is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the gatehouse towers. The gatehouse is {{the only part of}} the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. The ceiling of the passage through the gatehouse into the castle is vaulted and <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E

The courtyard facade (or south facade) of the tower is <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> windows that provide light and ventilation, while the other three facades—facing north, east and west—are <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> small openings {{in the form of}} arrowslits. The minaret, in its present aspect, dates largely from the early ninth century, about 836 AD. It is the oldest minaret in the Muslim world, and it is also the world's oldest minaret still standing.|$|E

25|$|During archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012 {{the remains}} of a skeleton <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that those are {{the remains of}} the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were <b>pierced</b> <b>with</b> either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest {{to make sure that the}} dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.|$|E

50|$|These bugs mainly inhabit fairly arid {{and sandy}} habitat, like seashores, heathland, steppe and savannas. Their main food is seeds, which they <b>pierce</b> <b>with</b> their {{proboscis}} {{to drink the}} nutritious fluids contained within. Some are economically significant pests, for example Leptocorisa oratoria on rice.|$|R
2500|$|<b>With</b> {{cartilage}} <b>piercing,</b> {{the blunt}} force of an ear piercing instrument will traumatize the cartilage, and therefore make healing more difficult. [...] Also, {{because there is}} substantially less blood flow in ear cartilage than in the earlobe, infection {{is a much more}} serious issue. [...] There have been several documented cases of severe infections of the upper ear following <b>piercing</b> <b>with</b> an ear <b>piercing</b> instrument, which required courses of antibiotics to clear up. There are many ways that an infection can occur: the most common way is when the person that got pierced decides to take out the piercing too early. According to the A.M.A, [...] the proper waiting period to change or take out a <b>piercing</b> <b>with</b> substantially less risk of infection would be three weeks.|$|R
