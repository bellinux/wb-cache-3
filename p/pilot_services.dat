40|$|Aims: To explore patients’ and staffs’ {{perceptions}} of a <b>pilot</b> <b>service</b> which dispatched a nurse and paramedic to low-priority ambulance calls. However, Methods: Patients’ opinions of both <b>pilot</b> and standard <b>service</b> groups were obtained through qualitative questionnaire data and individual interviews. Staffs’ perceptions were explored via two focus groups. Questionnaires were sent to {{a convenience sample of}} 128 patients attended by the <b>pilot</b> <b>service</b> and 128 patients receiving the standard service. Initially 19 questionnaire participants agreed to be interviewed. Focus group participants (n = 11) included nurses and paramedics involved in the <b>pilot</b> <b>service.</b> Results: Sixty-four questionnaires were returned and 11 interviews were conducted. Patients receiving the <b>pilot</b> <b>service</b> were enthusiastic about opportunities for care to be provided in their home. Involvement in the <b>pilot</b> <b>service</b> was a positive experience for staff. They felt confident in managing calls effectively because of their combined knowledge and skills, and believed that the quality of patient care had been improved. They also experienced increased job satisfaction and skills development. Conclusion: Both patients and staff expressed positive views about the <b>pilot</b> <b>service.</b> Patients appreciated being treated at home and staff believed that working together provided more appropriate care for patients and enhanced interprofessional development...|$|R
