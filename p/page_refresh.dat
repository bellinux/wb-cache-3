5000|$|In this technique, {{the server}} takes {{advantage}} of persistent HTTP connections, leaving the response perpetually [...] "open" [...] (i.e., the server never terminates the response), effectively fooling the browser to remain in [...] "loading" [...] mode after the initial page load could be considered complete. The server then periodically sends snippets of JavaScript to update {{the content of the}} page, thereby achieving push capability. By using this technique, the client doesn't need Java applets or other plug-ins in order to keep an open connection to the server; the client is automatically notified about new events, pushed by the server. One serious drawback to this method, however, is the lack of control the server has over the browser timing out; a <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> is always necessary if a timeout occurs on the browser end.|$|E

40|$|Web {{applications}} {{facilitated by}} {{technologies such as}} JavaScript, DHTML, AJAX, and Flash use {{a considerable amount of}} dynamic web content that is either inaccessible or unusable by blind people. Server side changes to web content cause whole <b>page</b> <b>refreshes,</b> but only small sections of the page update, causing blind web users to search linearly through the page to find new content. The connecting theme is the need to quickly and unobtrusively identify the segments of a web page that have changed and notify the user of them. In this paper we propose Dynamo, a system designed to unify different types of dynamic content and make dynamic content accessible to blind web users. Dynamo treats web page updates uniformly and its methods encompass both web updates enabled through dynamic content and scripting, and updates resulting from static <b>page</b> <b>refreshes,</b> form submissions, and template-based web sites. From an algorithmic and interaction perspective Dynamo detects underlying changes and provides users with a single and intuitive interface for reviewing the changes that have occurred. We report on the quantitative and qualitative results of an evaluation conducted with blind users. These results suggest that Dynamo makes access to dynamic content faster, and that blind web users like it better than existing interfaces...|$|R

40|$|The query of material's {{properties}} via a grid enabled Web portal plays {{a critical}} role in the MaterialsGrid project within eScience. However, developing a normal standard portlet to query material properties {{is by no means a}} perfect solution. Portal <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> is an expensive action as one portlet refresh can result in the refreshing of other portlets. In order to address this issue in material properties queries, the AJAX technique has been adopted. In this paper, we proposed a development model of using AJAX in a JSR- 168 portlet, and discussed the integration of AJAX into the MaterialsGrid portal for chemical formula search. By using AJAX, users can handle many queries and only apply the updates to the display of table, without requiring a full page to refresh. This can improve query performance and bring a more user-friendly interface. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a Rewriting Logic framework that formalizes {{the interactions between}} Web servers and Web browsers through a communicating protocol abstracting HTTP. The proposed framework includes a scripting language that is powerful enough to model the dynamics of complex Web applications by encompassing the main features {{of the most popular}} Web scripting languages (e. g. PHP, ASP, Java Servlets). We also provide a detailed characterization of browser actions (e. g. forward/backward navigation, <b>page</b> <b>refresh,</b> and new window/tab openings) via rewrite rules, and show how our models can be naturally model-checked by using the Linear Temporal Logic of Rewriting (LTLR), which is a Linear Temporal Logic specifically designed for model-checking rewrite theories. Our formalization is particularly suitable for verification purposes, since it allows one to perform in-depth analyses of many subtle aspects related to Web interaction. Finally, the framework has been completely implemented in Maude, and we report on some successful experiments that we conducted by using the Maude LTLR model-checker. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bioinformatics {{applications}} are generally multi-server dependants {{and will have}} to communicate several information repositories to carry out any analyses. These applications remain computationally intensive and time consum-ing as they engage lots of data transfer. Hence they face a major bottleneck when ported as web applications. Browser based web applications normally feature the classical request-response approach. If the response becomes late, as it is expected to happen in the case of long running Bioinformatics programs, Apache will get tired and a request timeout error might occur. Alternate approaches like “Client-Pull ” models that involve polling strategy with the unpredictable amount of page refreshes, only tend to intensify the network traffi c. Hence a technology that is intelligent enough to support the varied exhaustive Bioinformatics processes becomes highly essential. In this review, we propose how AJAX can afford a laconic framework within the Bioinformatics applications to completely reduce the <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> nuisance and provide a better user experience...|$|E

40|$|Today’s rich Web {{applications}} use {{a mix of}} Java Script and {{asynchronous communication}} with the application server. This mechanism {{is also known as}} Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The intent of Ajax is to exchange small pieces of data between the browser and the application server, and in doing so, use partial <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> instead of reloading the entire Web page. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a powerful Web development model for browser-based Web applications. Technologies that form the AJAX model, such as XML, JavaScript, HTTP, and XHTML, are individually widely used and well known. However, AJAX combines these technologies to let Web pages retrieve small amounts of data from the server without having to reload the entire page. This capability makes Web pages more interactive and lets them behave like local applications. Web 2. 0 enabled by the Ajax architecture has given rise to a new level of user interactivity through web browsers. Many new and extremely popular Web applications have been introduced such as Google Maps, Google Docs, Flickr, and so on. Ajax Toolkits such as Dojo allow web developers to build Web 2. 0 applications quickly and with little effort...|$|E

The intent of Ajax is to exchange small pieces of data between the browser and the application server, and in doing so, use partial <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> instead of reloading the entire Web page. In recent years, information system based on browse/server architecture (namely B/S architecture) received more favor by enterprises. Ajax technology consists of five parts. They are HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), JavaScript, DHTML (Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language), DOM (Document Object Model) and XML (Extensible Markup Language). With the help of cooperation and collaboration of these technologies, they can optimize the conventional enterprise information system by using an asynchronous way. Meanwhile, a quickly-responded and smoother user interface was provided. Enterprise information system with Ajax can be operated in a more efficient way, which means even use the current hardware, it can provide more load capacity, be more stable and serve more clients in parallel. In this paper: we present two kinds of information system models, one use conventional B/S architecture and the other use Ajax enhanced B/S architecture...|$|E
40|$|ITC/USA 2007 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-Third Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 22 - 25, 2007 / Riviera Hotel & Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaAsynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) has {{improved}} web applications {{in a way}} that has enhanced performance and made the user experience more like that of a desktop application. As the performance of PCs increases and broadband Internet access is more prevalent, switching between web pages is less painful than ever. One of the biggest advantages of AJAX is the ability for a web application to update only a small piece of data without refreshing the whole page. AJAX also allows for piecewise validation of user entry as opposed to the standard form entry with which we have become so accustomed. This paper describes how AJAX enabled applications are different from classic web applications and shows the advantages and disadvantages from both client and server sides of an AJAX enabled application. AJAX is not a new technology, but rather a new approach to web applications that uses standards already in place for XHTML, CSS, DOM, XML, and JavaScript. It is this new approach that eliminates the full <b>page</b> <b>refresh</b> that was so commonplace and now gives web applications the ability to look and feel more like desktop applications...|$|E
