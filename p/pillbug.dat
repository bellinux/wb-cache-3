50|$|In January 2013, the <b>Pillbug</b> was {{announced}} {{as a possible}} expansion piece, and {{has been added to}} the game. It was designed as a defensive piece, to counteract the other two offensive expansions and to give the second player a bit of an advantage. The <b>Pillbug</b> moves exactly like a Queen. In addition, the <b>Pillbug</b> has the special ability, in lieu of moving, to pick up and move another bug of either color. When doing so, the <b>Pillbug</b> picks up an adjacent piece and places it into a different, unoccupied space adjacent to itself. This special ability may, for example, be used to rescue a friendly Queen {{on the verge of being}} surrounded. The <b>Pillbug</b> may not move a bug which was just currently moved by one's opponent in the immediately preceding turn. All standard rules apply to the <b>Pillbug.</b> The Mosquito adapts to both the movement and special power of the <b>Pillbug.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Pillbugs</b> (woodlice of {{the family}} Armadillidiidae, also known as pill woodlice) can be {{confused}} with pill millipedes of the order Glomerida. Both of these groups of terrestrial segmented arthropods {{are about the same}} size. They live in very similar habitats, and they can both roll up into a ball. Pill millipedes and <b>pillbugs</b> appear superficially similar to the naked eye. This is an example of convergent evolution.|$|R

5000|$|The sole {{was soft}} and {{probably}} muscular. Since Halkieria was unsuited to swimming and had no obvious adaptations for burrowing, it must have lived on the sea-floor, [...] "walking" [...] by making its muscular sole ripple. The backward-projecting siculate sclerites may have improved its grip by preventing it from slipping backwards. Some specimens have been found partially rolled up, rather like a <b>pillbug,</b> and in this position the cultrate sclerites projected outwards, which probably deterred predators. It {{is difficult to determine}} the functions of the cap-shaped shells {{at either end of the}} animal, as the sclerites appear to have offered adequate protection. Scars on the inner surface of the front shell may indicate that it provided an attachment for internal organs. In one specimen the rear shell appears to have rotated by about 45° before fossilization, which suggests there was a cavity underneath, which may have housed gills.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{faithful}} {{expression of}} the mitochondrial DNA is crucial for cell survival. Animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) presents a highly compact gene organization. The typical 16. 5 kbp animal mtDNA encodes 13 proteins, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs. In the backyard <b>pillbug</b> Armadillidium vulgare, the rather small 13. 9 kbp mtDNA encodes {{the same set of}} proteins and rRNAs as compared to animal kingdom mtDNA, but seems to harbor an incomplete set of tRNA genes. Here, we first confirm the expression of 13 tRNA genes in this mtDNA. Then we show the extensive repair of a truncated tRNA, the expression of tRNA involved in large gene overlaps and of tRNA genes partially or fully integrated within protein-coding genes in either direct or opposite orientation. Under selective pressure, overlaps between genes have been likely favored for strong genome size reduction. Our study underlines the existence of unknown biochemical mechanisms for the complete gene expression of A. vulgare mtDNA, and of co-evolutionary processes to keep overlapping genes functional in a compacted mitochondrial genome...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The grey {{field slug}} Deroceras reticulatum has become a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the <b>pillbug</b> during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.

40|$|A {{small family}} of Kunitz {{protease}} inhibitors exists in Arabidopsis thaliana, {{a member of}} which (encoded by At 1 g 72290) accomplishes highly specific roles during plant development. Arabidopsis Kunitz-protease inhibitor 1 (Kunitz-PI; 1), as we dubbed this protein here, is operative as cysteine PI. Activity measurements revealed that {{despite the presence of}} the conserved Kunitz-motif the bacterially expressed Kunitz-PI; 1 was unable to inhibit serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin, but very efficiently inhibited the cysteine protease RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION 21. Western blotting and cytolocalization studies using mono-specific antibodies recalled Kunitz-PI; 1 protein expression in flowers, young siliques and etiolated seedlings. In dark-grown seedlings, maximum Kunitz-PI; 1 promoter activity was detected in the apical hook region and apical parts of the hypocotyls. Immunolocalization confirmed Kunitz-PI; 1 expression in these organs and tissues. No transmitting tract (NTT) and HECATE 1 (HEC 1), two transcription factors previously implicated {{in the formation of the}} female reproductive tract in flowers of Arabidopsis, were identified to regulate Kunitz-PI; 1 expression in the dark and during greening, with NTT acting negatively and HEC 1 acting positively. Laboratory feeding experiments with isopod crustaceans such as Porcellio scaber (woodlouse) and Armadillidium vulgare (<b>pillbug)</b> pinpointed the apical hook as ethylene-protected Achilles? heel of etiolated seedlings. Because exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and mechanical stress (wounding) strongly up-regulated HEC 1 -dependent Kunitz-PI; 1 gene expression, our results identify a new circuit controlling herbivore deterrence of etiolated plants in which Kunitz-PI; 1 is involved...|$|E

40|$|Because {{woodlice}} (Porcellio scaber and <b>pillbugs</b> (Eluma purpurascens) that traveled {{closer to}} the outer wall of alleys both before as well as after a 90 ° forced turn subsequently made sharper free turns in the opposite direction, it seemed possible that a quantitative relationship existed between tactile stimulation arising from wall contact and free-turn behavior However, on emerging from straight runways, without any forced turns, <b>pillbugs</b> turned at sharper angles than woodlice but there was no relationship between the size of a turn and amount of wall contact apart from a very minor one for woodlice only. It was concluded that tactile stimuh played a negligible part in turn alternation of either species thereby supporting involvement of proprioceptive cues. By requiring woodlice to negotiate a forced turn lined with glass on the outer half of the floor, it became apparent that their alternation was determined by proprioceptive feedback from bilaterally asymmetrical leg movements rather than distortion of body segments...|$|R
40|$|Revised 12 / 02, Reviewed and reprinted 8 / 07 / 3 M. "Sowbugs and <b>pillbugs</b> {{are closely}} related to shrimp, crabs and lobsters. Although they may {{occasionally}} invade the home, they normally prefer moist areas outdoors at the soil surface in mulched flowerbeds, leaf litter, grass clippings and other debris around foundations. However, cracks between slabs and porches and in basement walls provide excellent hiding places from which these occasional invaders can enter homes. These pests do not pose an economic or health threat to humans, but some sowbugs occasionally damage roots or the tender stems of plants. Millipedes and centipedes rarely damage seedlings. Sowbugs, <b>pillbugs</b> and millipedes do not harm humans or other animals, and centipedes usually are too small to injure humans. However, large centipedes (4 to 5 inches long) can inflict a wound similar to a bee sting. Annoyance from the presence of these invaders inside the home is the main concern with this group of pests...|$|R
25|$|When {{conditions}} are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water.

Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.|$|R
