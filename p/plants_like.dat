5|$|Concentrated near water bodies, the {{vegetation}} {{in most of}} El Hatillo is dense forests, occupying around 30% of the surface. Smaller <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> shrubs take around 9% and herbs occupy a similar percentage. In 1972, the forests of El Hatillo were declared a protected zone of the metropolitan area of Caracas.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Substrates {{they are}} most {{commonly}} found on in their native habitats include beds and floating clumps of macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrusspp., and Desmarestia viridis; {{as well as in}} marine <b>plants</b> (<b>like</b> eelgrass of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{is home to}} American beavers, as well {{as great}} blue heron, swans, snow geese, common loons, and many other types of waterfowl, with Canada goose, ring-necked duck, mallard, and wood duck the most {{commonly}} seen. The bogs, marshes, and swamps contain frogs and salamanders, and provide a habitat for carnivorous <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> the pitcher plant and sundew. Black Moshannon State Park is home to many common species of songbirds, including ovenbirds.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>likes</b> dry habitats, prefers loess {{and sandy}} soil. It {{can be found}} on {{lowlands}} and also on hilly habitats.|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} false violet comes {{not only from}} the {{heart-shaped}} leaves, but also because this <b>plant,</b> <b>like</b> violets, produces two kinds of flowers.|$|R
50|$|The nursery garden {{business}} is practised {{by many in}} the village these produce mainly saplings of flowers <b>plant</b> <b>like</b> country rose,casuarine hybrid clones, Kanagambaram, Jasmine etc.|$|R
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests in}} and around Ricketts Glen State Park {{are some of the}} most {{extensive}} in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} features {{thin and}} acidic soil, and hosts <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> witherod, Indian pear, Labrador tea, wintergreen, and blueberry shrubs. It is a woodland area, with birch, tamarack, maple, oak, beech, and white pine trees. Given {{the development of}} the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971. Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include grebes, loons, and alcids.|$|E
50|$|The giant potato (Ipomoea mauritiana) {{is a type}} {{of morning}} glory <b>plant.</b> <b>Like</b> the sweet potato, it belongs to the Ipomoea genus. It grows as a vine.|$|R
50|$|This <b>plant,</b> <b>like</b> {{others of}} the genus Artemisia, yields {{essential}} oils which have historically been used for various medicinal purposes, and its pharmacological properties are under investigation.|$|R
50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>likes</b> a {{relative}} humidity of 50 percent or higher. using humidity trays or room humidifiers {{to provide additional}} humidity in dry conditions is beneficial to these plants.|$|R
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. <b>Plants</b> <b>like</b> the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, {{with respect to the}} principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E

5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

25|$|Plant viruses are {{viruses that}} affect <b>plants.</b> <b>Like</b> all other viruses, plant viruses are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites {{that do not}} have the molecular machinery to replicate without a host. Plant viruses are pathogenic to higher plants.|$|E
25|$|An agar {{plate is}} a Petri dish that {{contains}} a growth medium (typically agar plus nutrients) used to culture microorganisms or small <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> the moss Physcomitrella patens. Sometimes selective compounds {{will be added to}} influence growth, such as antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Golden mice are {{granivorous}} and eat mostly seeds. They forage among {{trees for}} buds, berries, seeds, fruits, leaves, and some insects. It prefers sumac seeds and honeysuckle. They also consume berries from <b>plants</b> <b>like</b> dogwood, greenbrier, blackberry and wild cherry.|$|E
5000|$|Echeveria derenbergii is {{cultivated}} as an {{ornamental plant}} for rock gardens {{and as a}} potted <b>plant.</b> <b>Like</b> other Echeverias, it rapidly produces a colony of small offsets which can {{be separated from the}} parent plant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plant,</b> <b>like</b> the {{closely related}} Polygonatum (Solomon's seal), is {{suitable}} for cultivation in moist, humus-rich soil in a woodland setting or in dappled shade. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R
50|$|This <b>plant,</b> <b>like</b> other buttercups, {{contains}} the toxic glycoside ranunculin. It is avoided by livestock when fresh, {{but when the}} plant dries the toxin is lost, so hay containing the plant is safe for animal consumption.|$|R
