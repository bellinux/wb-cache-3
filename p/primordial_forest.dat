He had, too, a piece of a book about the lost palaces of Yucatan, those vast terraces buried in <b>primordial</b> <b>forest,</b> of whose makers there is now no human memory. With La Perouse he linked [...] "The Island Nights Entertainments," [...] and it never palled upon him that in the dusky stabbing of the [...] "Island of Voices" [...] something poured over the stabber's hands [...] "like warm tea."

40|$|Perceived by {{the white}} settler as a {{primordial}} land lacking variety and natural grandeur, the Australian landscape, despite multiple incursions since colonisation, {{had yet to be}} reconciled with the aesthetic criteria of either the picturesque or the sublime. It took some imagination, therefore, to suggest that in certain respects the Yarra Ranges, reaching to just over 500 metres above sea level at Black Spur near Lindt 2 ̆ 7 s Hermitage, might be compared to the Swiss Alps of at least four times this height. The Melbourne based journalist James Smith (1820 - 1910) was able to propose this conceit by drawing on an aesthetic paradigm witnessed by him in the Swiss Alps and echoed, he believed, in the Yarra Ranges: cultivation and habitation could co-exist in a landscape of <b>primordial</b> <b>forests.</b> By drawing upon these conflicting aesthetics, Smith 2 ̆ 7 s reading of the Swiss Alps offered a new paradigm for the interpretation of Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s alpine forests. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how John William Lindt 2 ̆ 7 s (1845 - 1926) Hermitage and garden, identified by Smith in 1901 as a realisation of the ideal traveller 2 ̆ 7 s retreat, participated in the promotion of such ideals...|$|R
50|$|The forest {{contains}} seven distinct ecosystems, including unique <b>primordial</b> swamp <b>forest,</b> and {{is home to}} {{more than}} 20 endangered plant species as well as 27 endangered animal species. Botanists have said in all livelihood there are even more as-of-yet unknown species populating the forest, which is also an important breeding ground for fish. In addition to its rich biodiversity, Prey Lang plays a critical role in water management. It is a primary watershed, regulating water and sediment flow to the Tonle Sap basin, and vital for the water and food security of millions. Prey Lang has some of the highest carbon sequestration values in the region, making it a powerhouse in the fight against climate change.|$|R
50|$|Narn is the homeworld of the Narn and the Narn Regime. Its day is 31 hours long. Prior to the Centauri's first invasion, Narn was {{a healthy}} green planet. Now {{it has the}} look of a {{slightly}} more habitable Mars. The surface temperature can fluctuate by at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit on any given day. Before the Centauri invasion the planet was dominated by <b>primordial</b> jungles and <b>forests,</b> teeming with animal life. Craggy mountains and small, landlocked seas covered the rest of the globe. One of the most revered locations on Narn is the G'Quon mountain range which was once home to the vicious On'Vik and herds of wild Dar and horned beasts called Natok that stomp and make noise when angered or disturbed.|$|R

In this homage to what will eventually become Canada, four local animals (bear, caribou, woodpecker and owl), guided these one hundred fifty children along the trails of discovery, under {{the glow of the}} Aurora Borealis. Thirty-one young ballet dancers (from Canada's National Ballet School) later emerge from the group of children and perform down the stage.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the left}} {{bank of the}} Adda, the park {{offers a variety of}} {{vegetation}} and partially wooded formations. The forests of Northern Italy have been subject, for many centuries, to the various agricultural activities of reclamations and deforestations. However, in this line of the river it is, in fact, possible to experience the last hems of the <b>primordial</b> <b>forest,</b> characterized by deciduous leaf trees. The park wood entertains an intermixed variety of trees, such as: poplars, elms, locust trees, etc. The park features a proliferation of wild plants (such as violets, primroses, hawthorns, etc.) and other ancestral cultivations; its brushwood is invaluable.|$|E
50|$|Old Man Willow is {{a fictional}} {{character}} In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, appearing in The Lord of the Rings. He was a willow {{tree in the}} Old Forest. He is portrayed in the story as a tree, albeit a sentient and evil one with various powers including hypnosis {{and the ability to}} move his roots and trunk. Some characters of the story speculate that he may have been related to the Ents, or possibly the Huorns, as the Old Forest was originally part of the same <b>primordial</b> <b>forest</b> as Fangorn. However, unlike Ents or Huorns, Old Man Willow is portrayed more like a tree, with roots in the ground, and without the ability to uproot himself and move from place to place.|$|E
5000|$|Montara Mountain and Sweeney Ridge are not {{cloaked in}} the dense Coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) typical {{of the rest of}} the Santa Cruz Mountains to the {{immediate}} south. The early Spanish settlers described the ridges of the headwaters as without tall trees. The only tall trees were planted recently and include eucalyptus, Monterey pine and Monterey cypress. The area from Montara Mountain north to the Golden Gate represent a unique bio-geographic unit dubbed the [...] "Franciscan Landscape" [...] which is primarily Coastal Scrub dominated by Coyote Brush and also sheltering unique endemic species found nowhere else. The Hazelnut Trail in San Pedro Valley County Park is a good place to see these unusual species which include Giant Golden Chinaquapin, Montara Manzanita, Fetid Adders-tongue, and California Hazelnut. These and other plants such as Wake robins, Coast and Giant trillium, Slender false solomon's seal, and Fetid adder's tongue blossom between clustered stems of shrubs and clumps of sword fern. Fetid adder's tongue—with its mottled green leaves, brown-purple striped flowers, and odor of rotting flesh—is particularly abundant. The fact that these species normally grow in the shady understory of redwood and Douglas fir forests, has led to speculation that prior to the 5,000 year occupation of the Ohlone Indians, who likely burned off the area to promote the growth of natural food sources, that the upper San Pedro watershed may have been host to <b>primordial</b> conifer <b>forests.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the Chicago Reader, Diana Spinrad writes: [...] The Woods, by David Mamet, is a {{character}} study of two people who represent the quintessential male and female, and explores how we manage {{to survive in the}} dark <b>primordial</b> <b>forest</b> of relationships. Mamet is particularly interested in women's desire to [...] "nest," [...] and men's fear of it. The problem with The Woods is that, in general, Mamet's perceptions of sexual relationships are a little warped. His characterizations of women suffer acutely from the madonna-whore syndrome. They are sex objects who, at the same time, have a mysterious nurturing quality to them. His men are entrenched in Chicago macho. The characters in The Woods are no exception. The challenge of the piece, then, is for the director and actors to create two interesting characters who can stand as individuals, above the stereotypes set for them, and who can make the action clear within an essentially static situation.|$|E
5000|$|Loosely wooded forests existed as {{far back}} as the 18th century, such as lush oak forests of the Burgholzhof, which were used for pig farming, and as pointed out by names such as Wannenwald, Kögelwald and Lorcher Mönchswald. The Lembergwald also {{stretched}} farther east than now and was a ducal hunting forest, which must have been so profitable that it was worthwhile to erect a hunting castle on the Schlotwiese. Today there are only a larger connected forest area in Zuffenhausen, namely on the Lviv, (a translation of Lemberg by Google Translate) a mountain range rising from east to west with the Feuerbach vineyards on the south side and the wooded northern slope on the north side of the Zuffenhausen side. However, pieces of that <b>primordial</b> <b>forest</b> still exist as the [...] "Hofkammerwald" [...] (named after the man who once owned the land), an area of over 58 ha that has been operated by the City of Stuttgart as a community forest since 1968. The eastern part of the forest is the present city park, the northern section near Neuwirtshaus is now Schützenwies Forest, the westernmost part in Weilimdorf is now called the Maierwald.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{activity}} is economic {{activity and the}} development of the cultural landscape can be understood as the accumulation of economic processes. A macroeconomic index derived from pollen-analytical data is presented here. The scores on the first axis of a canonical correspondence analysis are used to show the intensity of land use through time. These scores correlate with the cultural indicator curves when the vegetational development is dominated by agriculture involving grassland, arable fields and ruderal patches. In the Lake Constance area and the Rhineland, this point is first reached in the Bronze Age, when there is no <b>primordial</b> <b>forest</b> left. The cultural landscape {{can be seen as a}} capital resource {{and the development of}} the cultural landscape as capital formation. This development is an irreversible and directed process. Further research will show whether the human impact curve can serve as a long-term economic index analogous to cereal prices...|$|E
40|$|For centuries Amazonia {{has held}} the Western {{scientific}} and popular imagination as a <b>primordial</b> <b>forest,</b> only minimally impacted by small, simple and dispersed groups that inhabit the region. Studies in historical ecology refute this view. Rather than pristine tropical forest, some areas are better viewed as constructed or ‘domesticated’ landscapes, dramatically altered by indigenous groups in the past. This paper reviews recent archaeological research in several areas along the Amazon River with evidence of large pre-European (ca 400 – 500 calendar years before the present) occupations and large-scale transformations of forest and wetland environments. Research from the southern margins of closed tropical forest, in {{the headwaters of the}} Xingu River, are highlighted as an example of constructed nature in the Amazon. In all cases, human influences dramatically altered the distribution, frequency and configurations of biological communities and ecological settings. Findings of historical change and cultural variability, including diverse small to medium-sized complex societies, have clear implications for questions of conservation and sustainability and, specifically, what constitutes ‘hotspots’ of bio-historical diversity in the Amazon region...|$|E
