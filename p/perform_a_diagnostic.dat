To remedy this, they would be likely be able to communicate with each other, as well as other devices inside and outside the body, in an internalnet, in a distributed computing network. This would be likely to be accomplished by acoustic wave communication, or using wires composed of single electrons. Anders Sandberg has commented saying that [...] "mitochondria ... just react on local conditions and indirectly cooperate". and that [...] "It might be hard to make those pipes reliable", although he conceded that [...] "linked nanochondria will be much more versatile".

50|$|After Rose Kushner's June 1974 {{discovery}} of a cancerous lump in her breast, breast cancer {{became the focus of}} her life. On the basis of her library research into breast cancer treatment, she objected to the treatment which was then standard, in which a tumor biopsy and radical mastectomy were performed in a single surgical operation while the patient was under anesthesia. However, she had difficulty finding a doctor who would <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>diagnostic</b> biopsy and allow her to decide what action to take next. After a biopsy determined that her tumor was cancerous, she resisted the then-standard radical mastectomy procedure, in which muscle tissue and lymph nodes were removed along with the breast. In order to have a less invasive procedure, she traveled from her Kensington, Maryland home to Buffalo, New York, where she had found a doctor (Dr. Thomas Dao) who was willing to do a modified radical mastectomy.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{opinions}} in the case, the plaintiff Mallinckrodt owned {{a patent on}} a device for dispensing a radioactive mist used in taking diagnostic lung X-rays, and for trapping the mist after use. Mallinckrodt sold the device to hospitals for about $40 or $50. Hospital personnel would load the device with a suitable radioactive fluid to <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>diagnostic</b> procedure on a patient, use the device, and then discard it. Mallinckrodt labeled the devices it sold with the notice “Single use only.” Because the device itself cost approximately $10 to make but was sold {{for four or five}} times that, most of the purchase price that hospitals paid Mallinckrodt apparently represented the value of the patent (or the patented technology). This fact apparently led the defendant Medipart to go into the recycling business, in which Mallinckrodt itself had no direct interest (it chose to sell only new devices). For a $20 recycling fee, Medipart would clean one of the devices for a hospital, replace some parts, subject the device to gamma radiation to kill germs, and return it to the hospital for reuse. The district court and court of appeals opinions do not support the claim that a health or safety problem existed. However, Mallinckrodt asserted to the court that [...] "potential adverse consequences, such as infectious disease transmission” provided the reason for its imposing the restriction against reuse.|$|E

The postoperative course was marked by an infection of the extraction’s site. The pathology specimen findings revealed a stromal tumor with a high aggressive potential (five mitosis per field), positive to CD 117 at the immunohistochemical examination.

40|$|Introduction Many tasks involve {{decision}} making under uncertainty. For example, in diagnosis and troubleshooting, often one {{must decide whether}} to treat a suspected disease or malfunction or to <b>perform</b> <b>a</b> <b>diagnostic</b> test to reduce uncertainty about the cause of observed symptoms. In planning, one must decide how best to achieve desired goals. Selection tasks such as selecting the most appropriate applicant for a job, or the best product from a catalog, or the most relevant document on the world-wide web, also involve {{decision making}}. Decision analysis is the professional practice of applying Bayesian decision theory to clarify and improve decision making on real-world problems. Measured {{by the number of}} professional decision-analysis consultants, and by the increasing visibility of decision analysis in business, government, medicine, and elsewhere, the field is enjoying considerable success.

30|$|In conclusion, {{this case}} report intends to {{increase}} awareness among gynaecological laparoscopists of Spigelian hernia.

This case report also illustrates how misleading deep endometriosis can be. It also is a lesson in humility. Indeed we must admit that if in this woman a deep endometriosis nodule would have been found during surgery, compatible with her complaints, we might not have treated this Spigelian hernia since it was unknown to us at that moment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Transcutaneous {{ultrasound}} imaging {{may be used}} to detect abdominal hemorrhage in the field setting.

It appears likely that Image Registration will assist hemorrhage detection at the point of injury or in the initial evaluation by a trauma response team...|$|E
