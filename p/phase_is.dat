5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

50|$|Not every {{project will}} {{require that the}} <b>phases</b> <b>be</b> {{sequentially}} executed. However, the <b>phases</b> <b>are</b> interdependent. Depending upon the size {{and complexity of the}} project, <b>phases</b> may <b>be</b> combined or may overlap.|$|R
5|$|The {{follicular}} <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{final phase}} of expansion, that {{received}} planning approval {{at the same time}} as the others but which remains unscheduled, will add a matching third tier of seats to the North Stand. Once this last <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> completed it will bring the stadium's total seating capacity up to approximately 61,000, making the Etihad Stadium the nation's second largest capacity club ground.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E

5|$|Boron {{is similar}} to carbon in its {{capability}} to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000°C. It forms four major polymorphs: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but {{is very difficult to}} produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20GPa and heating to 1500–1800°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable. Compressing boron above 160GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K. Borospherene (fullerene-like B40) molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) have been described in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, {{and there is no}} clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E

5000|$|The EuroLeague, {{under its}} {{original}} league format, consisted of four phases. The first <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "regular season", {{which was the}} first group stage. The second <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the top 16 stage, which was the second group stage. The third <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the playoffs stage, and the fourth <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the EuroLeague Final Four stage. The Regular Season MVP was the MVP award for {{the first phase of the}} season, and the Top 16 MVP was the MVP award for the second phase of the season.|$|R
5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. In one study, {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang gongs {{are made}} using the cire perdue method, a lost-wax process used for casting the {{individual}} gongs. The first <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> {{the creation of}} wax molds of the gongs. In the past, before the availability of standardized wax sheets made specifically for foundry use, the molds were made out of either beeswax (talo) or candle wax (kandilà). The wax mold {{is covered with a}} special mixture of finely powdered coal/mud, which is applied on the wax surface using a brush.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} {{does suggest that}} the Southern Oscillation is weakly correlated with changes in tornado activity, which vary by season and region, as well as whether the ENSO <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> that of El Niño or La Niña. Research has found that fewer tornadoes and hailstorms occur in winter and spring in the U.S. central and southern plains during El Niño, and more occur during La Niña, than in years when temperatures in the Pacific are relatively stable. Ocean conditions {{could be used to}} forecast extreme spring storm events several months in advance.|$|E
30|$|Phases in {{the gait}} cycle were {{evaluated}} according to duration. The {{duration of the}} right swing <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> defined as {{the time when the}} right foot was off the ground, while the right stance <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> defined as the time when the right foot was on the ground. Similarly, the duration of the left swing <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> defined as the time when the left foot was off the ground, while the left stance <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> the time when the left foot was on the ground. The single support <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> defined as the period of time during which the opposite foot was lifted for swing phase, whilst the double support <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> defined as the period when both feet were in contact with the floor. The gait cycle was defined as the time interval between 2 successive occurrences of 1 repetitive event of walking.|$|R

5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> to reach a complete remission. Complete remission {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} phase of the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> {{the final}} phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E

30|$|The basic <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> set {{as the air}} and the {{secondary}} <b>phases</b> <b>were</b> water and oil. The density of the basic <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> 1.225  kg/m 3, the water density was 998.2  kg/m 3, and the crude oil density was 860  kg/m 3. At the initial moments, the water volume fraction below the free surface was set as one using the Patch function.|$|R
50|$|While {{the initial}} <b>phases</b> <b>were</b> {{dominated}} by basaltic lava flows and pyroclastic deposits, the final <b>phase</b> <b>was</b> characterized by pumice, surges, lahars, and pyroclastic flows characteristic of Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions.|$|R
5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|Upon heating, α-berkelium {{transforms}} {{into another}} phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fmm and {{the lattice constant}} of 500pm; this fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. This <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
