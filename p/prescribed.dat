40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To compare <b>prescribing</b> {{in general}} {{practices}} {{before and after}} they become fundholders to assess whether this affected <b>prescribing</b> patterns. DESIGN [...] Analysis of <b>prescribing</b> data (PACT) for one year before and one year after practices become first, second, or third wave fundholders and comparison with practices that were not fundholders during {{any part of the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] <b>Prescribing</b> costs (net ingredient cost per <b>prescribing</b> unit), <b>prescribing</b> volume (items per 1000 <b>prescribing</b> units), net ingredient cost per item, and percentage of generic <b>prescribing.</b> SETTING [...] Former Mersey Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS [...] 100 fundholders (20 first wave, 31 second wave, 49 third wave) and 312 nonfundholders. RESULTS [...] <b>Prescribing</b> costs and volume rose throughout the study in all groups. In all three fundholding waves the rate of increase of <b>prescribing</b> costs was significantly lower than for nonfundholders. Both cost per item and <b>prescribing</b> volume tended to decrease, the former probably because of a significant increase in generic <b>prescribing.</b> Fundholding and non-fundholding practices differed in several respects. CONCLUSION [...] Fundholding has altered practice <b>prescribing</b> patterns compared with those of nonfundholders, increasing generic <b>prescribing</b> and reducing the rate of increase of <b>prescribing</b> costs...|$|R
40|$|Background In Australia {{the agenda}} for non-medical <b>prescribing</b> has gained {{momentum}} in response to increasing pressure to improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. Some registered nurses and midwives with additional training already hold <b>prescribing</b> authority; however there is scope to expand this authority. To safeguard patient safety {{it is necessary to}} ensure the competence of any health professional authorised to <b>prescribe.</b> The national <b>Prescribing</b> Competencies Framework (PCF) provides a valuable standard against which <b>prescribing</b> competence can be assessed. In addition, the Health Professionals <b>Prescribing</b> Pathway (HPPP) defines three models of <b>prescribing</b> for non-medical practitioners. The project aimed to assess current <b>prescribing</b> capabilities of registered nurses and midwives across a range of professions, align competence with appropriate models of <b>prescribing</b> and determine areas that require additional training before a <b>prescribing</b> role can be considered...|$|R
40|$|Nurse {{independent}} and supplementary prescribers have legal authority to <b>prescribe</b> all licensed and unlicensed medicines with some minor restriction to <b>prescribing</b> controlled drugs. These <b>prescribing</b> rights {{are similar to}} those of doctors. To be effective, the integration of nurse <b>prescribing</b> must be consistent with the legal framework for nurse <b>prescribing</b> and, be acceptable to the nurse, employer, patient and healthcare team. There is little known about how <b>prescribing</b> is integrated in practice but agreements are potentially important to the organisation of professional work and may ultimately affect patient safety. These case studies set out to investigate how nurse prescribers integrate <b>prescribing</b> in primary and secondary care. Each case, a nurse prescriber,had completed the {{independent and}} supplementary <b>prescribing</b> course at one university between September 2004 and January 2007. Of the 26 cases recruited 13 had been qualified to <b>prescribe</b> for between 7 and 13 months, and 13 for 14 and 26 months. Data collected through semistructured interviews, field notes and attribute data was drawn together in case summaries. Data analysis showed effective integration to be dependent upon professional relationships and <b>prescribing</b> role agreements. Prescribers outlined three approaches to integrate <b>prescribing.</b> These were; <b>prescribing</b> as the opportunity presents, <b>prescribing</b> for specific conditions and <b>prescribing</b> for individuals. <b>Prescribing</b> as the opportunity presents reflects medical models of <b>prescribing.</b> Condition specific and individual approaches restrict <b>prescribing</b> to specific medical condition(s) or individual patients. These nurse prescribers preferred to use Independent <b>prescribing.</b> Reflecting this, prescribers showed higher levels of dependence on doctors than previously reported. This was most common in the first year of <b>prescribing.</b> Relationships between nurse prescribers and the team were important. New nurse prescribers raised unexpected issues in some intraprofessional relationships. However, it was the inter-professional relationship between nurse and doctor that determined integration. The nurse must believe, trust exists and is reciprocal to integrate <b>prescribing</b> in practice. Where there was an absence of trust or a concern of mistrust the nurse would not integrate <b>prescribing.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{drug use}} in 2 Dutch nursing homes (254 residents) by developing and evaluating <b>prescribing</b> indicators based on pharmacy prescription data. METHODS: We evaluated the <b>prescribing</b> of benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ulcer-healing drugs, and diuretics. <b>Prescribing</b> indicators were used to identify <b>prescribing</b> that was potentially not in line with recommendations in national and regional <b>prescribing</b> guidelines. We used both descriptive indicators, such as the number and percentage of users, and indicators reflecting potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing,</b> such as use of drugs outside the regional drug formulary, use of > 1 drug from the same drug class, and prescription of drug dosages above recommended values. When potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing</b> was found, we verified the findings {{by means of an}} interview with 1 of the prescribers. RESULTS: The <b>prescribing</b> indicators we assessed were generally in agreement with national and regional guidelines. However, <b>prescribing</b> of NSAIDs without concomitant <b>prescribing</b> of gastroprotective drugs was found in a relatively high number of patients. After prescriber interview and patient chart review, it was found that some <b>prescribing</b> indicators, such as dosages above recommended values, were not always indicative for suboptimal <b>prescribing.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that <b>prescribing</b> indicators based solely on pharmacy prescription data can be a useful tool to evaluate drug <b>prescribing.</b> With some of these <b>prescribing</b> indicators, we identified cases of potentially suboptimal <b>prescribing.</b> However, with other indicators such as those based on drug dosages, we could not identify suboptimal <b>prescribing,</b> and clinical information from the prescriber was necessary to get insight into the appropriateness of prescribin...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundÂ  <b>Prescribing</b> is a core {{activity}} for general practitioners, yet significant {{variation in the}} quality of <b>prescribing</b> has been reported. This suggests there may be room for improvement in the application of the current best research evidence. There has been substantial investment in technologies and interventions to address this issue, but effect sizes so far have been small to moderate. This suggests that <b>prescribing</b> is a decision-making process that is not sufficiently understood. By understanding more about <b>prescribing</b> processes and the implementation of research evidence, variation may more easily be understood and more effective interventions proposed. Â  MethodsÂ  An ethnographic study in three Scottish general practices with diverse organizational characteristics. Practices were ranked by their performance against Audit Scotland <b>prescribing</b> quality indicators, incorporating established best research evidence. Two practices of high <b>prescribing</b> quality and one practice of low <b>prescribing</b> quality were recruited. Participant observation, formal and informal interviews, and a review of practice documentation were employed. Â  ResultsÂ  Practices ranked as high <b>prescribing</b> quality consistently made and applied macro and micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions, whereas the low-ranking practice only made micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions. Macro <b>prescribing</b> decisions were collective, policy decisions made considering research evidence in light of the average patient, one disease, condition, or drug. Micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions were made in consultation with the patient considering their views, preferences, circumstances and other conditions (if necessary). Â  Although micro <b>prescribing</b> can operate independently, the implementation of evidence-based, quality <b>prescribing</b> was attributable to an interdependent relationship. Macro <b>prescribing</b> policy enabled <b>prescribing</b> decisions to be based on scientific evidence and applied consistently where possible. Ultimately, this influenced <b>prescribing</b> decisions that occur at the micro level in consultation with patients. Â  ConclusionÂ  General practitioners in the higher <b>prescribing</b> quality practices made two different âtypesâ of <b>prescribing</b> decision; macro and micro. Macro <b>prescribing</b> informs micro <b>prescribing</b> and without a macro basis to draw upon the low-ranked practice had no effective mechanism to engage with, reflect on and implement relevant evidence.

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject: Electronic <b>prescribing</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce <b>prescribing</b> errors in US hospitals. However we know little about its effect on <b>prescribing</b> quality, or its {{effectiveness}} in UK hospitals where systems for medication <b>prescribing</b> and supply are very different. Hospital pharmacists already review prescriptions to both detect errors and improve prescription quality. What this study adds: Electronic <b>prescribing</b> significantly increased <b>prescribing</b> quality in a UK hospital, as shown by fewer pharmacists' interventions and fewer <b>prescribing</b> errors. However, some new types of error were introduced. There was relatively little overlap between <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' interventions, signifying their different contributions to <b>prescribing</b> quality. Electronic <b>prescribing</b> and pharmacists' interventions should be viewed as an integrated system. AIMS: To investigate the effects of electronic <b>prescribing</b> (EP) on <b>prescribing</b> quality, as indicated by <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' clinical interventions, in a UK hospital. METHODS: <b>Prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' interventions were recorded by the ward pharmacist during a 4 week period both pre- and post-EP, with a second check by the principal investigator. The percentage of new medication orders with a <b>prescribing</b> error and/or pharmacist's intervention was calculated for each study period. RESULTS: Following the introduction of EP, there was a significant reduction in both pharmacists' interventions and <b>prescribing</b> errors. Interventions reduced from 73 (3. 0 % of all medication orders) to 45 (1. 9 %) (95 % confidence interval (CI) for the absolute reduction 0. 2, 2. 0 %), and errors from 94 (3. 8 %) to 48 (2. 0 %) (95 % CI 0. 9, 2. 7 %). Ten EP-specific <b>prescribing</b> errors were identified. Only 52 % of pharmacists' interventions related to a <b>prescribing</b> error pre-EP, and 60 % post-EP; only 40 % and 56 % of <b>prescribing</b> errors resulted in an intervention pre- and post-EP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EP improved the quality of <b>prescribing</b> by reducing both <b>prescribing</b> errors and pharmacists' clinical interventions. Prescribers and pharmacists {{need to be aware of}} new types of error with EP, so that they can best target their activities to reduce clinical risk.

40|$|There are {{indications}} that {{the increasing number of}} nurse prescribers has had a positive impact on patient access to medicines and that patients are satisfied with nurse <b>prescribing.</b> However, in order to impact on clinical outcomes, nursesâ <b>prescribing</b> consultations need to be not only safe, but also demonstrate a range of quality indicators derived from the evidence on effective <b>prescribing.</b> A number of frameworks that outline the competencies to guide safe and effective <b>prescribing</b> have been developed, which nurses and those responsible for the governance of <b>prescribing</b> in practice could use to assess and monitor the safety and quality of nurse <b>prescribing.</b> Research into nurse <b>prescribing</b> suggests that nurses use a range of competencies and skills in their <b>prescribing</b> consultations that are necessary to underpin quality and safe <b>prescribing</b> of medicines.

40|$|There are {{now over}} 30, 000 nurses across the UK who are {{qualified}} to <b>prescribe</b> from the Nurse <b>Prescribing</b> Formulary (NPF) for community practitioners.

Increasing numbers of community nurses are extending their <b>prescribing</b> skills by adopting independent and supplementary <b>prescribing.</b> Over 14, 000 nurses across the UK are qualified to <b>prescribe</b> using these modes of <b>prescribing.</b> The benefits of nurse <b>prescribing</b> exceed those anticipated by the Government.

40|$|Background and objective: Safe <b>prescribing</b> {{requires}} {{accurate and}} practical information about drugs. Our {{objective was to}} measure the utility of current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance when used to inform practical <b>prescribing</b> decisions, and to compare current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance in the UK with idealized <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Methods: We developed 25 clinical scenarios. Two independent assessors rated and ranked the performance of five common sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance in the UK when used to answer the clinical scenarios. A third adjudicator facilitated review of any disparities. An idealized list of contents for <b>prescribing</b> guidance was developed and sent for comments to academics and users of <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Following consultation an operational check {{was used to assess}} compliance with the idealized criteria. The main outcome measures were relative utility in answering the clinical scenarios and compliance with the idealized <b>prescribing</b> guidance. Results: Current sources of <b>prescribing</b> guidance used in the UK differ in their utility, when measured using clinical scenarios. The British National Formulary (BNF) and EMIS LV were the best performing sources in terms of both ranking [mean rank 1 Â· 24 and 2 Â· 20] and rating [%excellent or adequate 100 % and 72 %]. Current sources differed in {{the extent to which they}} fulfilled criteria for ideal <b>prescribing</b> guidance, but the BNF, and EMIS LV to a lesser extent, closely matched the criteria. Discussion: We have demonstrated how clinical scenarios can be used to assess <b>prescribing</b> guidance resources. Producers of <b>prescribing</b> guidance documents should consider our idealized template. Prescribers require high-quality information to support their practice. Conclusion: Our test was helpful in distinguishing between <b>prescribing</b> resources. Producers of <b>prescribing</b> guidance should consider the utility of their products to end-users, particularly in those more complex areas where prescribers may need most support.

A framework for allied health professional (AHP) <b>prescribing</b> trials within Queensland Health (Allied Health Professionsâ Office of Queensland) enabled endorsed credentialed physiotherapists and pharmacists {{working in the}} public health system to enrol in the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Allied Health <b>Prescribing</b> Training Program. The principles underpinning this framework incorporated those identified in the Health Professionals <b>Prescribing</b> Pathway. Aim - To design and deliver an allied health <b>prescribing</b> training program that would ultimately enable {{a new model of}} patient care across multiple Queensland public health practice settings, focusing on best practice via the Quality Use of Medicines and the NPS MedicineWise <b>Prescribing</b> Competencies Framework (the nationally available standard for health professional <b>prescribing</b> in Australia). Methods - A remote, interprofessional AHP <b>prescribing</b> training program was developed with enrolment offered to appropriately credentialed Queensland Health physiotherapists and pharmacists. The QUT program design included an extended period of supervised practice with an authorised prescriber within specific practice settings and with support by the local facility.

40|$|<b>Prescribing</b> {{accounts}} for 11 % {{of the total}} NHS budget. In the UK, there is an aging population who receive {{nearly half of all}} prescriptions, with the increasing age of the population, the prevalence of long-term conditions, cost and complexity of <b>prescribing</b> is likely to rise. <b>Prescribing</b> is influenced by numerous factors such as new drugs; aging populations; polypharmacy; and increased concern about adverse reactions. Although numerous initiatives are targeted at general practitioners to encourage application of research evidence the significant variation in <b>prescribing</b> quality and cost is difficult to explain. Previous studies have explored the influences of type of drug, focused clinical area, guidelines and the doctor/patient relationship. No study was found which has explored the details of the <b>prescribing</b> process using the ethnographic approach. This ethnographic study of three different general practices, involved participant observation, documentary review and semi-structured interviews. Analysis was an iterative process conducted in Atlas. ti by borrowing on grounded theory techniques and interpretative description. Practices were selected using <b>prescribing</b> quality indicators developed by Audit Scotland via PRISMS (<b>Prescribing</b> Information System for Scotland), which collects <b>prescribing</b> data for all practices in Scotland. Two practices which were ranked highly and one practice which was ranked low were observed. Practices made two different kinds of <b>prescribing</b> decision; macro and micro. Macro <b>prescribing</b> decisions are strategic, influenced by EBM and practice data, and consider the âaverage patient?. Micro <b>prescribing</b> decisions are made with an individual patient, considering their unique biology, context and perspectives. Practice pharmacists were instrumental in leading <b>prescribing</b> quality improvement in the larger practices and had an important role interpreting practice level data in light of the changing evidence. In the high ranking practices these changes were formulated into macro <b>prescribing</b> policy to rationalise and standardise their <b>prescribing.</b> The lower ranking practice suggested practices had to value collective decision-making and consistency in their <b>prescribing</b> behaviour to formulate a macro <b>prescribing</b> policy. Consistency in <b>prescribing</b> behaviour was facilitated by effective communication, which was important for shared values and practice identity. Practice identity influenced practice values, communication and organisation thus had a direct impact on their macro <b>prescribing</b> policy formulation and implementation. GPs used mindlines when making <b>prescribing</b> decisions at the micro <b>prescribing</b> level. GPs did not refer to explicit sources when seeking information but used personal <b>prescribing</b> formularies. These mindlines were iteratively developed from social networks with colleagues, secondary care and patient specific information from the practice pharmacist and from past experience. Through effective communication with colleagues these mindlines were shared. In conclusion, practices made two different kinds of <b>prescribing</b> decision; macro and micro. Both types of <b>prescribing</b> were dependent on effective communication channels, organisation, values and practice identity, illustrating the importance of communication for shared values, collective behaviour and <b>prescribing</b> decision-making.

40|$|Aims: To assess {{changes in}} the <b>prescribing</b> {{practices}} and views about nurse <b>prescribing</b> of Registered Nurses in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2012. Background: Considering the developments {{that took place in}} the Netherlands between 2006 and 2012, such as increased opportunities for nurse <b>prescribing</b> education and stricter control of nurses' <b>prescribing</b> practices, this study examines the extent to which nurses' <b>prescribing</b> practices and views have changed in the intervening years. In both years, nurses were not legally allowed to <b>prescribe.</b> Design: Survey study. Methods: Surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2012. Questionnaires were sent to a national sample of nurses. The questionnaires addressed nurses' views on nurse <b>prescribing</b> and the extent to which nurse <b>prescribing</b> took place in the respondents' work setting. Results: There were 386 and 644 respondents to the 2006 and 2012 surveys respectively. The proportion of nurses who said that they felt adequately equipped to <b>prescribe</b> medicines remained constant around 12 %. Insufficient knowledge to <b>prescribe</b> remained the most important reason for feelings of inadequacy.
