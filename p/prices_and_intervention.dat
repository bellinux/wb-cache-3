The operation of the network by self-interested and strategic users usually leads to the overuse of the channel resources and to substantial inefficiencies.

Our results show that intervention can achieve the maximum efficiency in the perfect monitoring scenario.

Empirical evidence shows that a comparativeadvantage-following development strategy promotes growth and narrows the income gap, achieving both efficiency in production and equity in income distribution.

METHODS: Systematic review of published and unpublished literature up to November 2007 of three categories of nutrition policy; nutrition guidelines, regulation of food and/or beverage availability, <b>and</b> <b>price</b> <b>interventions</b> applied in preschools, primary and secondary schools. RESULTS: 18 studies met the inclusion criteria.

CONCLUSION: Some current school policies have been effective in improving the food environment and dietary intake in schools, but there is little evaluation of their impact on BMI. As schools have been proposed worldwide as a major setting for tackling childhood obesity it is essential that future policy evaluations measure the long term effectiveness of a range of school food policies in tackling both dietary intake and overweight and obesity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Amazon {{deforestation}} causes severe climatic {{and ecological}} disruptions, with negative {{consequences for the}} livelihood of forest-dependent peoples. To avoid further disruptions, Brazil will need to take bold steps to eliminate both illegal and legal Amazon deforestation over the short term. Amazon deforestation declined by 70 % between 2005 and 2014 due to drops in commodity <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> by federal <b>and</b> state governments, such as law enforcement campaigns and credit restrictions for landowners who deforest illegally. Despite these impressive achievements, Brazil still deforests 5, 000 km 2 of Amazonian forests each year. How then will Brazil eliminate Amazon deforestation altogether if the country is only committed to cut illegal deforestation by 2030 —as stated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDC) to the 2015 climate change treaty meeting in Paris? Here we provide {{an analysis of the}} major socio-economic-political threats that could constrain Brazil from achieving its current goals. We then propose six fundamental strategies to help Brazil achieve a more ambitious goal to eliminate all major legal and illegal Amazon deforestation. These strategies involve bringing social and environmental safeguards to the infrastructure plans in the region, consolidating and expanding positive incentives for the production of sustainable commodities, establishing a new policy to guarantee the social and environmental sustainability of rural settlements, fully implementing the national legislation protecting forests (the Forest Code), protecting the land rights of indigenous people and traditional communities, and expanding the existing network of protected areas, allocating the 80 million hectares of not designated public forests as protected areas or areas for sustainable use of timber and non-timber forest products. The implementation of these strategies however depends on the formulation of a new development paradigm that promotes economic growth, social justice and productive agriculture, while protecting the fundamentally important ecological services of tropical forests...|$|R

40|$|The world {{sugar market}} {{has long been}} {{characterized}} by volatile <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> widespread <b>intervention.</b> Controls on domestic <b>prices,</b> demand, <b>and</b> supply have created an inefficient pattern of world production, consumption, and trade. Without government controls, production would shift from the coun-tries with higher-cost, subsidized production (especially the European Commu-nity, Japan, and the United States) to the countries with lower costs (such as Australia, Brazil, and Thailand). The resources saved could then be directed to other activities. Sugar policies in countries with high costs reduce world sugar prices quite substantially {{in the long run}} <b>and</b> increase <b>price</b> variability significantly; produc-tion controls in countries with low costs increase world <b>prices</b> somewhat <b>and</b> also increase their variability.

Tourism mobilities are understood {{in the context of}} overall shifts in corporeal mobilities, especially the impact of migration on networks and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) tourism. Four main tourism mobilities drivers are considered-technology, markets, cultures of mobility and state intervention-but their impact on mobilities is contested. The concepts of enfolded and substitutable mobilities, and of scapes and flows, are explained and used as intermediary concepts for engaging with the key relationships influencing tourism mobilities. Path dependency is shown to be backed by existing technologies, cultures and markets, together with deeply embedded scapes and substantial investments in existing infrastructure. Trends towards path creation are shown to depend on technological breakthroughs, including virtual tourism, alternative lifestyles bringing cultural change, market conditions brought about by possible sustained high oil <b>prices,</b> <b>and</b> state <b>intervention</b> leading to behavioural change. The concept of "path-dependent path-creation" is discussed along with the powerful influence of uncertainties and unknown future tipping-points. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{sequential}} bargaining under {{asymmetric information}} often exhibit equilibria which are characterised {{by the fact}} that agreement is reached only with a delay and that the final (period) solution is ex ante inefficient. The latter means that agreement is not reached though it is efficient (aggregate pay off exceeds aggregate costs). In this paper we analyse how intervention by a third agent in a sequential bargaining process, modelled as a durable goods monopoly, affects the (high path) equilibrium outcome. The effects of intervention crucially depend on how intervention is formulated. When the intervening agent and the seller decides the <b>price</b> <b>and</b> the subsidy (the intervening agent’s contribution) is decided in a Stackelberg game with the intervening agent as the leader the negotiations are always speeded up and equilibrium inefficiency reduced. When the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader the negotiations are only conditionally speeded up and the equilibrium inefficiency only conditionally reduced. For the same values on the reservation <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> discount factor <b>intervention</b> is more likely to take place when the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader.

The triumphs in agriculture are emblematic of post-war American progress and expansion but do not accurately depict the evolution of American agriculture throughout an entire century of agricultural depression and economic failure. Some characteristics of this evolution are unprecedented efficiency in terms of output per capita, rapid industrialization and mechanization, the gradual slip of agriculture's portion of GNP, and an exodus of millions of farmers from agriculture leading to fewer and larger farms. The purpose of this thesis is to provide an environmental history and political ecology of overproduction, which has lead to constant surpluses, federal <b>price</b> <b>and</b> subsidy <b>intervention,</b> <b>and</b> environmental concerns about sustainability and food safety. This project explores the political economy of output maximization during these years, roughly from WWI through the present, studying various environmental, economic, and social effects of overproduction and output maximization. The complex eco system of modern agriculture is heavily impacted by the political and economic systems in which it is intrinsically embedded, obfuscating hopes of food and agricultural reforms on many different levels. Overproduction and surplus are central to modern agriculture and to the food that has fueled American bodies for decades.
