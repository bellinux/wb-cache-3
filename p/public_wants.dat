500|$|A {{contract}} was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year, which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – {{one of the}} highest paid people in the world. The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: [...] "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the <b>public</b> <b>wants</b> Chaplin and will pay for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Fitzpatrick of NME {{characterized}} Beyoncé's {{breathing heavily}} while grabbing the [...] "imaginary" [...] bedsheets but remained a [...] "devout young Christian woman singing what the <b>public</b> <b>wants</b> her to sing." [...] Describing [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times {{commented that the}} song features [...] "an unusually high-pitched Beyoncé singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyoncé's singing [...] "not quite convincingly a naughty girl". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said {{it was fun to}} hear Beyoncé mimicking [...] "the pizzicato line" [...] in [...] "Naughty Girl", and that it was not much fun to hear her try to sing [...] "like a naughty girl". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that [...] "Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant".|$|E
500|$|No Limit was {{followed}} by Keep Your Seats, Please in 1936, which was again directed by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Tensions arose in pre-production with Banks {{and some of the}} cast requesting to Dean that Beryl be banned from the set. Tempers had also become strained between Formby and Desmond, who were not on speaking terms except to film scenes. The situation became so bad that Dean avoided visiting his studios for the month of filming. The film contained the song [...] "The Window Cleaner" [...] (popularly known as [...] "When I'm Cleaning Windows"), which was soon banned by the BBC. The corporation's director John Reith stated that [...] "if the <b>public</b> <b>wants</b> to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they'll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nation's airwaves"; Formby and Beryl were furious with the block on the song. In May 1941 Beryl informed the BBC that the song was a favourite of the royal family, particularly Queen Mary, while a statement by Formby pointed out that [...] "I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance". The BBC relented and started to broadcast the song.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930 Stout said: [...] "Aviation in the U.S. {{has been}} stagnating for two years. We are all copying.

2500|$|The {{great thing}} about Kylie is that she differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the <b>public</b> <b>wants</b> to see. Most are concerned with reproducing a certain logo or caricature of themselves. They want to cling on to an image developed years ago which makes things difficult {{because there is no}} room to take a picture, you aren't really forced to improvise which is when the best things happen. Every photographer has their own very personal vision of her, and she lets them have it. That is the big difference with Kylie, that she walks in and says 'This is me, {{what are you going to}} do with it.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Each {{character}}, whether {{animal or}} human, {{above or below}} the pier, is {{an aspect of the}} one central character voiced by the aging music hall artiste, Soliquisto. [...] Soliquisto may be lost in memories but he's still canny. [...] (What My <b>Public</b> <b>Wants)</b> [...] The plot is fairly simple and endearingly odd, but the underlying ideas are more complex. [...] Basically, Stinkfoot is a portrait of the artist’s creative heart and mind. [...] Soliquisto believes what he has made must remain in his control or his art is lost. [...] By the end of Stinkfoot he realizes nothing is ever lost, that he can let his creations go, that once he (or she) has created something it takes {{on a life of its}} own, and that the artist can always make more. [...] (Only Being Myself) [...] With this lesson learned, Soliquisto, who has made nothing new since Stinkfoot disappeared, sees Elma the Electrifying Elver dancing on the beach. [...] (Drowned Sailor's Dream) [...] Ah! [...] Here is his new creation, his latest work of art. [...] He will make her a star! [...] The act of creation is forever…it goes on and on.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the <b>public</b> <b>wants</b> today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when they step into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E

50|$|In the Southeast and Midwest, the {{resulting}} shortage of cash was so serious that local clearinghouses issued emergency notes against collateral pledged by cooperating banks {{so that people}} could carry on business.

60|$|The {{demands of}} this poor public are not reasonable, {{but they are}} quite simple. It dreads disease and desires to be {{protected}} against it.

What the <b>public</b> <b>wants,</b> therefore, is a cheap magic charm to prevent, and a cheap pill or potion to cure, all disease. It forces all such charms on the doctors.|$|E

25|$|As {{the medical}} {{profession}} continued to develop in line with Western scientific advances of the time, the <b>public</b> <b>wanted</b> to legally regulate medical organisations.

50|$|One {{aspect of}} this blurred {{distinction}} between myth and history is Ramsay's lifelong preoccupation with {{the lives of the}} Saints.
