30|$|Are {{private sector}} {{provisions}} {{easier to make}} portable? Not necessarily, and in any case, this would only be relevant for long-term contingencies—retirement and health care. Private saving offers a first defense against many financial risks in life, and money should be easy to carry when moving from country to country. However, finding reliable financial institutions {{at home and abroad}} to park the money remains a challenge. In addition, private sector pension arrangements often profit from tax privileges during the accumulation phase that countries increasingly take back when leaving the country and the exit tax may be sizable. Private health care insurance is not easily portable between countries (or even within countries) so that sizable savings elements get lost when moving. Even within the EU, private <b>provisions</b> (<b>for</b> <b>pension</b> and health care) are much less portable than public and mandated ones. This has given rise to pan-European or international private programs in health and preparation of a pan-European fund <b>for</b> supplementary <b>pension</b> benefits.|$|R

One hears a great deal of this ingratitude of republics, but few take the trouble of examining into the truth of the charge, or its reason, if true. I suppose the charge to be true in part, and for the obvious reason that a government founded on the popular will, is necessarily impulsive in such matters, and feels no necessity to be just, in order to be secure. Then, a democracy is always subject to the influence of the cant of economy, which is next thing to the evil of being exposed to the waste and cupidity of those who take because they have the power. As respects the soldiers of the revolution, however, America, under the impulsive feeling, rather than in obedience to a calm, deliberate desire to be just, has, since the time of Mr. Mordaunt Littlepage, made such a liberal <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>pensioning</b> them, as to include a good many of her enemies, as well as all her friends.--EDITOR.] ...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the role that Social Security <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> old-age <b>pensions</b> play in the retirement decision of Spanish workers and to evaluate the effects of the 2002 reform. We propose to estimate a model for retirement that captures the effects of pension incentives on the timing of the pension claim.

40|$|Self-employed workers {{make up a}} {{small but}} {{significant}} minority of the workforce in many OECD countries. This paper reviews three key aspects of pension schemes available to self-employed workers: coverage, contributions and benefits. Key findings include {{the fact that the}} self-employed are covered by the same pension schemes as those of employees in the majority of countries. One important difference is that, while employees share the contribution burden with their employers, the self-employed workers in most cases pay the full pension contribution from their own income. The rules <b>for</b> <b>pension</b> entitlements, on the other hand, are usually almost identical to those that apply to employees. One key conclusion emerging from this paper is that the <b>pension</b> <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> the self-employed is a matter of practical implementation of existing schemes rather than overhauling <b>pension</b> rules <b>for</b> these schemes.   Low coverage is a common problem for this group in some OECD countries, as they belong to the informal sector and their incomes are hard to identify. Contribution evasion or under-reporting of income by the self-employed is prevalent even in some countries with high per capita income. This has implications as these self-employed workers will have lower levels of pension incomes at retirement.   In some cases, low contributions coupled with relatively generous pension rights also raise an issue of equity in the <b>provision</b> of <b>pensions</b> <b>for</b> the self-employed and employees...|$|R

40|$|In an Article {{published}} in the April 1987 issue of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, I urged that the three major components of this nation 2 ̆ 7 s retirement income system—Social Security, and income tax preferences <b>for</b> both employer-sponsored <b>pension</b> plans and individual retirement savings—be analyzed as a comprehensive national retirement income security program. I demonstrated that such an integrated view of this tripartite retirement security system reveals serious problems both with Social Security and with the generally applauded 2 ̆ 2 tax expenditure 2 ̆ 2 <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> private <b>pensions</b> and individual savings. Viewing the three elements as a unified retirement security arrangement demonstrates that the core unfairness of this nation 2 ̆ 7 s retirement security program is the regressivity of its taxing structure and the incapacity of low- and moderate-wage earners to maintain post-retirement their prior standard of living. Significantly, this conclusion contradicts directly the contentions of many critics of social security who complain about its failure to replicate the payment and distribution structure of an 2 ̆ 2 actuarially fair 2 ̆ 2 insurance system. In the May 1988 issue of this law review, Professor Nancy J. Altman criticized my analysis. She complains that my 2 ̆ 2 limited focus 2 ̆ 2 is grounded 2 ̆ 2 solely 2 ̆ 2 in 2 ̆ 2 the perspective of tax policy, 2 ̆ 2 asserts that I 2 ̆ 2 would inadvertently weaken the long-run stability of Social Security by transforming it from a social insurance program to a welfare program, 2 ̆ 2 and presents her 2 ̆ 2 defense 2 ̆ 2 of tax expenditures <b>for</b> employer-sponsored <b>pension</b> plans.

40|$|Financial <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> old age is {{a serious}} issue. This paper {{therefore}} begins by outlining the pension situation in Germany, arriving at the conclusion that, as matters stand at present, {{none of the three}} "pillars" of pension provision - state and occupational pensions and private pension schemes - can sufficiently guarantee adequate retirement income in the future. Given increasing population ageing in Germany <b>for</b> one, <b>provision</b> must focus particularly on fully funded private provisioning and also partly on occupational pension plans.

This horizon effect can be put to use for asset allocation, as illustrated with reference to a model based on the shortfall probability (zeroth order lower partial moment, LMP 0).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} savings {{behaviour}} of German households, especially their capability and their reasons to save. We find that {{about one third}} of private households do not save at all while about 50 percent of the households save very regularly. Savings rates appear {{to be related to}} socio-demographic characteristics like family status or education. While we find saving to acquire a property and saving <b>for</b> old-age <b>provision</b> {{to be the most important}} reasons to save, looking at the subjective relevance addressed to them, no substitution between the different savings motives appears. Saving motives, however, appear to exert a displacement effect when looking at actual savings for old- age. Furthermore, we address more specifically saving <b>for</b> old-age <b>provision</b> by examining the experiences which have been made so far with the newly introduced, state-promoted private pension plans (“Riester“ pensions). As in other western countries, also in Germany it took time before the introduction of this new form of subsidised saving took off. The actual proliferation of Riester pension plans is highly dynamic, however, and current rates of growth outstrip by far the steady growth experienced in the USA. It is striking that the acceleration in Riester saving only really kicked in after substantial simplifications had been made to the scheme. The subsidy design rewards parents and workers with low income. Indeed, the social group better reached by the reform is that of parents with more than one child. With respect to disposable household income, however, the underlying SAVE data show that the proportion of Riester pensioners is much smaller in the lowest than in the middle and upper income brackets of the household income distribution. Therefore, the considerable financial incentives provided by the allowances alone are not effective on low income households. The key to achieve high take up rates is information or knowledge about the necessity of and arrangements relating to old-age pension provision. Respondents with higher educational attainments, in fact, are more likely to make use of Riester subsidies than people who leave school with a lower qualification. In the same direction points the fact that <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> private <b>pensions</b> correlate positively with the awareness of the future pension level. ...|$|R
