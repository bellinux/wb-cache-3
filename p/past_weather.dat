50|$|In the <b>past,</b> <b>weathering</b> of {{silicate}} rocks sequestered CO2, {{a negative}} feedback loop which maintained Earth’s climate within a habitable range over millions of years. When atmospheric CO2 concentration rise, temperature and precipitation increase and thereby enhance chemical weathering. The last time global temperature reached a long-term maximum was during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, 51-53 million years ago (See also Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum). Only over the past 34 million years have CO2 concentrations been low, temperatures relatively cool, and the poles glaciated. This long- term shift in Earth’s climatic state resulted, in part from differences in volcanic emissions, which were particularly high during parts of the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs (about 40-60 million years ago) but have diminished since then.|$|R

40|$|In-situ {{weathered}} bedrock, saprolite, is locally {{found in}} Scandinavia, {{where it is}} commonly thought to represent pre-Pleistocene weathering possibly associated with landscape formation. The age of weathering, however, remains loosely constrained, which {{has an impact on}} existing geological and landscape evolution models and morphotectonic correlations. Here we provide new geochronological evidence that some of the low-altitude basement landforms on- and offshore southwestern Scandinavia are a rejuvenated geomorphological relic from Mesozoic times. K-Ar dating of authigenic, syn-weathering illite from saprolitic remnants constrains original basement exposure in the Late Triassic (221. 3 ± 7. 0 – 206. 2 ± 4. 2 [*]Ma) through deep weathering in a warm climate and subsequent partial mobilization of the saprolitic mantle into the overlying sediment cascade system. The data support the bulk geomorphological development of west Scandinavia coastal basement rocks during the Mesozoic and later, long-lasting relative tectonic stability. Pleistocene glaciations played an additional geomorphological role, selectively stripping the landscape from the Mesozoic overburden and carving glacial landforms down to Plio–Pleistocene times. Saprolite K-Ar dating offers unprecedented possibilities to study <b>past</b> <b>weathering</b> and landscape evolution processes...|$|R

We analyzed a continuous sedimentary record over the last 13 Ma. Heavy-mineral and petrography data give insight into diagenesis and provenance, showing that the older part of the section is influenced by diagenesis and that sediments were not only deposited by a large Trans-Himalayan river and the palaeo-Kameng river, but also by smaller local tributaries. By taking into account changes in diagenesis and provenance, results of clay mineralogy and major element analysis show an overall increase in weathering intensity over time, with a remarkable change between ~ 10 and ~ 8 Ma...|$|R

50|$|The Weather Stress Index, or WSI, is a {{relative}} measure of the weather conditions, often used as a comfort indicator. The index, a number between 0 and 100, represents the percentage {{of time in the}} past with temperatures below the current temperature, for a given location, day and time. This makes the index a local measure based in <b>past</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. For example, if for a given location, on the 25th of July at 13:00 UTC the WSI is 85 for a temperature of 42 C, this means that the temperature was inferior to 42 °C in 85% of the time in the past, on the same place, on the 25th of July at 13:00 UTC (and superior to 42 °C in 15% of the time on the same place, day and hour). In other words, the WSI gives the probability of finding a smaller temperature in the local weather history, at a given day and time, than that of the present measurement. Therefore, high values of WSI predict {{a relative}} discomfort from excessive heat for local inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|The {{tropical}} weathering of sedimentary kaolin deposits {{from the}} plateaux surrounding Manaus (Alter do Chao formation, Amazon basin, Brazil) {{leads to the}} in situ formation of thick kaolinitic soils. The structural changes of kaolinite have been investigated quantitatively by infrared spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. Both techniques consistently show that each sample contains two types of kaolinite in various proportions. The progressive decrease in kaolinite order from the bottom {{to the top of}} the profile results from the gradual replacement of an old population of well-ordered kaolinite, typical of the underlying sedimentary kaolin, by a more recent generation of poorly ordered soil kaolinite. The vertical pattern of kaolinite replacement differs from that of the transformation of Fe oxides and oxyhydroxides previously observed in the same profile. The inherited fraction of well-ordered kaolinite ranges from 60 % at a depth of 9 in to 30 % in the upper levels of the soil. The persistence of sedimentary kaolinite in the upper horizons suggests that the rate of kaolinite transformation is relatively slow at the time scale of lateritic soil formation.

40|$|Implicit in the {{mnemonic}} 'MSATT' (Mars {{surface and}} atmosphere through time) is that rates of surface processes on Mars through {{time should be}} investigated, including studies of the kinetics and mechanism of oxidative weathering reactions occurring in the Martian regolith. Such measurements are described. Two major elements analyzed in the Viking Lander XRF experiment that are most vulnerable to atmospheric oxidation are iron and sulfur. Originally, they occurred as Fe(2 +) -bearing silicate and sulfide minerals in basaltic rocks {{on the surface of}} Mars. However, chemical weathering reactions through time have produced ferric- and sulfate-bearing assemblages now visible in the Martian regolith. Such observations raise several question about: (1) when the oxidative weathering reactions took place on Mars; (2) whether or not the oxidized regolith is a fossilized remnant of <b>past</b> <b>weathering</b> processes; (3) deducting chemical interactions of the ancient Martian atmosphere with its surface from surviving phases; (4) possible weathering reactions still occurring in the frozen regolith; and (5) the kinetics and mechanism of past and present-day oxidative reactions on Mars.

5000|$|Medicocriminal {{entomology}} is {{the branch}} of forensic entomology dealing {{with the use of}} arthropod evidence in criminal investigations. Because they make up the first wave of fauna to colonize a corpse, blowflies are among the most accurate forensic indicators of time elapsed since death, technically referred to as the post-mortem interval (PMI). This estimation is made by determining the developmental stages of the insects present on a body. Protophormia terraenovae is forensically important because of its extremely specific developmental time. Two methods are used to determine the PMI of a P. terraenovae-infested body. One approach utilizes information about the developmental stages of larvae located on or within the body, and the second utilizes facts about the larval stage as it emerges from the body to pupate. [...] The first, second, and third instar larvae present on a body are considered to be feeding stages. The first and second molting are characterized by rapid increases in size and generally occur within a certain range of larval length. Because the development of these flies is dependent on temperature, entomologists can use <b>past</b> <b>weather</b> data to estimate the ages of larvae and even pupae discovered on a corpse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biosphere}} reserve {{is home to}} the largest area of juniper forest (Juniperus excelsa) in Pakistan, covering about 110,000 hectares. It is believed that the forest is the second largest {{of its kind in the}} world. The juniper species found there are of global significance because of their advanced age and slow growth rate. In fact, the junipers of Ziarat are among the oldest living trees in the world. Although no dendrological study has yet been conducted, according to one estimate, the age of a mature tree in Ziarat can exceed 5,000 years. Local people refer to the trees as [...] "living fossils". Their remarkable longevity allows research on <b>past</b> <b>weather</b> conditions in the region, making the species of particular significance for studies on climate change and ecology.The juniper forest ecosystem of Ziarat provides a habitat for endangered wildlife species and supports a rich variety of plant species. Because of the ecosystem's biodiversity, various parts of it have been designated protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves. The mountain ranges, including the Khilafat Hills, consist of a core habitat that reportedly hosts several globally important wild species, among them markhors, urials, black bears and wolves. The forest also serves as a habitat for a number of other animals: Afghan pikas, foxes, jackals and several species of migratory birds. However, anthropological factors such as illegal hunting, human habitations and livestock grazing have encroached on the wildlife habitats, leading to their fragmentation. The human population, distributed across various sub-tribes and clans, is concentrated in valleys, although small settlements are visible on mountain slopes. There are over 100,000 people living within or in close proximity to the {{biosphere reserve}}, most of whom are agropastoralists. Almost 40 percent of the population migrates for three to four months during the winter to abodes in Harnai.Livestock was formerly the primary source of livelihood in the reserve. Today, it has been displaced by the development of agriculture and, in particular, the promotion of horticultural crops such as apple and cherry orchards.|$|E

40|$|Lithium {{and calcium}} isotope ratios, {{together}} with the Li/Ca element ratio, have been measured in calcites precipitated inorganically at temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 °C, and on seasonal growth bands from a coral. These measurements indicate the potential uses of these three environmental proxies. Carbonate Li isotopes are lighter than the solution from which they grow, probably due to equilibrium fractionation. This fractionation is not significantly influenced by temperature and, because Li {{is not involved in}} any known biological process, this suggests that carbonates will provide a recorder for the past Li-isotope composition of natural waters and hence for <b>past</b> <b>weathering</b> conditions. As has been observed previously for inorganic aragonite, the Ca-isotopes in inorganic calcite are lighter than the growth solution, and are only weakly dependent on temperature. This confirms that the temperature dependence observed in some species of foraminifera [Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst. 1 (2001) ] reflects additional isotope fractionation due to biological processes during mineralization. Ca isotopes may therefore provide a powerful tool with which to investigate the processes of biomineralization. Finally, Li/Ca ratios in inorganic and biogenic carbonates increase as temperatures decrease with a sensitivity of ≈ 4 % per °C. This temperature dependence of Li/Ca may prove useful to assess past temperatures in cold environments such as the deep ocean. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
