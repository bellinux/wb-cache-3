30|$|Water {{repellency}} steadily {{increased at}} soil depths of 5 cm and 10 cm from June to September as SMC decreased. This progression was also noted, although {{to a lesser}} extent, for unburned soil. Many studies have reported that summer drying allows water repellency to return (Dekker et al. 1998, Shakesby et al. 2000). Crockford et al. (1991) noted that soil repellency required only six to nine hot, dry days to become reestablished in a sclerophyllous forest in Australia. In our study, however, it appeared that both soil drying <b>and</b> <b>pile</b> <b>burning</b> contributed to water repellency, as noted by the higher level of repellency beneath large-wood <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> mixed-slash <b>piles</b> compared to unburned soil despite similar SMC levels (Figure 3). In contrast, Pierson et al. (2008) found that dry-season variability had {{a greater impact on}} soil water repellency than fire itself. We believe that the coarse-textured soils in the LTB were a contributing factor to the trends in water repellency based on the observation of Crockford et al. (1991) that coarse particles are more prone to coating of hydrophobic compounds than finer particles due to their low surface area per unit volume.|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{treatments}} are necessary in many vegetated {{areas of the}} Sierra Nevada to mitigate the effects of decades of fire suppression and land-management activities on fuel accumulations and understory canopies. Treating fuels will reduce the severity of wildfires and, as a result, the threat to human lives, the destruction of property and valuable resources, and the alteration of natural fire regimes. This chapter describes {{the use of a}} deterministic fire-modeling approach to obtain information about the relative effectiveness of fuel treatments, including fuel breaks, prescribed burning, biomassing, <b>piling</b> <b>and</b> <b>burning,</b> and cutting and scattering. Wildfire spread was simulated under idealized conditions to see how specific fuel and stand treatments affect fire behavior. It was obvious from the simulations that fuel breaks alone do not halt the spread of wildfire. Prescribed burning appears to be the most effective treatment for reducing a fire's rate of spread, fireline intensity, flame length, and heat per unit of area. A management scheme that includes a combination of fuel treatments in conjunction with other land-management scenarios should be successful in reducing the size and intensity of wildfires...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Forest fires pose a {{great risk}} to nearby {{communities}} and dwellings. Many forest managers {{work to reduce}} such risks by managing fuels. Efforts are underway to understand the economics and the logistics required to extract harvested forest biomass for utilization instead of the conventional disposal method of <b>piling</b> <b>and</b> <b>burning</b> on-site. Benefits from biomass utilization are multiple and include reduced impacts to air quality, improved forest health, economic opportunities, local renewable energy production and climate change mitigation. Trials in the Superior National Forest examined the feasibility of using conventional equipment to extract and utilize forest biomass compared with disposal of biomass with pile and burn techniques. Factors that increase the costs of biomass utilization include: machinery down-time, distance to end users, low biomass price, size of the harvest unit, forwarding distance, the number of machines hauled to sites to complete small sized operations, the modest amount of biomass removed per acre and applying prescriptions that were not designed for extraction logistics.

This is commonly assumed to have also occurred in the oak woodlands, shrub lands and grasslands of southwestern Oregon.

Since non-coniferous ecosystems of southwest Oregon were seldom studied, researchers hoped to achieve a greater understanding of the ecosystems by studying the plant communities and their relation with the environment such as slope, elevation and soils. Researchers also needed to gather information about the region’s historical condition as well as observe how plant communities in the chaparral components of the area responded to thinning treatments. Above all, researchers sought to determine the effectiveness and consequences of these treatments—not only for the native and non-native plant species, but for ecosystem preservation and restoration...|$|E
30|$|Density and {{occurrence}} of giant sequoia regeneration were {{positively associated with}} or related to canopy gaps. Across all control and low- to moderate-severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps, especially small-sized (< 0.4 ha) gaps. Similarly in wildfire and retention harvest stands, density of giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge in all groves but not all size classes. Giant sequoia seedlings and saplings have been demonstrated to be largely associated with canopy gaps (Harvey et al. 1980, Stephenson et al. 1991, Demetry 1995), particularly in gaps exceeding 0.3 ha to 0.8 ha (Piirto and Rogers 2002). In the central and southern Sierra Nevada, canopy gap creation (0.1 ha to 1 ha in size) using group selection treatments followed by <b>pile</b> <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> sequoia planting resulted in increased growth of giant sequoia seedlings and saplings (York et al. 2004, 2011).|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{differential}} effect of solar radiation on seedling establishment under a forest stand was studied {{to develop a}} basis for controlling species composition in the regenerating stand. The study was carried out on the Oregon Coast where current silvicultural practice is to clearcut mature stands and establish Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings in full sunlight. While generally favorable for conifer seedlings, the clearcut environment also favors growth of competing red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) which often overtops and suppresses the conifers. An exploratory study in a Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas-fir stand on gentle topography indicated the mechanics of manipulating canopy density could be handled without difficulty but removal of the overstory after seedling establishment {{needed to be done}} with care to avoid damage to seedlings. Logging slash was readily disposed of by <b>piling</b> <b>and</b> <b>burning</b> and the mature stand suffered only light storm damage even though a very severe windstorm occurred during the study period. Many Sitka spruce and western hemlock, some Douglas-fir, and no red alder seedlings became established under the forest canopy, but species differences were influenced by differences in seed supply. Competing vegetation increased following thinning of the forest canopy but generally did not prevent establishment of conifer seedlings. In the main study scarified plots were established under a 118 -year-old stand thinned to provide a range in canopy density and, therefore, in solar radiation reaching the forest floor. Establishment and growth of seedlings originating from natural seedfall and artificial seeding were measured and related to solar radiation by regression analysis. Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas-fir seedlings all became established more readily on mineral soil under the forest canopy than red alder. The ratio of viable seeds sown in the spring to established seedlings in the fall was 5. 8 for the conifers compared to 46. 7 for alder. The intensity of solar radiation had surprisingly little effect on seedling establishment even though intensities ranged from less than ten to almost 70 percent of radiation in the open. Radiation played a more important role in first-season growth. Spruce and hemlock growth increased with radiation up to an average daily radiation of about 150 Langleys or 50 percent of radiation in the open, then decreased at higher radiation levels. Red alder's response was similar with the optimum at about 39 percent of full sunlight. Growth of Douglas-fir continued upward at higher radiation levels, exhibiting a growth response significantly different from the other species. Red alder, generally recognized as an intolerant tree, appeared to be very tolerant of shade during its first and probably its second growing season. Starting from a smaller seed, it outgrew spruce and hemlock at low radiation levels indicating a basic photosynthetic efficiency surpassing these conifers. The downtrend in growth of spruce, hemlock, and alder at the higher radiation levels apparently was caused by high soil moisture tension and did not occur in a supplemental study where seedlings were watered. Even in the moist coastal climate soil moisture is apparently an important environmental factor limiting first-season seedling growth...|$|E
40|$|Emission {{from field}} burning of crop residue, a common {{practice}} {{in many parts of}} the world today, has potential effects on air quality, atmosphere and climate. This study provides a comprehensive size and compositional characterization of particulate matter (PM) emission from rice straw (RS) burning using both in situ experiments (11 spread field <b>burning)</b> <b>and</b> laboratory hood experiments (3 <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> 6 spread <b>burning)</b> that were conducted during 2003 - 2006 in Thailand. The carbon balance and emission ratio method was used to determine PM emission factors (EF) in the field experiments. The obtained EFs varied from field to hood experiments reflecting multiple factors affecting combustion and emission. In the hood experiments, EFs were found to be depending on the burning types (spread or <b>pile),</b> moisture content <b>and</b> the combustion efficiency. In addition, in the field experiments, <b>burning</b> rate <b>and</b> EF were also influenced by weather conditions, i. e. wind. Hood pile burning produced significantly higher EF (20 +/- 8 g kg(- 1) RS) than hood spread burning (4. 7 +/- 2. 2 g kg(- 1) RS). The majority of PM emitted from the field burning was PM(2. 5) with EF of 5. 1 +/- 0. 7 g m(- 2) or 8. 3 +/- 2. 7 g kg(- 1) RS burned. The coarse PM fraction (PM(10 - 2. 5)) was mainly generated by fire attention activities and was relatively small, hence the resulting EF of PM(10) (9. 4 +/- 3. 5 g kg(- 1) RS) was not significantly higher than PM(2. 5). PM size distribution was measured across 8 size ranges (from 9. 0 mum). The largest fractions of PM, EC and OC were associated with PM(1. 1). The most significant components in PM(2. 5) and PM(10) include OC, water soluble ions and levoglucosan. Relative abundance of some methoxyphenols (e. g., acetylsyringone), PAHs (e. g., fluoranthene and pyrene), organochlorine pesticides and PCBs may also serve as additional signatures for the PM emission. Presence of these toxic compounds in PM of burning smoke increases the potential toxic effects of the emission. For illustration, estimation of the annual RS field burning in Thailand was made using the obtained in situ field <b>burning</b> EFs <b>and</b> preliminary <b>burning</b> activity dat...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by the Society for Range Management and can be found at: [URL] juniper has increased in density and distribution in the interior Pacific Northwest since the late 1800 s. Management goals for many juniper woodlands are now focused on reducing tree densities and promoting biodiversity, prompting the use of fuel reduction treatments. Fuel reduction often involves mechanical cutting and disturbances such as slash <b>pile</b> <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> skid trail formation. While these activities may reduce tree densities, {{the extent to which they}} will restore native biodiversity and community composition, particularly in woodlands invaded by exotic annual grasses, is unclear. We evaluated the effects of juniper cutting in two experiments of disturbance type (slash <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> skid trails) followed by three native seeding treatments (cultivar, locally sourced, and no seed) on vegetation in central Oregon. Prior to cutting, native perennial grass cover and richness were positively associated and exotic grass cover was negatively associated with juniper basal area. After cutting and 2 yr after seeding, species composition was altered for both disturbance types. Some seeded areas had higher total species richness, higher native species richness, higher cover of seeded species, and higher overall cover compared to areas that were not seeded. But seeding effectiveness in mitigating exotic species spread varied based on exotic species functional group, pretreatment propagule pressure, and experiment disturbance type. Neither seed mix lowered exotic grass cover. There was limited evidence that the cultivar mix outperformed the locally sourced native seed mix. In the short term, fuel reduction activities may have facilitated further conversion of this woodland to an exotic grassland, but longer-term evaluation is needed. In juniper woodlands that have been invaded by exotic species, fuel reduction activities may facilitate further invasion, and exotic species control may be needed to limit invasion and promote native vegetation...|$|R
