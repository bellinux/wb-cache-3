40|$|Thermal reactivities of lignin {{pyrolysis}} intermediates, catechols/pyrogallols (O-CH 3 homolysis products) and cresols/xylenols (OCH 3 rearrangement products), {{were studied}} {{in a closed}} ampoule reactor (N 2 / 600 °C / 40 – 600 s) to understand their roles in the secondary reactions step. Reactivity tends to be enhanced by {{increasing the number of}} substituent groups on phenol and this effect was greater for-OH than for-CH 3. Thus, catechols/pyrogallols were more reactive than cresols/xylenols and syringol-derived products were more reactive than corresponding guaiacol-derived products. Catechols/ <b>pyrogallols</b> were effectively converted into CO (additionally CO 2 in the case of <b>pyrogallols)</b> in the early stage of pyrolysis. In contrast, cresols/xylenols were comparatively stable and produced H 2, CH 4 and demethylation products (cresols and phenol) after prolonged heating. All intermediates except phenol and 2 -ethylphenol formed coke during a long heating time of 600 s (second stage coking). Based on the present results, the roles of intermediates in tar, coke and gas formation from guaiacol and syringol are discussed at the molecular level, focusing on their differences. Molecular mechanisms of gas formation from <b>pyrogallols</b> and demethylation of cresols/ xylenols are also discussed. Keywords...|$|R
30|$|Leather {{has been}} used since ancient and medieval times for many {{purposes}} [13 – 15]. The corium is the raw material used for leather manufacturing which consists of a tight network of collagen fibres and fibrils [16]. Animal skin has been tanned through the ages using different tannages such as vegetable tannins [17, 18]. Vegetable tanning {{is based on the}} treatment of animal skins using natural sources of condensed tannins (catechols) found in acacia, mimosa and pine, as well as hydrolysable tannins (<b>pyrogallols)</b> such as oak wood, gulls and sumac leaves [1, 16 – 19]. Animal skin collagen protein interacts with the large molecules in vegetable tannins which transform the skin into leather with greater stability and resistance to microbial attack, comparing to non-treated skins [16].|$|R
30|$|When the {{pyrolysis}} {{temperature is}} increased to 400 – 450 [*]°C, secondary pyrolysis reactions take place and guaiacols/syringols rapidly transition to catechols (2 -hydroxyphenols)/pyrogallols (2, 3 -dihydroxyphenols) and o-cresols (2 -methylphenols)/xylenols (dimethylphenols) along with phenols (Fig.  2). In this temperature range, cracking of side-chain C−C bonds occurs, {{which increases the}} yields of monomers. The reaction products transition from unsaturated to saturated alkyls side chains (methyl, ethyl, propyl, 3 -hydroxypropyl and others) and non-substituted (−H) types. Coke and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation also starts. Around 550 [*]°C, catechols and <b>pyrogallols</b> disappear and non-condensable gas yields (particularly CO) significantly increase. At temperatures[*]> 700 [*]°C the formation of PAHs is enhanced. Phenols and o-cresols are relatively stable at such high temperatures; hence, these compounds are observed along with PAHs even during high-temperature pyrolysis.|$|R

30|$|When the {{pyrolysis}} {{temperature is}} further increased to 550 – 600 [*]°C, decomposition of catechols and pyrogarolls into non-condensable gases (mainly CO) occurs. Ledesma et al. [103] reported that gas-phase pyrolysis of catechol gives CO (approximately 50  wt%) and acetylene (20  wt%) at 800 [*]°C (with residence time 0.4  s). The gas formation mechanism {{has also been}} explained as illustrated in Fig.  11. The mechanism is based on reports that suggest the phenoxy radical undergoes unimolecular decomposition into CO and a cyclopentadienyl radical. The catechol radical decomposes into CO and a cycrolentadienol-lyl radical, which then further decomposes to cyclopentadienone. The cyclopentadienone fragments decompose into CO and two acetylene molecules. Although the exact details of the formation mechanism are unknown, <b>pyrogallols</b> that are formed from the S-type lignins typically produce large amounts of CO 2 along with CO [96].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cyclophosphamide {{is used as}} an anti cancer {{medicine}} in chemotherapy. This is an alkalizing medicine and causes the binding of DNA strands, breaking of DNA and control of protein synthesis and RNA. The side effects of this {{medicine in}}clude lack of appetite, nausea, reduction in activity of sexual lymph nodes, causing amenorrhea, azoospermia and oligospermia. Ginger includes many compounds, {{some of which are}} shogaols, gingerols, <b>pyrogallols</b> and sesquiterpenes. Ginger has anti nauseating, anti cancer, anti oxidant effects and eliminates free radicals. This medicine is used along with cyclophosphamide to reduce its destructive side effects in the body. Methods: For 21 days, the rats were fed with ginger and cyclophosphamide. After 21 days, the animals were weighed and rendered unconscious. Their testes were removed and tissue samples were provided from their testes. Results: The results showed that cyclophosphamide alone reduces body weight, testes weight and spermatogenesis as compared to the control group. In other experimental groups that were fed with ginger and cyclophosphamide, increased dosage of ginger increased the body weight, the testes weight and spermatogenesis in comparison to the other experimental groups. Conclusion: It seems that compounds present in ginger are anti tumoral and control the production of active metabolites. Therefore, if administered together with Cyclophosphamide, it can be useful and effective in patients undergoing chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{beneficial}} {{health effects}} of cranberries {{have been attributed to}} their (poly) phenol content. Recent studies have investigated the absorption, metabolism and excretion of cranberry (poly) phenols; however, little is known about whether they follow a dose response in vivo at different levels of intake. An acute double-blind randomized controlled trial in 10 healthy men with cranberry juices containing 409, 787, 1238, 1534 and 1910 mg total (poly) phenols was performed. Blood and urine were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Sixty metabolites were identified in plasma and urine including cinnamic acids, dihydrocinnamic, flavonols, benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, benzaldehydes, valerolactones, hippuric acids, catechols, and <b>pyrogallols.</b> Total plasma, but not excreted urinary (poly) phenol metabolites, exhibited a linear dose response (r 2 = 0. 74, p < 0. 05), driven by caffeic acid 4 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, quercetin- 3 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, ferulic acid 4 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid 3 -O-ß-d-glucuronide, sinapic acid, ferulic acid 4 -O-sulfate, 3 -hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid- 4 -O-sulfate, (4 R) - 5 -(3 ′-hydroxyphenyl) -γ-valerolactone- 4 ′-O-sulfate, 4 -methylgallic acid- 3 -O-sulfate, and isoferulic acid 3 -O-sulfate (all r 2 ≥ 0. 89, p < 0. 05). Inter-individual variability of the plasma metabolite concentration was broad and dependent on the metabolite. Herein, we show that specific plasma (poly) phenol metabolites are linearly related to the amount of (poly) phenols consumed in cranberry juice. The large inter-individual variation in metabolite profile may be due to variations in the gut microbiome...|$|R

40|$|Tannins {{account for}} a {{significant}} proportion of plant biomass and are likely to contribute to the residues formed by incomplete biomass combustion (black carbon, BC). Nonetheless, the molecular properties of thermally modified tannins have not been investigated in laboratory charring experiments. We applied conventional analytical pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM–GC–MS) to investigate the effects of heat treatment with a muffle furnace on the properties of condensed tannins (CT) from Corsican pine (Pinus nigra) needles. Py–GC–MS showed a decrease in the relative abundance of the 1, 2, 3 -trihydroxybenzenes (<b>pyrogallols)</b> at ⩾ 300 °C and of the dihydroxybenzenes (mainly catechols) at ⩾ 350 °C due to dehydroxylation of the CT B ring. Further dehydroxylation led to formation of monohydroxybenzenes (phenols), which showed a strong enrichment between 350 and 400 °C and, at higher temperatures, to a series of monocyclic and polycyclic aromatics [benzene, alkyl benzenes and polycondensed aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ]. Degradation of the A ring could not be recognized via Py–GC–MS, probably because of the poor chromatographic behavior of 1, 3, 5 -trihydroxybenzenes (phloroglucinols). The progressive dehydroxylation and eventual polycondensation of the CT B ring was corroborated using THM–GC–MS. In addition, with THM–GC–MS the thermal rearrangement of CT A rings at 300 °C and higher was inferred from the relative abundance of 1, 3, 5 -trimethoxybenzenes (methylated phloroglucinol derivatives). These compounds were observed at moderate/high temperature (up to 450 °C) and can not be produced from THM of lignin, suggesting that they may be markers of CT in natural BC samples...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] C-alkylpyrogallol[4]arenes {{have been}} studied by DFT {{computations}} and the results compared to experimental observations. Local minima of different conformers were located by geometry optimization of the trial structures using the B 3 LYP method and the 6 - 31 G(d,p) basis set. The electronic structure calculations were carried out to examine {{the role of the}} R-group and solvent on the preferred conformations and configurations of the macrocycles. To evaluate the effect of solvent on these properties, free energies of solvation were calculated using the SMD-PCM, IEF-PCM, and CPCM-PCM methods. Although the trends in the relative energies of the stereoisomers differ for the three methods, all three predict the same most stable structure for a given R-group. Modification of resorcin[4]arenes and pyrogallol[4]arenes with the use of mixed (3 pyrogallols: 1 resorcinol) macrocycles has been investigated to understand possible new chemical properties of the designed system. The lack of one hydroxyl group affects the intramolecular interactions and could change the properties of the system. Electronic structure calculations were employed to examine the relative stabilities of the stereoisomers of the macrocycle. In addition, the effect of the R-group and solvent on the properties of the macrocycle was considered. To comprehend the reactivity of the zinc-seamed pyrogallol[3]resorcin[1]arene dimeric mixed nanocapsule (3 <b>pyrogallols,</b> 1 resorcinol), the proton affinity of different sites was evaluated by DFT calculations using the PBE 1 PBE/LANL 2 DZ method. The most favored atoms for protonation were examined. The effect of introducing defects into the zinc-seamed pyrogallol[4]arene dimeric nanocapsule on characteristic electronic and chemical properties of the mixed capsule has been studied. Pyrogallol[4]arenes and resorcinol[4]arenes were chosen to assess their effectiveness for ion recognition and selectivity. Different approaches toward ion extractions by the macrocycles were considered. Metal binding of the cone structure of pyrogallol[4]arenes with linker groups R=H, Me, Et, Ph was evaluated by DFT calculations to investigate the effect of substituents on the binding energy of the metal ions Li+, Na+, K+, Be 2 +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + with the macrocycle. The same calculations were done with the chair structure of Cmethyl pyragallol[4]arene and the cone structure of C-methyl resorcinol[4]arene. A comparison of the extractability of compounds having different cavity sizes and carrying different functional groups at the arenes is discussed. Finally, possible activation methods for the leaving groups of S-benzimidazolyl glycosides and glycosyl alkoxythioimidates were examined. The effect of changing the substituent on the leaving group of the glycosyl donor on its electronic properties and structure was also investigated. The nucleophilicity difference between the heteroatoms towards promotors was calculated by DFT calculations. Possible mechanisms for activation were considered for different promoters to understand oligosaccharide assembly...|$|R
