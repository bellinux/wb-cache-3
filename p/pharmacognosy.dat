25|$|Research and {{teaching}} {{activities related to}} natural products fall {{into a number of}} different academic areas, including organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, <b>pharmacognosy,</b> ethnobotany, traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology. Other biological areas include chemical biology, chemical ecology, chemogenomics, and systems biology.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{origins of}} bitters {{can be traced}} back as far as the ancient Egyptians, who may have infused medicinal herbs in jars of wine. This practice was further developed during the Middle Ages, where the availability of distilled alcohol coincided with a renaissance in <b>pharmacognosy,</b> which made possible far more concentrated herbal bitters and tonic preparations. Many of the various brands and styles of digestive bitters made today reflect herbal stomachic and tonic preparations whose roots are claimed to be traceable back to Renaissance era pharmacopeia and traditions.|$|E
500|$|Botany (Greek [...] - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin [...] – herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, {{the core}} {{disciplines}} of biology whose history is {{closely associated with}} the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, <b>pharmacognosy,</b> economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.|$|E
2500|$|Natural {{products}} especially {{within the}} field of organic chemistry are often defined as primary and secondary metabolites. [...] A more restrictive definition limiting natural products to secondary metabolites is commonly used {{within the field}}s of medicinal chemistry and <b>pharmacognosy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pharmacognosy</b> {{provides}} {{the tools to}} identify, select and process natural products destined for medicinal use. [...] Usually, the natural product compound has some form of biological activity and that compound {{is known as the}} active principle - such a structure can evolve to become a discovery [...] "lead". In this and related ways, some current medicines are obtained directly from natural sources.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pharmacognosy,</b> the {{investigation}} of botanics used in indigenous medical traditions is essentially classical pharmacology. <b>Pharmacognosy</b> and classical pharmacology are both often contrasted with reverse pharmacology, that is, working from the target backward to identify new drugs starting with screening libraries of compounds for affinity for particular target. In <b>pharmacognosy,</b> folk medicines are first tested in clinical trials for efficacy. Only after efficacy has been established, is an effort made to determine the biologic target of the drug.|$|E
50|$|Crude {{drugs are}} {{unrefined}} medications in their raw or natural forms.
