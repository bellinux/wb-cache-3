[...] While fungi can breakdown many of these contaminants intracellularly, they also secrete numerous oxidative exoenzymes that work extracellularly. One critical aspect of fungi in regards to bioremediation is that they secrete these oxidative exoenzymes from their ever elongating hyphal tips. [...] Laccases are an important oxidative enzyme that fungi secrete and use oxygen to oxidize many pollutants. Some of the pollutants that laccases have been used to treat include dye-containing effluents from the textile industry, wastewater pollutants (chlorophenols, PAHs, etc.), and sulphur-containing compounds from coal processing.Bacteria are also a viable source of exoenzymes capable to facilitating the bioremediation of the environment. There are many examples of the use of bacteria for this purpose and their exoenzymes encompass many different classes of bacterial enzymes. Of particular interest in this field are bacterial hydrolases as they have an intrinsic low substrate specificity and can be used for numerous pollutants including solid wastes. [...] <b>Plastic</b> <b>wastes</b> including polyurethanes are particularly hard to degrade, but an exoenzyme has been identified in a Gram-negative bacterium, Comamonas acidovorans, that was capable of degrading polyurethane waste in the environment. [...] Cell-free use of microbial exoenzymes as agents of bioremediation is also possible although their activity is often not as robust and introducing the enzymes into certain environments such as soil has been challenging. [...] In addition to terrestrial based microorganisms, marine based bacteria and their exoenzymes show potential as candidates in the field of bioremediation. Marine based bacteria have been utilized in the removal of heavy metals, petroleum/diesel degradation and in the removal of polyaromatic hydrocarbons among others.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{is one of}} the raw {{materials}} for product manufacturing. Due to its advantageous including flexibility, relatively low cost and flexibility, it is widely applied {{in a wide range of}} products, such as shopping bags, containers, electronic equipment cases, etc. As plastic products are usually in short-term use, in proportion, a huge amount of <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> generates in the world every day, the same case happens in Hong Kong. Landfill expansion in the coming years is a hot social and environmental issue in Hong Kong. <b>Plastic</b> <b>waste,</b> which is a recyclable material, is the second highest component of municipal solid waste (MSW) being disposed into the landfill by weight in 2013. Plastic recycling business is facing difficulties in high operating cost and low revenue of recycled plastic pellets due to the dropping of oil price in recent years. Besides, the incentives for public to do plastic clean recycling is low. These factors discourage plastic recycling practices in Hong Kong and cause a large proportion of non-recycled <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> being dumped into the landfill every day. Since plastic is derived from petrochemicals, it usually has a comparable heating value with fuels, which is favorable in carrying out waste-to-energy (WTE) process and too valuable to throw away. Overseas countries apply WTE to recover the energy of <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> via thermochemical process. In some countries, <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> can be 100 % recycled and recovered in energy with landfill ban. In this research, the feasibility of WTE and its role in <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> management is studied. It was found the application in WTE for the treatment of <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> mixed with MSW is technically feasible. It is a significant means in waste management to relieve the space occupying by MSW in landfill and generate energy from waste by energy recovery technologies, for example, incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, etc. The result of study shows that, WTE is a financially feasible and eco-efficient means in non-recycled <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> treatment. WTE fills the gap between recycling and disposal in local <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> management. Public accepts the development of WTE for the treatment of non-recycled <b>plastic</b> <b>waste</b> in Hong Kong.
