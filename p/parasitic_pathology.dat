40|$|Toxoplasmosis, <b>parasitic</b> <b>pathology</b> {{supported}} by Toxoplasma gondii, {{is a typical}} example of multi-issue and inter-disciplinary on which, with equal intensity, converge the interests of various branches of human and veterinary medicine. The aim of research was the assessment of risk communication to pregnant women by doctors gynecologists involved in ASL’s territorial about toxoplasmosis, which can have serious effects on pregnancy and the unborn child. The results acquired during the investigation showed {{the need to develop}} and implement appropriate information campaigns and proper nutrition education...|$|E

Investigations on the cattlebreeding {{state have}} been carried out in the High Plateaus of Uvira in view to {{elucidate}} the importance of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>pathology</b> {{on the development of the}} cattle. The epidemiological study of gastro-intestinal diseases of the cattle and the snail inventory have been done in order to show, on the one hand, the nature, frequency and the gravity of gastrointestinal parasites and on the other hand, the causes of these infestations. Among the 318 samples of faeces examined, 311 have been positive (97. 8 %). The main parasites observed from the coproscopy were : Eimeria sp or Coccidia (92. 1 %), Schistosoma bovis (83. 0) %, Buxtonella sp (40. 6 %), Haemonchus sp (29. 2 %), Trichostrongylus sp (23. 9 %), Cooperia sp (10. 1 %), Chabertia sp (11. 9 %), Moniezia sp (15. 1 %) Strongyloides sp (6. 3 %), Fasciola hepatica (8. 2 %), Ostertagia sp (5. 3 %), Toxocara vitulorum (11. 9 %), Oesophagostomum sp (4. 4 %), Bunostomum sp (3. 5 %) et Nematodirus sp (0. 6 %). Seven species of snails have been sampled such as the aquatic species Pisidium casertanum, P. nitidum (Sphaeridae), Segmentorbis sp (Planorbidae), Syrnolopsis gracilis (Syrnolopsis) and Potadomoides schouterdeni and the terrestrial one Burtoa sp and an other one which still remains indetermined...|$|E
40|$|The La Macarena {{mountain}} range delimitates a transition between Andean ecosystems. There are currently important human {{settlements in the}} region that are searching for a decent living in extensive cattle raising. A project supported by the Colombian government is being conducted in the municipalities of Puerto Rico and La Macarena, which aims to introduce a technological package of tropical cattle farming in order to modernize livestock production in communities with a vulnerable population. The use of participative epidemiology tools in the framework of the project’s activities is hereby described, and particular attention is brought to the validity of using participative methods as an alternative to approach the problems of local rural producers and suggest alternative solutions in situations where resource limitations hamper the use of other study methods. Individual interviews and group workshops were carried out with livestock owners, who described the health alterations observed in their farms from their own perspective. After triangulation the description of the disease was compared with direct field observations and with the scientific descriptions of cattle health problems in the tropic. It was detected that deficiency diseases (pica, botulism) are very frequent in the region, reflecting the poor quality of soils and pastures. There are infectious calf diseases (calf scours, black scours) that occur due to management mistakes that are easily avoidable. There are also toxic and <b>parasitic</b> <b>pathologies</b> (photosensibilization and haemoparasites) that require a better understanding of their dynamics, so as to be able to design appropriate prevention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Extant {{cephalopods}} {{are commonly}} infested by parasites making it plausible that ammonoids also had parasites. We review the fossil evidence of parasitic infestations in ammonoids, which, due to low preservation potential of soft-tissues in ammonoids and parasites, are mainly recorded as shell pathologies on the external shell interpreted {{to be caused}} by parasites. Extant nautilids are of little help to interpret these structures as they only harbor <b>parasitic</b> copepods. <b>Pathologies</b> analogous to those found in ammonoids that are caused by parasites are common in extant bivalves and gastropods. The position of these features might reveal their parasitic nature. The restriction of these structures to certain ammonoid lineages suggests both the influence of phylogeny and the potential role of ecology (feeding, mode of life) on infestation risks. Other long-term associations with detriment to ammonoids such as epizoa and bioeroders as well as their possible confusion with parasitism are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} Imported Tropical Diseases in Portugal is correlated {{to a recent}} higher standard of living, influence of media and a consequent expansion of tourism, and above all to the close relationship existing between Portugal and Africa. The number and <b>pathology</b> (<b>parasitic</b> diarrhoeas, protozoal and helminthic infections) of in-patients with Tropical Diseases at the Unidade de Doenças Infecciosas, Parasitárias e de Medicina Tropical (UDIP-MT) were described, with special emphasis on Malaria (155 in-patients {{during the period from}} 1989 to 1993) and on Sleeping Sickness, where Eflornitin (DFMO) was for the first time used in Portugal. Finally, the impact of HIV epidemic on incidence and different clinical presentations of parasitic and other tropical pathology was also evaluated.

40|$|Although most routine {{microbiology}} {{diagnostic laboratories}} process specimens for {{the diagnosis of}} parasitic infections, there are no best practice guidelines either for processing or for referral to specialist centres. Microscopy for parasites is most often requested on faecal samples, but urine, sputum, liver aspirates, duodenal aspirates, bile, corneal scrapings, contact lens fluid, and tissue are also encountered. Diagnosis of certain parasitic infections requires serology or polymerase chain reaction. These are undertaken in specialist laboratories, which should be consulted for expert advice on diagnosis and management of <b>parasitic</b> infections. Clinical <b>Pathology</b> Accreditation UK (CPA) has defined standards for assessing the quality of service provided by laboratories, but {{these do not include}} scientific and technical aspects. The Association of Medical Microbiologists has recently published Standards for laboratory practice in medical microbiology, which covers scientific and technical aspects, mainly bacteriological examination of specimens in routine diagnostic microbiology laboratories. These guidelines are complementary to the CPA standards and aim to ensure a consistent and high quality of service. This article provides best practice guidelines for the diagnosis of parasitic infections...|$|R
