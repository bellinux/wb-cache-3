40|$|Background: Vital pulp {{preservation}} in {{the treatment}} of deep caries is challenging due to bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were to synthesize a novel, light-cured composite material containing bioactive calcium-silicate (Portland cement, PC) and the antimicrobial quaternary ammonium salt monomer 2 -methacryloxylethyl dodecyl methyl ammonium bromide (MAE-DB) and to evaluate its effects on Streptococcus mutans growth in vitro. Methods: The experimental material was prepared from a 2 : 1 ratio of PC mixed with a resin of 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate, bisphenol glycerolate dimethacrylate, and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (4 : 3 : 1) containing 5 wt % MAE-DB. Cured resin containing 5 % MAE-DB without PC served as the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material,</b> and resin without MAE-DB or PC served as the negative control material. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide (Dycal) served as commercial controls. S. mutans biofilm formation on material surfaces and growth in the culture medium were tested according to colony-forming units (CFUs) and metabolic activity after 24 h incubation over freshly prepared samples or samples aged in water for 6 months. Biofilm formation was also assessed by Live/Dead staining and scanning electron microscopy. Results: S. mutans biofilm formation on the experimental material was significantly inhibited, with CFU counts, metabolic activity, viability staining, and morphology similar to those of biofilms on the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material.</b> None of the materials affected bacterial growth in solution.

40|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>materials</b> for {{clinical}} molecular genetic testing applications {{are currently in}} critically short supply or non-existent for many genetically based diseases of public health importance. Here we demonstrate that anonymous, residual, clinical blood samples are potential sources of viable lymphocytes for establishing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -transformed blood lymphocyte cell lines. We attempted to transform 34 residual blood samples, and analyzed transformation success with respect to sample age, anticoagulant, storage temperature, volume, hemolysis, and patient age and sex. In univariate analysis, sample age {{was significantly associated with}} transformation success (P = 0. 002). The success rate was 67 % (6 of 9) for samples 1 to 7 days old, 38 % (3 of 8) for samples 8 to 14 days old and 0 % for samples 15 to 21 (0 of 11) days old. When we controlled for sample age in multivariate logistic regression, anticoagulant and storage temperature approached significance (P = 0. 070 and 0. 087, respectively; samples in acid citrate dextrose (ACD) and refrigerated samples were more likely to transform). Based on these findings, we suggest that samples collected in either ACD or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and up to 14 days old (refrigerated) or 7 days old (stored ambient), are reasonable candidates for EBV transformation. The transformation rate for samples that met these criteria was 63 % (10 of 16).

40|$|SummaryEbolaviruses, and {{the other}} viral causes of {{haemorrhagic}} fevers (VHF) have always posed special problems for diagnostic laboratories. These arise from the rarity of human infections, minimal documented experience with test delivery and interpretation, the paucity of established commercial or in-house assays, the lack of clinical material for test development and validation, the high level containment required for handling live virus, the ongoing evolution of the viruses, and the high personal and public health requirements for accurate diagnosis. This article addresses the current situation and the ongoing challenges associated with delivering timely, high quality and safe testing within Australia for people exposed {{as part of the}} current major outbreak of Ebolavirus disease (EVD) in Western Africa. The members of the Public Health Laboratory Network have developed deliverable and reliable nucleic acid detection tests, and also have the laboratory capacity to handle the live viruses if necessary. However delivering and maintaining these services necessitates high levels of experience in developing and applying tests for exotic and emerging infections, strong national and international links and collaborations, ongoing monitoring and reassessment of test design and performance, innovative approaches to generation of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material,</b> and a regular quality assurance program...|$|E

METHODS [...] Eighteen randomly selected cases of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix were examined as well as 25 cases each of normal cervices and those showing cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II, and III. DNA-DNA in situ hybridisation, using a biotinylated probe to the Bam H 1 "W" fragment of EBV, was carried out in addition to the polymerase chain reaction using specific primer sequences that flank a 153 base pair segment of the Bam H 1 "W" region of the EBV genome and which do not cross-amplify other DNA herpes viruses. <b>Positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> included paraffin wax embedded P 3 HR 1 lymphoblastoid cells (containing high copy numbers of EBV) and two nasopharyngeal carcinomas positive for EBV.

40|$|The {{choice for}} a {{biomaterial}} is partly based {{on the outcome of}} (cyto) toxicity assays. The rationales behind the selection of certain parameters, such as cell lines, controls, and animals, were evaluated using a positive and a negative control, and one experimental sample designed to induce intermediate toxicity. Extraction and direct contact assays were performed using human epidermal keratinocytes and mouse fibroblasts and mouse epithelial cells. Cell survival was measured with the tetrazolium salt (MTT) reduction assay. In addition, local implantation studies were performed in mice and rats. The positive control induced a high degree of toxicity in all in vitro tests performed, indicating that the toxicity observed in the direct contact assay was due to in situ extraction of toxic components. In the direct contact assay the negative control tested on the mouse fibroblasts resulted in a significant reduction of cell survival. No decrease in cell survival was found using the experimental sample. Subcutaneous implantation studies in mice showed that the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> induced a severe degeneration in mice. However, in rats just minimal alterations were noted. The experimental material induced moderate responses only in mice. Our results indicate that the direct contact assay provides limited additional information on the cytotoxicity of materials if certain limitations are not taken into account.

40|$|To {{probe the}} role of human plasma {{fibronectin}} in modulating human blood-derived macrophage adhesion and fusion to form multinucleated foreign-body giant cells (FBGC), a series of biomimetic oligopeptides based on the functional structure of fibronectin was designed and synthesized. Peptides incorporated the RGD and PHSRN integrin-binding sequences from FIII- 10 and FIII- 9 modules, respectively, and the PRRARV sequence from the C-terminal heparin-binding domain, either alone or in combination. Peptides were immobilized onto a polyethyleneglycol-based polymer substrate. The following conclusions were reached. Fibronectin modulated macrophage adhesion and the extent (i. e., size) of FBGC formation on control surfaces {{in the presence of}} serum proteins. Macrophages adhered to all substrates with relatively subtle differences between adhesion mediated by RGD, PHSRN, PRRARV, or combinations thereof. β 1 -integrin subunit was essential in macrophage adhesion to peptide-grafted networks in a receptor-peptide specific manner, whereas β 3 -integrin subunit was less important. Macrophage adhesion to PRRARV was mediated primarily by the direct interaction with integrins. RGD or PHSRN alone did not provide an adequate substrate for macrophage fusion to form FBGCs. However, the PHSRN synergistic site and the RGD site in a single oligopeptide provided a substrate for FBGC formation that was statistically comparable to that on the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> in the presence of serum proteins. This response was highly dependent upon the relative orientation between RGD and PHSRN. PRRARV did not support FBGC formation. These results demonstrate the importance of fibronectin and, specifically, the synergy between RGD and PHSRN domains, in supporting macrophage fusion to form FBGCs. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is {{the most}} important pathogen known to affect the sustainability and growth of the global penaeid shrimp farming industry. Although most commonly associated with penaeid shrimp farmed in warm waters, WSSV is also able to infect, cause disease in and kill a wide range of other decapod crustaceans, including lobsters, from temperate regions. In 2005, the European Union imported US$ 500 million worth of raw frozen or cooked frozen commodity products, much of which originated in regions positive for white spot disease (WSD). The presence of WSSV within the UK food market was verified by means of nested PCR performed on samples collected from a small-scale survey of supermarket commodity shrimp. Passage trials using inoculum derived from commodity shrimp from supermarkets and delivered by injection to specific pathogen-free Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei led to rapid mortality and pathognomonic signs of WSD in the shrimp, demonstrating that WSSV present within commodity shrimp was viable. We exposed a representative European decapod crustacean, the European lobster Homarus gammarus, to a single feeding of WSSV-positive, supermarket-derived commodity shrimp, and to <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> (L. vannamei infected with a high dose of WSSV). These trials demonstrated that lobsters fed positive control (high dose) frozen raw products succumbed to WSD and displayed pathognomonic signs associated with the disease as determined by means of histology and transmission electron microscopy. Lobsters fed WSSV-positive, supermarket-derived commodity shrimp (low dose) did not succumb to WSD (no mortality or pathognomonic signs of WSD) but demonstrated a low level or latent infection via PCR. This study confirms susceptibility of H. gammarus to WSSV via single feedings of previously frozen raw shrimp products obtained directly from supermarkets. K. S. Bateman, J. Munro, B. Uglow, H. J.

In this study, changes in {{the expression of the}} components of the E-cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex have been investigated using immunohistochemical techniques in primary tumours and nodal metastases from 36 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. For 14 patients the corresponding primary and nodal metastases samples were available. None of the 51 samples showed normal E-cadherin expression when compared with either the adjacent normal squamous epithelium or with normal colonic epithelium that was used as <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material.</b> In 88 % of primary tumours fewer than 50 % of cells exhibited normal membranous E-cadherin expression. Loss of membranous E-cadherin expression was more extensive in poorly differentiated carcinomas while, in individual carcinomas, membranous E-cadherin expression was stronger in those parts of the neoplasm that expressed the differentiation marker involucrin. Expression of beta-catenin generally paralleled that of E-cadherin, but in 12 cases there was strong membranous beta-catenin expression in samples that exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic E-cadherin labelling. Expression of alpha-catenin was generally weak and did not correlate with the expression of either beta-catenin or E-cadherin. Marked intratumoral heterogeneity for protein expression was evident for all antibodies, and the abnormal expression of the catenins is a novel finding. E-cadherin is expressed more intensely in cells with greater squamous differentiation, but there was no correlation between the decreased expression of any of the adhesion molecules of the E-cadherin complex tested and local recurrence, metastasis or survival. The loss of expression of components of the E-cadherin complex is a common abnormality in squamous carcinomas and, while it may be permissive for metastasis, it {{does not appear to be}} the only determinant of this process...|$|E

We verified pre-analytical processing (sample type, temperature and duration of storage, centrifugation protocol) on PRA, DRA, HMGB 1 and TWEAK. IL 8 was <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods: Blood from 10 donors was collected in serum (S), heparin, EDTA and citrate (Cit) tubes and kept at room temperature (RT) or refrigerated (COLD). For PRA and DRA a third series of EDTA tubes was chilled on ice (ICE). Samples were centrifuged one (1 Centr) or two (2 Centr) times after 30 minutes, 3 and 9 hours. Aliquots (- 80 °C) were analyzed within three months (immunometric assays). Results: PRA median CV at 3 and 9 hrs were: 8. 16 % and 7. 68 % (COLD), 2. 18 % and 5. 23 % (ICE), 18. 22 % and 17. 25 % (RT), being intra-assay CV 9 %. DRA intra-assay CV was 3. 2 %; median CV at 3 and 9 hrs were: 1. 94 % and 4. 87 % (COLD), 3. 32 % and 6. 07 % (ICE), 1. 94 % and 2. 96 % (RT). S-HMGB 1 was 10 fold lower than any other plasma type (F = 7. 14, p = 0. 002). Cit-HMGB 1 median CVs at 3 and 9 hrs were lower than intra-assay CV (15 %) : 2. 23 % and 8. 96 % (COLD, 1 Centr), 8. 64 % and 5. 24 % (COLD, 2 Centr), 11. 55 % and 6. 58 % (RT, 1 Centr), 7. 51 % and 8. 56 % (RT, 2 Centr). At 3 hrs TWEAK median CV was lower than intra-assay CV (5 %) for all pre-treatments. The median 9 hrs CV varied from a minimum of 6. 36 % (RT, 2 Centr) to a maximum of 11. 37 (COLD, 1 Centr). S-IL 8 at RT, not at COLD, progressively increased at 3 (28 + 8 pg/mL) (p = 0. 0194) and 9 hrs (590 + 206 pg/mL) with respect to basal (7 + 3 pg/mL) (p = 0. 0250). Conclusion: S-HMGB 1 is not measurable, probably because it interacts with thrombomodulin; citrate plasma is recommended. TWEAK can be measured in any matrix.

After pH cycling, the F release, bond strength, fracture mode and presence of white spot lesions were assessed. In the in situ study, the specimens were enamel fragments with bonded brackets (n= 12 /group). Twelve volunteers wore palatal appliances in 4 phases, with cariogenic challenge. Bond strength, fracture mode {{and change in}} surface hardness (%SH) were determined. Result Relative to the in vitro study, F release (ppm) was: GT= 0. 257 ± 0. 068 c; GTF= 0. 634 ± 0. 100 b; GSAF= 0. 630 ± 0. 067 b; GV= 2. 796 ± 1. 414 a. Only GV showed no white spot lesions. Bond strength values (MPa) were GT= 7. 62 ± 7. 18 a; GTF= 5. 15 ± 6. 91 ab; GSAF= 3. 42 ± 2. 97 bc; GV= 2. 87 ± 2. 09 c. Adhesive fracture was the most frequent type, except for GTF. In the in situ study, %SH was: GT=- 56. 0 ± 18. 3 a; GTF=- 57. 6 ± 11. 9 a; GSAF=- 57. 1 ± 11. 3 a; GV=- 52. 4 ± 25. 8 a.

40|$|Infectious {{disease is}} a {{significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in cats and dogs. The diagnosis of the causative agent is essential to allow for the appropriate clinical intervention, to reduce infection spread, and also to support epidemiological studies which in turn will better the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has replaced traditional detection methods as the gold standard diagnostic technique for many pathogens, however replacing traditional detection methods with panels of internally controlled multiplex real-time PCR screens designed along syndromic lines is not widespread. The aim of this thesis is to undertake the development phase of a wider project that intends to develop a broad panel of syndrome based real-time PCR multiplex assays for infectious diseases in cats and dogs. In order to achieve this, appropriate extraction and real-time PCR platforms and reagents were chosen. The aim of this project was to begin the development of five syndrome based panels of multiplex screens:- feline respiratory disease, feline conjunctivitis, feline anaemia, feline gingivitis, and feline and canine gastroenteritis. The multiplex assays were optimised and then evaluated through a series of experiments to determine the endpoint sensitivity, specificity and robustness of each multiplex in comparison to the single assays. The full optimisation and pre-clinical validation assessment of five multiplex assays was completed in the timescale of this project; the feline respiratory screen, the feline conjunctivitis screen and the feline/canine gastroenteritis 1, 2 and 3 screens. This study highlighted some of the difficulties that can be encountered when developing in-house multiplex real-time PCR assays. The main limitations were the lack of readily available <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>material,</b> published assays and sequence data. The results of this study highlight that the development of an in-house multiplex real-time PCR diagnostic service can be at times difficult and occasionally time-consuming. A significant finding of this study was that PCR may not be as sensitive as virus isolation in the detection of feline calicivirus (FCV). It is hoped that further work including additional sequencing will aid {{in the development of a}} more sensitive FCV PCR assay. In-house multiplex real-time PCR should bring many advantages over current veterinary diagnostic assays. This will in turn aid in the treatment and clinical management of the animal, and increase our understanding of infectious disease in cats and dogs...|$|E

A standardized source of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> antibody (human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4) will ensure the quality of surveillance data using these tests. A recombinant human IgG 4 antibody to Ov 16 was identified by screening against a synthetic human Fab phage display library and converted into human IgG 4. This antibody was developed into different <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> formulations for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) platforms. Variation in ELISA results and utility as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of the antibody were assessed from multiple laboratories.

When the anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody was used as a standard dilution in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ELISAs, the detection limits were approximately 1 ng/mL by HRP ELISA and 10 ng/mL by AP ELISA. <b>Positive</b> <b>control</b> dilutions and spiked dried blood spots (DBS) produced similar ELISA results.

Total doses of 15. 2 mg/kg body weight of the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> and Quartz Isolate were administered to rats by intratracheal instillation. Controls received saline only. Bronchoalveolar lavagate analysis showed that, relative to the controls, the total leukocyte counts at 3 days were significantly elevated in both the Quartz Isolate and <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> groups. At 28 and 90 days, the Quartz Isolate values were no longer statistically different from the control values whereas the corresponding <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> values were about 12 and 65 times greater than control values. At 3, 28 and 90 days, the percentages of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were 18 %, 25 % and 32 % for the Quartz Isolate group and 39 %, 45 % and 46 % for the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, respectively. Histopathologically, the Quartz Isolate group showed moderate effects compared to controls after 28 days with no progression of severity at 90 days. In contrast, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group exhibited more severe effects at 28 days and a progression in intensity at 90 days. In conclusion, in the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> group, a persistent inflammation (interstitial fibrosis, alveolar lipoproteinosis) was observed. Conclusions: i) Controls did not induce lung inflammation ii) The <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> produced significant and progressive lung inflammation. iii) The Quartz Isolate induced a significantly weaker inflammatory response than the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> (not progressive). From a regulatory point of view, these substance-specific toxicological effects of Quartz Isolate {{may need to be}} considered for its classification...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundSerological assays {{for human}} IgG 4 to the Onchocerca volvulus antigen Ov 16 {{have been used}} to confirm {{elimination}} of onchocerciasis in much of the Americas and parts of Africa. A standardized source of <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> antibody (human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4) will ensure the quality of surveillance data using these tests. Methodology/Principal FindingsA recombinant human IgG 4 antibody to Ov 16 was identified by screening against a synthetic human Fab phage display library and converted into human IgG 4. This antibody was developed into different <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> formulations for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) platforms. Variation in ELISA results and utility as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> of the antibody were assessed from multiple laboratories. Temperature and humidity conditions were collected across seven surveillance activities from 201122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2014 to inform stability requirements for RDTs and <b>positive</b> <b>controls.</b> The feasibility of the dried <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> for RDT was evaluated during onchocerciasis surveillance activity in Togo, in 2014. When the anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody was used as a standard dilution in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ELISAs, the detection limits were approximately 1 ng/mL by HRP ELISA and 10 ng/mL by AP ELISA. <b>Positive</b> <b>control</b> dilutions and spiked dried blood spots (DBS) produced similar ELISA results. Used as a simple plate normalization <b>control,</b> the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> antibody may improve ELISA data comparison in the context of inter-laboratory variation. The aggregate temperature and humidity monitor data informed temperature parameters under which the dried <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> was tested and are applicable inputs for testing of diagnostics tools intended for sub-Saharan Africa. As a packaged <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> for Ov 16 RDTs, stability of the antibody was demonstrated for over six months at relevant temperatures in the laboratory and for over 15 weeks under field conditions. ConclusionsThe recombinant human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody-based <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> will benefit inter-laboratory validation of ELISA assays and serve as quality control (QC) reagents for Ov 16 RDTs at different points of the supply chain from manufacturer to field use. 26745374 PMC 470634...|$|R
40|$|Several novel {{biodegradable}} {{materials have}} been proposed for wound healing applications {{in the past few}} years. Taking into consideration the biocompatibility of chitosan-based biomaterials, and that they promote adequate cell adhesion, this work aims at investigating the effect of chitosanbased membranes, over the activation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). The recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) reflects a primary reaction to foreign bodies. Activation of neutrophils results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O 2 − and HO− and the release of hydrolytic enzymes which are determinant factors in the inflammatory process, playing an essential role in the healing mechanisms. PMNs isolated from human peripheral blood of healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of chitosan or chitosan/soy newly developed membranes. The effect of the biomaterials on the activation of PMNs was assessed by the quantification of lysozyme and ROS. The results showed that PMNs, {{in the presence of the}} chitosan-based membranes secrete similar lysozyme amounts, as compared to <b>controls</b> (PMNs without <b>materials)</b> and also showed that the materials do not stimulate the production of either O 2 − or HO−. Moreover, PMNs incubated with the biomaterials when stimulated with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) showed a chemiluminescence profile with a slightly lower intensity, to that observed for <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> (cells without <b>materials</b> and stimulated with PMA), which reflects the maintenance of their stimulation capacity. Our data suggests that the new biomaterials studied herein do not elicit activation of PMNs, as assessed by the low lysozyme activity and by the minor detection of ROS by chemiluminescence. These findings reinforce previous statements supporting the suitability of chitosan-based materials for wound healing applications...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 294 nursery pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 15. 2 lb, 3 d postweaning) {{were used in}} a 28 -d trial to evaluate the effects on growth performance of eliminating specific crystalline amino acids from a low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. On d 3 after weaning, pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. A 2 -phase diet series was used, with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 and a common diet fed from d 14 to 28. All diets were in meal form. The formulation was {{based on data from}} previous trials in which fish meal was replaced with crystalline amino acids in the diet for 15 - to 25 -lb pigs. The objective of this trial was to determine which amino acids are required in this low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. The <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet contained L-lysine HCl, DL-methionine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine. The 6 treatments were (1) <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> (2) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine deleted from the diet, (3) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-tryptophan deleted, (4) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> L-valine deleted, (5) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-glutamine and L-glycine deleted, and (6) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine deleted from diet (negative control). There were 7 pigs per pen and 7 pens per treatment. Pigs and feeders were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet had improved (P 0. 40) ADG, ADFI, and F/G to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> but had improved (P 0. 12) ADG to the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> There were no differences (P > 0. 10) in ADFI from d 14 to 28. Because of the decrease in ADG from d 0 to 14, pigs fed the negative control or diets without L-tryptophan or L-valine had decreased (P < 0. 04) ADG for the overall trial (d 0 to 28) compared to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> ADFI from all treatment diets decreased compared to the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> although only the negative control group tested significantly (P 0. 24) in F/G for the overall data. In conclusion, L-tryptophan and L-valine were needed in the low-CP, high amino acid-fortified nursery diet to achieve maximum growth performance from 15 to 25 lb. This suggests that the tryptophan:lysine and valine:lysine requirements are greater than 15 and 57 % of lysine, respectively. The numerical decrease in performance when L-glutamine and L-glycine were removed from the diet during the first period suggests a need for nonessential nitrogen in the low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet or a benefit to one of these amino acids separate from its role as a nitrogen source...|$|R

40|$|Osteonecrosis (ON) is {{characterized}} through the impairment of osseous blood flow {{that leads to}} the collapse of femur head. Corticoid-induced ON in rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced in rabbits are useful models to assess the efficacy of potential treatments on this disease. D- 003 inhibits the mevalonate pathway, lipid peroxidation and prevents osteoporosis in rats through increasing the osteoclast apoptosis. This study investigated the effects of D- 003 on corticoid- and LPS-induced ON in rats and rabbits. Corticoid-induced ON: Rats were randomized into five groups. A negative control and four groups treated with prednisolone 6 mg/Kg: a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and three treated with D- 003 (5, 25 and 200 mg/Kg) for 80 days. All <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> presented ON areas. D- 003 significantly reduced the numbers and proportions of ON lesions, as compared to the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> group. LPS-induced ON in rabbits: Rabbits were randomized into five groups: a negative control and four injected with a single intra-venous injection of LPS (10 µg/Kg) including a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and three with D- 003 (5, 25 and 200 mg/Kg) for 30 days.

Sperm viability, motility, capacitation and the effect of relaxin on the fertilizing ability after heterologous IVF were evaluated. Although viability was not affected, relaxin increased (p < 0. 05) sperm motility compared to the negative and <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> both after 2 h (60. 0 ± 2. 0, 60. 0 ± 3. 1, 68. 3 ± 1. 7 and 69. 4 ± 2. 7, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and 4 h (55. 0 ± 2. 5, 53. 3 ± 3. 0, 62. 2 ± 3. 0 and 65. 0 ± 3. 2, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin) incubation. When sperm were incubated with both 100 ng/ml relaxin and heparin, a decrease (p < 0. 01) of pattern A, that is low capacitation level, was observed compared to the negative control both after 2 h (54. 4, 34. 3 and 36. 4 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and 4 h (51. 9, 35. 0 and 34. 3 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin). Moreover, an increase (p < 0. 01) of pattern EA, that is high capacitation level, was recorded with 100 ng/ml relaxin and heparin compared to the negative control both after 2 h (44. 1, 59. 3 and 57. 7 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and after 4 h (43. 0, 54. 4 and 56. 0 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin).
