5|$|The {{death of}} Tsaritsa Catherine the Great on November 17, 1796, {{led to a}} change in Russia's <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> Poland. On November 28, Tsar Paul I, who had hated Catherine, pardoned Kościuszko and set him free, after he had {{tendered}} an oath of loyalty. Paul promised to free all Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly settled in Siberia. The Tsar gave Kościuszko 12,000 rubles, which the Pole later, in 1798, attempted to return, when also renouncing the oath.|$|E
5|$|While some of Piłsudski's {{political}} moves remain controversial — {{particularly the}} May 1926 Coup d'état, the Brest trials (1931–32), the 1934 {{establishment of the}} Bereza Kartuska detention camp, and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the national minorities — Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

5|$|The committee's {{first choice}} {{to lead the}} mission was Count Folke Bernadotte, the {{vice-chairman}} of the Swedish Red Cross {{and a member of}} the Swedish Royal Family. When Bernadotte's proposed appointment was rejected by the Hungarians, Lauer suggested Wallenberg as a potential replacement. Olsen was introduced to Wallenberg by Lauer in June 1944 and came away from the meeting impressed and, shortly thereafter, appointed Wallenberg to lead the mission. Olsen's selection of Wallenberg met with objections from some US officials who doubted his reliability, in light of existing commercial relationships between businesses owned by the Wallenberg family and the German government. These differences were eventually overcome and the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed to the American request to assign Wallenberg to its legation in Budapest as part of an arrangement in which Wallenberg's appointment was granted in exchange for a lessening of American diplomatic pressure on neutral Sweden to curtail their nation's free-trade <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|The fake will {{in which}} the Shunzhi Emperor had {{supposedly}} expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents. Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus. Over the next few years, they enhanced {{the power of the}} Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. The regents also adopted aggressive <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E

25|$|Christians refer {{positively}} to Oda Nobunaga, {{who died in}} the middle of the unification of Japan. He favored the Jesuit missionary Luís Fróis and generally tolerated Christianity. But overall, he undertook no remarkable <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> Catholicism. Actually, Catholic power in his domain was trivial because he did not conquer western Japan, where the Jesuits were based. By 1579, at the height of missionary activity, there were about 130,000 converts.|$|E
25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} and occupation, of Norway, {{and after the}} legitimate Norwegian government had left the country, German occupying authorities {{under the leadership of}} Reichskommissar Josef Terboven, put Norwegian civilian authorities under his control. This included various branches of Norwegian police, including the district sheriffs (Lensmannsetaten), criminal police, and order police. Nazi police branches, including the SD and Gestapo, also became part of a network that served as tools for increasingly oppressive <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the Norwegian populace.|$|E

25|$|The 2.5 million Irish Catholics in England and Scotland were a {{major factor}} in the Labour base in many {{industrial}} areas. The Catholic Church had previously tolerated the Labour Party, and denied that it represented true socialism. However, the bishops by 1930 had grown increasingly alarmed at Labour's <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> Communist Russia, toward birth control and especially toward funding Catholic schools. They warned its members. The Catholic shift against Labour and in favour of the National government played a major role in Labour's losses.|$|E
25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the Progressive movement, and joined with advocate John Collier, the Indian Rights Association and others to protect Native American religion and sovereignty. Standing Bear’s commentaries on Native American culture and wisdom educated the American public, deepened public awareness and created popular support to change in government <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> Native American peoples. In 1928, Standing Bear’s “My People the Sioux” and the Meriam Report were published, launching an organized campaign to challenge government policies limiting Native American religion and sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic {{world order}} was {{challenged}} by the Netherlands and England. Theoretically, it was repudiated by Grotius's Mare Liberum. In the early 17th century, Japan built trade relations with the Netherlands and England. Although England withdrew from the operations in ten years under James I {{due to lack of}} profitability, the Netherlands continued to trade with Japan and became the only European country that maintained trade relations with Japan until the 19th century. As trade competitors, the Protestant countries engaged in a negative campaign against Catholicism, and it subsequently affected shogunate <b>policies</b> <b>toward</b> the Iberian kingdoms.|$|E
