5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the <b>polycarbonate</b> is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The <b>polycarbonate</b> forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two <b>polycarbonate</b> bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white <b>polycarbonate,</b> and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|A more {{expensive}} black model was offered until {{the introduction of}} the unibody aluminum MacBook. The <b>polycarbonate</b> MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook (until the new 2015 model) to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic <b>polycarbonates</b> {{are widely}} used in several {{manufacturing}} domains because of their extraordinary combination of transparency, toughness, ductility and chemical inertness at low and moderate temperature. They are, thus, ideal candidates to substitute float glasses, where lightweight and safety are of utmost relevance. In contrast, <b>polycarbonates</b> feature limited scratch and mar resistance, being characterized by very low surface hardness. This suggests the protection of <b>polycarbonates</b> with hard transparent coatings. However, poor interfacial adhesion between conventional coatings and <b>polycarbonates,</b> reduced cohesive strength of some hard coating materials and, in particular, their limited compliance when deposited on ductile substrates often reduce significantly their performance. In this respect, the present work analyzes {{the pros and cons}} of protecting thermoplastic <b>polycarbonates</b> with specialty coatings, emphasizing the real advantages of applying surface overlying layers and their drawbacks. Different formulations of the coatings were herein studied to optimize their interfacial adhesion with <b>polycarbonates</b> and cohesive strengths. Tribological (scratch, wear and mar) tests were, thus, performed to assess the performance of the coatings. After appropriate designing, specialty coatings might be useful to increase hardness and mar resistance of <b>polycarbonates.</b> Nevertheless, they are still largely ineffective to improve wear resistance of <b>polycarbonates.</b> © 2015 Elsevier B.

5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} <b>polycarbonate</b> (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The <b>polycarbonate</b> unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Plastics, such as {{polyethylene}} naphthalate (PEN), can {{be protected}} by applying zinc oxide coating. The coating reduces the diffusion of oxygen with PEN. Zinc oxide layers {{can also be used}} on <b>polycarbonate</b> (PC) in outdoor applications. The coating protects PC from solar radiation and decreases the oxidation rate and photo-yellowing of PC.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a new synthetic approach to aromatic and aliphatic <b>polycarbonates</b> by melt polycondensation of bisphenol A diacetates with alkylene- and arylenediphenyl dicarbonates. The diphenyl dicarbonates were prepared from phenyl chloroformate {{and the corresponding}} dihydroxy compounds. The process involved a precondensation step under a slow stream of dry argon with the elimination of phenyl acetate, followed by melt polycondensation at high temperature and under vacuum. The potential of this reaction is demonstrated by the successful synthesis {{of a series of}} aromatic-aromatic and aromatic-aliphatic <b>polycarbonates</b> having inherent viscosities from 0. 19 to 0. 43 dL/g. Thus low to intermediate molecular mass polymers were obtained. The 13 C-NMR spectra of the carbon of the carbonate group showed that the formed <b>polycarbonates</b> contain partial random sequence distribution of monomer residues in their chains. The <b>polycarbonates</b> were characterized by inherent viscosity, FTIR, 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The glass transition temperatures, measured by DSC, of the <b>polycarbonates</b> were in the range 13 – 108 ºC. The thermogravimetric curves of showed that these polymers have good thermal stability up to 250 ºC. The present approach may open the door for novel <b>polycarbonates</b> containing other organic functional groups...|$|R

5|$|The <b>polycarbonate</b> Intel MacBook {{is easier}} for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor.

5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear <b>polycarbonate</b> shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons.

40|$|The {{alternating}} copolymerization of biorenewable limonene dioxide with carbon dioxide (CO 2) catalyzed by a zinc β-diiminate complex is reported. The chemoselective reaction results in linear amorphous <b>polycarbonates</b> that carry pendent methyloxiranes and exhibit glass transition temperatures (Tg) up to 135 [*]°C. These <b>polycarbonates</b> can be efficiently modified by thiols or carboxylic acids {{in combination with}} lithium hydroxide or tetrabutylphosphonium bromide as catalysts, respectively, without destruction of the main chain.

5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the <b>polycarbonate</b> cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max bullet which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven. The <b>polycarbonate</b> tip used in the V-Max bullet acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the bullet. The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} MacBook, {{available in}} {{black or white}} colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the GM965 chipset, with Intel's GMA X3100 integrated graphics on an 800MHz system bus.

5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. The iPhone 5 has the shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon {{the release of a}} new model, being replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive <b>polycarbonate</b> exterior. The iPhone 5 supports 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S.|$|E
5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof <b>polycarbonate</b> bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{aliphatic}} <b>polycarbonates</b> {{have attracted}} significant attention as materials {{for use as}} biomedical polymers in recent years. The incorporation of pendent functionality offers a facile method of modifying materials postpolymerization, thus enabling functionalities not compatible with ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to be introduced into the polymer.

5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's <b>polycarbonate</b> exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Functionalized <b>polycarbonates</b> were {{synthesized}} by organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of a cyclic monomer with a pendant activated ester (MTC-OC 6 F 5) {{followed by}} a postpolymerization modification with both small molecules and macromolecules. Controlled ROP to form homopolymers and diblock copolymers was realized using catalytic quantities of triflic acid. For the homopolymers, a linear relationship between [M] 0 /[I] 0 and molecular weight (by GPC) demonstrated the living nature of the polymerization. Poly(MTC-OC 6 F 5) was functionalized under mild reaction conditions {{with a variety of}} amines to obtain polymers with pendant primary, secondary, and tertiary amides. Graft polymers with a high grafting density of over 87 % were synthesized using amine-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) of two different molecular weights (2 and 5 kDa).
