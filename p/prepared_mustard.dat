5000|$|<b>Prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> is sold {{in glass}} jars, plastic bottles, or metal squeeze tubes.Because of its {{antibacterial}} properties, mustard does not require refrigeration for safety; it will not grow mold, mildew, or harmful bacteria. [...] Mustard can last indefinitely without becoming inedible or harmful, though it may dry out, lose flavor, or brown from oxidation. Mixing in {{a small amount of}} wine or vinegar may improve dried-out mustard. Some types of <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> stored for a long time may separate, which can be corrected by stirring or shaking.

5000|$|The many {{varieties}} of <b>prepared</b> <b>mustards</b> {{have a wide}} range of strengths and flavors, depending on the variety of mustard seed and the preparation method. The basic taste and [...] "heat" [...] of the mustard are determined largely by seed type, preparation and ingredients. Preparations from the white mustard plant (Sinapis alba) have a less pungent flavor than preparations of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). The temperature of the water and concentration of acids such as vinegar also determine the strength of a prepared mustard; hotter liquids and stronger acids denature the enzymes that make the strength-producing compounds. Thus, [...] "hot" [...] mustard is made with cold water, whereas using hot water produces a milder condiment, all else being equal.|$|R

50|$|Mustard {{plants are}} any of several plant species in the genera Brassica and Sinapis in the family Brassicaceae. Mustard seed {{is used as a}} spice.

50|$|When whole {{mustard seeds}} are wetted and crushed, an enzyme is {{activated}} that releases pungent sulphurous compounds; but they quickly evaporate. An acidic liquid, such as wine or vinegar, produces a longer-lasting paste. However, even then <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> loses its pungency over time; the loss can be slowed by keeping a sealed container (opaque {{or in the}} dark) in a cool place or refrigerator.|$|E
5000|$|... {{allyl isothiocyanate}} and 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate are {{responsible}} for the sharp hot pungent sensation in mustards and in horseradish, wasabi, and garlic. This is because it stimulates the heat and acidity sensing TRPV ion channel TRPV1 on nociceptors (pain sensing nerve cell) in the mouth and nasal passages. The heat of <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> can dissipate with time. [...] This is due to gradual chemical break-up of 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate.|$|E
5000|$|The term hot mustard is {{used for}} <b>mustards</b> <b>prepared</b> {{to bring out the}} natural piquancy of the mustard seeds. [...] This is {{enhanced}} by using pungent black or brown mustard seeds rather than the white mustard seeds used to make mild mustards.|$|R

50|$|According to Thomas and Davenport (1985), early {{reports of}} {{spoilage}} in mayonnaise and salad dressing due to Z. bailii {{date back to}} the beginning of the 20th century. More detailed investigations in the 1940s and 1950s confirmed that Z. bailii was the main spoiler in cucumber pickles, sundry pickled vegetable mixes, acidified sauces, etc. Around the same time, fermentation spoilage incidents occasionally appeared in fruit syrups and beverages preserved with moderate benzoic acid levels (0.04 - 0.05% (w/w)). Again, Z. bailii was identified as the spoilage source. Nowadays, despite great improvements in formulation control, food processing equipment and sanitation technologies (e.g. automated clean-in-place), the yeast remains highly problematic in sauces, acidified foods, pickled or brined vegetables, fruit concentrates and various non-carbonated fruit drinks. Z. bailii is also well recognized as one of the main spoilers in wines due to its high resistance to combinations of ethanol and organic acids at low pH. Furthermore, the spoilage by this yeast has been expanding into new food categories such as <b>prepared</b> <b>mustards,</b> fruit-flavoured carbonated soft drinks containing citrus, apple and grape juice concentrates. The ability of Z. bailii in spoiling a wide range of foods is a reflection of its high resistance to many stress factors. Therefore, it has been included in the list of most dangerous spoilage yeasts by several authors.|$|R
5000|$|Russian mustard is a sharp, strong hot <b>mustard,</b> <b>prepared</b> from an Indian {{mustard seed}} and high acid (~6-9%) {{distilled}} white vinegar, with salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. Mustard flour is diluted {{with hot water}} in Russia, resulting in more efficient allyl isothiocyanate production and thus a sharper taste. Indian mustard has less heat-sensitive glucosinolates, so hot water does not reduce the pungency.|$|R
5000|$|Elena Molokhovets's classic Russian {{cookbook}} A Gift to Young Housewives {{gives the}} first known recipe for Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju, [...] "Beef à la Stroganov, with mustard", in its 1871 edition. The recipe involves lightly floured beef cubes (not strips) sautéed, sauced with <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> and bouillon, and finished {{with a small amount}} of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms. A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for Beef Stroganoff in Russia. [...] The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional.|$|E
5000|$|Locations {{renowned for}} their mustard include Dijon (medium-strength) and Meaux in France; Norwich (very hot) and Tewkesbury's mustard, in the United Kingdom; and Düsseldorf (hot) and Bavaria in Germany. They vary in the {{subsidiary}} spices {{and in the}} preparation of the mustard seeds. The mustard husks may be ground with the seeds, or winnowed away after the initial crushing; [...] "whole-grain mustard" [...] retains some unground or partially ground mustard seeds. Bavarian sweet mustard contains very little acid, substituting copious amounts of sugar for preservation. The Tecuci mustard from Romania is a sweet variety very popular in Eastern Europe and is suitable for barbecued meats such as mititei. Sometimes <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> is simmered to moderate its bite, and sometimes it is aged. Irish mustard is a whole-grain mustard blended with whiskey, stout (commonly Guinness), or honey.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the individual and combined effects of mustard flour and acetic acid in the inactivation of food-borne pathogenic bacteria stored at 5 and 22 °C. Samples were prepared to achieve various concentrations by the addition of acetic acid (0, 0. 5, or 1 %) along with mustard flour (0, 10, or 20 %) and 2 % sodium chloride (fixed amount). Acid-adapted three-strain mixtures of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains (106 to 107 CFU/ml) were inoculated separately into <b>prepared</b> <b>mustard</b> samples stored at 5 and 22 °C, and samples were assayed periodically.
