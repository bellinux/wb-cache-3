25|$|In Finland, Swedish is a {{mandatory}} school subject for Finnish-speaking pupils {{in the last}} three years of the primary education (grades 7 to 9). This so-called other domestic language is also mandatory in high schools, vocational schools, and vocational universities. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called public servant's Swedish). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue. Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the <b>Population</b> <b>Register</b> Center.|$|E
25|$|Another {{country with}} a highly {{efficient}} registration process is France. At the age of eighteen, all youth are automatically registered.

Residents are required by law to report any change of address to register within a short time after moving. This is also the system in Germany (but without the membership in the health system).|$|E

Their last home, to which they moved on 3 June 1885, was a villa in Agnetapark, Delft. When Matthes learnt that their marriage would be childless, she decided to dedicate her life to her husband's business and career, and participated in the establishment and management operation. She accompanied her husband to the factory every day, having her own office. She also continued to have private lessons. In addition to administrative activities, their main interests were personnel policy issues. Matthes and van Marken maintained close contact with the employees of the factory and their families, which appealed to the couple's sense of community; {{they wanted to be}} part [...] "of a larger whole".

30|$|Italy and Spain, as {{countries}} of recent immigration and high irregularity rates, {{have struggled to}} adapt their statistical system, especially their <b>population</b> <b>registers,</b> to adequately reflect {{the presence of an}} increasing number of immigrants in their territory.

30|$|The main {{conclusion}} we {{draw from}} this comparison is that, even with only six countries, an identical register-based sampling design is difficult. Although all the surveyed countries have <b>population</b> <b>registers</b> (in one form or another), the likelihood of obtaining probability samples of immigrant minorities exists only in Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Spain (hereafter the “register” countries), where <b>population</b> <b>registers</b> allow the extraction of country-wide samples. In Germany, the ideal case is difficult to achieve because registers are decentralized {{at the level of}} municipalities (which can deny access) and have to be combined by the survey researchers. Finally, in Italy, registers are also administered by the municipalities, and are not accessible for scientific research.|$|R
30|$|Theoretically, Danish and Swedish <b>population</b> <b>registers</b> {{are ideal}} {{sampling}} frames: they are directly accessible to researchers, they are centralized and {{they include a}} handful of key characteristics which allow {{the identification of the}} population of interest: age, gender, current address, country of origin, year of arrival. Thus, researchers can extract samples of immigrants which confidently fulfill the condition of ‘randomness’. Such samples can be extracted at the national, the local and the regional level. Moreover, <b>population</b> <b>registers</b> can subsequently be used both to weigh the data in case the population actually surveyed has been biased, and to survey the same sub-sample again (if the researcher is interested in creating a panel dataset). It goes without saying that using <b>population</b> <b>registers</b> as sampling frames is advantageous also for cost reasons: on the one hand, a centralized register implies one point of contact for the researcher; on the other, access to register data frees the researcher from the need to include socio-economic issues in the questionnaires, which can thus be shorter and focused on the issues of interest. Shorter questionnaires also limit bias due to an overload of respondents and can result in higher-quality answers.|$|R
