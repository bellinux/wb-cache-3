5|$|In Florida, nesting {{habitats}} often {{consist of}} mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash <b>pines</b> (Pinus elliottii), longleaf <b>pines</b> (P. palustris), loblolly <b>pines</b> (P. taeda) and cypress trees, {{but for the}} southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall <b>pines</b> found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa <b>pines</b> (Pinus ponderosa) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (Tsuga) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.|$|E

30|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} cone burning characteristics implicate sugar <b>pine</b> cones as {{contributors to the}} surface fire regime created by litterfall in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests (sensu Fonda and Varner 2004). Sugar <b>pine</b> cones burn with greater flame lengths and longer flaming times than cones of ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey <b>pine</b> (Pinus jeffreyi Balf.), two other <b>pine</b> species that commonly co-occur with sugar <b>pine.</b> Maximum flame length and flame duration for mature sugar <b>pine</b> cones exceeded previously reported values for ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey <b>pine</b> by ca. 58 cm and 120 s (Fonda and Varner 2004). The relatively greater potential contribution of sugar <b>pine</b> cones to surface fire behavior compared to cones of ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey <b>pine</b> becomes more apparent when burning characteristics of cones are considered alongside those of conspecific foliage. Maximum flame lengths of ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey <b>pine</b> needles were similar to maximum flame lengths of conspecific cones (Fonda et al. 1998). Maximum flame lengths of sugar <b>pine</b> cones, however, were twice that of sugar <b>pine</b> needles, in addition to cones having longer flaming time and smoldering time compared to needles (Fonda et al. 1998). Thus, it appears that sugar <b>pine</b> cones can be relatively greater contributors to surface fire behavior than cones of ponderosa <b>pine</b> or Jeffrey <b>pine.</b> By enhancing the flammability of the surface fuels, sugar <b>pine</b> cones may {{play an important role}} in the fuel dynamics of in mixed-conifer forests that lack a significant ponderosa <b>pine</b> or Jeffrey <b>pine</b> component, such as the YFDP.|$|R
