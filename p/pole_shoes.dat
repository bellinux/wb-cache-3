50|$|To {{efficiently}} wind the <b>pole</b> <b>shoes</b> lying {{close together}} of electronically commutated multipole three-phase motors, {{they will be}} coated with insulation and directly wound with the needle winding method. A needle with a nozzle that is placed at a right angle to the direction of movement travels in a lifting motion passing the stator packs through the groove channel between the two neighboring poles of the motor to drop the wire in the desired place. The stator is then turned at the reversal point on the winding head by one tooth pitch so that the previous process can run again in reverse order. With this winding technology a specific layer structure can be realized. The disadvantage is {{that there must be}} a clearance between two adjacent poles with a size of at least the nozzle diameter. The nozzle diameter is about three times the diameter of the winding wire. The space between two adjacent poles can therefore not be filled completely.|$|E

This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the <b>pole</b> <b>shoes,</b> hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Lately, {{the field}} of linear {{generators}} for wave energy conversion has attracted large attention, [1], [2]. One encouraging way to convert wave energy into electrical through direct drive is by using a linear, synchronous, longitudinal flux permanent magnet (PM) generator where the rotor piston is driven by, for example, a point absorber. As prices decrease, it has only recently become possible to use high remanence NdFeB magnets in technical applications. This opens up for new possibilities for linear generators, as high magnetic excitation can be achieved with smaller magnets. In the present work two concepts of magnet fixation, surface mounted magnets and magnets buried between <b>pole</b> <b>shoes</b> have been studied with NdFeB and ferrite magnets. While the former alternative demands stronger magnets, which {{are more difficult to}} handle, the latter yields a somewhat heavier rotor piston. <b>Pole</b> <b>shoes</b> provides better possibilities to shape the magnetic flux curve in the periphery of the air gap, and the magnets are more protected from transients. The surface mounted concept allows for a more efficient use of the magnets, as the leakage is lower than when the pole shoe approach is used. This means {{that it is possible to}} reduce the length of the rotor with surface mounted magnets. The different configurations are compared with respect to total magnet mass, efficiency and load angle. Thorough analysis of the generators has been carried out using full physics simulations using a finite element method (FEM) of the time dependent magnetic field. Magnetic intensity distributions, time dependent currents and voltages are also among the parameters that have been studied...|$|E

In this paper a novel linear segmented switched reluctance machine (LSSRM) having high force density and energy conversion ratio is proposed.

It is proved through finite element based simulation study (FEM) that LSSRM gives approximately double the force, {{for the same}} frame size as LSRM. This is achieved by decreasing the reluctance in the aligned position without affecting saliency ratio. The reluctance of LSSRM is decreased by reducing the flux path length and increasing the air gap area.
