An owner faced <b>with</b> dynamic <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> never liquidates and therefore accumulates capital to the golden rule level. For long-term liabilities, dividend payments and safety expenditure are non-decreasing over time.

If this is the case, then it accumulates less capital than the dynamic <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> owner; and may decrease dividend payments and safety expenditure over time.

50|$|The seminal {{theoretical}} {{contribution to}} the literature is that of Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, who studied credit rationing in market with imperfect information, in their namesake 1981 paper in the American Economic Review. Stiglitz and Weiss developed a model to illustrate how credit rationing can be an equilibrium feature of the market, {{in the sense that}} the rationed borrower would be willing to obtain the funds at an interest rate higher than the one charged by the lender, who will not be willing to lend the extra funds, as the higher rate would imply lower expected profits. It is equilibrium rationing as there exists excess demand for credit at the equilibrium rate of interest. The reason for that is adverse selection, the situation where the lender is faced with borrowers whose projects imply different risk levels (types), and the type of each borrower is unbeknownst to the lender. The main intuition behind this result is that safe borrowers would not be willing to tolerate a high interest rate, as, with a low probability of default, they will end up paying back a large amount to the lender. Risky types will accept a higher rate because they have a lower chance of a successful project (and typically a higher return if successful), and thus a lower chance of repayment. Note that this assumes limited liability, though results could still hold <b>with</b> <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transnational higher {{education}} is a major global phenomenon and the Australian {{higher education}} sector has taken up the challenge in securing {{their place in the}} global higher education system. 1 The policies of the Commonwealth government and the governance of many universities have certainly combined to enliven the ‘spirit of enterprise’ to extend the commercial arm of Australian universities to include significant transnational education arrangements with overseas providers. There has been a systematic increase in international students attracted to studying at Australian universities, which has involved a systematic increase in revenue. Many universities have established transnational educational ventures in various commercial forms, including joint ventures, agency and franchise arrangements. The various offshore ventures involving Australian universities have raised some pressing legal and non-legal issues that require examination. This article examines the legal relationship between Australian universities and partner offshore institutions in providing education services in collaborative transnational arrangements and investigates complex technical questions regarding whether these arrangements could give rise to legal liability in partnership. The main conclusion is that, in appropriate circumstances, it would be open to a court to find that a transnational arrangement between an Australian university and an offshore higher education institution is an arrangement between ‘persons’ who are carrying on a business in common with a view of profit and satisfy the legal status of partnership. The significance of a transnational education arrangement being a partnership is that an Australian university may find itself <b>with</b> <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> for the business of the arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the rapid}} rise in {{organizational}} forms for business associations, academics and practitioners {{have sought to}} explain the choice of form rationale. Each form contains {{its own set of}} default rules that inevitably get factored into this decision, including the extent to which each individual firm owner will be held personally liable for the collective debts and obligations of the firm. The significance of the differences in these default rules continues to be debated. Many commentators have advanced theories, most notably those based on <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability,</b> profit-sharing, and illiquidity, asserting that the partnership form provides efficiency benefits that outweigh any costs. In this article, the authors test these theories empirically by examining the choice of organizational form by New York law firms. Although the evidence indicates a strong shift from the general partnership form to the limited liability partnership form, a significant number of New York law firms remain general partnerships. The authors conclude that the prevailing theories based on <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability,</b> profit-sharing, and illiquidity are insufficient and posit that, in contrast to the beliefs of many commentators, the choice of form decision is quite complex. It depends on a variety of factors, including the behavior of other similarly situated firms that the decision makers consider competitors for prestige and clients. Nonetheless, it is apparent that <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> is generally considered burdensome, and it is the authors’ prediction that, at some point in time, nearly all the firms in their sample will choose to file as limited liability partnerships. The general partnership form, <b>with</b> its <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability,</b> will operate only as a penalty default that punishes parties who fail to sufficiently define their organization, forcing firm members to reveal relevant information to courts and interested third parties...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} optimal {{financial}} contracts {{of a firm}} which has private information over its expost revenues when the finance can be provided by either a single or two groups of investors. When {{they are the only}} investors we use a financial contract with non-contractible monitoring, in which the probabilities of cheating by the entrepreneur/firm and monitoring by investors are mutual best responses. The contract is written by the entrepreneur knowing that this equilibrium will subsequently occur. With a second group of investors who have no monitoring rights, we analyse a truth telling contract and a misrepresentation contract in which cheating and monitoring probabilities are chosen in a similar way to those of the single investor contract. The non monitoring investors learn the results of any monitoring for free. Our main results are that: the two investor group truth-telling contract achieves the second best despite the lack of commitment; this contract is only feasible under limited liability of investors if low state revenues are high enough. When low state revenues are too low for this then the two investor misrepresentation contract is optimal. This contract has a negative correlation between repayments to the two investor groups: the contract uses the non-monitoring group to smooth out the repayments of the entrepreneur optimally. This reduces his incentive to make false reports and mitigates the investor's incentive to monitor. A second result is that the two investor scenario is Pareto superior to the single investor model. We show that <b>with</b> <b>unlimited</b> <b>liability</b> on investor groups, the two investor misrepresentation contract is as good as the second best. Generally in this misrepresentation contract investors may have to make repayments to the firm rather than receive them. A further result is that the three party contract is always renegotiation-proof, as well as collusion-proof so long as the low state revenues are below the expected repayments of the monitor. Last we show that under limited liability the share of finance provided by the two is strictly positive and uniquely determined. financial contracts; multiple investors; no commitment. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{scenario}} of loan contracts with costly state verification, we {{examine how the}} properties of the set of states, different risk preferences of debtors and varying liability of lenders affect the structure of optimal repayments. In particular, we show that with risk-averse debtors, a general set of states, a constant observation cost and both unlimited and limited lender liability, the debtor is strictly better off revealing the true state of nature when his realized revenue is low, which implies that optimal debtor consumption has a downward jump around the single switch from observed to unobserved states. If the debtor can destroy revenue or if the debtor is risk neutral, this non-monotonicity of consumption disappears. Moreover, given the loan size, there is more monitoring under debtor-risk aversion than risk neutrality. We present simulations showing that a contract <b>with</b> <b>unlimited</b> lender <b>liability</b> and debtor-risk aversion has a higher expected observation cost but a lower variance of consumption than a contract with limited lender liability.
