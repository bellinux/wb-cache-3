Water quality parameters and physiological parameters were monitored/determined according to standard procedures. Water quality parameters were monitored after 48 hours with the exception of temperature which was monitored daily.

Representative plant material was collected from sample plots within an 8 km radius from {{the central part of the}} mine and from a reference area situated about 200 km upwind of the mining site. The following plant species were analysed: Bryoria jremontii, Br. juscescens, Cladina rangiferina, Equisetum fluviatile, Descbampsiaflexuosa, Eriopborum vaginatum, Salix glauca, Salix pbylicifolia, Betula nana, and Vaccini-um myrtillus. The greatest difference between metal concentrations in the <b>plants</b> collected from <b>dust</b> contaminated area and from the reference area was found in lichens. Copper is the main metallic component of the ore and was found in higher concentrations in lichens coming from the area around the mine than in lichens from the reference area.

Toward that goal, we analyzed a set of various potential organic matter (OM) sources such as aquatic and terrestrial <b>plants,</b> <b>dust,</b> and soils from Laguna Potrok Aike (LPA) and surrounding areas in southern Patagonia. We determined chain length distributions and hydrogen (δD) and carbon (δ 13 C) isotopic compositions of n-alkanes of different OM sources in order to quantify their relative contributions to lake sediments. Our results reveal that the mid-chain n-alkane, n-C 23, is predominantly produced by submerged aquatic plants, whereas long-chain n-alkanes (n-C 29 –n-C 31) are derived from various terrestrial sources. We estimated their relative contributions to the sediment using two approaches, i. e., based on the n-alkane distributions and their δD and δ 13 C values. Both approaches result in similar estimates of aquatic and terrestrial contributions for mid- and long-chain n-alkanes to the sediment. 62 – 73 % of the mid-chain n-C 23 alkanes originate from aquatic sources while 66 – 77 % of the long-chain n-alkanes originate from dust and 14 – 30 % from terrestrial plants. Our study shows that mid-chain n-alkanes such as the n-C 23 alkane in LPA are derived mainly from aquatic macrophytes and thus have the potential to record changes in lake-water isotopic composition.
