25|$|The {{life support}} system for the bell {{provides}} and monitors the main supply of breathing gas, and the control station monitors the deployment and communications with the divers. <b>Primary</b> <b>gas</b> supply, power and communications to the bell are through a bell umbilical, made up {{from a number of}} hoses and electrical cables twisted together and deployed as a unit. This is extended to the divers through the diver umbilicals.|$|E
25|$|A {{bailout bottle}} (BoB) or bailout {{cylinder}} is a scuba cylinder carried by an underwater diver {{for use as}} an emergency supply of breathing gas {{in the event of}} a <b>primary</b> <b>gas</b> supply failure. A bailout cylinder may be carried by a scuba diver in addition to the primary scuba set, or by a surface supplied diver using either free-flow or demand systems. The bailout gas is not intended for use during the dive except in an emergency. The term may be used to refer to just the cylinder, or the bailout set or emergency gas supply (EGS), which is the cylinder with the gas delivery system attached.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased <b>primary</b> <b>gas</b> supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may {{be included in}} these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth and if applicable, minimum operating depth.|$|E
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} were produced using both Ar and N 2 ̆ 082 as the <b>primary</b> plasma <b>gas.</b> Various {{aspects of the}} process and the coatings were investigated. It was found that higher in-flight particle temperatures could be produced using N 2 ̆ 082, but particle velocities were lower. Deposition efficiencies could be increased by a factor of two by using N 2 ̆ 082 as compared to Ar. Coatings having similar values of porosity, hardness, Young's modulus, and thermal diffusivity could be produced using the two <b>primary</b> <b>gases.</b> The coatings exhibited similar changes (increased hardness, stiffness, and thermal diffusivity) when heat-treated at 1400 0 C. However, the N 2 ̆ 082 -processed coatings tended to have lower values of Young's modulus and thermal diffusivity following such treatment. The results point to the potential advantage, in terms of reduced powder consumption and increased production rate, of using N 2 ̆ 082 as compared to Ar as the <b>primary</b> plasma <b>gas</b> for TBC deposition.

40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{the similarity between}} the expression for the state function of the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> representing a particle {{and that of the}} wave function. It is observed that the only difference between these two expressions is that in the former time appears as a real function while in the latter it appears as an imaginary function. He shows that the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> approach which treats time as real and the quantum mechanical approach which treats time as imaginary are two ways of representing the same reality and points to a new symmetry called the Wick symmetry. He shows that the probability postulate of quantum mechanics can be understood in a very simple and natural manner based on the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> representation of the particle. It is shown that the zero point energy of the quantum mechanics is nothing but the energy of the thermal bath formed by the vacuum fluctuations. The author shows that the quantum mechanics is nothing but the thermodynamics of the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> where time has not lost its directional symmetry...|$|R
40|$|The author {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> which is an abstract gas where the microstates are occupied successively in time unlike {{in the case of a}} real gas where the microstates are occupied simultaneously. He shows that the energy-momentum eigen state of a particle represented by a plane wave can be treated as a <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> which makes it possible to understand the dynamics of a particle in terms of the thermodynamics of such a gas. In this approach, time and space turn out to be the intrinsic properties of the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> representing a particle and the quantum nature of time and space emerges from it in a natural manner. It is shown that the action (with a negative sign) of a particle can be identified with the entropy of the <b>primary</b> eigen <b>gas</b> and the principle of least action is nothing but the second law of thermodynamics. Besides, it is shown that the uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics can be derived directly from the equation for the fluctuations...|$|R
25|$|The {{timing of}} gas {{generation}} presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and <b>primary</b> <b>gas</b> migration from, the source rocks could have terminated {{as early as}} the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, {{it is also possible that}} a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Doré and Jensen, 1996).|$|E
25|$|The Locker Shale and Mungaroo {{formation}} {{are associated}} with the syn-rift and post-rift sequences of the Permian extension that occurred just prior to the late Triassic extension event across the northwestern margin of Australia. Lying atop unconformable unit of Paleozoic sediments, the Locker Shale is composed of marine sediments deposited in a transgressional environment during the Late Permian extension. These marine sediments were deposited {{at the base of the}} Late Triassic and continued up until the end of Anisian age when it transitioned in the Mungaroo Formation. The Mungaroo Formation is an intricate fluvial environment of meandering and braided stream deposits laid down in the Ladinian (~241 Mya) to Norian ages (~209 Mya) during the pre-rift active margin of the Northwestern Australian Shelf. It is one of the thickest formations in the region and becomes progressively thicker (approximately 3,000 m thick) in the distal portions of the Northern Carnarvon Basin furthest offshore. One of the <b>primary</b> <b>gas</b> source for the Exmouth Plateau and Northern Carnarvon Basin, the Mungaroo Formation contains thick successions of siltstone, sandstone, and coal.|$|E
2500|$|The term bailout bottle, bailout {{cylinder}} or EGS (military/professional - emergency gas supply) [...] {{refers to}} a scuba cylinder carried by an underwater diver for use as an emergency supply of breathing gas {{in the event of}} a <b>primary</b> <b>gas</b> supply failure.

5000|$|Buffer gases are {{commonly}} used in many applications from high pressure discharge lamps to reduce line width of microwave transitions in [...] alkali atoms. A buffer gas usually consists of atomically inert gases such as helium, argon, and nitrogen which are the <b>primary</b> <b>gases</b> used.

25|$|Secondary {{particles}} {{derive from}} the oxidation of <b>primary</b> <b>gases</b> such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides into sulfuric acid (liquid) and nitric acid (gaseous). The precursors for these aerosols—i.e. the gases from which they originate—may have an anthropogenic origin (from fossil fuel or coal combustion) and a natural biogenic origin. In the presence of ammonia, secondary aerosols often {{take the form of}} ammonium salts; i.e. ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate (both can be dry or in aqueous solution); in the absence of ammonia, secondary compounds take an acidic form as sulfuric acid (liquid aerosol droplets) and nitric acid (atmospheric gas), all of which may contribute to the health effects of particulates.|$|R
5000|$|Small, {{electronegative}} molecules such as {{nitrogen and}} oxygen, {{which are the}} <b>primary</b> <b>gases</b> in air, significantly impact the ability of surrounding molecules to participate in hydrogen bonding. These molecules compete with surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors for hydrogen bond donors, therefore acting as [...] "hydrogen bond breakers" [...] and weakening interactions between surrounding molecules in the environment. Antiparellel strands in DNA double helices are non-covalently bound by hydrogen bonding between Watson and Crick base pairs; nitrogen and oxygen therefore maintain the potential to weaken the integrity of DNA when exposed to air. As a result, DNA strands exposed to air require less force to separate and exemplify lower melting temperatures.|$|R

5000|$|The major {{category}} {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other <b>primary</b> <b>gases</b> also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Greenhouse gas sources resulting from project construction activities are typically generated from transportation of materials to the project site and petrol based equipment used during construction of the project itself. Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants. Projects that are not stationary sources such as residential and commercial developments, schools, and related infrastructure can also contribute to increases in greenhouse gases. These projects emit greenhouse gases from sources such as vehicle mileage trips to site, energy to run the facility, and landscape maintenance equipment. Land use conversion can reduce vegetation sequestration of carbon dioxide.|$|R

40|$|We conduct 3 D {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the winds collision {{process in the}} massive binary system Eta Carinae, and conclude that accretion occurs during periastron passage.
