40|$|Precise {{diagnosis}} of loosening of endoprosthetic implants {{plays an important}} role in timely, adequate treatment. However, today's diagnostic tools, mainly radiological evaluation, do not yield satisfactory results. Therefore, a new approach based on the transmission of an internally generated combined acoustic and vibration signal, was investigated. For signal generation, a magnetic oscillator which impinges inside an implant component, can be used. The signal can be detected by an external accelerometer being positioned on the skin surface. Differences in the signal generated result from varying degrees of implant fixation. This principle was tested in seven porcine foreleg specimens with a custom implant. Influence of the measurement location at the porcine skin and different levels of fixation were investigated (<b>pressfit,</b> slight loosening, advanced loosening), with regard to the pull-out strength. Evaluation of different parameters, especially the frequency spectrum resulted in differences of up to 12 % for the comparison between <b>pressfit</b> and slight loosening, and 30 % between <b>pressfit</b> and advanced loosening. A significant correlation between the measured frequency and the pull-out strength for different levels of fixation was found. Thus, the novel diagnostic method shows potential for the precise detection of implant loosening. Further work is required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system in animal experiments...|$|E

40|$|Shape-memory-materials show good {{actuating}} properties {{based on}} their high reversible strain potential. The implicit positioning range can profitably be used in micro machines, if detachable connections between shape-memory-elements and adjacent steel-components are sufficiently realized. In this paper theoretical approaches to describe the design principles of the shaft to collar connections are followed by experimental validation of clamping and <b>pressfit</b> connections. The variation of the preload for clamping connections can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal <b>pressfit</b> connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between shaft and collar even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading. The evaluation of the surface appearance confirms the necessity of the calculated large joint length. Dependent on the temperature and the micro structure of the shape-memory-component different wear mechanisms are of major importance. (orig.)

40|$|PURPOSE Despite {{the fact}} that new and modern short-stems allow bone sparing and saving of soft-tissue and muscles, we still face the {{challenge}} of anatomically reconstructing the femoro-acetabular offset and leg length. Therefore a radiological and clinical analysis of a short-stem reconstruction of the femoro-acetabular offset and leg length was performed. METHODS Using an antero-lateral approach, the optimys short-stem (Mathys Ltd, Bettlach, Switzerland) was implanted in 114 consecutive patients in combination with a cementless cup (Fitmore, Zimmer, Indiana, USA; vitamys RM <b>Pressfit,</b> Mathys Ltd, Bettlach, Switzerland). Pre- and postoperative X-rays were done in a standardized technique. In order to better analyse and compare X-ray data a special double coordinate system was developed for measuring femoral- and acetabular offset. Harris hip score was assessed before and six weeks after surgery. Visual analogue scale (VAS) satisfaction, leg length difference and the existence of gluteal muscle insufficiency were also examined. RESULTS Postoperative femoral offset was significantly increased by a mean of 5. 8  mm. At the same time cup implantation significantly decreased the acetabular offset by a mean of 3. 7  mm, which resulted in an increased combined femoro-acetabular offset of 2. 1  mm.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of tibial stem design on load transfer, strains and relative micromotion between the tibial tray and bone. Attempts were also made to correlate FE results with clinical findings, like bone resorption, fibrous layer formation, radiolucencies and pain. The effect of the medial position of the tibial tray to obtain good alignment with press-fit long stems provoked higher strains when compared with the model where the stem was shifted medially. Cemented stems reduce load transfer by the tibial tray to proximal bone while <b>pressfit</b> stems transmit higher percentage of load. The idea that orthopaedic surgeons have that this kind of stems reduce load transmitted to the proximal bone is according to this study a wrong one. The hypothesis that load transferred at the distal tip of the press-fit stems occurs is true in an immediately pos-operative situation if micromotion is minimised due to an adequate press-fit. However, in the middle and long term, the share of load at the distal bone cannot not achieved. FE results demonstrated potential mechanical-clinical relations relative to bone resorption, radiolucencies and pain...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends and}} {{progresses}} in power electronics rely on fast, miniaturized, high current and high temperature switching semiconductors. However, in electronics system design, passive components technologies, in particular capacitors, limit their full exploitation. The {{goal of the}} present paper is, firstly, to analyse the capacitor technologies, in particular ceramic technologies for the limits set by high current, high voltages, high temperatures, high frequencies, and by cost items. Secondly, {{for each of the}} identified limits, to define the tools and technologies that are capable to overcome it. The new technologies include a new PLZT based antiferroelectric ceramic material with high switching field, copper inner electrode for the multilayer construction, firing in reducing atmosphere, applying a sputter method for the outer connecting electrode combined with silver sintering of a flexible termination or of a <b>pressfit</b> connector. The third goal is to show how the new technologies are applied such that the cost forecast in production scale is giving a good economic perspective for future use in power electronic systems. Finally, specific applications in power electronics are selected and described, where the benefits resulting from the new technologies are made evident...|$|E

The present {{study was conducted to}} compare the load sharing characteristics and construct stability of the tibial component when using cemented and cementless press-fit stem extensions. Methods: A total of 3 finite element models simulating 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 and 15 mm height wedge-shaped bone defect in the medial side of tibia plateau were constructed. All defects were repaired by cement with 2 screws reinforcement. Tibial standard implant without long stem, and 45, 60, 75, 90, 115 mm cemented and press-fit stems were simulated. The micromotion between the bone-cement interface was investigated. Results: In all defect models, both cemented and press-fit long stems had greater reduction in the bone-cement interface micromotion than the standard implant. Cemented stems transferred more applied load to diaphyseal bone than the <b>pressfit</b> stem. Cemented stems showed relative lower interface displacement than press-fit stems in all models. When the defect was 12. 5 mm, stems longer than 45 mm were required. When the defect was 15 mm, the stems longer than 60 mm were required.

40|$|Purpose of the study. -Most {{studies have}} {{reported}} {{a significant decrease in}} periacetabular bone stock one year after implantation of a cementless cup. The purpose of this work was to study the bone-implant interface of the tantalum cup using plain X-rays and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Material and methods. -This retrospective analysis concerned 42 patients with a tantalum cup, Trabecular Metal (TM) (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). All hips had primary implantations, performed by one surgeon via the same approach and with the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Minimum follow-up was two years. The Harris clinical score, and radiographic (lucent lines and acetabular position) and densitometric (analysis of 3. 3 mm of periacetabular bone in the three DeLee and Charnley zones) were recorded. Results. -At follow-up, the mean Harris score was 81. There were no implant malpositions (horizontal, vertical, inclination). Lucent lines were noted for 14 % of the cups. Bone mineral density (BMD) was higher than generally observed with cementless cups (1. 290 +/- 0. 309 g/cm(2)). Discussion. -The clinical and radiographic results are similar to data in the literature regarding correct implant position. The higher rate of lucent lines around the tantalum cup is also reported in the literature and {{is the result of the}} <b>pressfit,</b> resolving at one year. The greater BMD in zone 1 might reflect better force transfer to the weight-bearing zone. Conclusion. -As biomaterial recently introduced in orthopedic surgery, tantalum appears to provide a better force transfer to the central part of the iliac bone and thus possibly better preservation of pelvic bone stock.

40|$|Polyethylene {{wear and}} {{micromotion}} of the implant {{play an important}} role in multifactorial etiology of osteolysis leading to aseptic loosening of the acetabular components. Despite excellent results in primary total hip arthoplasty in a 10 - 15 year perspective there are still unsolved problems. The weakest link is the longevity of the actabular component. Young and active patients have a clearly worse outcome than older patients. Consequences of polyehtylene wear and ways to reduce wear have therefore been in focus during recent years. Radiostereometry (RSA) is the golden standard in measuring in vivo micromotions. In 4 clinical studies including 332 patients we used therefore RSA to record the efficacy of fixation of cemented and uncemented cups. The amount of wear of old and newly designed polyethylenes (PE) was related to cup stability and radiological and clinical measures of outcome. This study showed that cementless cups inserted with <b>pressfit</b> technique do not need additional augmentation. Screws and pegs increase the risk for radiolucencies and osteolystic lesions but are helpful tools in cases where primary stability is jeopardized. In the second decade clinically silent osteolysis is common for the porous coated Harris Galante cup with unsealed screw holes. The locking mechanism of the PE liner in this cup is unsatisfactory and an increase of liner dissociations is expected. EtO sterilized PE displayed high in vivo wear and we do not recommend its continued use but close monitoring of patients with earlier inserted EtO sterilized implants. The substantially reduced wear in cemented highly cross-linked PE cups without any negative in vivo tradeoffs might have a substantial impact on choice of material and operating technique in the near future. However, we still recommend its restrained use in controlled series until longer follow-up data is available. Nevertheless, the short term in vivo results of modern highly cross-linked PE look promising and ight improve the outcome of cemented and uncemented hip arthroplasties by reducing complication and revisions...|$|E
