25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton <b>pump</b> <b>drives</b> protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E

The result demonstrates that there exists strong effect between <b>pump</b> <b>driven</b> current and wind-driven current. The wind can effectively reduce the area of low velocity zone of <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> current {{as well as the}} power consumption of pump. And the increased high velocity area could better inhibit the algae growth and thus prevents degradation of water quality...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a graphene quantum <b>pump,</b> adiabatically <b>driven</b> by two thin potential barriers vibrating around their equilibrium positions.

40|$|In {{the current}} economy {{situation}} companies {{try to reduce}} their expenses. One of the solutions {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency of the processes. It is known that the energy consumption of pumping applications range from 20 up to 50 % of the energy usage in the certain industrial plants operations. Some studies have shown that 30 % to 50 % of energy consumed by pump systems could be saved by changing the pump or the flow control method. The aim of this thesis is to create a mobile measurement system that can calculate a working point position of a <b>pump</b> <b>drive.</b> This information can be used to determine the efficiency of the <b>pump</b> <b>drive</b> operation and to develop a solution to bring pumpâ€™s efficiency to a maximum possible value.

30|$|The {{improvement}} in the reliability and availability of the pumping engine components, which {{is a part of}} the general technological progress, has caused that the availability of the 2 [*]Ã—[*] 60 % (2 [*]Ã—[*] 50 %) systems driven with electric motors is only slightly different from the values achieved by the EM 3 [*]Ã—[*] 50 % or BPT 100 %[*]+[*]EM 30 % configurations.
