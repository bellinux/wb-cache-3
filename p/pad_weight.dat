40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: Decision-making {{regarding}} {{surgery for}} post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI) is challenging. The 24 -hour <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test {{is commonly used}} to objectively quantify PPI. However, <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> may vary based upon activity level. We aimed to quantify variability in pad weights based upon patient-reported activity. Materials and Methods: 25 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled. All patients demonstrated clinical stress urinary incontinence without clinical urgency urinary incontinence. On three consecutive alternating days, patients submitted 24 -hour pad weights along with a short survey documenting activity level and number of pads used. Results: Pad weights collected across the three days were well correlated to the individual (ICC 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 74 – 0. 93), p< 0. 001). The mean difference between the minimum <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> leakage and maximum leakage per patient was 133. 4 g (95 % CI 80. 4 – 186. 5). The mean increase in 24 -hour leakage for a one-point increase in self-reported activity level was 118. 0 g (95 % CI 74. 3 – 161. 7, p< 0. 001). Pad weights also varied significantly when self-reported activity levels did not differ (mean difference 51. 2 g (95 % CI 30. 3 – 72. 1), p< 0. 001). Conclusions: 24 -hour <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> leakage may vary significantly on different days of collection. This variation is more pronounced with changes in activity level. Taking into account patient activity level may enhance the predictive value of <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> testing...|$|E

In vitro rates of isoprenaline stimulated lipolysis were significantly greater in brown but not white adipose tissue. Rates of [14 C]glucose incorporation into triacylglycerols were significantly reduced in BAT (brown adipose tissue) and WAT (white adipose tissue) under basal and isoprenaline stimulated conditions. In a second experiment, hyperthyroid animals showed impaired weight gain, despite increased food intake during 19 days' treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT Genetic {{parameters}} concerning {{weight of}} abdominal fat pads were determined for a randombred layer-type population. Progeny by the upper (U) and lower (L) 10 % of the sires {{with respect to}} weights of fat pads were compared. Cellularity measures were made of the fat pads from random samples {{of the two groups}} of progeny. Progeny of U sires had fat pads numerically heavier than those of progeny by all sires. However, progeny of L sires had fat pad weights similar to those of all sires. Heritability estimates of abdomi-nal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight,</b> as calculated from half-sib correlation and regression of offspring on sires, were. 29 ±. 36 and. 27 ±. 06, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of early feed restriction on organ weights, fat deposition, and carcass composition in broilers. In Experiments 1 and 2, broiler chicks were reared in litter pens for 49 days, whereas Experiments 3, 4, and 5 were conducted in battery cages for 28 days. Feed restriction in all experiments was accomplished by providing male broiler chicks 40 kcal per bird per day for 7 (Experiments 1 and 2) or 6 (Experiments 3, 4, and 5) days, starting at 4 days of age. Feed restriction of broiler pullets in Experiment 1 was imposed from 4 to 9 days of age. Furthermore, the starter and grower diets in Experiment 2 contained either 1 or 4 % added fat and the starter diets in Experiments 3, 4, and 5 contained either 21 or 26 % protein. No significant differences were observed for abdominal fat <b>pad</b> and gizzard <b>weights,</b> liver and carcass fat, or carcass protein between early restricted birds and ad libitum controls at 49 days of age in Experiments 1 and 2. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} Experiment 4, no differences in abdominal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were observed among the different feeding regimens. Significant increases in abdominal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights,</b> percentage liver, and percentage carcass fat were noted for females at 49 days of age when compared with male broilers. Carcass fat was significantly higher and carcass protein was significantly lower in broilers fed commercial versus reduced fat diets. Broilers fed a 21 % protein diet had significantly heavier abdominal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> at 28 days of age than birds fed a 26 % protein diet. No significant interactions were observed between the various treatments for the different variables measured. Results from the present studies indicate that early feed restriction minimally affects organ weights, fat deposition, and carcass composition of broiler chickens later in life.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if dietary Chlorella vulgaris (chlorella) intake would be effective on cadmium (Cd) detoxification in rats fed dietary Cd. Fourteen-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 415. 0 ± 1. 6 g were randomly divided into two groups and fed slightly modified American Institute of Nutrition- 93 Growing (AIN- 93 G) diet without (n= 10) or with (n= 40) dietary Cd (200 ppm) for 8 weeks. To confirm alteration by dietary Cd intake, twenty rats fed AIN- 93 G diet without (n= 10) and with (n= 10) dietary Cd were sacrificed and compared. Other thirty rats were randomly blocked into three groups and fed slightly modified AIN- 93 G diets replacing 0 (n= 10), 5 (n= 10) or 10 % (n= 10) chlorella of total kg diet for 4 weeks. Daily food intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ weight (liver, spleen, and kidney), perirenal fat pad and epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were measured. To examine Cd detoxification, urinary Cd excretion and metallothonein (MT) concentrations in kidney and intestine were measured. Food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ <b>weight</b> and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were decreased by dietary Cd intake. Urinary Cd excretion and MT concentrations in kidney and small intestine were increased by dietary Cd. After given Cd containing diet, food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ <b>weights</b> and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were not influenced by dietary chlorella intake. Renal MT synthesis tended to be higher in a dose-dependent manner, but not significantly. And chlorella intake did not significantly facilitate renal and intestinal MT synthesis and urinary Cd excretion. These findings suggest that, after stopping cadmium supply, chlorella supplementation, regardless of its percentage, might not improve cadmium detoxification from the body in growing rats...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of high fat diet and endurance training on rat adipose tissue. Male Wistar rats were assigned to either a low or high fat diet (12 % and 73 % calories as fat, respectively). Both groups were further divided into sedentary (LFS;n= 11 and HFS;n= 11) and exercise trained (LFT;n= 11 and HFT;n= 11) groups. Exercise training was 5 wk swimming program in which duration of swimming was gradually increased to 5 h/day. Epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> and adipose cell size in HFS group were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher than in LFS group. Endurance training was associated with a lower body weight and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> in both diet groups. The high fat diet decreased lipolysis stimulated by maximum norepinephrine in both untrained and trained groups (～ 48 and ～ 38 %, respectively). Endurance training increased the lipolysis in both low and high fat diet groups (～ 41 % and ～ 96 %, respectively). These results suggest that obesity and lipemia induced by the high fat diet might be improved by endurance training...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Evaluate the efficacy, safety, and {{tolerability}} {{of a novel}} pressure-attenuation balloon for {{the treatment}} of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) using a prospective, randomized, single-blind, multi-center design, evaluated at 3 months. Methods: Sixty-three females with SUI were randomized 2 : 1 to treatment with a balloon (N= 41) or sham procedure (N= 22). The sham (control) entailed the same procedure without the deployment of a balloon. Endpoints were evaluated at 3 months and included a composite endpoint that required both 10 point increase in the 22 -item Incontinence Quality of Life Survey (I-QOL) and 50 % decrease in provocative <b>pad</b> <b>weight.</b> Additional endpoints included incontinence episode frequency, and PGII assessment. Results: In an ITT analysis, 63 % of women in the treatment group achieved the composite endpoint, compared to 31 % in the Control Group (P= 0. 0200). In a per protocol analysis, 81 % of women in the treatment arm had a 50 % decrease in <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test vs. 45 % in the Control Group (P= 0. 0143); 41. 6 % of the treatment patients were dry on <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test (1 gram) vs. 0 % in the Control Group (P< 0. 001), and 58 % of treated patients reported improvement on a PGII assessment versus 25 % of women in the Control Group (P= 0. 025). Adverse events in the treatment group included dysuria (14. 6 %), gross hematuria (9. 8 %), and UTI (7. 3 %). Conclusions: This minimally invasive treatment for female SUI with an intravesical pressure-attenuation balloon was safe and effective.

This study evaluated the potential use of in ovo administration of exogenous endocrine compounds to enhance growth and reduce fat content of posthatch broiler chickens. Effects of in ovo administration of growth hormone (GH) plus triiodothyronine (T 3) on growth and adiposity of broiler chickens were investigated in experiment 1. Vehicle or vehicle containing. 1 ng T 3 plus. 25 mg GH,. 1 ng T, plus 2. 5 mg GH or. 1 ng T 3 plus 25 mg GH were injected into the albumen of fertile eggs on day 11 of incubation. Female broilers from eggs injected with. 1 ng T 3 plus 25 mg GH had significantly greater body weights as compared to controls from 5 weeks to 7 weeks of age. Administration of. 1 ng T 3 plus 2. 5 mg G H resulted in a significant (P <. 05) 20. 5 % reduction in fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> in males. The effect of manipulating estrogen status in ovo on posthatch growth rate and skeletal development was examined by two trials in experiment 2. Effects of in ovo administration of tamoxifen citrate (T) or 17 f 3 -estradiol (E) on growth and fattening of broiler chickens were assessed in trial 1. At day one of incubation, either vehicle, vehicle containing 20 Mg of E or 200 Mg of T was injected into the albumen of fertile eggs. Neither sex ratios, body weight, fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> nor adipose cellularity parameters were altered by the concentrations of T or E administered in trial 1. In trial 2, eggs from a commercially selected broiler line and from a population of Athens-Canadian Randombreds (AC) were injected with either vehicle or vehicle containing 500 mg of T. At three weeks of age, chicks were sampled for fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> and gonadal sex. The higher concentrations of T administered in trial 2 resulted in significant modifications in phenotypic sex ratios at hatch in both genotypes. However, these phenotypic changes in sex ratios did not yield significant alterations in body weight, fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> or skeletal development. In conclusion, in ovo endocrine administration resulted in modifications of growth and tissue development in broilers.

40|$|Abstract Background Intrauterine growth {{retardation}} due to maternal under-nutrition increases susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. We reported {{earlier in the}} offspring of mineral or vitamin restricted rat dams, a high body fat percentage and decreased insulin secretion to glucose challenge. This study determined whether or not central adiposity and altered adipocytokine profile were associated with high body fat content. Methods Body fat percentage; glucose, insulin and adipocytokine levels in fasting plasma and fresh weights of epididymal fat pads were determined {{in the six months}} old male offspring of Wistar NIN rat dams on chronic 50 percent restriction of vitamins or minerals throughout their growth, gestation, lactation and weaned on to restricted diets or restricted mothers/offspring rehabilitated from different time points. Results In line with high body fat percent, chronic restriction of vitamins and minerals increased the epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight.</b> Maternal vitamin restriction decreased plasma adiponectin and increased leptin levels whereas mineral restriction decreased both. Both the treatments did not affect plasma TNF-α levels or insulin resistance status (HOMA-IR). Rehabilitation from parturition but not weaning, rescued the changes in the offspring. Conclusion High body fat percentage in the offspring of vitamin restricted or mineral restricted rat dams was associated with increased abdominal adiposity (epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight)</b> and differential expression of adipocytokines but not insulin resistance.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the true value of non {{invasive}} exploration tools of urinary incontinence such as ICIQ-sf questionnaire and 1 hour <b>pad</b> <b>weighting</b> test correlated with urodynamics findings. Method and population: We performed a cross-sectional study comparing successive urodynamic testings from December 2007 to April 2010 over 120 patients (12 M, 108 F) aged from 20 to 91. 5 y. old (m = 57. 8; SD = 15) consulting for urinary incontinence. Each of them (120) answered to the ICIQ-sf questionnaire and the 1 -hr <b>pad</b> <b>weighting</b> test was performed in 115 cases (96 %). We evaluated the correlations between ICIQ-sf scores and results of the pad test. We proceeded to a statistical likelihood ratio analysis of these two non invasive methods comparatively to the prevalence assessed by urodynamics (Receiver Operating Curve procedure). Results: The mean ICIQ-sf score was 13. 5 (SD = 4. 6) with a mean pad testing of 8 gm (SD = 16). As regards to urodynamic findings, the curve used to evaluate the practical value of ICIQ-sf score showed an under curve area of 0. 689 (IC 95 %: [0. 598 - 0. 770]) and the curve used to evaluate the practical value of pad test showed under curve area of 0. 693 (IC 95 %: [0. 600 - 0. 779]). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression model showed two independants predictors of incontinence (age: OR: 1. 07; IC 95 %: [1. 02 - 1. 12]; P = 0. 0032 and ICIQ-sf; OR: 1. 2; IC 95 %: [1. 06 - 1. 36]; P = 0. 0037).

Two hundred poults were reared from 4 to 28 wk of age under four treatments as follows: full-fed controls (FF), low-protein diet (12 % CP from 12 to 28 wk; LP), and reduced BW (10 to 20 % lower BW than FF; RIO and R 20). At photostimula-tion (28 wk), all birds consumed a commercial breeder diet ad libitum {{for the remainder of}} the study (48 wk of age). Settable egg production (eggs per hen) to 48 wk for all hens, and those in lay was: FF, 39. 4 (48. 6); LP 42. 7 (51. 7); RIO, 41. 4 (52. 8); R 20, 40. 7 (55. 4).

40|$|Low {{birth weight}} and rapid {{postnatal}} weight gain are independent and additive {{risk factors for}} the subsequent development of metabolic disease. Despite an abundance of evidence for these associations, mechanistic data are lacking. The hormone leptin has received significant interest as a potential programming factor, because differences in the profile of leptin in early life {{have been associated with}} altered susceptibility to obesity. Whether leptin alone is a critical factor for programming obesity has, until now, remained unclear. Using the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse, we show that low birth weight followed by rapid catch-up growth during lactation (recuperated offspring) leads to a persistent increase in body weight in adult life, both in wild-type and ob/ob animals. Furthermore, recuperated offspring are hyperphagic and epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> are significantly increased, reflecting greater adiposity. These results show definitively that factors other than leptin are crucial in the programming of energy homeostasis in this model and are powerful enough to alter adiposity in a genetically obese strain...|$|R

At a dose of 1 micrograms/g of body weight, injected EGF resulted in a 50 % decrease of fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight.</b> Although kidney weight was also diminished, the weight of other organs such as liver and intestine remained unchanged or even slightly increased, suggesting {{that the effect of}} EGF on fat pad development was not due to a generalized inhibitory action of EGF {{on the development of the}} neonate rats. The number of adipocyte precursors in inguinal fat pads of EGF-treated animals was higher than in control animals (1. 3 -fold for 0. 3 micrograms/g of body weight of EGF and 1. 8 -fold for 1. 0 micrograms/g of body weight), whereas the number of mature adipocytes and the amount of triglyceride accumulated per fat pad were concomitantly lower. Adipocyte precursors isolated from EGF-treated animals displayed a reduced differentiation ability in culture and a higher sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of EGF than did cells isolated from control animals.

The increased lipogenesis in the chow-fed PPARalpha-null mice was accompanied paradoxically by lower mRNA expression of SREBP- 1 c and its target genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. Consumption of a high-cholesterol diet increased the mRNA expression of these genes in the PPARalpha-deficient mice but not in the wild-type. De novo cholesterol synthesis was not detectable in the adipose tissue of either genotype despite a relatively high expression of the mRNA's encoding SREBP- 2 and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase. The mRNA expression of these genes and of the LDL-receptor in adipose tissue of the PPARalpha-deficient mice was lower than that of the wild-type and was not downregulated by cholesterol feeding. The results suggest that PPARalpha plays a role in adipose tissue cholesterol and triacylglycerol homeostasis and prevents cholesterol-mediated changes in de novo lipogenesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the issue of}} obesity in humans, the production of low-fat meat from domestic animals is important in the agricultural industry to satisfy consumer demand. Understanding the regulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue could advance our knowledge to potentially solve both issues. Although the G 0 /G 1 switch gene 2 (G 0 S 2) was recently identified as an inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in vitro, its role in vivo has not been fully clarified. This study was conducted to investigate the role of G 0 S 2 gene in vivo by using two independent transgenic quail lines during different energy conditions. Unexpectedly, G 0 S 2 overexpression had a negligible effect on plasma NEFA concentration, fat cell size and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> under ad libitum feeding condition when adipose lipolytic activity is minimal. A two-week feed restriction in non-transgenic quail expectedly caused increased plasma NEFA concentration and dramatically reduced fat cell size and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight.</b> Contrary, G 0 S 2 overexpression under a feed restriction resulted in a significantly less elevation of plasma NEFA concentration and smaller reductions in fat pad weights and fat cell size compared to non-transgenic quail, demonstrating inhibition of lipolysis and resistance to loss of fat by G 0 S 2. Excessive G 0 S 2 inhibits lipolysis in vivo during active lipolytic conditions, such as food restriction and fasting, suggesting G 0 S 2 as a potential target for treatment of obesity. In addition, transgenic quail are novel models for studying lipid metabolism and mechanisms of obesity...|$|E

40|$|The global rise in {{prevalence}} of obesity is not fully explained by genetics or life style factors. The developmental origins of health and disease paradigm suggests that environmental factors during early life could play a role. In this perspective, perinatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been indicated as a programming factor for obesity and related metabolic disorders later in life. Here we study early life programming by BPA using an experimental design that is relevant for human exposure. C 57 BL/ 6 JxFVB hybrid mice were exposed during gestation and lactation via maternal feed to 8 non-toxic doses (0 - 3000. μg/kg body weight/day (μg/kg bw/d)) of BPA. After weaning, offspring were followed for 20 weeks without further exposure. Adult male offspring showed dose-dependent increases of body and liver weights, no effects on fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> and a dose-dependent decrease in circulating glucagon. Female offspring showed a dose-dependent decrease in body weight, liver, muscle and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights,</b> adipocyte size, serum lipids, serum leptin and adiponectin. Physical activity was decreased in exposed males and suggested to be increased in exposed females. Brown adipose tissue showed slightly increased lipid accumulation in males and lipid depletion in females, and ucp 1 expression was dose-dependently increased in females. The effects in females were more reliable and robust than in males due to wide confidence intervals and potential confounding by litter size for male data. The lowest derived BMDL (lower bound of the (two-sided) 90 %-confidence interval for the benchmark dose) of 233. μg/kg bw/d (for interscapular weight in females) was below the proposed BMDL of 3633. μg/kg bw/d {{as a basis for}} tolerable daily intake. Although these results suggest that BPA can program for an altered metabolic phenotype, the sexual dimorphism of effects and diversity of outcomes among studies similar in design as the present study do not mark BPA as a specific obesogen. The consistency within the complex of observed metabolic effects suggests that upstream key element(s) in energy homeostasis are modified. Sex-dependent factors contribute to the final phenotypic outcome. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{inducing}} inactivity for 53 h after 21 days {{of voluntary}} running {{resulted in a}} 25 and 48 % increase in epididymal and omental fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights,</b> respectively, while rats continued to eat more than a group that never had access to a running wheel (J Physiol 565 : 911 – 925, 2005). We wanted {{to test the hypothesis}} that inactivity, independent of excessive caloric intake, could induce an increase in fat pad mass. Twenty-one-day-old rats were given access to voluntary running wheels for 42 – 43 days so that they were running 9 km/day in the last week of running, after which wheels were locked for 5, 53, or 173 h (WL 5, WL 53, WL 173) before the rats were killed. During the 53 and 173 h of inactivity, one group of animals was pair fed (PF) to match sedentary controls, whereas the other continued to eat ad libitum (AL).

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the 24 -month {{outcome of the}} Macroplastique(R) Implantation System (MIS) {{for the treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence (SUI) using objective and subjective measures, including quality-of-life (QoL) impact. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one consecutive women {{with a mean age of}} 47. 4 years and a mean body mass index 26. 16 kg/m(2) having urodynamically diagnosed intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) were enrolled. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by physical examination, Stamey grading of incontinence, pad usage, <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test, and urodynamic measurements. Quality of life was assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire. Patients underwent transurethral injection of the MIS under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The mean volume injected was 6. 3 mL. The data presented are based on 24 -month follow-up from the last injection, and the patients were considered their own controls. Results: Patient QoL improved in all domains. Ten patients (47 %) considered themselves cured; three (14. 3 %) thought they were improved, and eight (38. 1 %) believed the procedure had failed. According to the subjective surgeon Stamey grading, 8 patients (38. 1 %) were considered cured, 5 (23. 8 %) improved, and 8 (38. 1 %) failed. Daily pad usage was reduced from a mean of 4. 38 to 1. 47. According to the <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test, 12 patients (57. 1 %) were dry and two (9. 5 %) improved, while in 7 (33. 3 %), MIS failed. Urodynamic testing demonstrated 10 patients (50 %) dry and 5 (25 %) improved. Conclusion: The MIS proved to have an outcome acceptable to patients and surgeons at 24 -month follow-up.

40|$|Aim of the study: Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the anti-obesity activity of chloroform:methanol extract of P. integrifolia (CMPI) in mice fed with cafeteria diet. Materials and Methods: Female Swiss Albino mice were divided into six groups, which received normal and cafeteria diet, standard drug simvastatin (10 mg/kg) and CMPI (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) daily for 40 days. Parameters such as body weight, body mass index (BMI), Lee index of obesity (LIO), food consumption, locomotor behavior, serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), atherogenic index, organ weight and organ fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> were studied for evaluating the anti-obesity activity of P. integrifolia. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint profile of chloroform-methanol extract was also studied using quercetin as the reference standard. Results: There was a significant increase in body weight, BMI, LIO, food consumption, organ weight (liver and small intestine), organ fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> (mesenteric and peri-renal fat pad) and in the levels of serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL with a significant decrease in locomotor behavior (ambulation, rearing, grooming) and HDL level in cafeteria diet group. Animals treated with CMPI showed dose dependent activity. P. integrifolia (200 mg/kg) supplementation attenuated all the above alterations, which indicates the anti-obesity activity. HPLC fingerprint profile of CMPI showed two peaks in the solvent system of 50 mm potassium diphosphate (pH- 3 with ortho phosphoric acid) : Methanol (30 : 70 v/v) at 360 nm. Conclusion: Present findings suggest that, CMPI possessed anti-obesity activity that substantiated its ethno-medicinal use in the treatment of obesity...|$|E
40|$|Early {{postnatal}} overnutrition disrupts satiety without altering vagal gastrointestinal afferents. PHYSIOL BEHAV 00 (0) 000 - 000, 2010. Early postnatal overnutrition {{results in}} a predisposition to develop obesity {{due in part to}} hypothalamic and sympathetic dysfunction. Potential involvement of another major regulatory system component - the vagus nerve - has not been examined. Moreover, feeding disturbances have rarely been investigated prior to development of obesity when confounds due to obesity are minimized. To examine these issues, litters were culled on the day of birth to create small litters (SL; overnutrition), or normal-size litters (NL; normal nutrition). Body weight, fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight,</b> meal patterns, and vagal sensory duodenal innervation were compared between SL and NL adult mice prior to development of obesity. Meal patterns were studied 18 hour/day for 3 weeks using a balanced diet. Then vagal mechanoreceptors were labeled using anterograde transport of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase injected into the nodose ganglion and their density and morphology were examined. Between postnatal day 1 and weaning, body weight of SL mice was greater than for NL mice. By young adulthood it was similar in both groups, whereas SL fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> was greater in males, suggesting postnatal overnutrition produced a predisposition to obesity. SL mice exhibited increased food intake, decreased satiety ratio, and increased first meal rate (following mild food deprivation) compared to NL mice, suggesting postnatal overnutrition disrupted satiety. The density and structure of intestinal IGLEs appeared similar in SL and NL mice. Thus, although a vagal role cannot be excluded, our meal parameter and anatomical findings provided no evidence for significant postnatal overnutrition effects on vagal gastrointestinal afferents...|$|E
40|$|Adipose tissue serves {{two main}} {{functions}} in the body: (1) it is the body's primary energy depot; and (2) it also serves as an important endocrine organ, producing and secreting various enzymes, growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. Both of these functions require ample access to circulating blood. Many aspects of angiogenesis during adipose tissue expansion remain poorly understood. Adipocytes produce a large variety of molecules involved in angiogenesis, and obesity is associated with elevated circulating levels of Vascular Endothelial Growh Factor (VEGF). Our lab has previously shown that angiogenesis and adipogenesis are mutually dependent via a VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR 2) -mediated mechanism. Since then several other studies have reinforced a role for the VEGF-VEGFR system in energy metabolism. For example, genetically obese mice treated with anti-VEGF antibody had lower fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights,</b> but the VEGF receptor responsible for this observation is not known. There is also disagreement on the cell type(s) responsible for fat tissue's angiogenic capability, with some studies supporting a dominant role for adipocytes, while others attribute most of the angiogenic capacity to the adipose tissue stromal cells (ASC) ...|$|R

This study investigates the inhibitory effects of Korean mistletoe extract (KME) on adipogenic factors in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells and obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice fed a high-fat diet. Male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice fed a high-fat diet were treated with KME (3 g/kg/day) for 15 weeks for the antiobesity and NAFLD experiments. Body weight and daily food intake were measured regularly during the experimental period. The epididymal pad was measured and liver histology was observed. The effects of KME on thermogenesis and endurance capacity were measured. The effects of KME on adipogenic factors were examined in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop an optimal method for {{measuring}} male gonad weight, one that i s both statistically dependable (i. e. not subject to wide fluctuations within similarly treated groups) and appropriate with respect to end uses of data, testis, epididymis, and epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were obtained from normal adult male rats and subjected to statistical analyses. The results underscore the neces-sity for omitting the epididymal fat pad from “gonad “ weight measurements since {{there appeared to be}} no relationship between i t s weight and the weight of either the testis or epididymis. Furthermore, the ~nclusion of epididymal fat resulted in large variation in total unit weight. An interdependent relationship was shown for testis and epididymis weights, indicating i t may be appropriate to report a combined value for these entities, though this decision should be based on the intent of the study. A significant saving in time was effected by obtaining the weight of the testis alone. In studies which require male gonad weight assessment, therefore, the testis, excluding epididymis and epididymal fat, shoul...|$|R
