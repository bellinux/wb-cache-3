5|$|The Royal Navy {{selected}} the Sea King {{to meet a}} requirement for an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex, placing an order with Westland for 60 SH-3D Sea Kings in June 1966. The prototype and three pre-production aircraft were built by Sikorsky at Stratford, Connecticut and shipped to the United Kingdom to act as trials and <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The first of the SH-3Ds was initially fitted with General Electric T58s and, after being shipped from the United States, was flown in October 1966 from the dockside at Avonmouth to Yeovil airfield. The other three were delivered from the docks, by road to Yeovil, for completion with British systems and Rolls-Royce Gnome engines. The first Westland-built helicopter, designated Sea King HAS1, flew on 7 May 1969 at Yeovil. The first two helicopters were used for trials and evaluation by Westland and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment; subsequent production Sea Kings were delivered to the Royal Navy's 700 Naval Air Squadron from August 1969 onwards.|$|E

25|$|During August 1951, {{a second}} British-built Canberra (WD940) was flown to the US {{to act as}} a <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft</b> for Martin, as well as to perform {{assorted}} trials and to support performance validation of airframe changes. On 21 December 1951, one of the British <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft</b> (WD932) was lost in accident; although this was subsequently discovered to be caused by incorrect fuel scheduling having led to the tail-heavy aircraft exceeding its design limits during a maneuver, the crash jeopardized the entire program and invigorated the anti-Canberra political opposition. The crash did lead to some design changes in the face of political pressure, but these were not implemented on the first 75 aircraft to be produced.|$|E

25|$|ADRDE, the Army group {{developing}} gun laying and truck-mounted {{early warning}} radars, {{moved to the}} site in May, and was renamed the Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) in the process. They were soon joined by elements of the AMRE, who had also been renamed to become the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE). After arriving, the teams developed a plan to install the first six AI sets at nearby RAF Defford {{under the supervision of}} RAF fitters, at which point the aircraft would be flown to two operational fitting stations to serve as <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft</b> for new sets as they arrived. This system ultimately proved very successful, with 80 aircraft a month being delivered at the peak.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} planned to order 300 P.50s, but in April 1939, the new Air Force Commander Gen. Kalkus and Air Defence Inspector Gen. Józef Zając {{estimated}} that the current PZL.50 design did not meet its specified performance goals and ordered PZL to develop it further, building an improved <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft</b> with only a limited series of 25-30 aircraft on order, designated the P.50A. Production aircraft were to have the wing area increased from 15.8 m² to 19 m². The total planned order was decreased to 200 and Poland started to look for fighters abroad, ordering 160 Morane-Saulnier MS 406 fighters from France. As an interim measure, 100 PZL P.11g Kobuz fighters were ordered, fitting the P.11c airframe with Mercury VIII engines.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{manufacturer}} of the Hurricane was Canada Car and Foundry at their factory in Fort William, Ontario, Canada (the facility's Chief Engineer, Elsie MacGill, {{became known as}} the [...] "Queen of the Hurricanes"). The initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally, but was endorsed by the British government; Hawker, having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the Munich Crisis of 1938, drew up preliminary plans to expand Hurricane production via a new factory in Canada. Under this plan, samples, <b>pattern</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and a complete set of design documents stored on microfilm, were shipped to Canada; 22 early British-produced Hurricanes were transferred to support the development. As a result, Canadian-built Hurricanes were shipped to Britain to participate in events such as the Battle of Britain.|$|E
