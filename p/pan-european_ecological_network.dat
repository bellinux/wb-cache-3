40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> concept as a {{suitable}} basis for inserting biodiversity conservation into sustainable landscape development. For landscapes to be ecologically sustainable, the landscape structure should support those ecological processes {{required for the}} landscape to deliver biodiversity services for present and future generations. We first show that in multifunctional, human-dominated landscapes, biodiversity conservation needs a coherent large-scale spatial structure of ecosystems. Theory and empirical knowledge of <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> provides a framework {{for the design of}} such structures. Secondly, <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> can bridge the paradox between reserve conservation (fixing nature in space and time) and development, which implies change. This is because <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> can change structure without losing their conservation potential. Thirdly, <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> facilitate stakeholder decision-making on feasible biodiversity goals. They help to focus on an effective spatial scale. We conclude that extending the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> concept with multifunctional indicators is a promising step towards sustainable landscape development and stakeholder decision-making...|$|R

Constructing an effective and harmonious urban <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> and maintaining a sustainable living environment in response to rapid urbanization are the key issues required to be resolved by landscape planners. In this paper, Nanchang City, China was selected as a study area. Based on a series of landscape metrics, the landscape pattern analysis of the current (in 2005) and planned (in 2020) green space system were, respectively, conducted by using FRAGSTATS 3. 3 software. Considering the actual situation of the Nanchang urban area, a “one river and two banks, north and south twin cities” <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> was constructed by using network analysis. Moreover, the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> was assessed by using corridor structure analysis, and the improvement of an <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> on the urban landscape was quantitatively assessed through a comparison between the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> and green space system planning. The results indicated that: (1) compared to the green space system in 2005, the planned green space system in 2020 of the Nanchang urban area will decline in both districts (Changnan and Changbei districts). Meanwhile, an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of green space patches at the landscape level implies the fragmentation of the urban green space landscape. In other words, the planned green space system does not necessarily improve the present green space system; (2) the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> of two districts has high corridor density, while Changnan’s <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> has higher connectivity, but Changbei’s <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> is more viable from an economic point of view, since it has relatively higher cost efficiency; (3) decrease in patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbor distance, and an increase in mean patch size and connectivity implied that the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> could improve landscape connectivity greatly, as compared with the planned green space system. That is to say, the planned <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> would reduce landscape fragmentation, and increase the shape complexity of green space patches and landscape connectivity. As a result, the quality of the urban ecological environment would be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Network</b> is now widely recognised as an important policy initiative in support of protected Natura 2000 sites. The site selection is based on habitats as defined in the Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Whilst there is information {{about the presence of}} these habitats in Natura 2000 sites, there is no detail of their distribution elsewhere in Europe. The present paper describes a methodology that identifies the spatial distribution of habitats across Europe so that their actual extent can be determined. Five methodological steps are involved starting with selection of appropriate spatial data sets, defining knowledge rules from the descriptions of Annex I habitats, continuing with additional ecological expert knowledge when needed, implementation of the models, and finally the validation. Spatial distribution models were derived for 27 habitats representing the most significant ecosystems. This spatial modelling approach is illustrated with one detailed example. Validation showed that mapping accuracy depends on the habitat description available but also upon its spatial character. Thus widespread habitats such as forests were accurately assessed whereas dispersed classes such as freshwater systems were more difficult to assess. Possible methodological improvements are suggested, such as inclusion of vegetation relevés to improve the knowledge rules. Extension of the methodology to other habitats would require a moderate effort since data collection and processing has now been completed and it is this which is the most time consuming part of the process. We conclude that our method maps widespread European habitats with unprecedented accurac...|$|E

We formalize {{the construction of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>networks</b> in forest environments as the optimal control dynamic graph-theoretic problem. The <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> {{is based on a}} set of bioreserves and patches linked by green corridors. The network is defined as a graph, in which bioreserves, which host the species, are represented by the target nodes provided with an attraction function. The role of patches, which are represented by the unmarked nodes, is to receive the species before redirecting them to bioreserves. We consider two cases: a case of complete graph, where the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> is fully connected, and a case of incomplete graph, where the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> is partially connected. We use an ecologically and economically weighted Mahalanobis distance when dealing with the species migration through the grid.

In both cases, at the equilibrium, the <b>ecological</b> <b>network</b> maintains its connectedness while minimizing the distances between nodes weighted by the opportunity costs of timber production.
