25|$|Aronia melanocarpa (black chokeberry) has {{attracted}} scientific interest {{due to its}} deep purple, almost black pigmentation that arises from dense contents of polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. Total polyphenol content is 1752mg per 100 g dry weight, anthocyanin content is 1480mg per 100 g dry weight, and <b>proanthocyanidin</b> concentration is 664mg per 100 g fresh weight. These values are among the highest measured in plants to date. The black aronia species contains higher levels of anthocyanins than purple (Aronia prunifolia) or red aronia (Aronia arbutifolia), whereas red and purple aronia are richer in phenolic acid and proanthocyanins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Proanthocyanidins</b> {{have been}} shown to {{effectively}} protect ischemic neurons, but its mechanism remains poorly understood. Ginkgo <b>proanthocyanidins</b> (20, 40, 80 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours before reperfusion. Results showed that ginkgo <b>proanthocyanidins</b> could effectively mitigate neurological disorders, shorten infarct volume, increase superoxide dismutase activity, and decrease malondialdehyde and nitric oxide contents. Simultaneously, the study on grape seed <b>proanthocyanidins</b> (40 mg/kg) confirmed that different sources of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> have a similar effect. The neurological outcomes of ginkgo <b>proanthocyanidins</b> were similar to that of nimodipine in the treatment of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

50|$|<b>Proanthocyanidins</b> {{are present}} in fresh grapes, juice, red wine, and other darkly {{pigmented}} fruits such as cranberry, blackcurrant, elderberry, and aronia. Although red wine may contain more <b>proanthocyanidins</b> by mass per unit of volume than does red grape juice, red grape juice contains more <b>proanthocyanidins</b> per average serving size. An 8 fl oz serving of grape juice averages 124 milligrams <b>proanthocyanidins,</b> whereas a 5 fl oz serving of red wine averages 91 milligrams (i.e., 145.6 milligrams per 8 fl. oz. or 240 mL). Many other foods and beverages may also contain <b>proanthocyanidins,</b> but few attain the levels found in red grape seeds and skins, with a notable exception being aronia, which has the highest recorded level of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> among fruits assessed to date (664 milligrams per 100 g).|$|R

40|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) {{is one of}} the leading causes of offspring malformations, in which eye malformation is an important disease. It has raised demand for therapy to improve fetal outcomes. In this study, we used chick embryo to establish a GDM model to study the protective effects of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> on eye development. Chick embryos were exposed to high glucose (0. 2 mmol/egg) on embryo development day (EDD) 1. <b>Proanthocyanidins</b> (1 and 10 nmol/egg) were injected into the air sac on EDD 0. Results showed that both dosages of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> could prevent the eye malformation and rescue the high glucose-induced oxidative stress significantly, which the similar effects were showed in edaravone. However, <b>proanthocyanidins</b> could not decrease the glucose concentration of embryo eye. Moreover, the key genes regulating eye development, Pax 6, was down-regulated by high glucose. <b>Proanthocyanidins</b> could restore the suppressed expression of Pax 6.

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{initiated}} to determine whether <b>proanthocyanidins</b> can protect against doxorubicin-induced mutagenicity in mice and to elucidate the potential mechanism of this protection. Pretreatment of mice with <b>proanthocyanidins</b> (100 mg/kg/day, orally) for 7 days and simultaneously with doxorubicin (12 mg/kg, i. p.) for another day, significantly reduced the frequency of bone marrow DNA strand breaks and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes compared to doxorubicin-treated mice alone. Furthermore, <b>proanthocyanidins</b> caused a reduction in bone marrow suppression induced by doxorubicin treatment. In male germline, orally administration of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> (100 mg/kg/day, orally) for 7 consecutive days before and 7 consecutive days after treatment with doxorubicin (12 mg/ kg, i. p.), significantly elevated the levels of sperm count and motility reduced by doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore, <b>proanthocyanidins</b> significantly decreased the elevated levels of spermatogonial and spermatocyte chromosomal aberrations and sperm head abnormality induced by doxorubicin. Prior administration of <b>proanthocyanidins</b> ahead of doxorubicin reduced the doxorubicin induced testicular lipid peroxidation and prevented the reduction in testicularnonprotein sulfhydryl significantly. Conclusively, this study provides {{for the first time}} that <b>proanthocyanidins</b> have a protective role in the abatement of doxorubicin-induced mutagenesis and cell proliferation changes in germinal cells of mice that reside, at least in part, in their radical scavengeractivity. Therefore, <b>proanthocyanidins</b> can be a promising chemopreventive agent to avert secondary malignancy and abnormal reproductive outcomes risks in cancer patients receiving doxorubicin-involved treatment...|$|R

Empirical evidence suggests that <b>proanthocyanidins</b> that are seed-derived impart harsh and aggressive tannins to red wine, and minimizing the crushing of fruit prior to fermentation and maceration will minimize the extraction of seed material.

In addition, antityrosinase activity of the <b>proanthocyanidins</b> was investigated.
