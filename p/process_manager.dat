30|$|Our {{study also}} offers {{practical}} implications for <b>process</b> <b>managers.</b> Analogous to the theoretical insights, our results sensitize <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> to <b>process</b> deviance being a complex multi-causal construct {{that needs to}} be assessed holistically. Moreover, using the identified reasons as a checklist, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> can easily assess to which extent the processes in their area of responsibility tend toward process deviance. Despite the explorative nature of Delphi studies, it is justified to use the reasons as a checklist because the panelists agreed on them throughout multiple rounds. Using the identified reasons as a checklist offers a low-threshold assessment tool as <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> only require their own knowledge. Moreover, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> can apply the reasons in any application domain. When assessing to which extent business processes tend toward deviance, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> can derive custom weights for each reason based on the reasons’ importance for routine and nonroutine <b>processes.</b> <b>Process</b> <b>managers</b> can leverage such assessment results for multiple purposes: From a stand-alone perspective, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> can use the results for redesigning existing or creating novel business processes. From a process portfolio perspective, they can leverage the assessment results to prioritize processes for improvement purposes if they contrast the processes’ tendency toward deviance against the expected impact of process deviance. Finally, our reasons make the case for not only checking for process deviance during or after process execution. Rather, process deviance should also be considered at design time and when redesigning existing business processes before it occurs.|$|R

Lifehacker timed how long browsers took to start and reach a page (both right after boot-up and after running at least once already), timed how long browsers took to load nine tabs at once, tested JavaScript speeds using Mozilla's Dromaeo online suite (which implements Apple's SunSpider and Google's V8 tests) and measured memory usage using Windows 7's <b>process</b> <b>manager.</b> They concluded that Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 were the fifth and sixth fastest browsers respectively on startup, 3.5 was third and 3.6 was sixth fastest to load nine tabs at once, 3.5 was sixth and 3.6 was fifth fastest on the JavaScript tests. They also concluded that Firefox 3.6 was the most efficient with memory usage followed by Firefox 3.5.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a typical}} PowerPC-based Macintosh system, the boot process {{includes}} loading a bootstrap loader from ROM, loading the <b>Process</b> <b>Manager</b> {{stored in the}} boot blocks of the startup device, locating a [...] "blessed" [...] System Folder on the startup device, and then loading Finder. However, because the Pippin platform ran only on non-writable CD-ROM, a modification to the boot process had to be made. For developers who were using standard 7.5.2 system software, a [...] "PippinFinder" [...] was installed into the System Folder, allowing the CD-ROM to be bootable on a Pippin-based system. Once development was finalized, PippinFinder {{was removed from the}} System Folder, and the Pippin-specific system software was placed onto the build. In addition, an alias of the main executable was placed into the Startup Items folder, so that upon bootup, the application will launch automatically. Developers are constrained to the base hardware profile of the Pippin platform, using no hard drive cache for downloaded content, and sharing 128 KB of NVRAM with the system.|$|E

30|$|To {{address the}} {{limitation}} that our Delphi {{study focused on}} reasons for process deviance from a <b>process</b> <b>manager’s</b> perspective, we recommend that future research covers the perspectives of other roles such as process participants, <b>process</b> portfolio <b>managers,</b> or BPM method specialists. Beyond, future research should investigate process deviance for different application domains (e.g., sales or production processes) and process contexts (e.g., knowledge-intensive or inter-organizational processes). These activities will contribute to a holistic understanding of reasons for process deviance, which can then be used as foundation {{for future studies on}} process deviance. Not all other perspectives on process deviance can be covered by the Delphi method. While the Delphi method may also be appropriate for <b>process</b> portfolio <b>managers</b> or BPM method specialists, the perspective of process participants may be covered most suitably through interviews, ethnographies, or observations.|$|R
30|$|In the {{brainstorming}} and narrowing-down {{phases of}} our Delphi study, we answered the first research question by identifying and structuring reasons for process deviance. As analytical lens, {{we chose the}} perspective of <b>process</b> <b>managers.</b> Though not being operationally involved in <b>process</b> execution, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> are familiar with and responsible for business processes end-to-end both content-wise and regarding process performance. Thus, they {{play a key role}} in the coordination of work and the management of process deviance. For the same reason, <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> require neither <b>process</b> models nor logs to reason about whether a business process is deviant. This feature strengthens the ex ante view on process deviance and enables identifying broadly applicable reasons for process deviance. In the rating phase of our Delphi study, we addressed the second question by rating the identified reasons with respect to their importance for causing deviance in routine and nonroutine processes. The distinction between routine and nonroutine processes is common in organizational science, as both process types capture the nature of work in terms of variation and variety (Lillrank 2003), two concepts closely linked to process deviance. The distinction between routine and nonroutine processes is also relevant from an IS perspective, as the digital age, which is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, and complexity, and ambiguity (Bennett and Lemoine 2014), leads to a shift from routine to nonroutine processes (Gimpel et al. 2018). Between 60 and 80 % of all processes are supposed to be nonroutine processes (Swenson 2010).|$|R

30|$|The {{exploratory}} and iterative {{nature of}} the Delphi method fits our research questions. As knowledge on reasons for process deviance is immature, an exploratory research method is appropriate (Andrade et al. 2016). Further, an iterative method enables experts {{to benefit from the}} feedback of other experts and to think about reasons for process deviance as well as their importance repeatedly (Okoli and Pawlowski 2004). Thus, we preferred the Delphi method over other methods such as exploratory interviews where experts are involved only once and sequentially. The perspective of <b>process</b> <b>managers,</b> which we chose in our Delphi study for the reasons outlined in the introduction, can be suitably addressed by the Delphi method (Paré et al. 2013). This is because experienced experts from industry and academia can put themselves in the position of <b>process</b> <b>managers</b> and judge reasons for process deviance accordingly. However, in case process deviance is studied from complementary perspectives (e.g., the perspective of process participants), other research methods (e.g., observations, interviews, or ethnographies) are more suitable. As we will discuss in the conclusion, confirmatory research methods (e.g., surveys) are most appropriate to validate the results of our exploratory Delphi study.|$|R
