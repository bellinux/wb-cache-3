40|$|The {{state of}} {{diseases}} in South African domestic pigs drastically changed when Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) {{was introduced in}} the Western Cape Province during 2004 and was followed by an outbreak of Classical swine fever (CSF), primarily in the Eastern Cape, in 2005. These outbreaks occurred mostly in rural and backyard pig populations. Subsequent to an intensive culling operation, it became necessary to implement country-wide surveillance to substantiate that freedom from these two diseases had been achieved. Samples for a country-wide cross-sectional study were collected from commercial and non-commercial pig establishments in a combined effort between the South African Pig Producers Organisation (SAPPO) and the National and Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Veterinary Services. The survey targeted the high-risk sector of the pig population and included rural pig populations, pigs from “grey” herds (commercial farms with inadequate bio-security) and commercial establishments. Samples were also tested for Swine influenza (SI), Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), Aujeszky’s Disease (Aujeszky’s), Foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) and African swine fever (ASF). The first objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the validity of the survey design. The second objective was to evaluate the results and, thereafter, make valid inferences regarding the disease status of the domestic pig population. This also included the confidence level of the overall survey. The third objective was to qualify and quantify sample losses to enable improved future survey design and execution. The outcome of the survey indicated that the results were sufficient to conclude that the non-commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 1 %. The calculations also indicated that the results were adequate to conclude that the commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 5 %. The outcome of the calculations done on the second phase test results allows South Africa to conclude that the non-commercial pig sector is free from FMD, ASF, Aujeszky’s and TGE, at the expected minimum prevalence of 2 %. The sample sizes for Aujeszky’s, TGE, ASF and FMD tests in the commercial sector were too small to allow for a decision to be made and, as a result, it was not possible to declare this sector free of disease. However, the non-commercial sector is much larger and the risk of disease introduction higher, therefore, if the non-commercial sector tested negative for the disease, it is highly likely that the commercial sector will be free of the disease as well. It is recommended that passive surveillance be augmented and that a national <b>pig</b> <b>survey</b> be conducted every 3 years to provide proof of disease freedom. It is important to conduct a risk analysis to qualify and quantify the risk of CSF and PRRS introduction. This could improve future surveys by providing a scientific basis for targeted surveillance.

A total of 632 households with human population of 5905 were identified in seven pig- rearing locations in the study area while 105 (16. 6 %) of these households with human population of 1105 (18. 7 %) reared a total number of 3895 pigs. Physical randomization was used to select 50 % representative samples of pig-rearing households and pigs for this study. Out of the 402 pigs from 55 households, 207 (51. 5 %) pigs were positive for Balantidium coli cysts, 56 (13. 9 %) for Cryptosporidium oocysts while mixed infection was observed in 29 (7. 2 %). There is significance difference in the distribution of the two parasites in the <b>pigs</b> <b>surveyed</b> (p< 0. 05). Young pigs were most affected with infection rates of 33 (58. 9 %) Cryptosporidium oocysts, 113 (54. 6 %) Balantidium coli cysts and 17 (58. 6 %) mix infection. Human fecal samples collected from 53 individuals revealed 3 (5. 7 %) positive cases of Cryptosporidium oocysts all in young ones while a positive case of Balantidium coli cyst infection was found in an adult female. Water and soil samples from two areas were also found to contain both organisms. The semi-intensive system of pig rearing which allowed pigs to scavenge and defecate about, defective personal and environmental hygiene couple with the usage of untreated pig feaces as manure on vegetable farms in the study area can enhance the spread of these zoonotic diseases in human population...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} virus (CSFV) is a highly {{infectious}} disease of pigs. It has had significant impacts on East Nusa Tenggara, eastern Indonesia since its introduction in 1997. In spite of its importance to this region, {{little is known about}} its seroprevalence and distribution, and pig-level and farmer-level factors that may {{have an impact on the}} serological status of an individual pig. To address this knowledge deficit, a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey was conducted in 2010 involving 2160 pigs and 805 farmers from four islands in the region. Farmer questionnaires and pig record forms were used to collect data about the farmers and <b>pigs</b> <b>surveyed.</b> Blood was collected from each pig to determine its CSFV serological status. Apparent and true prevalence were calculated for each island, district, subdistrict, and village surveyed. CSFV serological status was used as an outcome variable in mixed effects logistic regression analyses. Overall true CSFV seroprevalence was estimated at 17. 5 % (lower CI 16. 0 %; upper CI 19. 5 %). Seroprevalence estimates varied widely across the islands, districts, subdistricts, and villages. Manggarai Barat, a district on the western end of Flores Island, contained pigs that were positive for antibody to CSFV. This result was unexpected, as no clinical cases had been reported in this area. Older pigs and pigs that had been vaccinated for CSFV were more likely to test positive for antibody to CSFV. The final multivariable model accounted for a large amount of variation in the data, however much of this variation was explained by the random effects with less than 2 % of the variation explained by pig age and pig CSFV vaccination status. In this study we documented the seroprevalence of CSFV across four islands in East Nusa Tenggara, eastern Indonesia. We also identified risk factors for the presence of antibody to CSFV. Further investigation is needed to understand why clinical CSFV has not been reported on the western end of Flores Island, and to identify additional risk factors that explain CSFV serological status to inform disease control strategies...|$|R

Results provide a good insight with respect to housing and management systems. Organic farms showed a high diversity of housing and management systems between and within countries and even within a farm.

A new industry sponsored study {{in the form of a}} Joint Industry Project has been undertaken aimed at demonstrating that the presence of internal corrosion in pipelines induces measurable and identifiable vibration in a carrier pig as it passes through the line. The study is based on the conjecture that it is possible to characterize pig vibrations in such a way as to differentiate between pipe that is, for example, corroded, un-corroded or may have wax present.

40|$|The recent {{recognition}} of neurocysticercosis {{as a major}} cause of epilepsy in Uganda and changes in pig demography have lead to a need to better understand the basic epidemiology of Taenia solium infections in pigs and humans. Human exposure {{is a function of the}} size of the animal reservoir of this zoonosis. This is the first field survey for porcine cysticercosis to investigate the prevalence of antigen-positive pigs across an entire rural district of south-east Uganda. In our field surveys, 8. 5 % of 480 pigs screened were seropositive for the parasite by B 158 /B 60 Ag-ELISA. In addition, of the 528 homesteads surveyed 138 (26 %) did not have pit latrines indicating a high probability of pigs having access to human faeces and thus T. solium eggs. This study thus indicates the need for better data on this neglected zoonotic disease in Uganda, with a particular emphasis on the risk factors for infection in both pigs and humans. In this regard, further <b>surveys</b> of <b>pigs,</b> seroprevalence <b>surveys</b> in humans and an understanding of cysticercosis-related epilepsy are required, together with risk-factor studies for human and porcine infections.

40|$|Background Taenia solium {{cysticercosis}} is a parasitic meat-borne {{disease that}} is highly prevalent in pigs and humans in Africa, but the burden is vastly underestimated {{due to the lack}} of official control along the pork commodity chain, which hampers long-term control policies. Methods The apparent and corrected prevalences of T. solium cysticercosis were investigated in pork carcasses slaughtered and retailed in Antananarivo (Madagascar), thanks to a 12 -month monitoring plan in two urban abattoirs. Results Overall apparent prevalence was estimated at 4. 6 % [4. 2 – 5. 0 %]. The corrected overall prevalence defined as the estimated prevalence after accounting for the sensitivity of meat inspection was 21. 03 % [19. 18 - 22. 87 %]. Significant differences among geoclimatic regions were observed only for indigenous pigs, with an apparent prevalence estimated at 7. 9 % [6. 0 – 9. 9 %] in the northern and western regions, 7. 3 % [6. 0 – 8. 6 %] in the central region, and 6. 2 % [4. 7 – 7. 8 %] in the southern region. In the central region, where both exotic and indigenous <b>pigs</b> were <b>surveyed,</b> indigenous <b>pigs</b> were 8. 5 times [6. 7 – 10. 7] more likely to be infected than exotic improved pigs. Urban consumers were more likely to encounter cysticercosis in pork in the rainy season, which is a major at risk period, in particular in December. Differences between abattoirs were also identified. Conclusion Our results underline the need for improved surveillance and control programmes to limit T. solium cysticercosis in carcasses by introducing a risk-based meat inspection procedure that accounts for the origin and breed of the pigs, and the season.

Implementation of farm management and hygiene measures was assessed by using a concept based on critical control points (CCP). Animal health status was estimated by examinations of the carcass at the abattoir, taking nearly 50, 000 pigs into account of which 4132 pigs derived from the assessed organic pig farms. One of the main pathological findings were “milk spots” in the liver and lung diseases. Spot sampling of blood analysed for antibodies versus mycoplasma and salmonella revealed {{that most of the}} animals had contact to the pathogen agents. Carcass quality rated in the EUROP-System was lower in organic compared to conventional farms; mean intramuscular fat content and pH 1 showed no preference for organic pork.

40|$|MRSA is a {{bacteria}} {{that is known}} to cause {{a wide range of}} different infections in humans, some more severe than others. In recent years different strains of the bacteria, mainly the MRSA CC 398, has been found in many pig farming operations across Europe. Most of Sweden’s pork imports come from Denmark and Germany and the estimation of the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms throughout both countries are more than 50 percent. For this study Sweden were chosen {{due to the fact that}} no pigs have been found to carry the infection in this country. The purpose of this study was to find out if legislation and use of antibiotics in each of the countries somehow influence the spreading of the infection, but also to investigate how MRSA transmits between different individuals. The study is split in two parts, namely a literature review and a small survey that were sent to Swedish <b>pig</b> producers. The <b>survey</b> showed that disease protection is important and that 67 percent of the pig producers that answered are worried that MRSA might come to Sweden.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{a devastating}} {{pathogen}} that {{is associated with}} high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Livestock are a well-known reservoir for this pathogen, which poses substantial health risks for livestock workers. Little is known about the epidemiology of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) among livestock workers in Eastern Europe. MethodsTo study the epidemiology of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania, we collected and characterized nasal and oropharygneal samples from swine workers on commercial <b>pig</b> farms. A <b>survey</b> that included questions about work-related tasks, biosafety practices, contact with animals, and health status was used to assess the risk factors that were potentially associated with LA-MRSA colonization. ResultsThe prevalence of MRSA colonization among swine workers was 6. 8 %. Two LA-MRSA strains with the spa types t 034 and t 011 and one likely community-associated MRSA strain with the spa type t 321 were isolated from workers on five farms. Interestingly, all MRSA carriers worked on farms that imported animals from other production facilities. ConclusionThis is the first study to confirm the presence of LA-MRSA among swine workers in Romania and suggests the need to minimize the risk of LA-MRSA-related infections in swine workers and their community contacts. The findings also suggest a link between the commercial movement of swine and the introduction of LA-MRSA...|$|R
40|$|For the {{majority}} of native species, human-created habitats provide a hostile environment that prevents their colonization. However, if the conditions encountered in this novel environment {{are part of the}} fundamental niche of a particular species, these low competitive environments may allow strong population expansion of even rare and stenotopic species. If these species are potentially harmful to humans, such anthropogenic habitat alterations may impose strong risks for human health. Here, we report on a recent and severe outbreak of the viciously biting and day-active mosquito Anopheles plumbeus Stephens, 1828, that is caused by a habitat shift toward human-created habitats. Although historic data indicate that the species was previously reported to be rare in Belgium and confined to natural forest habitats, more recent data indicate a strong population expansion all over Belgium and severe nuisance at a local scale. We show that these outbreaks can be explained by a recent larval habitat shift of this species from tree-holes in forests to large manure collecting pits of abandoned and uncleaned <b>pig</b> stables. Further <b>surveys</b> of the colonization and detection of other potential larval breeding places of this mosquito in this artificial environment are of particular importance for human health because the species is known as a experimental vector of West Nile virus and a potential vector of human malari...|$|R

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 (1). A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the pathogen; several possible {{origins of the coronavirus}} were suggested from wild animal reservoirs, such as Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs (2 – 8).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{smallholder}} farmer awareness in terms of good pig management and to identify serious management issues that should be readily changeable despite resources being limited in a rural setting. Methodology was a combination of questionnaire and observational surveys performed at pig-keeping households practising either confinement or a free-range system. Households were identified using the snowball method. A total of 120 pig-keeping households were included, of which 32 practised free-range systems and 88 confined their <b>pigs.</b> The observational <b>survey</b> included management practices and welfare assessment based on one pig from each of the 120 households. The results indicated that farmers were not aware of the basic requirements of pigs regardless of the production system practised. Water was often neglected and provided less frequently among those practising free-range. Pigs kept free-range also received treatment less frequently compared to those kept confined. Pigs were generally kept in poor conditions with risk of injury and without shelter from wind, rain, cold, heat, and sun. Welfare issues exist within both production systems, but issues within the confinement system could be easily eliminated with proper management. More knowledge on basic pig husbandry is required in the region and is essential for improving production. Educating farmers on the basic requirements for water and feed, alone, could vastly improve smallholder pig production. Education on pig management should therefore be a cornerstone in any research activity involving smallholder farmers in rural areas. [URL] Tropical Disease...|$|R

Pigs aged between 2 and 60 months were assessed by the Enzyme-linked Immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay to determine their serological status against porcine cysticercosis in a cross-sectional study. A total of 1, 153 pigs were sampled. Porcine seroprevalence was 45. 19 % (42. 31 - 48. 06). The information about the animals and households was analyzed and risk factors associated with seroprevalence were determined by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the porcine population, {{the risk of being}} seropositive increased by 7 % with every month of age (OR 1. 07, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 09), and by 148 % for pigs living in East Morropon (OR 2. 48, 95 % CI 1. 82 - 3. 37).

Three forested craters, Pu'u Huluhulu, Kane Nui O Hamo, and Napau Trail Pit Crater located on Kilauea volcano's East Rift Zone, were <b>surveyed</b> for feral <b>pig</b> (Sus scrofa) activity, alien plant species, and endangered, rare, and uncommon native plant species in 1995 - 1997. Plant species lists were prepared and Braun-Blanquet releve method was used to determine cover and abundance of vegetation. Releve plots were established at all three craters (two in Pu'u Huluhulu, two in Napau Trail Pit Crater, and five in Kane Nui O Hamo) to characterize forest type, species diversity, and species density occurring at these craters. These plots were replicated in exterior forests near these craters for qualitative comparison between interior and exterior forests. A total of eighteen plots were established. The craters have very steep interior walls inhibiting feral pig ingression. Using USGS-Biological Resources Division feral <b>pig</b> activity <b>survey</b> protocol it was determined that feral pigs have not been present recently within these forested craters. Sources of disturbance to interior crater forests are localized events such as tree and rock fall. Twenty-one alien plant species were located in the survey areas; nine at Kane Nui O Hamo, six at Napau Trail Pit Crater, and fifteen at Pu'u Huluhulu. The most aggressive alien plant species included firetree (Myrica faya), kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), yellow Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus), and beardgrass (Andropogon virginicus). Alien plant species diversity in the craters is very low, much lower than the surrounding forests. We attribute this finding to the absence of feral pig disturbance, low levels of natural disturbance such as rock and tree fall, and a high diversity and density of native plant species which enhance recovery of disturbed sites. Thirteen rare and uncommon plant species were located in the survey areas. Two of these species, Phyllostegia floribunda, and pawale (Rumex giganteus), had not previously been recorded for the ERZ. Persistence of rare and uncommon native plant species may be attributed to steep interior crater walls and rough and variable terrain of crater floors which act as natural barriers to feral pigs, low intensity of natural disturbance, high diversity and density of other common native plant species, and a unique microclimate and microhabitat.

Similar to other parvoviruses, through the results of phylogenetic and comparative analysis, we presume that the crossover recombination occurred before {{the region of the}} conserved NP 1 gene during the speciation process. The truncation of the 5 terminal region of NP 1 gene also seemed to be associated with recombination. Gene truncation is a phenomenon considered as host adaption that is found not only in pathogenic field strains of virus in in vitro cell culture systems (Pan et al. 2012; Steel et al. 2009) but also in naturally occurring viruses, such as the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Yu et al. 2012). To determine whether this truncation is the result of viral adaptation to the host or is an independent event resulting from close contact between domestic <b>pigs,</b> periodic prevalence <b>survey</b> of PBoV-KU 14 and studies of recombination occurring in PBoVs will be required. Additionally, because PBoVs have high intrinsic substitution rates (Babkin et al. 2013), and the chance that different PBoVs co-exist in one host is high, genetic change of PBoVs should be monitored carefully, and new strains should be subjected to persistent surveillance.|$|R

Through <b>surveyed</b> on reproductivities of 320 sows and on liveweight gains and feed consumed of 3109 hogs sold, it was shown that on an average,a live litter size of a sow was 10. 57 heads with initial weight of 8. 45 kg/litter when born and was 9. 83 heads {{with the weight of}} 110. 8 kg /litter when weaned at 57. 50 days old. Delivery interval was 180 - 205 days. Duration of reproduction of the sows was 5 - 8 years. With TPR,it could save 20 - 30 percent concentrate stuff but time for slaughtering of hogs was extended to 2 - 5 months;it could save 50 - 60 percent concentrate with the sows. By tested on 41 fattening hogs,the experiment groups basically lived on green forages with a diet containing 12. 15 - 18. 05 percent crude fiber (CF) per kg dry matter (DM) gained 495 g/head per day and 1. 79 kg concentrate, 1. 41 kg roughage and 11. 95 kg green forages should be consumed to gain one kg liveweight,which had 10. 84 Mcal digestable energy (DE) and 480 g crude protein (CP).

40|$|Near-infrared {{spectrometry}} : a rapid analytical {{tool for}} n- 3 {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} measurement on backfat of <b>pig</b> carcass A <b>survey</b> carried out by IFIP among slaughterhouses that are or are not engaged in strategies for improvingthe lipid profile of pork demonstrates {{the need for a}} tool for rapid and early determination of the fatty acid profile of a carcass. This work aims to develop models to predict the fatty acid composition, including n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 PUFA) from a near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurement directly on the slaughter line. The infrared measurements were performed on 282 pigs, 50 % coming from the Bleu-Blanc-Coeur label (that guarantees higher levels of n- 3 PUFA). They were performed on the slaughter line on hot carcass and on the backfat, using a near infrared spectrometer (LabSpec 5000, ASD). The samples were collected and their fatty acid compositions were obtained using gas chromatography. The regression method employed was partial least squares (PLS). The results show that the spectral range 800 - 1830 nm provides the best predictions. The models developed for C 18 : 3 n- 3, n- 3 PUFA and total PUFA gave the best results (R²= 0. 87, 0. 86 and 0. 86, respectively) with an associated uncertainty of 1. 2, 1. 5 and 2. 8 points and average values of 2. 4; 3. 2; and 16. 2, respectively. For all other fatty acids, the determination coefficients (R²) were lower than 0. 75. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use NIRS to determine on the slaughter line the n- 3 PUFA content of pigs and enable them to be sorted according to quality criteria of fat...|$|R

Taenia solium is a cestode parasite that causes cysticercosis in both humans and <b>pigs.</b> A serological <b>survey</b> was undertaken to assess the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with porcine cysticercosis in the rural district of Morropon, Peru. Pigs aged between 2 and 60 months were assessed by the Enzyme-linked Immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay to determine their serological status against porcine cysticercosis in a cross-sectional study. A total of 1, 153 pigs were sampled. Porcine seroprevalence was 45. 19 % (42. 31 – 48. 06). The information about the animals and households was analyzed and risk factors associated with seroprevalence were determined by a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the porcine population, {{the risk of being}} seropositive increased by 7 % with every month of age (OR 1. 07, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 09), and by 148 % for pigs living in East Morropon (OR 2. 48, 95 % CI 1. 82 – 3. 37). Whereas, the presence of latrines in a household decreased the risk of being seropositive by 49 % (OR 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 39 – 0. 67).

40|$|Taenia solium {{cysticercosis}} {{was reported}} in official veterinary and medical statistics to be highly prevalent in pigs and humans in Madagascar, but few estimates are available for pigs. This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of porcine cysticercosis among pigs slaughtered in Antananarivo abattoirs. Firstly, the diagnostic performance of two antigen-ELISA techniques (B 158 B 60 Ag-ELISA and HP 10 Ag-ELISA) and an immunoblotting method were compared with meat inspection procedures on a sample of pigs suspected to be infected with (group 1; n = 250) or free of (group 2; n = 250) T. solium based on direct veterinary inspection in Madagascar. Sensitivity and specificity of the antigen ELISAs were then estimated using a Bayesian approach for detection of porcine cysticercosis {{in the absence of}} a gold standard. Then, a third set of pig sera (group 3, n = 250) was randomly collected in Antananarivo slaughterhouses and tested to estimate the overall prevalence of T. solium contamination in pork meat traded in Antananarivo. The antigen ELISAs showed a high sensitivity (> 84 %), but the B 158 B 60 Ag-ELISA appeared to be more specific than the HP 10 Ag-ELISA (model 1 : 95 % vs 74 %; model 2 : 87 % vs 71 %). The overall prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in Antananarivo slaughterhouses was estimated at 2. 3 % (95 % credibility interval [95 %CrI]: 0. 09 – 9. 1 %) to 2. 6 % (95 %CrI: 0. 1 – 10. 3 %) depending on the model and priors used. Since the sample used in this study is not representative of the national <b>pig</b> population, village-based <b>surveys</b> and longitudinal monitoring at slaughter are needed to better estimate the overall prevalence, geographical patterns and main risk factors for T. solium contamination, in order to improve control policies.

40|$|The study {{hypothesis}} was that pre-slaughter handling is not conducted {{in such a}} way that pigs can be considered humanely slaughtered, nor is it conducive to promoting those properties of fresh meat that could enhance pork quality. The 1 st phase of the investigation was aimed at confirming the present compliance level within the prescribed norms. To this end the importance of stunning induction requirements for effective electrical stunning, the welfare implications relating to the pre-slaughter handling of pigs and the stunning and sticking techniques were investigated. Pre-slaughter welfare of the pigs at the abattoir was found to be influenced at the outset by the origin and type of pig slaughtered, the daily throughput range of pigs and the type of abattoir involved. A disappointing pre-arrival aspect was that deficiencies in road motor vehicles were observed while off-loading pigs. Through poor design or lack of maintenance, another factor that hampered free movement of pigs was the off-loading facilities. The nature of animal behaviour in the pens, in the passages and when going into the stunning area was directly related to the pig handling efficiency and to the nature and extent of design and maintenance problems with equipment. None of the abattoirs had a well designed in-feed to a well planned stunning area / facility, and a very high level of pig pre-slaughter stress prevailed. The optimum position of the electrodes is virtually impossible to attain under practical conditions and the practice of repeat application of electrical stunning is common. Of the total sample size (n = 1175), 34 % were difficult to shackle, 90 % of these being from the abattoirs tending to slaughter more routinely a wide range of different sized <b>pigs.</b> In this <b>survey</b> 149 <b>pigs</b> (13 %) required more than a single sticking attempt to bleed out properly, considerably higher than in other published reports...|$|R
40|$|Background: Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) is a mosquito-borne {{infectious disease}} caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). About 1 – 10 cases with severe {{central nervous system}} symptoms have been constantly reported every year in Japan. To clarify the mechanism of maintenance of JEV, the present study <b>surveyed</b> <b>pigs</b> for serological evidence of JEV infection and isolated JEV strains from pigs and mosquitoes in Isahaya City (Isahaya) and Goto City (Goto) in the islets of Goto in Nagasaki Prefecture from 2008 to 2014. Results: The serological <b>survey</b> of <b>pigs</b> showed the increase of IgM sero-positivity against JEV in July or August, and it was maintained until October or November in both Isahaya and Goto every year. There were 47 JEV strains isolated in Nagasaki from 2001 to 2014 including the isolates in this study, and they belonged to genotype 1. Thirty four of the isolated strains were from pigs in Isahaya and were classified under six subclusters (1 -A- 1, 1 -A- 2, 1 -A- 3, 1 -A- 4, 1 -A- 5, and 1 -A- 9). Thirteen strains were isolated from pigs and mosquitoes in Goto and were classified into three subclusters (1 -A- 5 (2008); 1 -A- 1 (2009); and 1 -A- 2). In the subcluster 1 -A- 2, three different monophyletic subgroups, 1 -A- 2 - 2 (2010), 1 -A- 2 - 3 (2011), and 1 -A- 2 - 1 (2013, 2014), appeared in Goto. Conclusions: These data strongly suggested that JEV appearance in Goto seems {{to depend on the}} frequent introduction of JEV from outside of the island and this pattern is different from what has been observed in subtropical islands in the East China Sea such as Okinawa and Taiwan, where the same populations of JEV (1 -A- 7 (1998 – 2008) in Okinawa; genotype 3 (until 2012) in Taiwan) have been maintained for a long period. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 843 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 3 月 9 日Author: Akira Yoshikawa, Takeshi Nabeshima, Shingo Inoue, Masanobu Agoh, Kouichi MoritaCitation: Tropical Medicine and Health, 44, 8; 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of airborne endotoxins and microorganisms in livestock buildings (cattle, <b>pig,</b> poultry) was <b>surveyed</b> in four European countries (England, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany). Measurements were {{made during the}} day and night. The endotoxin concentrations were determined from dust samples separated into inhalable and respirable fractions. Airborne microorganisms were classified as total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and total fungi. The lowest endotoxin concentrations were found in cattle houses. The highest concentrations of endotoxin were measured in poultry houses, especially percheries, with an overall mean of 692 and 49 ng/m 3 for inhalable and respirable fractions, respectively. Endotoxin concentration was usually higher in the day than at night. These concentrations give cause for concern for the health of stockmen working in such buildings. The corresponding mean emission rates from poultry houses were 678 and 43 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively, 51 and 6 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from pig buildings and 9 and 1 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from cattle houses. A new automated bioaerosol sampler was developed, which allows remote, independent sampling of airborne microorganisms. Its principle of operation is similar to a slit sampler: airborne microbes are collected by impaction on an agar surface. Most measurements of airborne microorganisms were made in Germany. The indoor {{concentration of}} total bacteria was 6. 43 log colony-forming units (cfu) /m 3 in broiler houses, 5. 1 log cfu/m 3 in pig buildings and 4. 3 log cfu/m 3 in cattle buildings. During the day, the overall concentration of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 3 and 4 log cfu/m 3. The mean fungi concentration for cattle was 3. 8, for pigs 3. 7 and for poultry 4. 0 log cfu/m 3 during the day. Slightly lower concentrations were measured at night. No significant correlation was found between the concentrations of endotoxin and Enterobacteriaceae. The highest emission rate of total bacteria and fungi was measured for broilers, i. e. 9. 5 and 7. 7 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively. Buildings for laying hens had the highest mean emission rate of 7. 1 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight for Enter obacteriaceae...|$|R
40|$|The epithelia of {{a number}} of glands and cavitary organs of the rat and guinea <b>pig</b> have been <b>surveyed,</b> and in all cases investigated, a {{characteristic}} tripartite junctional complex has been found between adjacent cells. Although the complex differs in precise arrangement from one organ to another, it has been regularly encountered in the mucosal epithelia of the stomach, intestine, gall bladder, uterus, and oviduct; in the glandular epithelia of the liver, pancreas, parotid, stomach, and thyroid; in the epithelia of pancreatic, hepatic, and salivary ducts; and finally, between the epithelial cells of the nephron (proximal and distal convolution, collecting ducts). The elements of the complex, identified as zonula occludens (tight junction), zonula adhaerens (intermediary junction), and macula adhaerens (desmosome), occupy a juxtaluminal position and succeed each other in the order given in an apical-basal direction. The zonula occludens (tight junction) is characterized by fusion of the adjacent cell membranes resulting in obliteration of the intercellular space over variable distances. Within the obliterated zone, the dense outer leaflets of the adjoining cell membranes converge to form a single intermediate line. A diffuse band of dense cytoplasmic material is often associated with this junction, but its development varies from one epithelium to another. The zonula adhaerens (intermediate junction) is characterized by the presence of an intercellular space (∼ 200 A) occupied by homogeneous, apparently amorphous material of low density; by strict parallelism of the adjoining cell membranes over distances of 0. 2 to 0. 5 µ; and by conspicuous bands of dense material located in the subjacent cytoplasmic matrix. The desmosome or macula adhaerens is also characterized by the presence of an intercellular space (∼ 240 A) which, in this case, contains a central disc of dense material; by discrete cytoplasmic plaques disposed parallel to the inner leaflet of each cell membrane; and by the presence of bundles of cytoplasmic fibrils converging on the plaques. The zonula occludens appears to form a continuous belt-like attachment, whereas the desmosome is a discontinuous, button-like structure. The zomula adhaerens is continuous in most epithelia but discontinuous in some. Observations made during experimental hemoglobinuria in rats showed that the hemoglobin, which undergoes enough concentration in the nephron lumina to act as an electron-opaque mass tracer, does not penetrate the intercellular spaces beyond the zonula occludens. Similar observations were made in pancreatic acini and ducts where discharged zymogen served as a mass tracer. Hence the tight junction is impervious to concentrated protein solutions and appears to function as a diffusion barrier or "seal. " The desmosome and probably also the zonula adhaerens may represent intercellular attachment devices...|$|R

At the time of European settlement the quokka was widespread and abundant and its distribution encompassed an area of approximatelyThe former and current {{distribution of the}} quokka, Setortix brachyurus, was mapped from published and all available unpublished records. At the time of European settlement the quokka was widespread and abundant and its distribution encompassed an area of approximately 41 200 km 2 of south-west Western Australia inclusive of two offshore islands, Bald Island and Rottnest Island. Historical reports indicated an extensive population decline occurred in the 1930 s. The decline continued, with a previously undocumented decline apparent in the period from 1980 to 1992. However, this decline may be an artefact of the time scales used for mapping and may well equate with a previously reported decline lor a suite of south -west mammals in the 1970 s. By 1992 the quokka´s distribution {{had been reduced to}} an area of approximately 17800 km 2. An increased awareness of the presence of the quokka on the mainland has resulted in numerous reportings of quokka presence since 1992, has confimled the existence of several populations at the northern extent of the quokka´´s known geographic range and indicated the cmrent, 2005, distribution to be similar to that in 1992. However, survey and population estimates at six of these mainland locations from the northem jarrah forest indicated low abundance. There have been no population estimates elsewhere on the mainland. Two populations have been reported tiom the Swan Coastal Plain, but neither has been confirmed extant. Predation by the introduced fox, Vulpes vulpes, is implicated as a major cause of the quokka´s initial decline, while ongoing predation, habitat destruction and modification through altered tire regimes have contributed to the continued decline. Specific conservation management actions are recommended, namely: (i) Implementing an active adaptive management program in the northern jarrah forest to determine quokka population response to habitat manipulation through the use of fIre, fox baiting and <b>pig</b> control; (ii) <b>Surveying</b> the Stirling fumge and Green Range populations with emphasis placed on determining population size and population genetic structure; (iii) Surveying the reported occurrences from the Swan Coastal Plain, with emphasis on unambiguously determining presence. If confirmed, priority should he directed to assessing population size and determining the management requirements to ensure persistence of the population; (iv) Surveying southem forest and south coast populations to assess quokka population size, the extent of movement between sllbpopulations and assessment of the range of habitat types used by quokkas. The latter should be combined with spatial analyses of known extant populations and suitable and potentially suitable habitat; (v) Determining the role of tire in establishing and maintaining preferred habitat of southern forest and south coast populations; and (vi) Establishing a program to assess the potential effects from management operations...|$|R
