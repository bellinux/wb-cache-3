30|$|In this paper, I started {{discussing}} {{the relationship between}} CSR, sustainability and the new emerging concept of purpose, and concluded that purpose revolution is the uninterrupted wave of CSR and sustainability revolution and continuous debate over the shareholder and stakeholder theories. The terms of purpose, CSR, sustainability, stakeholders, and the like are the common sentiments expressed in many business circles. Whether you are academic scholars or business practitioners, {{when you talk about}} purpose, you cannot ignore its relationship with CSR and sustainability. Because CSR and sustainability are the most important ingredients of purpose. Purpose without CSR and sustainability is in a vacuum. Purpose needs CSR and sustainability. CSR and sustainability have gone through a lot of change over the past years. Approaches such as shared value, caring economy, the circular economy, conscious capitalism and <b>purpose</b> <b>economy</b> have all evolved and new initiatives and frameworks such as GRI, ISO, and UN-SDGs have been developed. The tools and resources are there to make sure that purpose is backed up with the rigour that ensures CSR and sustainability is done well. CSR and sustainability also need purpose. Despite the growth in organisations tackling CSR and sustainability, they still suffer from poor perceptions around “green” and we do not make it easy for ourselves with all the jargon. Purpose provides an opportunity to focus on the long term through an engaging and emotional lens.|$|E

50|$|The {{definitions}} {{for cars}} and trucks {{are not the same}} for fuel economy and emission standards. For example, a Chrysler PT Cruiser is defined as a car for emissions purposes and a truck for fuel <b>economy</b> <b>purposes.</b> Under the current light truck fuel economy rules, the PT Cruiser will have a higher fuel economy target (28.05 mpg beginning in 2011) than it would if it were classified as a passenger car. CAFE standards signaled the end of the traditional long station wagon, but Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca developed the idea of marketing the minivan as a station wagon alternative, while certifying it in the separate truck category to allow compliance with less-strict emissions standards. Eventually, this same idea led to the promotion of the SUV. This trend has reversed itself since the crossover has eroded SUV sales - during the mid-2000s, SUVs must conform with emission standards and a crossover is defined as a car for fuel <b>economy</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|R

Connections are shown to familiar econometric models of linear regression and simultaneous equations. I also investigate the auxiliary procedures used in this literature, including differencing as a treatment for unit roots and the calibration of results using other data. The three applications demonstrate how the method is subjective and pliable in practice.
