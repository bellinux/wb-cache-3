50|$|Planar concave {{microtome}} knives {{are extremely}} sharp, {{but are also}} very delicate and are therefore only used with very soft samples. The wedge <b>profile</b> <b>knives</b> are somewhat more stable and find use in moderately hard materials, such as in epoxy or cryogenic sample cutting. Finally, the chisel profile with its blunt edge, raises {{the stability of the}} knife, whilst requiring significantly more force to achieve the cut.|$|R
50|$|Generally, knives are {{characterized}} by the <b>profile</b> of the <b>knife</b> blade, which falls under the categories of planar concave, wedge shaped or chisel shaped designs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} manufacturing aspects of these tools. Constructive and geometric peculiarities are exposed for the gear hobbing cutter with large modules. The design of the gear hobbing cutter with modified profile in the parametrized variant permits a rapid adaptation to any conditions. Depending on the particular constructive geometric of the gear hobbing cutter profile it was created the virtual prototype (solid model). This is analyzed and, in the final stage, it is manufactured. Manufacturing techniques of the tool include the obtaining of the <b>profiled</b> <b>knifes</b> for clearance (achieved by increased 50 : 1 templates on the machine for profiled tools) and the special control templates (obtained on templates milling machine F. Studer). This paper {{presents the}} method of obtaining of the gear hobbing cutter profile by adjusting the corresponding shape of the abrasive disc to optimize the grinding conditions. It is recommended the method which uses {{the changing of the}} rack reference imposed by technical and functional conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{histological}} and cytological {{examination of}} normal and pathological specimens of adult bone has presented problems mainly {{related to the}} high mineral content and consequent hardness ofthe tissue in which the living cells are embedded. Prolonged fixation and subsequent decalcification seemed to be essential but were inevitably associated with formation of artefacts and distortion ofthe cells, and they precluded the use ofmost ofthe more delicate histochemical techniques. One advance was to cut frozen sections in a cryostat using the Jung K microtonie fitted with a <b>profile</b> K <b>knife</b> (Pearse and Gardner 1972). Another approach was to study embryonic or fetal bone before extensive niineralisation had occurred. Admirable as {{the results of these}} two lines of research have been, they may have given a slightly distorted picture of the structure and metabolism of mature bone. Recently a technique has been described for slicing live bone without killing the cells. Living cells were isolated from these slices, examined microscopically and cultured (Bard, Dickens, Smith and Zarek 1972). This technique has been used to study osteoarthritic h uma n femoral heads removed at operation (Bard, Dickens, Edwards and Smith 1972). It might be applicable to various problems in the study of normal and pathological hone. It therefore seemed worth while to report our method and findings in greater detail than has hitherto been possible...|$|R
40|$|The wear {{characteristics}} as regards cross-cutting of packaging materials in packaging machines were examined during three edge life tests using commercial packaging films. The cross-cutting system of a candy wrapping machine was used. In these tests relief face wear of knife-edges was determined {{which was at}} its lowest in the web cutting area of the knives. The knives did not turn blunt within the areas of relief face wear but within the transient areas between heacy and low wear. There the <b>knife</b> <b>profile</b> was adversely affected {{to such an extent}} that bridges developed at the web's cut edges. As a result the cuttings sticked together. The edge life of the knives depends on the sectility of the webs in this area but not on the quantity of the relief face wear. Further tests will be necessary to determine the impact of the cutting geometry and the cutting pressure on the formation of the transient areas at the knife-edges...|$|R
5000|$|Caidao or {{so-called}} 'Chinese cleaver' {{is not a}} cleaver, {{and most}} manufacturers warn {{that it should not}} be used as a cleaver. It is more properly referred to as a Chinese chef's knife and is actually a general-purpose knife, analogous to the French chef's knife or the Japanese santoku. The confusion arises from the fact that Chinese chef's knives are rectangular and that some (particularly older, traditional knives made of carbon steel) have somewhat heavy blades. Also, the fact that the blade is heavier toward the tip encourages skilled Chinese chefs to use a swinging or [...] "tapping" [...] stroke as well as a [...] "pushing" [...] stroke. However, the edge has the gradual bevel of a chef's knife and will most probably be damaged if used for splitting bone. Actual cleavers in China have the same <b>profile</b> as chef's <b>knives</b> but have much thicker blades with a sharp bevel and heavier handles.|$|R
50|$|Sharpening and Finishing: It is preferably left to sit {{while the}} knife age hardens {{so that when}} the knife is made straight, few if any distortions appear as the knife ages further. If is made under the Sakai, Osaka {{production}} system, the knife is sent to a sharpener who corrects for distortion and sharpnens simultaneously to make the final geometry and <b>profile</b> of the <b>knife,</b> and then finished by polishing, engraving, and installation of handle by other craftsmen. It may be mirror polished or finished with natural stones to highlight the hamon, resist rusting, and improve balance and some honyaki display alloy banding upon polish. The handle is installed and a saya is usually made. Ebony fittings denote ornamental display as the wood is hard enough to scratch the blade in the saya and the ebony can crack under changes in humidity, and the extra weight may make holding the knife more tiring but can help balance with longer blades. If used for work, it represents the status of the cost and knowledge of proper care and use. The extra labor in manufacture, sharpening, and finishing, time lost to failed blades, and skill in temperature control and forging contributes to the higher price compared to usual laminated blades.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or {{automatic}} opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade <b>profile,</b> enabled the <b>knife</b> {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of DNA {{in a criminal}} investigation often requires scrutiny in relation to how {{it came to be}} where it was found. There is a paucity of data with respect {{to the extent to which}} one can assume that the last person handling an object, which has previously been touched by others, will contribute to the DNA profile generated from it. There are limited data in detailing the extent to which any foreign DNA is picked-up from a previously touched object and transferred to subsequently touched objects. This study focuses on DNA transfer and persistence on a knife handle after multiple handlings with the knife by different individuals soon after each other, as well as handprints left on flat DNA-free surfaces immediately after touching a knife handle with a known history of prior handling. The profiles of later handlers of a knife are more prominent than earlier handlers; however, the last handler is not always the major contributor to the profile. Proportional contributions to the <b>profiles</b> retrieved from <b>knife</b> handles vary depending on the individuals touching the knife handle. They can also vary when knife handles have been handled in the same manner by the same individuals in the same sequence on different occasions. Hands readily pickup DNA left on objects by others and transfer it to subsequently touched objects. The quantity of foreign DNA picked up by a hand and deposited on subsequently touched objects diminishes as more DNA-free objects are handled soon after each other. Caution is advised when considering how DNA from different individuals may have been transferred to the object from which it was collected...|$|R
