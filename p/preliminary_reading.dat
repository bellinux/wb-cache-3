60|$|We would impress {{upon the}} {{student at the}} outset the {{importance}} of some <b>preliminary</b> <b>reading</b> before dissection is undertaken. No one would dream of attempting to explore a deserted city without some previous study of maps and guide-books, but we find again and again students undertaking to explore the complicated anatomy of a vertebrated animal without the slightest, or only the slightest, preparatory reading. This is entirely a mistake. A student should {{be familiar with the}} nomenclature of the structures he contemplates examining, he should have some idea of their mutual relations and functions, or his attention will inevitably be diverted by the difficulty of new names and physiological questionings to the neglect of his dissection, and that careful observation of form and mutual position which is the essential object of dissection. On the other hand, it is equally necessary-- perhaps more so-- to warn students against the bookish fallacy, and to assure them of the absolute impossibility of realizing biological facts from reading alone. Practical work can alone confirm and complete the knowledge to which the text-book is the guide. In scientific teaching it may sometimes be convenient for the thought to precede the thing, but until the thing has been dealt with the knowledge gained is an unsatisfactory and unstable possession.|$|E

50|$|In {{his overall}} approach, Hyperius sought a firm {{basis in the}} Bible, rigidly, and held that before {{practical}} theology can be put in force, it must be made a part of systematic theological study, and must not be taught fragmentarily.

All must be squared with the Bible, or, where the Bible did not contain specific data, with the commandments of love for God and one's neighbor.|$|E

His primary education was obtained in the district schools and was continued in the High School at Dresden and Zanesville, Ohio, being graduated from the latter institution with the class of June 1875. His more specifically literary education was acquired in Kenyon College, at Gambier, Ohio, which he entered {{in the fall of}} 1875, completing the course there by graduation with the class of 1879.

For each exercise the authors provide detailed solutions as well as references for <b>preliminary</b> and further <b>reading.</b> There are also many insightful notes to motivate the student and set the exercises in context. Students will find these exercises extremely useful for easing the transition between simple and complex probabilistic frameworks. Indeed, many of the exercises here will lead the student on to frontier research topics in probability. Along the way, attention is drawn to a number of traps into which students of probability often fall.

2500|$|According to the {{archivist}} at the Great Synagogue in Rome, {{the custom}} {{of a young woman}} being called up in synagogue before the entire community dates back to {{the early years of the}} Roman Jewish community approximately 2,300 years ago. The community recognized her as [...] "being of age" [...] and acknowledged her in a public fashion. This would support more modern documents that record an Orthodox Jewish Italian rite for becoming bat mitzvah (which involved an [...] "entrance into the minyan" [...] ceremony, in which boys of thirteen and girls of twelve recited a blessing) since the mid-19th century. There were also bat mitzvah rituals held in the 19th century in Iraq. All this may have influenced the American rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, who held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in the United States, for his daughter Judith, on March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City. Judith Kaplan recited the <b>preliminary</b> blessing, <b>read</b> a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing. Kaplan, who at that time claimed to be an Orthodox rabbi, joined Conservative Judaism and then became the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, influenced Jews from all branches of non-Orthodox Judaism, through his position at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. At the time, most Orthodox rabbis strongly rejected the idea of a bat mitzvah ceremony.|$|R
40|$|Marañón’s work, as a whole, {{is truly}} complex. After a <b>preliminary,</b> partial <b>reading,</b> the {{questions}} that arise are numerous and varied. The aim {{of this article is}} to analyse some of the wealth of the medical facets of these works by following some of the threads which are repeated in the literature on the author. His medical works, within the context of western medicine of the time, are still analysed from a perspective of a series of clichés. Actually from our point of view, his work is the result of a peculiar construction, based on both medical practice and personal theoretical principles which led to a model of medicine similar to that of the great reformers within the framework which Laín Entralgo has termed “present medicine”. La obra de Marañón, en su conjunto, es verdaderamente compleja. Después de una primera lectura parcial la cantidad de interrogantes que plantea son muchos y variados, pero siguiendo unos pocos hilos conductores, que se repiten, podemos analizar su riqueza. Este es el objetivo del presente trabajo limitándonos a su faceta de médico. Su obra médica, en el conjunto de la medicina occidental del momento, sigue valorándose partiendo de una serie de tópicos. A nuestro parecer, es el resultado de una elaboración peculiar desde la clínica, y partiendo de unos supuestos personales; dando lugar a un modelo de medicina coincidente, en gran medida, con el de los grandes reformistas de lo que Laín Entralgo ha llamado “medicina actual”...|$|R
