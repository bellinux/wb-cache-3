To investigate the clinical relevance of this mechanism, we used a computerized Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task and compared performance of 19 severely obese individuals to that of 19 healthy-weight controls matched for age, education and gender. During the response-priming test we exposed participants to both food pictures and to Pavlovian cues predictive of those food pictures, and examined their biasing effect on instrumental choice. As expected, obese participants showed higher <b>priming</b> <b>rates</b> for palatable, high-calorie foods (potato chips and chocolate) relative to low-calorie foods (lettuce and courgette) whereas healthy-weight individuals did not show a difference between <b>priming</b> <b>rates</b> for these two food types.

We did not find any evidence of increased impulsivity or reliance on a habitual strategy during the slips-of-action task, in obese participants.

50|$|Many {{credit card}} issuers give {{a rate that}} is based upon an {{economic}} indicator published by a respected journal. For example, most banks in the U.S. offer credit cards based upon the lowest U.S. <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> as published in the Wall Street Journal on the previous business day {{to the start of}} the calendar month. For example, a rate given as 9.99% plus the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> will be 16.99% when the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> is 7.00% (such as the end of 2005). These rates usually also have contractual minimums and maximums to protect the consumer (or the bank, as it may be) from wild fluctuations of the <b>prime</b> <b>rate.</b> While these accounts are harder to budget for, they can theoretically be a little less expensive since the bank does not have to accept the risk of fluctuation of the market (since the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> follows inflation rates, which affect the profitability of loans). A fixed rate can be better for consumers who have fixed incomes or need control over their payments budgets. These rates can be varied upon depending upon the policies of different organisations.|$|E
