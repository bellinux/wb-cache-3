25|$|The {{collapse}} of the dam prompted the creation of over a dozen separate investigations into the cause of failure. With unprecedented speed, eight of these had begun by the weekend following the collapse. Almost all of these involved investigative panels of prominent engineers and geologists. The more notable of these groups and committees were those sponsored by California governor C. C. Young, headed by A. J. Wiley, the renowned dam engineer and consultant to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Boulder (Hoover) Dam Board; the Los Angeles City Council, which was chaired by the Chief of the Reclamation Service, Elwood Mead; the Los Angeles County coroner, Frank Nance and Los Angeles County District Attorney Asa Keyes. Others were convened: the Water and Power Commissioners started their own inquiry, as did the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors who hired J. B. Lippincott.

500|$|Jeffrey Brent, the <b>past</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Academy of Clinical Toxicology, {{was invited}} to testify about the {{potential}} role of thimerosal-containing vaccines in triggering Michelle's autism. He stated that [...] "there {{was not a single}} study indicating that any form of mercury could cause serious neurological symptoms in the dosages that were used in vaccines" [...] and criticized Aposhian's use of in vitro studies and his equating them to what happens in the actual animal, arguing that [...] "the exposure to a cell in a petri dish was far more likely to cause damage than an equivalent dosage in a living system." [...] With regard to specific in vitro studies, Brent argued that the Goth study was flawed because it tested thimerosal on mouse cells, not human cells; because these cells were exposed not to ethylmercury, as the human body would be after receiving a thimerosal-containing vaccine since thimerosal is quickly metabolized to ethylmercury, but to thimerosal itself, and because the cells were exposed to far higher concentrations of thimerosal than could ever occur {{as a result of the}} administration of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Brent highlighted similar problems with the Agrawal study, noting that the cells in that study, like those in the Goth study, were exposed to thimerosal, not ethylmercury, and to much higher doses than found in vaccines. He also examined the Bradstreet and Geier study and the Holmes study, noting that [...] "much better studies from other investigators could not replicate the results of either the Holmes study or the Bradstreet/Geier study," [...] citing two other peer-reviewed papers which had concluded that hair mercury levels were not significantly different between study participants with autism and controls, as well as a study which had concluded that children with autism had no chelatable heavy-metal body burden whatsoever. Brent also pointed out that, like another of Bradstreet's studies, the Bradstreet-Geier study had been published in a non-indexed journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which he described as [...] "very much of a fringe journal with lots of alternative agendas, and it's not even indexed by the National Library of Medicine." [...] Brent concluded by testifying that thimerosal could not have degraded Michelle's immune system to the extent that when she was vaccinated with MMR nine months later, it caused brain damage, saying [...] "That couldn't possibly be the case." [...] In the second set of the proceedings, which pertained to thimerosal alone (as opposed to thimerosal working in conjunction with MMR), Brent testified, with regard to Jordan King and one other child with autism who also served as a test case in this trial, that there was [...] "absolutely no reason to chelate them for any mercury-related reason." ...|$|E
