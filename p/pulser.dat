40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we examine}} the {{characteristics}} of electric field <b>pulse</b> trains that are attributed to preliminary breakdown in negative cloud-to-ground lightning discharges and compare them to those of similar <b>pulse</b> trains associated with attempted cloud-to-ground leaders. The data were acquired in 2006 in Gainesville, Florida. The largest <b>pulses</b> in the train can exceed in magnitude the following first return-stroke <b>pulse.</b> The arithmetic mean <b>pulse</b> duration and interpulse interval for <b>pulse</b> trains in negative cloud-to-ground discharges are 4. 8 and 65 µs, respectively. The arithmetic mean <b>pulse</b> duration and interpulse interval for <b>pulse</b> trains in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders are 17 and 73 µs, respectively. This implies that <b>pulse</b> trains in ground discharges contain a larger fraction of “narrow” <b>pulses</b> (apparently disregarded in previous studies), defined here as those with durations equal to or less than 4 µs, than the <b>pulse</b> trains in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders.
