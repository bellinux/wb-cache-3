5|$|A 2003 study {{claimed the}} Stanley's {{renovation}} brought positive economic effects to the theatre's local area, bounded by 8th Street and 17th between Fir and Hemlock. According to the study, this area became {{more of a}} leisure/recreation destination, with many new culturally related businesses, retail stores and service-related businesses opening. An increase in overall sales was noted and 76% of surveyed residents responded that the theatre's reopening had a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the community. Business respondents also reportedly had a positive view of the theatre's effects.|$|E
5|$|Curcumin as of 2010 has {{not shown}} benefit in people {{even though there}} is {{tentative}} evidence in animals. There is inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on cognitive impairment and dementia. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research looks promising.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{innovation}} backward linkages, transportation equipment has <b>positive</b> <b>effects.</b> This is reasonable, {{because this}} sector requires {{a variety of}} technology components to complete its products. Hence, its innovation backward linkages result in <b>positive</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

30|$|Like other {{recipients}} of social assistance in Denmark, immigrants are offered active labour market programmes {{administered by the}} job centres. Because a large fraction of non-western immigrants are social assistance recipients, {{it is very important}} to assess whether these programmes have <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on immigrants’ employment prospects. If some programmes show <b>positive</b> <b>effects,</b> further targeting of such programmes to immigrants may have large <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on labour market integration and, indirectly, on social integration in general.|$|R
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that while the subsidy reform plan needs further adaptation and fine-tuning, citizens must separate the questions of public policy from the issues of government legitimacy. The IMF has hailed Iran's economic reform and asked Iran's expertise {{to be transferred to}} other countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit has also praised Iran's subsidies reform plan for its <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the economy in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{flavonoids}} {{found in}} the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on arterial health. A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the {{physical and mental health}} of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{to find out}} the effect of investment opportunity set and free cash flow towards dividend policy and its impacts on firm value of manufacturing companies registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange during the period of 2011 - 2013. The samples of this study are 25 manufacturing companies and they were selected by using purposive sampling method. The data is collected through non participants’ observation. Path analysis which is an extension of the multiple linear regression technique is used to analyze data. Based on the data analysis, it was found that, investment opportunity set has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on dividend policy. It refuses the negative hypothesis, free cash flow has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on dividend policy, investment opportunity set has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on firm value, free cash flow has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on firm value, dividend policy has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on firm value, investment opportunity set has effects on firm value  through dividend  policy  and free  cash flow has no  effects on firm value  through  dividend   policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} older sisters’ and brothers’ {{literacy}} on the annual school entry and primary school grade progress probabilities {{of boys and}} girls are estimated using within-household variation. Older siblings’ literacy has <b>positive</b> <b>effects,</b> especially for same-sex siblings. The literacy of older sisters appears to be more beneficial than that of older brothers, not least since it has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on school entry among both boys and girls, and since it has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> also when the sister has left the household. There are <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> both from literate older siblings who left school and from literate older siblings who are still in school. This suggests that within-household education spillovers, rather than time-varying credit constraints, explain the positive sibling-dependency, since with credit constraints children in school would compete over scarce resources. The <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on school progress are limited to same-sex siblings who are still present in the household, suggesting every-day interactions to be important.

5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{started the}} season with {{consecutive}} wins, rising {{to the top of}} the table by early October. After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses that caused the team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to slip in January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there has}} been {{relatively}} little research {{on the effectiveness of}} online support groups in mental health, {{there is some evidence that}} online support groups can be beneficial.

30|$|These {{theoretical}} considerations imply <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> {{of participation}} in a short-term training program on the probability of taking up employment. However, for the theoretically derived <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> to hold in reality {{there have to be}} potential employers willing to engage the participants in the programs. Despite the increased search effort or the higher productivity obtained in practical training, participants may still possess a productivity too low to be remunerated by the market. In that case, there will be no <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of participation.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we hypothesize similar <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of {{diversity}} climate on these variables. Furthermore, existing studies have established that trust in workgroup communication has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on both job satisfaction (De Vries et al. 2006) and inclusion of team members (Smidts et al. 2001). Similar results have been found for openness (Shore et al. 2011). As such, the second aim of study 1 is to test whether the <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> of diversity climate on these outcome variables is mediated by trust and openness.|$|R
5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on local businesses and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on them.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E

But this ignores the possibility that new owners will expand the firm's scale, with potentially <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on employment, wages, and productivity. Evidence generally shows these forces to be offsetting, usually resulting in small employment and earnings effects and sometimes in large, <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> on productivity and scale.

Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E
