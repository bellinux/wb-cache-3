40|$|Epuration in France : an uncompleted story, Henry Rousso. In {{spite of}} the many works devoted to the postwar " purge ", the subject deserves a new reading : the sources {{previously}} used to draw up the record, especially for the legal épuration, seem to have underestimated its scope. This provides <b>an</b> <b>apportunity</b> to reconsider the functions and stakes of the épuration, {{in the light of}} the collapse of the communist System and the dilemmas of all transitions to a democratic regime. Rousso Henry. L'épuration en France : une histoire inachevée. In: Vingtième Siècle, revue d'histoire, n° 33, janvier-mars 1992. Dossier : L'épuration en France à la Libération. pp. 78 - 105...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{background is}} the essential of creative thinking in working environment in which accompany wih this ability employess would able to change a mistake to be <b>an</b> <b>apportunity,</b> to keep working spirit, and to show their achievement. However, creative thinking {{in order to make}} renewal ang change in organization resulted in many obtacles, including in culture of regular and systematic big organization, where the creative person could not go on in this environment. This study purposed to find out the difference of creative thinking between monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess. Thinking creative is someone opinion concerned with new thing though fluency, flexibility, originality, and ability to elaborate an idea. The hypothesis stated that there were difference monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employess. Those who work monotonous have low level of creative thinking, and those who work non-monotonous have high level of creative thinking. This research used non-experimental design. The dependent variable was to think creative and the independent variable was kind/characteristic of working (monotonous and non-monotonous-working). This study was conducted in PT. Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk Kandatel Malang that had 311 employees with total sample covered 70 people who worked monotonous and non-monotonous. The sampling technique was purposive sampling. The instrument used creative thinking scale. Index of validity from this scale was 0. 188 – 0. 617. The analysis method was t-test. The result of analysis showed that t = 4. 556; p = 0. 000 meaning that there were very significant different of thinking creative between monotonous-working and non-monotonous-working employees. The average score of monotonous-working employees was 148. 26 and the non-monotonous-working employees were 142. 43. In other words, the monotonous-working employees had low creative thinking level and the non-monotonous-working employees had high level of creative thinking. Therefore, the research hypothesis was accepted...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people say}} that DANEM, the scores of EBTANAS is very {{important}} as it is used {{by a lot of}} high schools and universities to assist institutions is the selection and placement of students. Being curious, the writer would like to find out whether the EBTANAS as a formal, large scale, "standardized" instrument has fulfilled the conditions of a test construction. Based on considerable skill needed in constructing multiple choice and essay test items, the validity of the 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS as a measuring instrument of the student's achievement is questionable. This study, therefore, is undertaken to analyse and evaluate the validity of the English EBTANAS, through content analysis and item construction analysis. This analytical study will be limited to the 1956 - 1987 English EBTANAS for Senior High School, the content as the match the objectives, and item contruction based mainly on the guidelines or principles of constructing multiple choice and easy items. So far, there has always been an assumption that all English instructors are capable of constructing multiple tests and that these language tests are considered valid and reliable as measuring instrument. However having followed the systematic procedures of analysing content validity of EBTANAS, the following things were discovered: 1. The structure test did not have representative coverage of structural learning outcomes and content. Its sampling was inadequate in terms of learning outcomes, content, and size. 2. The vocabulary test did not have an adequate size of samples. 3. The reading comprehension test did not have adequate sampling. So it could be deduced that the 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS was not based on a carefully planned table of specifications. Analysis of item construction revealed that to a great extent item construction did not meet the principles of constructing multiple choice and eassay test items All of these led to the following conclusions: 1. The 1986 - 1987 English EBTANAS had a low degree of validity. 2. Of the three subtests, the structure test was the least acceptable, followed by vocabulary test and reading comprehension test successively. Eventualy, the analyst recommends that. : 1. Seminars and workshops on language testing be held. 2. A language testing standardization project be set up at the Indonesian Ministry of Education. 3. An education staff member be given <b>an</b> <b>apportunity</b> to pursue further study in language testing. 4. A suggestion be made to the ministry of Education to improve the syllabus of the English subject for the Senior High School...|$|R
