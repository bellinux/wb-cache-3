40|$|Purpose of the toolkit This toolkit {{has been}} written to assist landholders, {{community}} groups and restoration practitioners monitor the outcomes of revegetation projects for biodiversity in rainforest landscapes. By 'revegetation', we mean a range of on-ground works including the reforestation of cleared land and the enhancement or restoration of existing remnants. The toolkit protocols {{can also be used}} to track the recovery of rainforest from disturbance events, such as cyclones. The toolkit was developed from research conducted in tropical and subtropical Australia, with help from restoration practitioners and natural resource managers. Scope of the toolkit Version 1 of this toolkit includes protocols and <b>proformas</b> to monitor 'basic indicators' of the biodiversity outcomes of revegetation projects. These are aspects of forest structure that provide information on the development of a revegetation project and are correlated with the use of revegetated sites by rainforest wildlife. Users of the toolkit do not require specialist botanical or zoological knowledge, but need to have basic field survey skills. There are five sections to the toolkit: 1. Background information on monitoring and revegetation. 2. Information on the design of monitoring programs. 3. <b>Proformas</b> for recording the on-ground works done in a revegetation project. 4. Protocols and <b>proformas</b> for monitoring 'basic indicators' of revegetation projects. 5. Information on data management, analysis and evaluation. Data entry, analysis and evaluation A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet {{has been written}} to accompany this version of the toolkit, to help store, analyse and summarise the data collected from monitoring revegetated sites. The spreadsheet includes: 剡 page of explanatory notes; 剰ages to record data from monitoring surveys of a revegetated site (a baseline survey and up to eight follow-up surveys); 剰ages to record data from surveys of (up to five) reference sites; 剡 page which automatically summarises the data; and 剡 page which creates graphs of trends in the revegetated site over time, and compares these trends with values recorded in reference sites. <b>Proformas</b> for keeping records and monitoring projects. A Microsoft Word version is available of the <b>proformas</b> used in the Monitoring Toolkit for (i) keeping records of on-ground works, and (ii) monitoring 'basic indicators'. Updates from previous versions of the toolkit The initial version of the 'monitoring toolkit' was released in June 2006. Changes in the revised version are mostly to wording, in an attempt to make the protocols and <b>proformas</b> easier to follow. There have been no substantive changes to the monitoring protocols themselves. The accompanying Excel file has also been revised. For further information, contact: J. Kanowski@griffith. edu. au or C.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 39, based on 12 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally unfavorable reviews". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen expressed a mixed response towards its [...] "punchydance-pop songs full of club-ready beats and Casanova gestures", calling it [...] "a bland, occasionally obnoxious, <b>proforma</b> R album". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson commented that [...] "the only compelling {{thing about the}} incoherent Graffiti is the material (both external and internal) that makes it even less palatable than a simply below-average collection of paint-by-numbers R beats." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club gave the album an F rating and stated [...] "The production is clean and often lively, and Brown sings well enough. The problem is what he’s singing". Allmusic editor Andy Kellman also dismissed the album's songwriting and called Brown [...] "exceptionally insufferable" [...] {{on most of the}} songs. Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave the album one out of four stars and described it as [...] "thoroughly mediocre and at times just garbage". Pete Paphides of The Times panned its ballads, called them a [...] "slopfest of mawkish penitence". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times questioned the lyrics' substance and called Graffiti [...] "a curiously faceless album that largely thumbs its nose at close reading".|$|E

40|$|Between 2008 and 2010, the British Geological Survey (BGS) {{carried out}} 2 {{separate}} studiesto identify and quantify landslide hazards {{with the potential}} to affect third party assets (infrastructure, property and communities) in Scottish Forestry Commission managed land (with the Transport Research Laboratory) and in Wales. A desk-based investigation analysed a range of information, including: the BGS National Land-slide Database, National Digital Geological Mapping (DiGMap 50), landslide potential maps (GeoSure & De-brisFlow) plus information from published literature. These resources were used to score key landslide char-acteristics and, where necessary, estimate the magnitude andextent of the hazard. This was achieved using a custom geographical information system (GIS) combined with an established algorithm to assess the suscep-tibility to landslide hazards and the likelihood of their impact on third party assets. For areas where ahigh landslide potential was identified, <b>proformas</b> were completed, recording detailed information on the geologi-cal and geomorphological conditions, known or recorded landslides and assets at risk with a score for land-slide hazard and likelihood.
