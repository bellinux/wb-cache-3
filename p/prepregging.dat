50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for <b>prepregging,</b> filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 High {{performance}} <b>prepreg</b> systems used in {{the airplane}} industry are proprietary and as a result, issues or problems concerning <b>prepreg</b> handling and composite performance have not been understood by the <b>prepreg</b> user and manufacturer. To help eliminate these proprietary concerns, model <b>prepreg</b> systems are typically used to understand commercial <b>prepreg</b> systems from neat resin through end-use. The usefulness of model <b>prepreg</b> systems is that they allow the resin components, fiber type/weave, and <b>prepreg</b> processing parameters to be changed to better understand their effects on <b>prepreg</b> and final composite characteristics. In this work, a <b>prepreg</b> system modeling methodology was developed {{that can be used}} to understand commercial <b>prepreg</b> systems and reduce the cycle time for new resin and <b>prepreg</b> system development and manufacturing. An engineering approach was used to develop the methodology by combining traditional analytical tools used by the chemist with bulk <b>prepreg</b> analytical methods. The methodology was based on the non-traditional viewpoint of designing for <b>prepreg</b> characteristics first, with cured mechanical properties being secondary. This change in paradigm is a logical progression for design when one considers that <b>prepreg</b> is the precursor to final composite parts. As a result, only by optimizing <b>prepreg</b> characteristics can composite manufacturing and final mechanical properties be optimized, ultimately adding value to the <b>prepreg</b> customer and manufacturer. The design of prepregs still must include the required final mechanical properties, however, it should be realized that this is only one part of many in the design of high performance <b>prepreg</b> systems. Therefore, by optimizing the resin chemistry for not only cured properties but also processing, the necessary quality for today's higher performance <b>prepreg</b> systems can be achieved. Collectively, the modeling methodology that was developed was used to investigate and understand several commercial <b>prepreg</b> systems from processing, structure, and property inter-relationships as they relate to the performance, design, and manufacturing of these materials...|$|R

Partial least squares modeling of the spectra allowed both the <b>prepreg</b> age and the shear strength to be determined from the <b>prepreg</b> spectra.

40|$|Preimpregnated {{composite}} materials (prepregs) are increasingly used in composites manufacture {{in a variety}} of industries [1]. Fibers such as carbon, glass, quartz, or Kevlar™ fiber are coated with an uncured resin such as an epoxy, polyester, vinyl ester or polyimide forming the <b>prepreg.</b> The resulting <b>prepreg</b> material is then used at a later time in the manufacture of a composite structure. The <b>prepreg</b> is pliable and readily arranged into forms.

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} <b>prepregging</b> {{machine has}} been designed and built for NASA Langley Research Center. The machine has numerous advantages over existing units due to its various modular components. Each of these can be used individually or simultaneously depending on the required <b>prepregging</b> method. A reverse roll coater provides the ability to prepare thin films from typical hot-melt thermoset formulations. Also, if necessary, the design allows direct fiber impregnation within the reverse roll coater gap. Included in the impregnation module is a solution dip tank allowing the fabrication of thermoplastic prepregs from solution. The proceeding modules within the unit consist of four nip stations, two hot-plates, a hot-sled option and a high temperature oven. This paper describes the advantages of such a modular construction and discusses the various processing combinations available to the prepregger.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unidirectional carbon fiber-LaRC TPI {{composites}} {{were made}} by prepreg-ging carbon fiber tow with particles of LaRC TPI suspended in aqueous solutions of the ammonium salt of LaRC TPI polyamic acid. The <b>prepregging</b> was followed by drying and consolidation steps designed to facilitate water removal. The effects of processing condi-tions on composite properties were investigated. The processing conditions included the degree of overlap of the fiber bundle in the prepreg, the fiber tension during <b>prepregging,</b> {{and the use of}} vacuum during the consolidation step. It was found that fiber volume % in-creased with increasing fiber tension and that consolidation under vacuum resulted in composites with void content as low as 0. 14 volume %. Fourier transform infrared spec-troscopy and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectroscopy established that most of the water was removed from the prepreg and most of the polyamic acid was con-verted to polyimide prior to consolidation. The properties of the resulting unidirectional laminates were quite reproducible. Shear moduli were comparable to those for graphite-fiber/epoxy and graphite-fiber/PEEK laminates.

These goals are: (1) the biological remediation of the hazardous components in the <b>prepreg</b> wastes, and (2) providing the potential for recycling the <b>prepreg</b> waste fibers. The experiments examined a <b>prepreg</b> that employs an bismaleimide resin system. Initial results demonstrated an obvious deterioration of the <b>prepreg</b> material when incubated with several bacterial strains. The most active cultures were identified as a mixture of 'Bacillus cereus' and 'Pseudomonas sp'. Gas chromatography analyses revealed seven primary compounds in the resin mixture. Biotransformation studies, using the complete <b>prepreg</b> material, demonstrated on obvious loss of all seven organic compounds. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses resulted in structure assignments for the two primary components of the resin. Both were analogs of Bisphenol A; one being bismaleimide, and the other being Bisphenol A containing a diglycidyl moiety. The 'diglycidyl analog' was purified using thin-layer chromatography and the biotransformation of this compound (at 27 ug/ml bacterial culture) was monitored.
