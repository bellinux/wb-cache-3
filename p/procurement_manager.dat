40|$|ABSTRACT. Public <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> {{throughout}} the United States and their legal counterparts are implementing alternative dispute resolution as the preferred method of resolving contractual disputes. ADR seeks to resolve contractual disputes equitably and expeditiously {{by keeping the}} process {{in the hands of}} public <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> and out of the grasp of attorneys and the courts. ADR is a global concept. In 2004 a conference was held in Brussels to discuss self-regulatory initiatives for mediation and to launch the European Code of Conduct for Mediators. ADR is being adopted by public procurement practitioners globally. This paper provides an empirical assessment of its adoption, effectiveness and global application among public sector <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> in the United States, Canada and the European community...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{procurement}} in supplier relationships (SRs). Driven by the importance of outsourcing, {{there is a widespread}} awareness that procurement {{plays an important role in}} their management, yet there is still an incoherent view of what this role entails. The role of procurement is identified in this study by exploring how <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> conduct certain activities for the management of SRs that involve the exchange of products/services with different levels of asset specificity. The role is analysed and assessed in terms of four fundamental dimensions of SRs (trust, power, commitment and involvement). The findings reveal a far more limited role for <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> than what is advocated in the literature, especially for SRs that involve the exchange of products/services with high level of asset specificity and criticality. In light of the findings, certain profiles that can be adopted by <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> in specific contextual situations are identified and a guide to how procurement departments may be involved in an effective way in the management of SRs is proposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{procurement}} of commodities, such {{as basic}} {{raw materials and}} energy sources, is an important operations management activity that can significantly impact {{the value of a}} firm. Managing commodities may also include trading of commodities ’ contracts on the financial markets. The finance and economics literature suggests that financial hedging is a valuable risk management strategy because it can reduce the agency cost. We elaborate on this idea by studying the interaction between financial trading and physical trading decisions within a firm from the principal-agent perspective. This interaction creates tension between the compensation that the firm provides to the <b>procurement</b> <b>manager</b> responsible for physical trading and the financial hedging decision of the firm: a higher bonus rate makes the <b>procurement</b> <b>manager</b> exert more effort, which reduces the variability of the commodity price and reduces the need for hedging. As a result of this tension, we find that the bonus rate is non-monotonic in several parameters that characterize the firm and the manager, such as the average commodity price and the ability level of the manager.

40|$|As {{companies}} {{continue to}} outsource {{large portions of}} their manufacturing, managing costs in the supply chain is increasingly important in reducing overall costs and remaining competitive. Low-cost sourcing has become an increasingly prevalent way for companies to reduce total costs. This thesis develops a methodology for evaluating cost-reduction alternatives and low-cost sourcing opportunities. This thesis is intended to provide <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> with assistance in making informed and well-thought out decisions regarding cost-reduction and low-cost sourcing choices. Six criteria are established to compare cost-reduction alternatives and evaluate the fit of an alternative with the company's supply chain strategy. A framework is developed to aid <b>procurement</b> <b>managers</b> in evaluating low-cost sourcing opportunities. This framework involves the utilization of filters to screen parts, countries, and companies for fit with the supply chain strategy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{describe}} how customer perceived value influences the buying decisions for public hospitals conducting public procurement. This thesis was conducted using a qualitative interview with a <b>procurement</b> <b>manager</b> at the Norrbotten County Council procurement unit. This qualitative data was then analyzed using a frame of reference constructed using current customer perceived value literature, and organizational buying literature. The findings shows that customer perceived value influences the buying decisions of public hospitals conducting public procurement mainly in the initial part of the procurement process. The findings suggests that the public organizations perception of value is not as highly dependent on the trade-off moment between benefit and sacrifice as literature suggests. Instead the public organizations perception of value that influences buying decisions exists {{in the form of}} specification of benefit sought, and specified evaluation method to establish value. The public organizations perception of value is highly influential for buying behavior, thus understanding how public hospitals expresses their sought value is critical for long term success of supplying towards public hospitals.

In Pakistan there are regulations and legal frame work for procurement but there is lack of specific guide lines for procurement officers for implementations of SPP practices in Pakistan.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{neglected}} areas of the manufacturing (and retail) supply chain is the inbound logistics segment. Managing outbound logistics {{has always been the}} strength of the Supply Chain organization (at manufacturers and retailers). The Marketing department has identified different logistics requirements for the finished goods segment. Customizing outbound logistics requirements (various distribution models are the outcome) based on the needs of specific customer segments is today a routine requirement. Similar to the Marketing department, the Purchase (Procurement) department has its own unique set of requirements for inbound raw materials / work-in-progress and other inbound material. In addition, modern JIT manufacturing methods push the <b>Procurement</b> <b>Manager</b> to aim to achieve lowest inventory models – often at the expense of higher inbound transportation costs. There is an inherent conflict in balancing the Just-in-time manufacturing practices (low inventory, shipment sizes, frequency of shipments) with inbound logistics and transportation needs (low cost, visibility of goods). The manufacturing or Retail organization needs to ask itself: Is it seeking the lowest integrated total logistics cost, the streamlined (and lowest) JIT inventory for its manufacturing needs or {{to strike a balance between}} the inherent conflict between the two aforementioned goals aimed towards achieving an optimally balanced and efficient supply chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} how customer satisfaction influenced the buying decisions for public hospitals conducting public procurement. This thesis was conducted using a qualitative interview with a <b>procurement</b> <b>manager</b> at Norrbotten County Council procurement unit. The qualitative data collected was then analyzed using a frame of reference that was constructed previous to the interview. The findings of this thesis showed that customer satisfaction influenced the organizational buying behavior of public hospitals conducting public procurement. The findings showed that customer satisfaction influenced the buying behaviors in two ways. One of the ways customer satisfaction influences buying decisions is through the users’ perception of customer satisfaction. If the users are found dissatisfied the consequence to this will be revealed in the next public procurement process where the specification of what is sough is then changed. The other way in which customer satisfaction influences the buying behavior found was concerning the specification itself. This customer satisfaction is more direct, if the supplier fails to live up to the specification disconfirmation occurs. This disconfirmation can lead to the removal of a supplier from their contract, or the disregard from future contracts if the conflict is thoroughly documented.
