5|$|Mid-October 1998– Moisture {{associated}} with the remnants of Hurricane Madeline results in flooding in Central Texas. The event breaks numerous rain records in the region, including the wettest month for San Antonio since records began in 1885. In addition, 15 rivers exceed the previously known <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> The floods kill 31people. and cause $1.5 billion in damages.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was worst {{along the}} Cheat River, where {{five of the}} six gauging {{stations}} set new discharge records. At Parsons, the river produced a discharge of , which was about 3.8times the previous flood record, and 3.5times the rate of a 100-year flood. At Rowlesburg, the Cheat River crested at , which remains the highest on record as of 2013. At Hendricks, the Dry Fork of the Cheat River had a <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> of , more than twice the previous record.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to have large impacts on <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> However, there may be bias in the simulation of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> by hydrological models. This study aims to improve the simulation of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> under climate change in Lanjiang catchment, east China, by comparing two approaches: postprocessing of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> and composite objective calibration. Two hydrological models [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and modèle du Génie Rural à 4 paramètres Journalier (GR 4 J) ] are employed to simulate the daily flows, and the peaks-over-threshold method is used to extract <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> from the simulated daily flows. Three postprocessing methods, namely, the quantile mapping method and two generalized linear models, are set up to correct the biases in the simulated raw <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> A composite objective calibration of the GR 4 J model by taking the <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> into account in the calibration process is also carried out. The regional climate model Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) with boundary forcing from two GCMs (HadCM 3 and ECHAM 5) under greenhouse gas emission scenario A 1 B is applied to produce the climate data for the baseline period and the future period 2011 – 40. The results show that the postprocessing methods, particularly quantile mapping method, can correct the biases in the raw <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> effectively. The composite objective calibration also resulted in a good simulation performance of <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> The final estimated <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> in the future period show an obvious increase compared with those in the baseline period, indicating there will probably be more frequent floods in Lanjiang catchment in the future...|$|R
50|$|Flood control {{programs}} {{as early as}} {{the first half of the}} twentieth century became quantitative in predicting <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> of riverine systems. Progressively strategies have been developed to minimize <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> and also to reduce channel velocities. Some of the techniques commonly applied are: provision of holding ponds (also called detention basins) to buffer riverine <b>peak</b> <b>flows,</b> use of energy dissipators in channels to reduce stream velocity and land use controls to minimize runoff.|$|R
30|$|It is {{the ratio}} of basin area A, to the square of maximum length of the basin L b. It is a {{dimensionless}} property and {{is used as a}} quantitative expression of the shape of basin form. The sub-watershed- 1 has maximum value (R f =  0.79) while sub-watershed- 7 has minimum value of (R f =  0.17). The smaller the value of form factor is, the more elongated the basin will be. The basin with a high form factor has high <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> of shorter duration, whereas the basin with a low form factor has lower <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> of longer duration. Therefore, sub-watershed- 7 will have lower <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> of longer duration. However, sub-watershed- 1 will have high <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> of shorter duration.|$|R

The Kern River terminates in the Tulare Basin. During very wet years, water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River which flows to the Pacific Ocean. From the east, water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek, which joins the Owens River, which in turn terminates at Owens Lake, an endorheic lake of the Great Basin.|$|E
25|$|Flooding in the Holderness Level {{increased}} between 1840 and 1880, {{as farmers}} used tile drains {{to keep their}} land free of standing water. These carried the water away more quickly to the main drains, increasing the <b>peak</b> <b>flow.</b> Where this drained into the upland drain, {{this was not a}} problem, but where it entered the lowland drain, it caused difficulties, particularly when Marfleet was tide locked. Following the successful introduction of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston drain, {{to the west of the}} River Hull, the Trustees looked at the possibility of installing pumps as Marfleet. However, help came from another source.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1958, {{flooding}} was {{a persistent}} problem near the lower {{reaches of the}} river, with Beighton, Catcliffe, Treeton and Woodhouse Mill particularly at risk. When the River Rother Improvement Scheme was first proposed in September 1958, analysis of flood flows revealed that peaks flows on the Rother generally reached the River Don at Rotherham after the <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> on that river had already passed. Enlarging the channel of the Rother {{would have resulted in}} the peak flows reaching the Don earlier, effectively moving the problem of flooding downstream to Rotherham. The scheme therefore recognised the need to create and manage washlands to hold back the excess flow under these conditions.|$|E
40|$|Open ditch {{drainage}} {{has historically}} been a common land management practice in upland blanket peats, particularly in the UK. However, peatland drainage is now generally considered to have adverse effects on the upland environment, including increased <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> As a result, drain blocking has become a common management strategy in the UK over recent years, although there is only anecdotal {{evidence to suggest that}} this might decrease <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat and the subsequent blocking of drains is poorly understood, therefore a new physics-based model has been developed that allows the exploration of the associated hydrological processes. A series of simulations is used to explore the response of intact, drained and blocked drain sites at field scales. While drainage is generally found to increase <b>peak</b> <b>flows,</b> the effect of drain blocking appears to be dependent on local conditions, sometimes decreasing and sometimes increasing <b>peak</b> <b>flows.</b> Based on insights from these simulations we identify steep smooth drains as those that would experience the greatest reduction in field-scale <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> if blocked and recommend that future targeted field studies should be focused on examining surface runoff characteristics...|$|R

All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV1 and <b>peak</b> <b>flow</b> rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.|$|E

The review summaries methods and methodologies applied and key findings from {{a large number of}} studies.

Several studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> report decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt <b>peak</b> <b>flows,</b> likely caused by increasing temperature. The review of likely future changes based on climate projections indicates a general increase in extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with the observed trends. Hydrological projections of <b>peak</b> <b>flows</b> show large impacts in many areas with both positive and negative changes.
