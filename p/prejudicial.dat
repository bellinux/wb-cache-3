5|$|On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was {{suspended}} for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct <b>prejudicial</b> to the administration of justice in the Jones case.|$|E
5|$|However, even {{if any of}} {{the above}} {{situations}} applies to a person, he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority if he or she has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner <b>prejudicial</b> to public security or the maintenance of public order.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Yong, {{referring}} to the affidavit of the Minister for Culture, held that Order 123 was made after the Government had been satisfied that the teachings and beliefs contained in publications of the WTBTS were contrary to the public interest. The Minister had viewed the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses as being <b>prejudicial</b> to the Government's nation-building efforts, and hence he had rightly exercised his discretion to prohibit such publications.|$|E
5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the check to St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the <b>prejudicial</b> refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, {{on the ground that}} the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|Chapter VI of Part II of the ISA confers {{additional}} powers on the Minister for Home Affairs {{to prevent}} subversion. If a written law confers power on a person, body or authority to appoint people to positions, the Minister can order {{that he or}} she be provided with a list of the people from which the appointment will be made, and other information. The Minister can then direct that people whose appointment would be <b>prejudicial</b> to the interests of Singapore shall not be appointed or recruited. Furthermore, no person is permitted to disclose any communication received from the Minister except in the course of official duty.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and <b>prejudicial.</b> Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
5|$|His Defensa de los curas de Riobamba {{was written}} in {{response}} to a report from Ignacio Barreto that accused the clergy in Riobamba of various unethical practices. Among other things, the report said that the large number of religious celebrations in Riobamba (frequented by Indians) were <b>prejudicial</b> to Catholic faith, agriculture, industry and the interests of the Crown; also, that priests demanded money from the Indians for entrance into churches and for certain ceremonies, that priests in Riobamba were immoral and finally that most sermons were incomprehensible to the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his co-accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other co-accused were <b>prejudicial</b> to Wotton's case. Wotton then pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} rioting. In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the advice of his legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's co-accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried.|$|E
5|$|Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian {{denomination}} {{whose members}} refuse {{to engage in}} any political or national practices, such as saluting the flag or performing national service. This was deemed <b>prejudicial</b> to the public welfare and good order of Singapore, and on 14 January 1972 the Government issued two orders {{to deal with the}} perceived threat to public order. First, Gazette Notification No. 123 of 1972 ("Order 123") was issued by the Minister for Culture pursuant to section 3 of the Undesirable Publications Act ("UPA") to ban works published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society ("WTBTS"), the primary corporation used by Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were <b>prejudicial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under the Internal Security Act, the Minister for Communications and Information is {{empowered}} to prohibit the printing, publication, sale, issue, circulation or possession of any document or publication on the ground, among others, {{that it is}} <b>prejudicial</b> to the national interest, public order or security of Singapore. Doing {{any of the above}} acts in relation to a banned publication is a criminal offence. Among the publications that have been interdicted under this Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, and the Russian political newspaper Pravda. A similar power to prohibit the importation, sale or circulation of publications that are considered to be contrary to the public interest exists under the Undesirable Publications Act.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC found that this instruction was <b>prejudicial</b> to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E
5|$|Raj Thackeray and SP leader Abu Asim Azmi were booked under Indian Penal Code {{sections}} 153 (wantonly giving provocation {{with intent}} to cause riot), 153 A (promoting enmity between groups {{on the basis of}} place of birth, residence, etc.) and 153 B (imputations, assertions <b>prejudicial</b> to national integration) on 11 February. The police also applied section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to both politicians and warned them not to hold any press conferences or rallies in the next seven days. On 13 February, however, police arrested both the leaders. Later that day, a local court granted Raj conditional bail and ordered him not to make any speeches that would inflame public tension. He obtained a release after furnishing a personal bond of Rs.15,000. Azmi was arrested and taken to the Bhoiwada court in South Central Mumbai and was released on surety of Rs.10,000.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This procedure was not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such <b>prejudicial</b> recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Mashbir {{returned}} to Japan after an 11-year absence {{in a second}} attempt to launch the M-Plan {{on behalf of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, naval attaché Zacharias. At that time, there was still hope that war between Japan and America might still be prevented. This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attachés in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir. In a misunderstanding that would come close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military attaché suspicions, a <b>prejudicial</b> report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937. Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was disenrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, it appeared that the actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure to communicate to uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged. Mashbir's dismissal and the failure to implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan {{has been described as a}} key factor in the United States' failure to have more information on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner <b>prejudicial</b> to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a <b>prejudicial</b> manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} <b>prejudicial</b> {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various <b>prejudicial</b> evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E
25|$|WBC {{sought a}} mistrial based on alleged <b>prejudicial</b> {{statements}} made by the judge and violations of the gag order by the plaintiff's attorney. An appeal was also sought by the WBC. WBC {{has said that it}} is thankful for the verdict.|$|E
25|$|At the Court of Appeals, the {{admission}} of the videotape was ruled unduly <b>prejudicial,</b> the conviction was overturned, and the case was remanded for a new trial. He was convicted a second time for failure to file, and that conviction was affirmed.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar filed {{a second}} round of ethics charges against Nifong for a {{systematic}} abuse of prosecutorial discretion that was <b>prejudicial</b> to the administration of justice when he withheld DNA evidence to mislead the court.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of this commission, Hansen's {{responsibilities}} include overseeing formal enquiries into conduct, which in the opinion of the Executive Board is <b>prejudicial</b> to the interests of the game of cricket. He will then make recommendations to the Executive Board on these matters.|$|E
25|$|Justice Hope also {{recommended}} that {{amendments to the}} ASIO Act provide that “it is not {{the purpose of the}} Act that the right of lawful advocacy, protest or dissent should be affected or that exercising those rights should, by themselves, constitute activity <b>prejudicial</b> to security”.|$|E
25|$|The case {{created a}} storm of controversy, but the {{convictions}} were overturned on appeal mainly because - as in their subsequent British trial - the appeal judge found that Locke had misdirected the jury and made remarks that {{were found to have}} been <b>prejudicial</b> to the defence's case.|$|E
25|$|Tsarnaev's lawyer, Judy Clarke, {{indicated}} two strong {{lines of}} likely appeal: that on <b>prejudicial</b> grounds the trial {{should never have}} been held in Boston; and that the defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The appeal process could last years or decades.|$|E
25|$|The nokasayas or the six non-passions are: hasya (laughing, joking {{or making}} fun of), rati (<b>prejudicial</b> liking or impartiality), arati (improper conduct) soka (sorrow), bhaya (fear), and jugupsa (disgust). All these six {{emotions}} are charitra mohaniyas, because the soul which {{is subjected to}} them, is hindered through them {{in the practice of}} right conduct.|$|E
25|$|Like Owen Roberts in Sorrells, he {{expressed}} concern that a predisposition test would needlessly deter defendants who might otherwise have a case based {{on the behavior of}} the government agents involved from doing so, since it would allow the prosecution to bring up prior bad acts that would be <b>prejudicial</b> to the jury and otherwise inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{expanded}} substantially {{the number}} of people eligible for jury service, firstly by removing the various former grounds of ineligibility, and secondly by reducing the scope for people to avoid service when called up. Only members of the Armed Forces whose commanding officers certify that their absence would be <b>prejudicial</b> to the efficiency of the Service can be excused jury duty.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{potentially}} <b>prejudicial</b> {{evidence that was}} mentioned in the committal hearing (regarding Hullett – evidence that would then {{not be used in}} Adams's first trial for murdering Morrell) the Tucker Committee was held, which led to the law being changed in the subsequent Criminal Justice Act 1967 to restrict what might be published about committal hearings to avoid pre-trial publicity.|$|E
25|$|When a {{justiciable}} issue arises, the decision-maker must give the parties a fair opportunity {{to present their}} cases and to correct or contradict any relevant statements <b>prejudicial</b> to them. Generally, it is a denial of natural justice to fail to disclose to a party specific evidence relevant to the decision {{if he or she}} is thereby deprived of an opportunity to comment on it.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2006, the North Carolina bar filed ethics {{charges against}} Nifong over his conduct in the case, {{accusing him of}} making public {{statements}} that were <b>prejudicial</b> to the administration of justice and heightened public condemnation of the accused, and of engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. The 17-page document accused Nifong of violating four rules of professional conduct, listing more than 100 examples of statements he made to the media.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, most {{financial}} institutions and some economists feel that all too often, banks are accused unfairly of discrimination against minority owned businesses when said business is simply not worth such a credit risk, {{and that no one}} would find such a decision discriminatory if the business were not minority owned. These charges of reverse racism or <b>prejudicial</b> analysis are a longstanding source of controversy in the study of economic discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have accused}} him of a romanticised and <b>prejudicial</b> {{promotion}} of 'primitivism' {{through the medium of}} archetypal theory. Archetypal theory has been posited as being scientifically unfalsifiable and even questioned as to being a suitable domain of psychological and scientific enquiry. Jung mentions the demarcation between experimental and descriptive psychological study, seeing archetypal psychology as rooted by necessity in the latter camp, grounded as it was (to a degree) in clinical case-work.|$|E
25|$|In July 1865, Barrett {{preferred}} {{charges of}} disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, abandoning his colors, and conduct <b>prejudicial</b> to good order and military discipline against Morrison for {{actions in the}} battle, resulting in the latter's court martial. Confederate Col. Ford, who had returned from Mexico {{at the request of}} Union Gen. Frederick Steele to act as parole commissioner for disbanding Confederate forces, appeared as a defense witness and assisted in absolving Morrison of responsibility for the defeat.|$|E
25|$|The process {{continued}} also in post-Trianon era. The {{political and}} cultural rights offered to interwar Hungary's ethnic minorities were more limited than their equivalents in any other country of East-Central Europe. While anyone who resisted Magyarization was, indeed, subject to {{political and cultural}} handicaps, they were {{not subject to the}} kinds of civic and fiscal tricks (<b>prejudicial</b> court proceedings, overtaxation, biased application of social and economic legislation) that some of Hungary's neighbors often inflicted on their ethnic minorities.|$|E
