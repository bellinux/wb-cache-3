25|$|The Iron Workers {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{at war with}} the AFL and, in particular, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. The Carpenters claimed that <b>pile-driving</b> <b>work,</b> which was done primarily by Iron Workers in many areas, belonged to them and convinced the Building Trades Department to go along with them. When the Iron Workers refused to relinquish this work the AFL suspended it from membership in 1917. Other unions, such as the Lathers, then claimed that work that had historically been done by iron workers belonged to them instead. Unable to call on the support of other AFL unions in its fights with employers, the Iron Workers relented the following year and ceded pile driving work, with the exception of work related to bridge building, to the Carpenters.|$|E
