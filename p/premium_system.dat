5000|$|The {{efficiency}} of control measures was questioned {{in the past}} and is often questioned today, as well as whether they stand in a good cost-benefit ratio. The <b>premium</b> <b>system</b> proved to be susceptible to deception and to be useless on a large scale, and can therefore only be used for getting rid of [...] "problem-dogs". Animal traps are considered inhumane and inefficient on a large scale, due to the limited efficacy of baits. Based on studies, it is assumed that only young dogs that would have died anyway can be captured. Furthermore, wild dogs are capable of learning and sometimes are able to detect and avoid traps quite efficiently. In one case, a dingo bitch followed a dogger and triggered his traps one after another by carefully pushing her paw through the sand that covered the trap.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the risk-shifting behaviors of Taiwan’s commercial banks {{before and after}} Taiwan government adopted a risk-based <b>premium</b> <b>system.</b> We use the model of Duan et al. (1992) to tie the incremental insurance subsidy received by a bank to investigate the changes on the banks ’ risk-shifting behavior. Furthermore, to obtain reliable estimates for testing our hypotheses, we employ Merton (1977) model to estimate the deposit insurance premium and use the maximum likelihood estimation method proposed by Duan (1994) to estimate {{the market value of}} banks’ assets. Our results find that, under the flat-rate <b>premium</b> <b>system,</b> there is a negative relationship between leverage and asset risk for old commercial banks, while opposite results for the new commercial banks. After adopting the risk-based <b>premium</b> <b>system,</b> the effect of risk-restraining factors decreases.

40|$|Pension is {{a subject}} that soon or later affects all {{individuals}} in society. Within the <b>premium</b> pension <b>system</b> mutual fund fees are an important factor to consider since it can erode savings. This study investigates fees and performance of all mutual funds {{that existed in the}} <b>premium</b> pension <b>system</b> (PPS) between 2004 and 2016. Risk-adjusted performance and fees are adjusted to reflect the discount that is given for fees within the <b>premium</b> pension <b>system</b> to reflect actual investor experiences. The data needed to make these adjustments were obtained from the Swedish Pension Agency. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if there is a relationship between fee and risk-adjusted return within the Swedish <b>premium</b> pension <b>system.</b> Further on this study aims to explain what mutual fund characteristics can be used to predict performance and fees within the <b>premium</b> pension <b>system.</b> Theories used in this study are efficient market hypothesis, agency theory, behavioral finance, economies of scale and portfolio theory. The factors from the Carhart 4 -factor model is used to construct the factor model utilized in this study to estimate risk-adjusted returns. This study adapts a quantitative research method and panel data regressions were conducted to determine how fee and risk-adjusted performance is related to various mutual fund characteristics. Hausman tests were conducted to evaluate if the fixed effects model or random effects model was the most appropriate to use. The result of the Hausman test proved that fixed effect model was the most appropriate model to use. This study will draw conclusions about whether the fee that the mutual fund companies charge can be justified given their risk-adjusted performance. The results for the sample of all mutual funds and the sample of equity funds imply that there exists a positive relationship between fee after discount and performance. Therefore, mutual funds in the <b>premium</b> pension <b>system</b> compensate for increasing fees with a higher risk-adjusted return. The sample of balanced funds differs since there is a negative relationship between risk-adjusted returns and fees. This study finds that size is a determinant of risk-adjusted performance, with larger mutual fund performing better than smaller funds. Because of this finding, it can be concluded that economies of scale do exist among the mutual funds in the <b>premium</b> pension <b>system.</b> Actively managed mutual funds charge higher mutual fund fees on average than passively managed funds. Further on, there is significant evidence that actively managed equity funds perform worse than passively managed equity funds. This suggests that investors are better off investing into cheaper equity index funds rather than expensive actively managed equity funds...|$|R
