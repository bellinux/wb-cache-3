5|$|In 2008, {{two more}} fire mishaps {{occurred}} in the leather industries in the area, one {{in the month of}} March and the other in June: a total of nine <b>people</b> <b>got</b> injured in these two incidents. Even though fire safety licenses and insurances for the workers of the leather factories were made mandatory after the fire incident of 2006, none of the authorities—the municipal corporation, the services department of the state government, and the police—ensured that these were actually followed by the factories. The local residents claimed that the owner of the factory that was impacted in the fire incident of 2006, now operates from another address of the same area. According to fire brigade officials, the Topsia area along with nearby Tiljala and Tangra forms the most fire-prone area of the city, and that around three to four fires break out every week, though they do not get reported in the media as there is no loss of life.|$|E

Within five years, the granaries were fully stocked with food supplies and the <b>people</b> <b>got</b> along with their livelihoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{war in the}} Portuguese {{overseas}} territories of Africa was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the <b>people</b> <b>got</b> weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African {{overseas territories}} were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. In addition, younger Portuguese military academy graduates resented a program introduced by Marcello Caetano whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and {{had served in the}} overseas territories' defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates.|$|E

Ten minutes later, when the ferries docked in Beacon and disgorged their cargo, <b>people</b> <b>got</b> in their cars or hopped on the waiting buses and went home, over the new bridge.

Joyce Carol Oates wrote: [...] "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, {{the effect was}} dramatic and electrifying." [...] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate {{as well as his}} lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts. [...] "It didn't take long before <b>people</b> <b>got</b> it, that he was pretty damned special," [...] says Baez.|$|E

[...] They rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Yorke responded: [...] "We write pop songs... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it." [...] He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified the album's influences: [...] "What really blew my head off {{was the fact that}} <b>people</b> <b>got</b> all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create." ...|$|E

According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some <b>people</b> <b>got</b> out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present.
