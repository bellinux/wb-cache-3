5|$|The battle did {{not have}} a notable {{influence}} on the war and did not prevent further <b>pillage.</b> Montevideo was finally subdued by Admiral Brown during the Second Banda Oriental campaign. Antonio Zabala, the leader of the Montevidean army, served under San Martín during the crossing of the Andes years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} was {{a private}} venture much like the Drake-Norris expedition, supported by limited assistance and subsidies from the crown. Its objective was to <b>pillage</b> Spanish and Portuguese ships within the Atlantic, off the Spanish coast or within the Caribbean {{and to make a}} profit from which the Queen's portion would amount to a large sum.|$|E
5|$|This unruly mob {{began to}} attack and <b>pillage</b> {{outside the city}} in search of {{supplies}} and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the Bosporus one week later. After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split {{up and began to}} <b>pillage</b> the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; most of this group of the crusaders were massacred. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50knights, fought a battle against the Turks at Civetot in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.|$|E
5000|$|In 881, Lei, {{for reasons}} unclear, fled back from Huainan {{to his home}} region. He {{gathered}} 1,000 men and attacked Lang Prefecture, capturing it and killing its prefect Cui Zhu (崔翥). With the Tang imperial government then battling the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, then-reigning Emperor Xizong made Lei the acting prefect. From this point on, Lei, in control of Lang Prefecture, would make periodic <b>pillages,</b> {{three or four times}} a year, against Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality. [...] Lei's <b>pillages</b> appeared to briefly stop in 885, when then-military governor of Jingnan, Chen Ru, bribed him to stop the <b>pillages,</b> but after Chen was overthrown by Zhang Gui later that year, Lei appeared to continue his <b>pillages.</b> [...] It was said that these <b>pillages</b> laid the region on the Yangtze River to waste.|$|R

5|$|Morgan {{considered}} attacking Camp Morton, the prisoner-of-war camp in Indianapolis, to free {{more than}} 5,000 Confederate {{prisoners of war}} imprisoned there, but decided against it. Instead, his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio. With Indiana's militia in pursuit, Morgan's men continued to raid and <b>pillage</b> their way toward the Indiana-Ohio border, crossing into Ohio on July 13. By the time Morgan left Indiana, his raid had become {{a desperate attempt to}} escape to the South. He was captured on July 26 in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The 1895 {{capture of}} the Merina royal capitol, the Rova of Antananarivo, by the French sparked the Menalamba {{rebellion}} against foreigners, Christianity and Merina domination. In the chaotic 1895–97 period, bands of Sakalava, Marofotsy and other bandits engaged in raids to loot cattle and other goods. The Sihanaka were especially hard hit owing to their reputation as a relatively wealthy trading people. Many Sihanaka villagers resorted to sleeping in the forests and fields to avoid falling victim to nighttime <b>pillage</b> and arson; entire Sihanaka villages were burned.|$|E
5|$|The Regiment {{followed}} the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They {{hid in the}} San Carlos Convent, in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe. San Martín watched the enemy ships {{from the top of}} the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to <b>pillage</b> and the regiment charged into battle. San Martín employed a pincer movement to trap the royalists. He led one column and Justo Bermúdez the other.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in <b>pillage</b> and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is perhaps for this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E
5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand {{brought more}} than 400 Fussvolk (foot soldiers) and five squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by <b>pillage,</b> arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn their allegiance to Gebhard and would fight to the death for him.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and <b>pillage.</b> The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to prevent it from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E

25|$|While many {{buildings}} were <b>pillaged,</b> burned, or {{destroyed by the}} Viking raids, ecclesiastical sources may have been overly negative as no city was completely destroyed. On the other hand, many monasteries were <b>pillaged</b> and all the abbeys were destroyed. Rollo and his successors brought about rapid recoveries from the raids.|$|R
5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district, that included Ch'ol Maya territory around Tila. In {{the early years of}} conquest, encomienda rights effectively meant rights to <b>pillage</b> and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and were sold in exchange for weapons, supplies, and horses.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{crossed the}} border in mid-August. Given-Wilson has noted the care Henry took not to ravage or <b>pillage</b> the {{countryside}} on their march through Berwickshire and Lothian. This was {{in marked contrast to}} previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385. This he puts this down to the presence in the English army of the earl of Dunbar, whose lands they were. Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauchée that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to <b>pillage</b> and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would round up the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E

5|$|The Theban Cycle {{deals with}} events {{associated}} especially with Cadmus, the city's founder, and {{later with the}} doings of Laius and Oedipus at Thebes; a series of stories {{that lead to the}} eventual <b>pillage</b> of that city {{at the hands of the}} Seven Against Thebes and Epigoni. (It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{agreed to}} help the King attack Lisbon, with a solemn {{agreement}} that offered to them the <b>pillage</b> of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, {{but some of them}} set sail and continued to the Holy Land. Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped capture Santarém earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer Sintra, Almada, Palmela and Setúbal, and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had reached}} a stalemate and Murad contemplated his next move. He was advised to <b>pillage</b> the countryside, but the surrounding fields had already been burned by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. Mehmed, Murad's son, proposed leaving Svetigrad to strike at Krujë. Murad sternly rejected this, reasoning that the supplies to take Svetigrad would have been wasted and that Krujë would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad {{in an attempt to}} starve the garrison into submission. Meanwhile, the garrison under the leadership of Peter Perlati made several successful sorties against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement and strengthen his soldiers' morale.|$|E

5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the <b>pillage</b> and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|War {{broke out}} after Henry {{returned}} to Normandy with an army to support Theobald of Blois, who was {{under attack from}} Louis. Henry and Louis raided each other's towns along the border, and a wider conflict then broke out, probably in 1116. Henry was pushed onto the defensive as French, Flemish and Angevin forces began to <b>pillage</b> the Normandy countryside. Amaury III of Montfort and many other barons rose up against Henry, {{and there was an}} assassination plot from within his own household. Henry's wife, Matilda, died in early 1118, but the situation in Normandy was sufficiently pressing that Henry was unable to return to England for her funeral.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to <b>pillage</b> and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E
