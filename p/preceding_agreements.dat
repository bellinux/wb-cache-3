40|$|Over 25 {{per cent}} of present day {{refugees}} enjoy asylum in Pakistan, {{most of them}} having been there {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Pakistan is not, however, a party to either the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. The legal status of the Afghan refugees it hosts is therefore not a foregone conclusion, even though they were considered to be refugees on a prima facie basis during the first two decades of their exile in Pakistan. This article identifies the legal status of the Afghan refugees on the basis of a series of agreements Pakistan concluded with UNHCR and also occasionally with Afghanistan. By virtue of the last of the series of agreements, Afghan refugees can return to Afghanistan under a UNHCR-assisted voluntary repatriation programme until December 2009. In view of the fact that all Afghans have been granted leave to stay in Pakistan until the same date, many are expected to stay in Pakistan rather than return with the assistance of UNHCR. Unlike the <b>preceding</b> <b>agreements,</b> the last one does not address the fate of those who will still be in Pakistan upon completion of the voluntary repatriation programme. It seems therefore imperative to identify the legal status and corresponding entitlements of the Afghan refugees. It is argued that the prima facie recognition of refugee status can be sustained on the basis of the agreements referred to. In addition it is argued that the current ‘profiling’ exercise of UNHCR, even while presumably beneficial for the most vulnerable refugees, is irreconcilable with the status and entitlements of the Afghan refugees, and the same holds true with respect to the usual practice of ‘screening’ those refugees who have opted not to return under a voluntary repatriation programme. An alternative that would be reconcilable is a collective cessation of refugee status if and when the situation in the country of origin so warrants, provided individual refugees may contest this...|$|E

40|$|Existing {{research}} has shown that negotiated peace agreements are less likely to sustain an enduring peace in the aftermath of civil wars. A large proportion of research concentrates on the effects of either agreement design or agreement implementation on the likelihood of civil war resumption. Generally, existing studies fail to integrate design and implementation as separate parts of an interdependent process. Studies also tend to ignore the implication of <b>preceding</b> <b>agreement</b> design on subsequent implementation. This research develops an integrative framework that engages both the agreement design and implementation stages in the civil war peace process. It also examines the effects of third-party mediation on the durability of peace agreement in the aftermath of civil wars through its in uence on the quality of agreement design and implementation. The presence of third-party mediation helps to resolve future uncertainty and fear resulting from the problem 2 ̆ 2 between war combatants, and thus makes peace agreements more durable. By using compiled data from the UCDP Peace Agreement Dataset, the Civil War Mediation (CWM) dataset, and the Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED), this research employs a Cox Proportional Hazards model to test the implication of design and implementation on the durability of postwar peace. The results suggest that the effect of mediation on peace durability is conditional upon the stages of the peace process. Peace agreements designed and implemented by mediators are more likely to sustain lasting peace. The results also indicate that not all implementation of power-sharing pacts, as promised in the design stage, can produce pacifying effects given the fact that implementing certain types of power-sharing pacts disrupts peace processes...|$|R

The paper uses a simple monetary model of the open economy to illustrate how the exchange rate responses to news about the trade balance when the government authorities gear policy toward resolving external imbalances. The paper finds that U. S. dollars exchange rates against the Japanese yen and the West German mark respond strongly to news about the U.

40|$|Designed to {{contribute}} to {{an assessment of the}} effects of the second agreement with general practitioners, the study analyzes the effects produced on the medical practices of general practitioners by pay range of a) the individual income ceiling and b) various types of fee restrictions on supplementary medical procedures provided under the agreement. The methodology used consisted basically in analyzing the variations of selected indicators of professional activity and medical practice among general practitioners by pay range following the implementation of the second agreement. Control groups were used to facilitate the assessment of other factors that may have influenced the variations referred to. The study shows that the income ceiling has resulted in a significant slowdown in the professional activity of general practitioners whose income had been in excess of the income ceiling in the year <b>preceding</b> the <b>agreement.</b> The shorter work period was accompanied by a longer vacation period. From the second part of the study it appears that the implementation of the second agreement has also appreciably reduced differences in medical procedures by pay range. The fee restrictions on supplementary procedures have produced a very considerable drop in the number of supplementary procedures performed by general practitioners in the top pay ranges, whereas in the past such procedures had been particularly prevalent in those pay ranges...|$|R
40|$|For those {{engaged in}} the {{discipline}} of cybernetics, its relationship to business has long been discussed and desired. The recent explosion of digital communication channels affords an application domain for cybernetics that is itself potentially highly productive yet clearly in need of guidance. While “Web 2. 0 ” experiments abound, failure rather than design has been the primary mechanism for steering the development of marketplace conversations between and among brands and consumers. This paper proposes to replace natural selection with the application of conversation theory to marketing {{as a means of}} improving outcomes. Using cybernetics concepts of goal-directed systems, requisite variety, co-evolution and conversation, the author characterizes marketing conversations, offers examples of them, and provides prescriptions for improving them. The goal is to improve the conversational experiences delivered by digital technologies in order to better meet the goals of marketers and, especially, the goals of users/consumers/persons who are on the receiving end—and, more so every day, on the generating end—of interaction channels enabled by digital technology. In practice, conversation is a requirement for commerce because any commerce transaction must be <b>preceded</b> by <b>agreement,</b> which must be preceded by conversation. Therefore, the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of conversation should be a focus for every business that offers products or services. Furthermore, conversation is a requirement for brands and consumers to create a relationship of trust, which is the foundation of lifetime customer value, which in turn is the single best measure of viability—the survival and thriving—of any brand...|$|R
40|$|The {{memory of}} D. Egas is unquestionably {{linked to the}} {{production}} of {{what is known as the}} Summa de Libertate Ecclesiastica. Egas was Bishop of Viseu between 1288 and 1313 and seems neither to have enjoyed any position of particular influence withnear the king nor shared royal spheres of influence. On the contrary, however, the perspective contained within the aforementioned document is that of a bishop devoted to the government of his diocese and his legacy. Furthermore, his name and his role are referred to in the negotiations <b>preceding</b> certain <b>agreements</b> defining the relationship between King D. Dinis and the Church in the period that elapsed between the 1380 s 1280 s and the early years of the 14 th century and his name is certainly linked with the writing of a text as important as that of the Summa. This text, providing a reflection on the relationship between royal power and the episcopate, conveys an image of a prelate much more interested in the political circles and much more interventional than an earlier approach had suggested. It is within this context of establishing a balance between these two apparently contradictory viewpoints that this study was undertaken presenting the administration of Bishop Egas as a case study for a broader perspective on relations between episcopates and the king towards the end of the 13 th century.

The Liberals opposed NAFTA and promised to try to renegotiate the FTA, but this was not a central campaign theme. The NDP did focus on opposition to NAFTA, but the Canadian people mostly felt that the free trade debate was over. When in office, the Liberals signed on to NAFTA with little opposition. Similarly, while constitutional issues had dominated the national debate for several years, two failed reform proposals led most to support giving the issue a rest. Chrétien promised not to reopen the constitution, and that under the Liberals any change would be incremental in nature. In Quebec the election was seen as a prelude to the next Quebec election and the referendum on secession that was sure to follow.|$|R
40|$|This article {{faces an}} old paradox of moral education: the {{apparently}} logical impossibility of choosing {{the transmission of}} agreed-upon values and the autonomous exercise of reason.

However, she warns us against a possible danger: the mere transmission of accepted principles and values may place moral education under a heterogeneous direction of conduct. Educators should, by all means, avoid such a risk. She suggests seeking a reasonable plurality as a means of transmitting agreed-upon values. The notion of reasonable plurality derives from a feature assigned to John Rawls’ concept of “overlapping consensus”. </span...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{agreement}} between drug use measured in computerized pharmacy records and patient interviews or questionnaires is generally good. However, most investigations {{on this subject}} studied selected populations or subsets. We studied the coverage of Dutch pharmacy data for our study cohort, and the {{agreement between}} the different sources. Methods We used the data from 8592 subjects of an on-going population-based study, focused {{on the impact of}} microalbuminuria (PREVEND). Data on drug use was collected in a questionnaire and at community pharmacies. Drug use was measured in the year <b>preceding</b> the questionnaire. <b>Agreement</b> between the sources was measured using kappa-values, sensitivity and positive predictive value. Results Pharmacy data could be collected for 7568 (88 %) of the study cohort. Pharmacy data and questionnaires showed good agreement for antihypertensives, lipid lowering drugs, oral antidiabetics and oral contraceptives, but poor agreement for nitrates, hormone replacement therapy and painkillers. Conclusions Pharmacy data could be collected for a large proportion of our cohort. For chronically used drugs pharmacy data generally agrees well with questionnaires. However, for drugs used for shorter periods, as needed, or also available over-the-counter, the agreement is not so good. Pharmacy data can be a valuable source of drug information in epidemiological studies. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares reform {{ownership}} in Ghana and Tanzania {{over the past}} two decades. It finds that on several dimensions, Ghana 2 ̆ 019 s early economic reforms enjoyed a high degree of ownership. That ownership was not embedded, however, in a politico-institutional framework that ensured that ownership would be maintained. Initial efforts to broaden consultation were not maintained and the small economic team was insufficiently widened. The politically more difficult second-generation reforms, the move to multi-party democracy and the exponential increase in aid contributed to a decline in {{ownership in}} Ghana. In the case of Tanzania, while initial reform efforts were made without aid, the acrimonious debate with donors that <b>preceded</b> the eventual <b>agreement</b> with the IMF and the socialist ideological heritage strengthened the perception of little ownership. Tanzania 2 ̆ 019 s relatively weak state capacity and weakened policy decision making process have contributed to lower ownership. Most important, however, the high degree of aid dependency and dominance of donors sometimes tends to mask the real attempts the country is making. Tanzania has made interesting innovations in trying to manage its relations with donors. If they are to succeed, state and institutional capacity must be strengthened and donors must give the country some space...|$|R
40|$|Patent holders are, with {{increasing}} frequency, making public promises {{to refrain from}} asserting patents under certain conditions, or to license patents on terms that are “fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory” (FRAND). These promises or “patent pledges” generally <b>precede</b> formal license <b>agreements</b> and other contracts, but are nevertheless intended to induce the market to make expenditures and adopt common technology platforms without the fear of patent infringement. But despite their increasing prevalence, current contract, property, and antitrust law theories used to explain and enforce patent pledges have fallen short. Thus, a new theory is needed to secure the market-wide benefits that patent pledges can offer. This Article proposes a novel “market reliance” theory for the enforcement of patent pledges. Market reliance {{is rooted in the}} equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel, but adds a rebuttable presumption of reliance borrowed from the “fraud-on-the-market” theory under federal securities law. Under this approach, a patent holder’s public commitment is enforceable by any participant in the relevant market absent a showing that it knowingly rejected the commitment. The market reliance theory offers a robust means for enforcing legitimate patent pledges by thirdparty market participants, and it extends the effect of such pledges to downstream purchasers of patents. As such, the market reliance theory could fill a critical gap in the existing patent enforcement landscape and give greater assurance to the technology markets that depend on them...|$|R
