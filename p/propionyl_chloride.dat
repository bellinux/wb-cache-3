Possible interference of reactive side chains was investigated by reacting N-acetylamino acids {{as well as}} several peptides with <b>propionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> instead of acetyl chloride. The products were characterized by PDMS mass spectrometry and 1 H-NMR. This chemical method allows, for the first time, complete derivatization of N-acetylproline to proline thiohydantoin. Applying this chemistry to peptides with a C-terminal proline, the yields for formation of proline thiohydantoin were found to be up to 60 %, depending on the peptide sequence. The previous inability to derivatize C-terminal proline to thiohydantoin was thought to stem from the fact that proline cannot form the oxazolonium ion required for efficient reaction with the thiocyanate ion.

Among GTP, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is dominant and has been considered as being effective in both food and biological systems.

In order to expand the application of EGCG to more diverse systems, it may be lipophilized through structural modification. In this work, lipophilized derivatives of EGCG were prepared by acylation with different chain lengths fatty acyl chlorides such as acetyl chloride, C 2 : 0; <b>propionyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> C 3 : 0; hexanoyl chloride, C 6 : 0; octanoyl chloride, C 8 : 0; dodecanoyl chloride, C 12 : 0; octadecanoyl chloride, C 18 : 0; and docosahexaenoyl chloride, C 22 : 6.

As complexing ligand either a commercially available ligand (triphenyl phosphine) (PPh 3) or synthetic aliphatic amines were used. As initiators, methyl 2 -bromopropionate, ethyl 2 -bromoisobutyrate, α,α-dichloroacetophenone, and poly(ethylene oxide) macroinitiator were employed. Block copolymerization of n-butyl methacrylate-b-tert-butyl acrylate (BMA-b-tBA) was performed by two-step ATRP method. The results showed that, for well-defined copolymers, a low conversion macroinitiator (conversion 35 %) is preferable to a high conversion one. Four tetradentate nitrogen ligands, viz. dichloro{[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (1), {[N,N'-dioctyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (2), {[N,N'-dibenzyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (3), and (1 R, 2 R) -(-) -N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) diiminocyclohexane (4), were synthesised at the University of Helsinki, and used as complexing ligands in iron-mediated polymerization of methyl methacrylate. High to moderate conversions (87 %, 43 %) were obtained in relatively short times (90  min for 1 and 30  min for 2), which indicates an efficient catalyst system. When the bulkiness of the substituents was significantly increased, as in ligand 3, polymerization rate was decreased and control was lost. Ligand 4 was less efficient than the other ligands, probably because the ethylene bridge was replaced by cyclohexane bridge. Poly(ethylene oxide) monochloro macroinitiators and poly(ethylene oxide) telechelic macroinitiators (Cl-PEO-Cl) were prepared from monohydroxy functional and dihydroxy functional poly(ethylene oxide) {{in the presence of}} 2 -chloro <b>propionyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and applied to the polymerization of styrene (S) or methyl methacrylate (MMA). The polymerization of styrene was carried out in bulk at 140  °C and catalysed by copper(I) chloride (CuCl) in the presence of 2, 2 ' -bipyridine (bipy) ligand (CuCl/ bipy), but the polymerization of MMA was carried out in the presence of (FeCl 2. 4 H 2 O) / (PPh 3) catalytic system. With most of the macroinitiators, the living nature of the polymerizations led to block copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn  90 % by mass) allowed the preparation of water-soluble/water-dispersible block copolymers. Small amounts of the PEO-PS-based block copolymers were applied to modify the paper surface. Chain length of the hydrophilic block and/or the amount of hydrophobic block was found {{to play an important role}} in modification of the paper surface. It was also found that water-dispersible triblock copolymer containing 10  wt-% PS makes the paper surface highly hydrophobic (contact angle > 115 ° ) and retards water absorption on both light weight coated base paper (LWC) and fine base paper (FP).
