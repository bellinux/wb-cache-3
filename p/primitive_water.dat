50|$|As {{with any}} V8, the block was {{relatively}} light for the displacement supported. The {{bottom of the}} block formed the parting line for the main bearing caps. The most complex part of the block was the exhaust passage routing. The exhaust valves were {{on the inside of}} the V and exhaust flow was initially downward and passed around the cylinders through the water jacket to exit on the outside of the cylinder block. The routing of the exhaust through the water jacket put an extremely heavy load on the cooling system and led to frequent overheating, especially on early models, if the cooling system were not maintained. Somewhat <b>primitive</b> <b>water</b> pumps used until the advent of the 1948 8RT and 1949 8BA models also contributed to the overheating problem. The space for the exhaust flow was also somewhat restricted, so the exhaust passages were tall and narrow in some locations. The gas flow past the rough sand castings could be greatly improved by polishing the passages. The capacity of the block for over-boring (beyond normal boring for wear compensation) was limited by the configuration and the metal available. In early blocks, some cylinder walls were extremely thin due to cores shifting during casting. It was prudent to overbore before relieving and polishing the ports, as a casting flaw such as a sand pit might be revealed, usually fatal to further use of the block. The blocks with the factory 3- (3.1875) inch bore can usually be safely bored 1/8 inch over standard to 3.3125 in and sometimes can be bored 3/16 inch over standard to 3.375 in, increasing displacement a little over 12%.|$|E

40|$|Pristine {{carbonaceous}} chondrites contain fine-grained matrix, {{which is}} composed largely of amorphous silicates, sub-micron silicate and sulfide crystals, and organic materials. They {{are regarded as}} primitive dust in the early Solar System that have suffered minimal alteration in their parent bodies. The matrix generally has different lithologies; {{some of them are}} unaltered but some are more or less aqueously altered. Their textures have been examined in 2 D usually by FE-SEM/EDS, TEM/EDS, nano-SIMS and micro-XRD. Observation of their complex fine textures, such as spatial relation between different lithologies in 3 D, is important for understanding aggregation and alteration processes. Synchrotron radiation (SR) -based X-ray tomography reveals 3 D structures nondestructively with high spatial resolution of approximately greater than 100 nm. We have developed a new technique using absorption contrasts called "dual-energy tomography" (DET) to obtain 3 D distribution of minerals at SPring- 8, SR facility in Japan, and applied successfully to Itokawa particles. Phase and absorption contrast images can be simultaneously obtained in 3 D by using "scanning-imaging x-ray microscopy" (SIXM) at SPring- 8, which can discriminate between void, water and organic materials.

Editor: Dr. V. B. Kamble Water is an essential prerequisite forpeople’s lives and livelihoods. The relationship between human population and water resources has changed with the progress of human civilisation. Early human civilisations {{in different parts of the}} world developed on the banks of major rivers, which ensured a reliable supply of water.

Technological interventions made it possible to make water available in areas where it could not have been dreamt of in the past.

There are three kinds of major demands for water—agricultural, industrial and domestic. Demand for water increases continually with the growth of world population.

5000|$|Formerly {{called the}} “Zaire” (Kongo nzere, [...] "the river that {{swallows}} all rivers"), the Congo's origin is {{traced to the}} Chambeshi (discovered by Livingstone) in Zambia. The Kalambo River has one of Africa’s highest waterfalls (250 meters) at the Zambia/Tanzania border. The Chambeshi contributes to the Bangweulu Swamp, home to both the black lechwe and the Bemba people. (Livingstone died there searching for the Nile source.) Other denizens include the oribi, tsessebe (relative of the gnu), African lungfish and the stork-like shoebill. The Luapula and Lualaba Rivers are followed, as is the Lake Tanganyika effluent river, the Lukuga. Tanganyika provides habitat for Limnocnida (freshwater jellyfish), the Bichir (a <b>primitive</b> fish), <b>water</b> cobra, the spotted-necked otter and diverse populations of cichlids. The abandoned “country estate” of Col. Stewart Gore-Browne (incorrectly called “Henry” in the series) — known as Shiwa Ngandu — is visited. It is in northern Zambia.

The wider river here hosts elephant-snout fish, north African catfish, and the water chevrotain. “Bai” (Biaka, “glades”) provide habitat for elephant, hippo and the western lowland gorilla, which numbers as many as 50,000 within the Odzala National Park. River martins swarm massively. The Congo is so wide here that it forms an effective barrier between two related species of ape: the common chimp on the north bank and the bonobo (pygmy chimp) on the south.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to consider balance dynamics for modelling slow vortical motion is suggested within the rotating shallow <b>water</b> <b>primitive</b> equations. Instead of a traditional approach using divergence and ageostrophic vorticity as fast variables, the velocity is exactly expressed as a sum of the gradient part, described by a Bernoulli function, and the rest, an agradient part, proportional to the velocity tendency, which is used as the fast variables slaved to potential vorticity. The source of the flow evolution is expressed in a form of a Jacobian operator on the Bernoulli function and potential vorticity that allows for direct estimation of the slow evolution rate. Momentum equations for the agradient velocity are derived for accurate representation of both slow vortical motion and fast inertia-gravity waves. This approach allows {{for the construction of}} balance conditions for vortical dynamics and a potential vorticity inversion scheme even for moderate Rossby and Froude numbers, assuming that the angle between the isolines of Bernoulli function and potential vorticity is small. This approach is found to be limited by the ellipticity condition for balanced tendencies which incorporates both known criteria for formal stability: the gradient velocity modified by the local Rossby wave speed should be subcritical.

This paper validates and extends recent work examining the suggested upscale cascade mechanism in a three-di-mensional quasigeostrophic framework using a simple shallow <b>water</b> <b>primitive</b> equation (SWPE) numerical model and helps clarify {{certain aspects of the}} Rossby adjustment problem on a nonresting basic state for finite-amplitude nonaxisymmetric disturbances. The SWPE approach serves as a meaningful intermediate step between the quasigeostrophic and full-physics frameworks and allows a simple investigation of the effects of unbalanced dynamics (contributions of gravity waves) and Rossby numbers of order unity. The authors compare quantitative results of the two models on the storm spinup time and magnitude. For asymmetric initial conditions whose mass and wind field are out of balance, robust spinup is still obtained provided the initial asymmetries possess a significant vortical component. Episodic convective forcing param-eterized via unbalanced vorticity anomalies is shown to lead to spinup of a tropical storm strength vortex on a timescale of approximately 40 h.

Analyzing water use and future demand forecasting is a <b>primitive</b> clue for <b>water</b> demand management. Water in Luxor is used for agricultural, residential, institutional, commercial, and touristic purposes. The results of water use analysis indicated that for the time period from 1983 to 2012, agriculture is the highest consumer of water which reached about 94. 76 - 97. 38 % followed by residential water consumption (1. 90 - 3. 05 %), institutional water consumption (0. 71 - 1. 75 %), and touristic water consumption (0. 02 - 0. 43 %), respectively. The future demand forecasting results revealed that the present situation may continue to rise in the next 50 years which will increase the water demand with a water deficit ranging between 15 and 114 MCM/year. To fill the gap between the present water consumption and future residential, institutional, commercial, and touristic water demand, additional municipal facilities, and improvement and management of water supply/demand are needed. To cope with the predicted future water demand, it is recommended to improve the on-farm irrigation, reduce the demand for irrigation water, rationalize the irrigation water use, and enhance the integrated role of water users in integrated water resources management. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|Tropical Cyclone (TC) {{track changes}} {{associated}} with Rossby wave energy dispersion are simulated {{in a shallow}} <b>water</b> <b>primitive</b> equation model with an initial field where a TC is located south of a subtropical high. An anticyclone east of the TC appears because of Rossby wave energy dispersion. The connection of the anticyclone with the subtropical high leads to a poleward TC track deflection. The TC eventually moves across the axis of the subtropical ridge. The formation of the track {{may be attributed to}} the nonlinear interaction between the subtropical high and the TC. This work validates the conceptual model proposed by previous observational research. The scenario of the nonlinear interaction between the TC and the subtropical high may also be modified through the influence of mesoscale vortices. The main modifications are (1) the anticyclone induced by energy dispersion of the TC weakens, (2) the connection between the anticyclone and the subtropical high is delayed, and (3) the TC shifts more westward and does not move across the ridge axis. We propose that some of the mesoscale vortices are axisymmetrized by the TC and results in an increase in TC size which modifies the properties of the energy dispersion. The phase and group speeds decrease and produce a simulated track deflection to the left compared to the simulation without mesoscale vortices. Our numerical results demonstrate that multiple scale nonlinear interactions have an essential role in influencing TC track changes...|$|R
