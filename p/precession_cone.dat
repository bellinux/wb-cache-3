40|$|Current {{searches}} for compact binary mergers by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors assume for simplicity the two bodies are not spinning. If the binary contains compact objects with significant spin, then this {{can reduce the}} sensitivity of these searches, particularly for black hole [...] neutron star binaries. In this paper we investigate the effect of neglecting precession on the sensitivity of {{searches for}} spinning binaries using non-spinning waveform models. We demonstrate that in the sensitive band of Advanced LIGO, the angle between the binary's orbital angular momentum and its total angular momentum is approximately constant. Under this constant <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> approximation, we show that the gravitational-wave phasing is modulated in two ways: a secular increase of the gravitational-wave phase due to precession and an oscillation around this secular increase. We show that this secular evolution occurs in precisely three ways, corresponding to physically different apparent evolutions of the binary's precession about the line of sight. We estimate the best possible fitting factor between any non-precessing template model and a single precessing signal, {{in the limit of}} a constant <b>precession</b> <b>cone.</b> Our closed form estimate of the fitting-factor depends only the geometry of the in-band precession cone; it does not depend explicitly on binary parameters, detector response, or details of either signal model.

We investigate the 3 D evolution of jets launched symmetrically from single stars but also jets from warped disks in binary systems.

Our reference simulation maintains a good axial symmetry and also a bipolar symmetry for more than 600 rotations of the inner disk confirming {{the quality of our}} model setup. We have then implemented a 3 D gravitational potential (Roche potential) due to a companion star and run a variety of simulations with different binary separations and mass ratios. These simulations show typical 3 D deviations from axial symmetry, such as jet inclination outside the Roche lobe or spiral arms forming in the accretion disk. In order to find indication for precession effects, we have also run an exemplary parameter setup, essentially governed by a small binary separation of only ≃ 200 inner disk radii.

40|$|Inspiralling black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) {{binaries}} emit {{a complicated}} gravitational wave signature, produced by multiple harmonics sourced by their strong local gravitational field and further modulated by the orbital plane's precession. Some {{features of this}} complex signal are easily accessible to ground-based interferometers (e. g., {{the rate of change}} of frequency); others less so (e. g., the polarization content); and others unavailable (e. g., features of the signal out of band). For this reason, an ambiguity function (a diagnostic of dissimilarity) between two such signals varies on many parameter scales and ranges. In this paper, we present a method for computing an approximate, effective Fisher matrix from variations in the ambiguity function on physically pertinent scales which depend on the relevant signal to noise ratio. As a concrete example, we explore how higher harmonics improve parameter measurement accuracy. As previous studies suggest, for our fiducial BH-NS binaries and for plausible signal amplitudes, we see that higher harmonics at best marginally improve our ability to measure parameters. For non-precessing binaries, these Fisher matrices separate into intrinsic (mass, spin) and extrinsic (geometrical) parameters; higher harmonics principally improve our knowledge about the line of sight. For the precessing binaries, the extra information provided by higher harmonics is distributed across several parameters. We provide concrete estimates for measurement accuracy, using coordinates adapted to the <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> in the detector's sensitive band. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|Whenever a freely {{spinning}} body {{is found in}} a complex rotational state, this means that either the body is a recent victim of an impact or a tidal interaction, or is a fragment of a recently disrupted progenitor. Another factor (relevant for comets) is outgassing. Due to impacts, tidal forces and outgassing, the asteroidal and cometary precession must be a generic phenomenon: while some rotators are {{in the state of}} visible tumbling, a much larger amount of objects must be performing narrow-cone precession not so easily observable from the Earth. The internal dissipation in a freely precessing top leads to relaxation (gradual damping of the precession) and sometimes to spontaneous changes in the rotation axis. Recently developed theory of dissipative precession of a rigid body reveals that this is a highly nonlinear process: while the body is precessing at an angular rate ω, the precession-caused stresses and strains in the body contain components oscillating at other frequencies. Dependent upon the spin state, those frequencies may be higher or, most remarkably, lower than the precession rate. In many states dissipation at the harmonics is comparable to or even exceeds that at the principal frequency. For this and other reasons, in many spin states the damping of asteroidal and cometary wobble happens faster, by several orders, than believed previously. This makes it possible to measure the precession-damping rate. The narrowing of the <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> through the period of about a year can be registered by the currently available spacecraft-based observational means. However, in the near-separatrix spin states a precessing rotator can considerably slow down its relaxation. Comment: 21 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|VLBI {{observations}} {{have shown}} that the parsec-jet of 3 C 345 is formed by several components, ejected from the core with superluminal velocities and travelling along bent trajectories on the plane of the sky. We interpret the differences in velocity and position angle among the different features at formation time as the result of parsec-scale precession of the relativistic jet and calculate the aperture angle of the <b>precession</b> <b>cone,</b> the angle between the cone axis and the line of sight and the Lorentz factor associated with the jet bulk motion. We assumed a precession period of 10. 1 yr, {{which is one of the}} B-band light curve long-term periods reported in the literature. We propose that boosting of the underlying jet emission, which is time-dependent due to precession, is responsible for this long-term optical variability. Jet precession with periods of several years can be produced in super-massive black hole binary systems, when the secondary black hole is in an orbit non-coplanar with the primary accretion disk, inducing torques in the inner parts of the disk. Assuming that this mechanism is responsible for the jet precession in 3 C 345, we estimate upper and lower limits for the masses of the two black holes, as well as their mean separation. We found a correlation between the formation of jet components and the occurrence of strong optical flares, as well as a very strong anti-correlation between the intensity of these flares and the time required for the components to reach the maximum flux density at radio frequencies.

40|$|Context: In 2004, {{changes in}} the radio {{morphology}} of the Be/X-ray binary system LSI+ 61303 suggested {{that it is a}} precessing microquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed throughout the entire orbit of the system were not used to study its precession because the changes in radio morphology could tentatively be explained by the alternative pulsar model. However, a recent radio spectral index data analysis has confirmed the predictions of the two-peak microquasar model, which therefore does apply in LSI+ 61303. Aims: We revisit the set of VLBA observations performed throughout the orbit to determine the precession period and improve our understanding of the physical mechanism behind the precession. Methods: By reanalyzing the VLBA data set, we improve the dynamic range of images by a factor of four, using self-calibration. Different fitting techniques are used and compared to determine the peak positions in phase-referenced maps. Results: The improved dynamic range shows that in addition to the images with a one-sided structure, there are several images with a double-sided structure. The astrometry indicates that the peak in consecutive images for the whole set of observations describes a well-defined ellipse, 6 - 7 times larger than the orbit, with a period of about 28 d. Conclusions: A double-sided structure is not expected to be formed from the expanding shocked wind predicted in the pulsar scenario. In contrast, a precessing microquasar model can explain the double- and one-sided structures in terms of variable Doppler boosting. The ellipse defined by the astrometry could be the cross-section of the <b>precession</b> <b>cone,</b> at the distance of the 8. 4 GHz-core of the steady jet, and 28 d the precession period.

40|$|LSI+ 61303 {{is one of}} the few GeV- and TeV-emitting X-ray {{binaries}} with a prominent, well-studied modulated {{radio and}} gamma-ray emission. Changes in its radio morphology suggested in the past the hypothesis of a precessing microquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed all around the orbit were not used to study the precession because the souce was explained in the context of the pulsar model, the alternative model for this system. However, a successive radio spectral index analysis has confirmed the predictions of the microquasar scenario in LSI+ 61303. At the light of these results we reanalysed the set of VLBA observations that constitutes a unique tool to determine the precession period and render a better understanding of the physical mechanism behind the precession. We improved the dynamic range of the images by a factor of four using self-calibration, and the self-calibrated maps reveal, in six out of ten images, a double-sided structure. The double-sided structure has variable position angle and switches at some epochs to a one-sided structure. These variations indicate a scenario where the precessing jet, inducing variable Doppler boosting, points close to our line of sight - a microblazar, the galactic version of the extra-galactic blazars. High energy observations of LSI+ 61303 are consistent with the microblazar nature of this object. Moreover, we suggest in LSI+ 61303 the first case of core shift effect observed in a microquasar. Because of this effect, well known in AGN, the cm-core of the jet is rather displaced from the system center. In LSI+ 61303, the cm-core of the jet traces a large ellipse, 7 times larger than the orbit, in a period of about 28 d.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a multiwavelength {{campaign}} during which BL Lac was observed at 17 regular epochs from 1998. 23 to 2001. 28. We used the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) in an observing mode sensitive to linear polarization at wavelength 7 mm with a resolution of the order of 0. 2 mas. For the first time such observations were complemented by near-simultaneous polarization-sensitive James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) observations at a wavelength close to 1 mm. Optical polarimetry was also obtained for the final year of observations. The VLBA images reveal a remarkable oscillating ‘nozzle’ structure with a period of ∼ 2 yr. The orientation of the nozzle tracks the polarization position angle measured at the JCMT, in which we detect a very similar period. We argue that these results require the same jet direction at the small scale probed by the 1 -mm emission as at the larger scale probed by the 7 -mm emission; {{there is no evidence to}} suggest wiggling of the jet between these scales. The picture that emerges is of a straight but precessing jet where the components form a straight line near the core, but form an apparently curved locus at larger separations where components were ejected in different directions. Two further lines of evidence support this view. First, tracing the evolution of bright components showed straight paths and ejection angles consistent with the nozzle direction at the ejection time. Secondly, a simple model of a precessing nozzle was used to predict the inner jet structure. At most epochs the agreement between the model and data was good. On angular scales > 2 mas from the core a transition occurs and most components bend to follow the usual southeasterly direction on deca-milliarcsecond scales. This precession is clearly analogous to that found in the galactic jet source SS 433 albeit with a higher jet speed and a smaller <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> opening angle.

40|$|Whenever a freely {{spinning}} body {{is found in}} a complex rotational state, this means that either the body experienced some interaction within its relaxation-time span, or that it was recently "prepared'' in a non-principal state. Both options are encountered in astronomy where a wobbling rotator is either a recent victim of an impact or a tidal interaction, or is a fragment of a disrupted progenitor. Another factor (relevant for comets) is outgassing. By now, the optical and radar observational programmes have disclosed that complex rotation is hardly a rare phenomenon among the small bodies. Due to impacts, tidal forces and outgassing, the asteroidal and cometary precession must be a generic phenomenon: while some rotators are {{in the state of}} visible tumbling, a much larger amount of objects must be performing narrow-cone precession not so easily observable from the Earth. The internal dissipation in a freely precessing top leads to relaxation (gradual damping of the precession) and sometimes to spontaneous changes in the rotation axis. Recently developed theory of dissipative precession of a rigid body reveals that this is a highly nonlinear process: while the body is precessing at an angular rate, the precession-caused stresses and strains in the body contain components oscillating at other frequencies. Dependent upon the spin state, those frequencies may be higher or, most remarkably, lower than the precession rate. In many states dissipation at the harmonics is comparable to or even exceeds that at the principal frequency. For this and other reasons, in many spin states the damping of asteroidal and cometary wobble happens faster, by several orders, than believed previously. This makes it possible to measure the precession-damping rate. The narrowing of the <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> through the period of about a year can be registered by the currently available spacecraft-based observational means. We propose an appropriate observational scheme that could be accomplished by comet and asteroid-aimed missions. Improved understanding of damping of excited rotation will directly enhance understanding of the current distribution of small-body spin states. It also will constrain the structure and composition of excited rotators. However, in the near-separatrix spin states a precessing rotator can considerably slow down its relaxation. This lingering effect is similar to the one discovered in 1968 by Russian spacecraft engineers who studied free wobble of a tank with viscous fuel...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2016. Major: Physics. Advisor: Paul Crowell. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 119 pages. This thesis describes dynamical phenomena occurring in ferromagnet (FM) /n-GaAs heterostructures, while the ferromagnet is driven to resonance (FMR). The relevant work {{was published in}} Appl. Phys. Lett. 105, 212401 (2014) and Nature Communications 7, 10296 (2016), respectively. In a FM/n-GaAs heterostructure, strong spin-orbit coupling at the FM/n-GaAs interface leads to a tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) effect, which makes the resistance across the FM/n-GaAs interface depend on {{the orientation of the}} magnetization relative to the crystalline axes. When the FM is driven on resonance, the magnetization starts to precess around an effective magnetic field with an elliptical trajectory. Because of the TAMR effect, the onset of FMR modulates the tunneling resistance across the FM/n-GaAs interface, enabling electrical detection of FMR. I demonstrate that through the TAMR mechanism, the FMR <b>precession</b> <b>cone</b> angles can be characterized quantitatively. This study shows that the TAMR effect plays a predominant role in producing a dc voltage in FM/n-GaAs heterostructures at FMR, which has {{to be taken into account}} when studying the FMR-induced phenomena in similar systems. When a large forward bias current is applied across the FM/n-GaAs interface, a spin accumulation can be generated in the n-GaAs. I show that, in this spin accumulation regime, FMR can be used to detect the spin accumulation. This technique utilizes the fact that at FMR, the magnetization can precess at a frequency faster than the electron spin decay rate in the n-GaAs. The electrical signal from a FM, in measuring the electrochemical potential of a spin accumulation in the n-GaAs, depends on the relative angle between the magnetization vector in the FM and the spin accumulation in the semiconductor. Traditionally, to detect the spin accumulation, one applies a perpendicular magnetic field to let the spins in the semiconductor precess (the Hanle effect) or an in-plane magnetic field to switch the direction of the magnetizations (spin valve measurement). Neither one works well at room temperature in n-GaAs due to the significant decrease of spin lifetime as temperature increases. In my experiment, the magnetization is forced to precess at the FMR frequency, which is faster than the decay rate of spins in the n-GaAs. Once spins are injected from the precessing magnetization of the FM into the n-GaAs, they precess at a much lower frequency due to the different effective magnetic fields and electron g-factors of FM and n GaAs. This difference in precession frequency creates a phase angle between the magnetization vector in the FM and the spins in the n-GaAs, which enables an effective detection of spin accumulation. My modeling shows that this FMR technique provides a new way to determine the spin lifetime by measuring the FMR frequency dependence of the spin signal, which is verified experimentally, and the spin lifetime is measured at room temperature. The FMR-spin detection technique developed in this work can be applied to other systems in which spin lifetimes are short, such as metals and perhaps topological insulators...|$|E
