40|$|The {{provisions}} of Art. 50 point 2 and Art. 52 para. 1 of the Act of 2 July 2004 on {{the freedom of}} economic activity refer to the “guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of activity under concession” without determining, however, what such guarantee should really contain. This paper {{is an attempt to}} establish the meaning of the above term and this will be made based on other acts regulating activities under concession. It will also determine whether the provision of a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of an activity under concession is identical with the satisfaction of the requirements needed to be fulfi lled in order to obtain a concession. Consequently, an analysis of the {{provisions of}} different acts regulating specifi c matters determining the conditions necessary to be met in order to conduct an economic activity has been made, including the provisions of other acts in which a concept of a “guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of economic activity” has been used. The above analysis allows to draw a conclusion that the granting of a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of activity under concession cannot be treated as satisfying the requirements of conducting economic activity, otherwise each entrepreneur satisfying the requirements of needed to conduct economic activity would be regarded as also giving a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance.</b> What is more, giving a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> does not apply to activities under concession only. However, guarantees of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> in other types of economic activity are rare. Giving a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of activity under concession means guaranteeing that the activity will also be properly performed in the future. A characteristic feature of an activity conducted under concession is that the future is predicted based on the actual state of affairs ascertaining satisfaction of the requirements of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of an economic activity. Deliberations on a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of economic activity may be carried out {{in the context of a}} guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of a given profession. This is done in the second part of the paper. However, it must be noted that not all elements identifi ed in judicial decisions as those constituting a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of a profession, may be directly referred to when it comes to the performance of an economic activity. Professional ethic or the moral qualities of an entrepreneur may not constitute a premise indicating the absence of a guarantee of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of a concession activity...|$|R
40|$|Many moving {{mechanical}} assemblies (MMA) for space mechanisms rely on liquid lubricants to provide reliable, long-term <b>performance.</b> The <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of the MMA {{is critical in}} assuring a successful mission. Historically, mission lifetimes were short and MMA duty cycles were minimal. As mission lifetimes were extended, other components, such as batteries and computers, failed before lubricated systems. However, improvements in these ancillary systems {{over the last decade}} have left the tribological systems of the MMAs as the limiting factor in determining spacecraft reliability. Typically, MMAs are initially lubricated with a very small charge that is supposed to last the entire mission lifetime, often well in excess of 5 years. In many cases, the premature failure of a lubricated component can result in mission failure...|$|R

50|$|Most {{contracts}} are not breached. The {{primary means of}} termination is by due and full and <b>proper</b> <b>performance,</b> which is usually rendered by the person on whom the duty to perform is imposed. The effect of <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> or payment is to release the party concerned from his contractual obligation. Payment is the delivery of what is owed by a person competent to deliver to a person competent to receive. When made, it operates to discharge the obligation of the debtor. <b>Proper</b> <b>performance</b> of a party's obligation discharges not only that obligation but also any obligations accessory to it, such as contracts of suretyship and pledge.|$|R

The common {{load shedding}} methods are based on measuring the frequency first derivative; therefore, an error in measurement process can highly affect their <b>performance.</b> Also, for <b>proper</b> <b>performance</b> of these load shedding schemes, the exact value of some parameters of power system is needed. Any error in estimation of these parameters reduces the reliability of these load shedding schemes. In this paper, an underfrequency load shedding method based on the forecast minimum frequency of system is proposed. In this method, the samples of the power system frequency are taken after disturbance; then, particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to forecast the minimum frequency based on these samples. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed load shedding scheme, its performance has been compared with a newly suggested method...|$|R
