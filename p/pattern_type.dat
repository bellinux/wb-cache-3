25|$|Yuan poetry {{refers to}} those types or styles of poetry {{particularly}} {{associated with the}} era of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), in China. Although the poetic forms of past literature were continued, the Yuan period is particularly known {{for the development of the}} poetic aspects included in the complex mix of different art forms which characterize Chinese opera, namely the qu or fixed-tone <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> of verses that were delivered by the actors of these shows. Although the language of Yuan poetry is still generally considered to be Classical Chinese, a certain vernacular aspect reflecting linguistic changes can be seen in some of the fixed-rhythm verse forms, such as Yuan ci and qu. Certain aspects of Yuan poetry can be understood in the context of the social and political changes which took place as part of the process of the Mongol conquest of the Jin and Song Dynasties and their subsequent establishment of the Yuan dynasty.|$|E

But still, he is a man, and meant as a pattern to men; the new Adam; the new <b>pattern,</b> <b>type,</b> and ideal for all mankind. Him, says St. Paul,--that is, his likeness,--we are to put on, that as he was after the likeness of God, so may we be likewise.|$|E

40|$|To {{classify}} Listeria monocytogenes using taxonomic characters {{derived from}} the rRNA operons and their flanking sequences, we studied a sample of 1346 strains within the taxon. DNA from each strain was digested with a restriction endonuclease, EcoRI. The fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis, immobilized on a membrane, and hybridized with a labeled rRNA operon from Escherichia coli. The pattern of bands, positions, and intensities of hybridized fragments were electronically captured. Software was used to normalize the band positions relative to standards, scale the signal intensity, and reduce the background so that each strain was reproducibly represented in a data base as a pattern. With these methods, L. monocytogenes was resolved into 50 <b>pattern</b> <b>types</b> differing in the length {{of at least one}} polymorphic fragment. <b>Pattern</b> <b>types</b> representing multiple strains were recorded as the mathematical average of the strain <b>patterns.</b> <b>Pattern</b> <b>types</b> were arranged by size polymorphisms of assigned rRNA regions into subsets, which revealed the branching genetic structure of the species. Subtracting the polymorphic variants of a specific assigned region from the <b>pattern</b> <b>types</b> and averaging the types within each subset resulted in reduced sets of conserved fragments {{that could be used to}} recognize strains of the species. <b>Pattern</b> <b>types</b> and reduced sets of conserved fragments were conserved among different strains of L. monocytogenes but were not observed in total among strains of other species...|$|R

30|$|Why {{might we}} not expect {{holistic}} processing? One common feature of domains of expertise that have shown holistic processing {{is that they}} require people to individuate objects, which often involves learning names of individuals (Chua, Richler, & Gauthier, 2015; Wong, Palmeri, & Gauthier, 2009). Naming is {{a natural part of}} many forms of expertise (e.g. car or bird experts or familiar face recognition). However, fingerprints are rarely named, other than broad classifications based on their overall <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> (e.g. whorl or arch). The present experiments use an over-learned stimulus set (at least for experts) for which naming is not an integral component of their expert behavior. We avoid any broad naming based on <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> because when we changed one or both halves of the image, we always replaced the half with the same <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> (left or right loop); naming at the <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> level could not contribute to performance in our task.|$|E
40|$|Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) sulcogyral {{patterns}} are stable morphological variations established early in life. They consist of three distinct pattern types, with Type III in particular {{being associated with}} poor regulatory control (e. g., high sensation seeking and negative emotionality, low constraint), which may confer risk for earlier onset of cannabis (CB) use and greater use in later life. The OFC sulcogyral pattern may therefore be a stable trait marker in understanding individual differences in substance-use vulnerability and associated affective disturbances in users. In a large multisite cross-sectional study, we compared OFC <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> distribution between 128 healthy controls (HC) and 146 CB users. Within users (n = 140), we explored the association between OFC <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> and CB use level, and subsequently if level of CB use informed by OFC <b>pattern</b> <b>type</b> may mediate disturbances in affective tone, as indexed by depressive symptoms. While OFC pattern distribution did not distinguish between HC and CB groups, it informed greater lifetime use within users. Specifically, CB users with <b>pattern</b> <b>Type</b> III in the right OFC tended to use more CB over their lifetime, than did CB users with <b>pattern</b> <b>Type</b> I or II. Greater lifetime CB use was subsequently associated with higher depressive symptoms, such that it mediated an indirect association between right OFC <b>pattern</b> <b>Type</b> III and higher depressive symptoms. The present study provides evidence for neurobiological differences, specifically sulcogyral pattern of the OFC, to modulate level of CB use, which may subsequently influence the expression of depressive symptom...|$|E
