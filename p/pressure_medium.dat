50|$|The overall {{shape of}} the sample {{assembly}} is a cube (typically around 6mm), this shape allows {{for each of the}} 6 anvils to make contact with each face of the sample assembly. The outer portion of the sample assembly is the <b>pressure</b> <b>medium,</b> which is commonly either boron epoxy (BE) or mullite. The choice of <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> used in the sample assembly depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment. Boron epoxy is a self gasketing material in the D-DIA, which means it can produce a seal between all the anvils during deformation, but it has been shown to impart a significant amount of water to the sample during the experiment. This added water to the sample makes it impossible to conduct rheology experiments under anhydrous conditions. The other <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> material, mullite, leaves the sample very dry, but does not have the ability to self-gasket in the D-DIA. For this reason, when mullite is used as a <b>pressure</b> <b>medium</b> it needs to be used in combination with a gasket material. Typically the gasket material used is pyrophyllite, and the mullite will be machined into a sphere which sits in pyrophyllite “seats”, forming a cube.|$|E

This modified DIA multi-anvil system is used with a hydraulic press that generates loads of up to 1000 tons and is the first multi-anvil press installed for geoscience research in Taiwan. In this paper, the geometry of the high-pressure apparatus is briefly described and the pressure calibration performed in the press is reported. The thermal behaviors of various <b>pressure</b> <b>mediums,</b> boron-epoxy, zirconia, and mullite, are also compared. Pressure calibrations at room temperature were performed with different cell designs, paying {{special attention to the}} so called ¡§D¡¨ factor, which is defined as the ratio of diagonal length of the cell assembly cube to the diameter of the cavity hole. For a given cell design, the sample-pressure efficiency for the three materials examined was similar. Calibrations with different cell designs showed that increasing the ¡§D¡¨ value results in greater pressure generation efficiency. By comparing the deformation behavior at high temperatures (up to 1200 °C), the semi-sintered mullite and zirconia appeared to be better <b>pressure</b> <b>mediums</b> compared to boron-epoxy...|$|R

A thin metal foil is pre-compressed {{between the two}} diamonds and a small hole is drilled in the center to create the sample chamber. In most cases, stainless steel is an acceptable material for the foil, but an incompressible rhenium foil is required for experiments involving extremely high pressures. The sample is held together with a few micron-sized chips of ruby, which are used as pressure gauge, and a <b>pressure</b> transmitting <b>medium</b> is loaded into {{the hole in the}} gasket. For the <b>pressure</b> transmitting <b>medium,</b> silicone oil (a mixture of polysiloxane chains with methyl and phenyl groups), or methanol and ethanol mixture are popular.

50|$|Air {{bags are}} also used by rescuers to lift heavy objects up to help victims who are trapped under those objects. There are three main types of lifting bags for rescue: high <b>{{pressure}},</b> <b>medium</b> pressure and low pressure systems. Low-pressure bags are operated at 7.25 psi for high vertical lift in a large surface area but lower lifting capacities. Medium-pressure bags are operated at 15 psi. High-pressure bags which have higher lifting capacities are operated at pressure between 90 and 145 psi. Two air bags can be stacked together to provide a higher lift. It is recommended that {{no more than two}} bags {{can be used in a}} stacked configuration, the bigger bag must be the bottom one, and no other objects are inserted between the stacked bags. Incorrect use of stacked bags may result in a bag (or other objects) shooting out to create a dangerous projectile.|$|E

50|$|The main {{components}} of the piston-cylinder apparatus (Fig. 1) are the pressure generating system, the pressure vessel, and the assembly parts within the vessel. There {{are two types of}} piston-cylinder apparatus: non end-loaded and end-loaded, which involve, respectively, one or two hydraulic rams. In the end-loaded type the second hydraulic ram is used to vertically load and strengthen the pressure vessel. The non end-loaded type is smaller, more compact and cheaper, and is operable only to approximately 4 GPa.Pressure is applied to the sample by pressing a piston into the sample volume of the pressure vessel. The sample assembly consists of a solid <b>pressure</b> <b>medium,</b> a resistance heater and a small central volume for the sample. Three common configurations are used: ”, ” and 1”, which are the diameters of the piston and thus the sample assembly. According to the pressure amplification concept, the choice of the piston depends on the pressure you need to achieve.During the experiment, water circulates around the pressure vessel, the bridge and the upper plates to cool the system.|$|E
50|$|A Griggs {{apparatus}} has {{the ability}} to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand operated lever pump or a servo controlled syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (σ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug {{at the top of the}} sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl <b>pressure</b> <b>medium.</b> Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10−3sec-1 down to 10−8sec-1. To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a recirculating ball screw is located in between the gear set and deformation piston (σ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (σ1). The outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram.|$|E

Tightly interwoven with the main story, the subplot plays in the milieu of the Swiss city of Zürich, and the advances of the brutal and corrupt city police officer Scatamacchia (Hans Heinz Moser) against a hostess allow a very personal view on Scandurat (Bruce Myers), Gardella's business partner and close friend.

40|$|Helium is {{commonly}} used as a <b>pressure</b> transmitting <b>medium</b> to render the sample pressure hydrostatic in high pressure experiments with diamond anvil cells. On solidification under pressure helium begins to develop strength that is characteristic of any solid. The estimation of the compressive strength of helium {{as a function of}} pressure is important as it helps in estimating the nonhydrostatic stresses that can develop in the sample even when it remains immersed in helium <b>pressure</b> transmitting <b>medium.</b> The x-ray diffraction data on polycrystalline samples obtained with the radial diffraction geometry are commonly used to determine the compressive strength of solids. This method fails in the case of helium because of its low scattering power. The nonhydrostatic stresses that develop in crystalline solids immersed in helium <b>pressure</b> transmitting <b>medium</b> were used to estimate the strength of helium. The diffraction data available in the literature were selected for this study. It was important for this study to consider the data from the experiments that were conducted ensuring that the samples did not come in contact with the anvils.

The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms.
