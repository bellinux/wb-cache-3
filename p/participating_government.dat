The NSG's decision came after three days of intense U.S. diplomacy. The approval was based on a formal pledge by India stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons. The pledge was contained in a crucial statement issued during the NSG meeting by India outlining the country's disarmament and nonproliferation policies.|$|R

Germany was reunited in 1990 while Czechoslovakia broke {{up into the}} Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. Twelve more nations joined up to 1990.

5000|$|Before {{the end of}} this period, a {{selection}} of about 50 scientists within each Working Group produces a first draft [...] "Summary for policymakers" [...] (SPM) summarizing its section of the full assessment report. This first draft SPM is sent for comments to the <b>participating</b> <b>government.</b> Comments are taken into account in a second draft prepared by the scientists. When the full assessment report is finalized, each second draft SPM is then reviewed during a four days plenary session comprising government delegations and observer organizations. Each reviewing session is chaired by the scientists chairing the Working Group, surrounded by a panel of scientists. The government delegations usually consist of one to six delegates, comprising generally a mix of national experts (some of which are part of the IPCC) and a few diplomats or other non-scientist civil servants.|$|E

The result was that the <b>participating</b> <b>governments</b> to the conference adopted the so-called Bali Road Map (BRM) which included, among others, the Bali Action Plan (BAP). In short, the BRM was a set of decisions that <b>participating</b> <b>governments</b> considered to be the way forward to confronting the climate change threats. The BAP on the other hand, called on <b>participating</b> <b>governments</b> to adopt a `shared vision´ for a long-term cooperative action on climate change.

Finally, the recently held UN conference on the climate change in Durban, South Africa, was aimed at reaching agreements on the post 2012 Kyoto Protocol commitments. The outcome of the conference known as the Durban Platform agreed on a roadmap for a legally binding international agreement to combat the climate change by 2015 and be entered into effect by 2020.

5000|$|The International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists {{was held}} between November 24 and December 21, 1898 {{following}} {{the assassination of}} Empress Elisabeth of Austria by Luigi Lucheni on the promenade of Lake Geneva on September 10, 1898. Fifty-four delegates attended from 21 different countries. Every <b>participating</b> <b>government</b> agreed to set up special organizations for the surveillance of those suspected of anarchism, defined as [...] "any act that used violent means to destroy the organization of society" [...] although that definition was mere propaganda. In fact, anarchism is a political ideology which emerged from the nineteenth century socialist movement, advocating the abolition of hierarchical class society and its replacement with a self-consciously anti-hierarchical socialist society. While it has historically included violent tendencies (such as insurrectionist anarchism with its advocation of [...] "propaganda by the deed"), it also includes non-violent elements, with {{the bulk of the}} movement taking a more moderate position on the use of violence for revolutionary purposes between these two extremes.|$|E
50|$|Precondition for {{resettlement}} is to {{be registered}} as a refugee with the UNHCR and to have undergone the Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process based on the 1951 Refugee Convention refugee definition. Among those refugees the UNHCR or other organisations (e.g. RefugePoint or HIAS) make referrals for resettlement if they identify {{a high level of}} risk and vulnerability whilst being in the first country of asylum. Selection procedures can vary between UNHCR offices. If {{one or more of the}} above criteria are met it still needs to be assessed whether third country resettlement is the most appropriate durable solution compared to voluntary return and local integration. After the refugees are referred for resettlement and agree to be resettled they are suggested to suitable countries that run resettlement programmes. Each <b>participating</b> <b>government</b> can select from the referrals and refugees themselves cannot choose their country of resettlement. Even though receiving countries should not select refugees according to their own criteria, it may be that societal and political desires influence which groups of refugees are received. Countries make their decisions based on either just a dossier or following an interview with the refugee.|$|E
