40|$|The billing {{process of}} {{electricity}} consumption {{which we are}} using at present is very long process and requires lot of man power. The energy billing in India is error prone and also time and labor consuming. Errors get introduced at every stage of energy billing like errors with electro-mechanical meters, human errors while noting down the meter reading and error while <b>processing</b> the paid <b>bills</b> and the due bills. There are many cases where the bill is paid and then is shown as a due amount in the next bill. There is no proper way to know the consumer's maximum demand, usage details, losses in the lines, and power theft. For overcoming all the difficulties present in the system we are introducing fully automated billing process. In the proposed system front end is user friendly and can be operated easily by having minimum computer knowledge. The billing process is prepaid energy billing, which could be titled.

When the state of California mandated that all water systems reduce usage by 20 percent in 2009, SMWC implemented an initiative to replace its existing metering system with Mueller Systems' Hot Rod AMR System. The amount of time spent collecting meter reads was reduced from six days to four hours, and consumption within SMWC's service area dropped by 22 percent, largely due to the AMR system's real-time monitoring that can detect leaks earlier and provide more detailed usage data to both SMWC and its customers.|$|R

The energy billing system used nowadays are labor and time consuming. There is no proper way to know the consumer's maximum demand, usage details. This paper presents a prepaid energy meter to facilitate energy consumption measurement and to know consumer’s maximum demand. The major components are PIC microcontroller, Voltage and Current transformer, Precision rectifier, Zero Crossing Detector, Logical Circuit and GSM. This paper demonstrates the use of prepaid energy meter system. If we use this system it will be beneficial for the consumer to manage power. It is easy to operate and cost effective. Another advantage of the prepaid system is that the human errors in taking meter readings and <b>processing</b> <b>bills</b> can be reduced to a large extent.

40|$|Offshoring – {{the process}} of {{migration}} of productive tasks to low-cost countries – is understood as the evolution of international sourcing strategy: a multi-phased development process, which reflects a gradual evolution of sourcing from domestic purchasing to global sources (Monckca and Trent, 1991). Traditionally, offshoring has been confined to manufacturing tasks and simple tasks such as back office (order <b>processing,</b> <b>billing</b> accounts, payroll <b>processing)</b> and customer service (call centers, on-line customer service, telemarketing). More recently, Western firms have extended this practice to more complex, knowledge-intensive tasks (e. g.

The aim of the symposium is to illustrate the organizational and strategic implications of the offshoring of intangibles. As the shift from simple tasks to complex, knowledge-intensive tasks entails a redefinition of firm’s sourcing strategies in terms of division of labor for innovation, presenters will illustrate and discuss (a) the geography of offshoring, (b) organizational capabilities that firms develop to effectively manage offshoring of intangibles, and (c) the contingencies (context- and task-specific) that affect offshoring processes.

40|$|Handwritten Digit Recognition System {{involves}} {{reception and}} interpretation of handwritten digits by a machine. Due to variation in shape and orientation of handwritten digits, {{it is difficult for}} a machine to interpret handwritten digits. Handwritten digit Recognition has a wide area of research due to its vast applications like automatic bank cheques <b>processing,</b> <b>billing</b> and automatic postal service. In this thesis, an Offline Handwritten Digit Recognition System is presented. The recognition system is broadly divided into 2 parts, first part is feature extraction from handwritten images and the second one is classification of feature vector into digits. We propose descriptors for handwritten digit recognition based on Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature. It is one of the widely used feature vector for object detection in computer vision. For classification of features, linear Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) Classifier is proposed. This is a binary class classifier which is further converted to a 10 class classifier by means of One against all algorithm. Due to small training time, PSVM classifier is preferable over standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. The handwritten images both for training and testing are taken from MNIST database. The performance of the system is measured in terms of Sensitivity, Accuracy, Positive Predictivity and Specificity. The performance of PSVM classifier is better compared to Artificial Neural Network(ANN) ...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe paper {{focuses on}} the role of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) in the {{national}} legislative process. An enquiry into the relevance of the NCOP when <b>processing</b> <b>bills</b> during the Third Parliament has been critical when reviewing this role. The paper studied all the bills processed by Parliament with particular interest in the amendments proposed by the NCOP. The legislative framework in which the NCOP functions was critical to determine whether it enables this institution to adequately fulfill this role. The objective of this paper was to assess whether or not the NCOP fulfills its constitutional role of representing provincial interests in the national legislative process. The paper has uncovered the following regarding the NCOP’s role in the national legislative process. • The NCOP role varies according to the different pieces of legislation it is considering. This means that the manner in which it processes and passes ordinary bills affecting provinces will be different from the way it considers those bills not affecting provinces. • The NCOP has thorough consultative process on bills affecting provinces, compared to the superficial role it plays on bills not affecting provinces. More ordinary bills not affecting provinces have been processed by Parliament; however, the NCOP has proposed more amendments to the minority of bills affecting provinces. • The electoral system of South Africa has weakened the caliber of delegates in the NCOP. This has unintended consequences on the strength of the NCOP as an institution to abide by its decisions or to challenge the National Assembly when there are disagreements. • The NCOP may be misguided about its role at times and not strategically situated to focus on matters of provincial competence. x The paper argues that the NCOP remains relevant and has achieved its constitutional mandate of representing the interests of provinces. However, more work needs to be done to ascertain a common view of what constitutes provincial interests. Furthermore, the NCOP should confine its scope to matters of provincial competence. Thus the small number of delegates will be focused on the issues that reflect the core mandate of this institution...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{business}} processes are rarely accomplished inside the companies domains. More often they involve entities geographically distributed which interact in a loosely coupled cooperation. While cooperating, these entities generate transactional data streams, such as sequences of stock-market buy/sell orders, credit-card purchase records, Web server entries, and electronic fund transfer orders. Such streams are often collections of events stored and processed locally, and they thus have typically ad-hoc, heterogeneous formats. On the other hand, elements in such data streams usually {{share a common}} semantics and indeed they can be profitably mined {{in order to obtain}} combined global events. In this paper, we present an approach to the parsing of heterogeneous data streams based on the definition of formatdependent grammars and automatic production of adhoc parsers.
