40|$|Cell-to-cell {{communication}} in bacteria is mediated by quorum-sensing systems (QSS) that produce chemical signal molecules called autoinducers (AI). In particular, LuxS/AI- 2 -dependent QSS {{has been proposed}} {{to act as a}} universal lexicon that mediates intra- and interspecific bacterial behavior. Here we report that the model organism Bacillus subtilis operates a luxS-dependent QSS that regulates its morphogenesis and social behavior. We demonstrated that B. subtilis luxS is a growth-phase-regulated gene that produces active AI- 2 able to mediate the interspecific activation of light production in Vibrio harveyi. We demonstrated that in B. subtilis, luxS expression was under the control of a novel AI- 2 -dependent negative regulatory feedback loop that indicated an important role for AI- 2 as a signaling molecule. Even though luxS did not affect spore development, AI- 2 production was negatively regulated by the master regulatory proteins of <b>pluricellular</b> behavior, SinR and Spo 0 A. Interestingly, wild B. subtilis cells, from the undomesticated and probiotic B. subtilis natto strain, required the LuxS-dependent QSS to form robust and differentiated biofilms and also to swarm on solid surfaces. Furthermore, LuxS activity was required for the formation of sophisticated aerial colonies that behaved as giant fruiting bodies where AI- 2 production and spore morphogenesis were spatially regulated at different sites of the developing colony. We proposed that LuxS/AI- 2 constitutes a novel form of quorum-sensing regulation where AI- 2 behaves as a morphogen-like molecule that coordinates the social and <b>pluricellular</b> behavior of B. subtilis...|$|E

40|$|Adventitious rooting {{might be}} induced in {{recalcitrant}} woody genotypes by infection with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, and, in some cases, might also require exogenous auxin. The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine how agrobacteria trigger root formation in the stem of a recalcitrant woody microcutting, which cytological events result from the combined presence of infection and exogenous auxin, and which types of roots are induced by infection. Microcuttings of a recalcitrant walnut (Fuglans regia), infected or not with A. rhizogenes strain 1855, were cultured with either indolebutyric acid (IBA), IAA, or without exogenous hormones, to induce rhizogenesis. They were cytohistologically and ultrastructurally investigated at various times in culture. Southern blot and PCR analyses were performed to verify the frequency of transgenic, chimeric and bacterium-containing roots. The infection was sufficient per se to stimulate rhizogenesis. Rooting on the infected cuttings was enhanced by exogenous IBA, which accelerated and increased root meristemoid formation, in comparison with without hormone treatment. Meristemoids were organized both directly by the cambial cells and indirectly by the callus, and showed a <b>pluricellular</b> origin. Inter and intracellular bacteria were observed in the stem throughout the culture period (30 d). They were preferentially present in the vessels, and mainly in those showing polyphenol deposition. In the infected IAA-treated cultures, a high level of secondary xylem formation occurred instead of rhizogenesis. Nontransformed roots were preferentially produced by the infected cuttings treated with the auxins. Bacterium-containing and chimeric roots were produced by infected cuttings independently of the treatment. Thus, in a recalcitrant walnut, nontransformed root meristemoids are stimulated by combining infection and exogenous indolebutyric acid. Furthermore, the persistence of bacteria in the stem during the culture and the <b>pluricellular</b> origin of the meristemoids explain the presence of the bacterium-containing and chimeric roots...|$|E

Las células epidérmicas de la hoja del esporofito tienen paredes laterales onduladas en las superficies dorsal y ventral. The {{development of}} the gametophytic phase of Microgramma nitida is described based on spore samples that was obtained of fertil specimens gathered on Veracruz State, Mexico.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is a key}} process {{for the defense of}} <b>pluricellular</b> organisms against pathogens, and it involves a set of surface receptors acting in an ordered fashion to contribute directionality to the movement. Among these receptors are the integrins, which connect the cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix components, thus playing a central role in cell migration. Integrin clustering at focal adhesions drives actin polymerization along the cell leading edge, resulting in polarity of cell movement. Therefore, small integrin-binding proteins such as the snake venom disintegrins that inhibit integrin-mediated cell adhesion are expected to inhibit cell migration.

On the other hand, regulation of PCD is mainly given by the Bcl- 2 family members, which are in turn essentially regulated by activation of death receptors and/or DNA damage.

40|$|International audienceThe leading {{front of}} a collectively {{migrating}} epithelium often destabilizes into multicellular migration fingers where a cell initially similar to the others becomes a leader cell while its neighbours do not alter.

However, an accurate dynamic cartography of both mechanical and biochemical activities remains to be established. Here, by mapping the mechanical traction forces exerted on the surface by MDCK migration fingers, we show that these structures are mechanical global entities with the leader cells exerting a large traction force. Moreover, the spatial distribution of RhoA differential activity at the basal plane strikingly mirrors this force cartography. We propose that RhoA controls the development of these fingers through mechanical cues: the leader cell drags the structure and the peripheral <b>pluricellular</b> acto-myosin cable prevents the initiation of new leader cells...|$|E

However, in vitro, adhesion of the cells to their substrate favors a closure mechanism mediated by lamellipodial protrusions, which has prevented a systematic study of the purse-string mechanism. Here, we show that monolayers can cover well-controlled mesoscopic nonadherent areas much larger than a cell size by purse-string closure and that active epithelial fluctuations are required for this process. We have formulated a simple stochastic model that includes purse-string contractility, tissue fluctuations, and effective friction to qualitatively and quantitatively account for the dynamics of closure. Our data suggest that, in vivo, tissue fusion adapts to the local environment by coordinating lamellipodial protrusions and purse-string contractions...|$|E
