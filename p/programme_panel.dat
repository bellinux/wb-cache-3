40|$|Since 1999, China {{has spent}} RMB 50 billion (about US$ 7 billion) to {{implement}} the ‘Grain for Green’ programme, the largest land retirement programme in the developing world. From 1999 to 2003, over 7. 2 million hectares of agricultural land were retired under the programme. However, many farmers report {{that they did not}} receive the compensation promised under the programme in exchange for planting trees on their agricultural land. This paper examines the impacts of subsidy payment shortfalls, delayed payments and programme uncertainty on farmers’ participation in the Grain for Green programme. A stylized reputation game is used to explain how village-level corruption (subsidy underpayment), along with uncertainty regarding the likely longevity of the programme, discourage farmers’ participation in the <b>programme.</b> <b>Panel</b> data are used to estimate the impact of previous payment shortfalls on subsequent …reputation, grain for green programme, land use...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} world markets, trade {{liberalisation}} and price decontrol have left smallholder farmers {{more vulnerable to}} the vagaries of market forces. Constraints such as poor technology, weak organisational structures and high transaction costs due to long and inefficient supply chain means that smallholders cannot compete with large corporations. Collective action which has been successfully applied within natural resources management if properly institutionalised among smallholder farmers can improve their marketing in a number of ways. It can reduce transaction costs of taking produce to the market; increase the smallholders’ bargaining power and enable them to access services that private sector or government are not readily willing to investigate. This paper uses the Sub Saharan Africa Challenge <b>Programme</b> <b>panel</b> data to investigate enabling factors for collective marketing. Based on these factors the paper discusses how Integrated Agriculture Research for Development (IAR 4 D) can be fashioned to improve upon collective marketing among smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa...|$|E

A special word is said in this respect supra by Pro­ fessor Checkland, Chairman of the Systems Science Panel. The Advanced Research Institute (ARI) was organized for the purpose of bringing together senior scientists to seek a consensus on the assessment of the present state of knowledge on the specific topic of "health services systems" and to present views and recom­ mendations for future health services research directions, which should be of value to both the scientific community and the people in charge of reorienting health services. The conference was structured so as to permit the assembly of a variety of complementary viewpoints through intensive group discussions to be the basis of this final report. Invitees were selected from allover Europe and North America, including observers from the major international organizations involved in health ser­ vices research, to provide the experience and expertise necessary to make the issue of "health services systems" val id and significant...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{explanation}} of the bands of extended states appearing in random one-dimensional models with correlated disorder, focusing on the continuous random-dimer model [A. Sanchez, E. Macia, and F. Dominguez-Adame, Phys. Rev. B 49, 147 (1994) ]. We show exactly that the transmission coefficient at the resonant energy is independent of the number of host sites between two consecutive dimers. This allows us to understand why there are bands of extended states for every realization of the model as well as the dependence of the bandwidths on the concentration. We carry out a perturbative calculation that sheds more light on the above results. In the conclusion we discuss generalizations of our results to other models and possible applications which arise from insight into this problem.

40|$|The NATO Science Committee and its {{subsidiary}} Programme Panels {{provide support}} for Advanced Research Institutes (ARI) in various fields. The idea is to bring together scientists of a chosen field {{with the hope that}} they will achieve a consensus on research direc­ tions for the future, and make recommendations for the benefit of a wider scientific community. Attendance is therefore limited to those whose experience and expertise make the conclusions significant and acceptable to the wider community. Participants are {{selected on the basis of}} substantial track records in research or in the synthesis of research results to serve mankind. The proposal for a one-week ARIon Earth Observation and In­ formation Systems was initiated by the NATO Special <b>Programme</b> <b>Panel</b> on Systems Science (SPPOSS). In approving the ARI, the senior NATO Science Committee identified the subject as one of universal impor­ tance, requiring a broad perspective on the development of opera­ tional systems based on successful experimental systems. The general purpose of this ARI was to address the critical problems of integrating the relatively new science and technology of remote sensing into operational earth observation and manage­ ment information systems. The main problems of concern were those related to systems design, organization, development of infrastruc­ ture, and use of information in decision processes. The main empha­ sis was on problems of transferring technologies and methods from experimental to operational systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} behavior of disordered quantum well-based semiconductor superlattices where the disorder is intentional and short-range correlated. We show that, whereas the transmission {{time of a}} particle grows exponentially {{with the number of}} wells in an usual disordered superlattice for any value of the incident particle energy, for specific values of the incident energy this time increases linearly when correlated disorder is included. As expected, those values of the energy coincide with a narrow subband of extended states predicted by the static calculations of Domı´nguez-Adame et al. @Phys. Rev. B 51, 14 359 ~ 1994 !#; such states are seen in our dynamical results to exhibit a ballistic regime, very close to the WKB approximation of a perfect superlattice. Fourier transform of the output signal for an incident Gaussian wave packet reveals a dramatic filtering of the original signal, which makes us confident that devices based on this property may be designed and used for nanotechnological applications. This is more so in view of the possibility of controlling the output band using a dc-electric field, which we also discuss. In the conclusion we summarize our results and present an outlook for future developments arising from this work.
