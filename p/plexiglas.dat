5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, <b>Plexiglas.</b> The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, <b>Plexiglas</b> {{was used in the}} board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E
5|$|An Amshack (a small {{aluminum}} and <b>Plexiglas</b> bus shelter) with a bare asphalt platform {{was built in}} downtown Pittsfield near the former Union Station. The 'station' opened on April 26, 1981. The 1965-built station was converted to a yard office, used by Conrail and later CSX Transportation for their adjacent Pittsfield Yard.|$|E
5|$|The nine-story building's {{most notable}} feature is its translucent, {{corrugated}} sunscreens. Supported by aluminum lattices throughout the building's facade, the sunscreens {{are made of}} Rohm and Haas's principal product, <b>Plexiglas.</b> In 2007 the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today {{is considered one of}} the best examples of the International style.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{impression}} of space within the cockpit {{area and the}} great degree of visual sighting afforded by the <b>Plexiglas</b> panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good sighting.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few {{kilometres}} from the eastern base of the volcano. The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the <b>Plexiglas</b> windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|William Chalmers invented <b>Plexiglas</b> while a {{graduate}} student at McGill. In computing, MUSIC/SP, software for mainframes once popular among universities and colleges around the world, was developed at McGill. A team also contributed to the development of Archie, a pre-WWW search engine. A 3270 terminal emulator developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software. A team has developed digital musical instruments in the form of prosthesis, called Musical Prostheses.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on <b>plexiglas,</b> although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including <b>plexiglas</b> windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|With Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers {{becoming}} the ninth and tenth {{members of the}} league, the 2005–06 season began with nine clubs (Manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed). However, in November 2005 London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations. From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained {{only a very small}} fan base. The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing {{only a small number of}} games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season. The facilities were very basic, seating only 900 people with an overall capacity of barely 1000. In November 2005, during a game against Nottingham Panthers; Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boardings. Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of <b>plexiglas</b> shattered in an irregular manner, injuring a spectator. When a similar event took place during practice a few days later; the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink. With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games, the Racers were forced to suspend team operations with immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Engineers at Coleman Products Corporation in Coleman, Wisconsin, {{created a}} non-drivable <b>plexiglas</b> Gremlin as a {{demonstrator}} of the placement {{and function of}} electrical wiring harnesses.|$|E
25|$|Some P-38G {{production}} was diverted {{on the assembly}} line to F-5A reconnaissance aircraft. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the XF-5D, with a <b>plexiglas</b> nose, two machine guns and additional cameras in the tail booms.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin was}} covered almost entirely with <b>Plexiglas</b> windows {{providing}} visibility {{in all directions}} except directly underneath the aircraft. The cockpit consisted of tandem pilot and copilot stations, or the aircraft could accommodate a pilot and three passengers, or a pilot and two stretchers.|$|E
25|$|Mirror mazes, {{often found}} in {{amusement}} parks as well, contain large numbers of mirrors and sheets of glass. The idea is to navigate the disorientating array without bumping into the walls. Mirrors in attractions like this are often made of <b>Plexiglas</b> as to assure {{that they do not}} break.|$|E
25|$|Built principally from GFRP the B12 uses {{monocoque}} construction, {{avoiding the}} use of a welded steel-tube core structure, maximising the volume available for crew accommodation and payloads such as research instrumentation. The cockpit seats two in tandem under large <b>plexiglas</b> canopies with the instructor seat, in the rear, set at a higher level to improve his forward view.|$|E
25|$|Students at Akaflieg Berlin {{studied a}} {{high-performance}} motor-glider {{with the engine}} in the nose and an automatically folding propeller. After approval was given, a prototype was built in 1991, as the ' Akaflieg Berlin B13', using GFRP (glass-fibre re-inforced plastic) to form a fuselage with smooth lines, housing the engine in the nose and a two-seat side-by-side cockpit covered by a large <b>plexiglas</b> canopy.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, he {{made the}} {{television}} documentary Above the Below about his friend and collaborator David Blaine and his 44-day stunt in a park over the bank of River Thames in London inside a suspended <b>plexiglas</b> box. A documentary commissioned by Sky Television and Channel 4, it also includes jokes, visual poetry, and music. In addition, Korine has worked with Blaine {{on a number of}} Blaine's specials.|$|E
25|$|During {{the filming}} of Thunderball in 1965, Connery's life was in danger in the {{sequence}} with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special <b>Plexiglas</b> partition inside the pool, {{but this was not}} a fixed structure, and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, e.g. , the {{bremsstrahlung}} {{produced by}} shielding the beta radiation with the normally used dense materials (e.g. lead) is itself dangerous; in such cases, shielding must be accomplished with low density materials, e.g. <b>Plexiglas</b> (Lucite), plastic, wood, or water; as the atomic number is lower for these materials, {{the intensity of}} bremsstrahlung is significantly reduced but a larger thickness of shielding is required to stop the electrons (beta radiation).|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel {{developed}} an artificial heart valve. His mechanical valve {{consisted of two}} parts, a ball that {{is surrounded by a}} cage which is the first variation of the ball-in-cage valves. Originally, the cage and the ball were constructed using <b>Plexiglas.</b> Due to the noise created by the contacts between the moving ball and the cage, the ball was later changed to use silicone-coated material.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, {{with their}} heroes from 1942 dwindling (due to either age, health, or the war), the Leafs turned to lesser-known players like rookie goalie Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt. They would upset the Red Wings in the 1945 finals. In the 1946-47 NHL season, Maple Leaf Gardens {{was the first}} arena in the NHL to have <b>Plexiglas</b> {{inserted}} in the end zones of the rink.|$|E
25|$|The {{units have}} four-abreast seating, with seats {{originally}} upholstered in dark blue leather. The interior was largely covered in aluminum and brown-painted plates. The window frames {{were covered in}} aluminum. The air ducts were at first painted brown, but passengers {{had a tendency to}} rest their feet on them. They were therefore kept unpainted. The motorman's cab was sealed off with an aluminum and <b>plexiglas</b> wall, later changed to a non-translucent aluminum to avoid reflections.|$|E
25|$|Although Cage started {{painting}} in his youth, {{he gave it}} up in order to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel, dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs {{and a group of}} what Cage called plexigrams: silk screen printing on <b>plexiglas</b> panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.|$|E
25|$|The Epsilon {{is a low}} winged {{cantilever}} monoplane of all metal construction. It {{is powered}} by a Lycoming O-540 flat-six piston engine driving a two-blade propeller, and is fitted with a retractible nosewheel undercarriage. The pilot and instructor are sat in tandem under a sliding <b>Plexiglas</b> canopy, with cockpit layout designed to aid transition to the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet to which French students graduate after completing the Epsilon part of their training syllabus.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Rudolf Kaiser, the Ka-2 was an all wooden glider with {{plywood and}} {{aircraft}} fabric covering. The Ka-2s wings, with marked forward sweep and dihedral are mounted above the fuselage, flanking the rear cockpit. The front cockpit {{is covered by}} a one piece <b>plexiglas</b> canopy which opens {{to the right and}} the rear cockpit is covered by a canopy incorporating the inner leading edges of the wing, opening rear-wards, held in place by the front canopy when closed.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 1946, Maple Leaf Gardens was {{the site}} of the first game {{in the history of the}} Basketball Association of America (later to become the NBA), with the Toronto Huskies playing the New York Knickerbockers. The Huskies played their last game at the Gardens on March 28, 1947, and the {{franchise}} folded shortly thereafter. In the 1946–47 NHL season, Maple Leaf Gardens was the first arena in the NHL to have <b>Plexiglas</b> inserted in the end zones of the rink.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{a type of}} {{familiar}} silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified {{as a type of}} glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historic designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto Röhm and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by the Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark <b>Plexiglas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heintz {{migrated}} to Canada in 1973, {{and set up}} Zenair in 1974 to sell plans and kits of the Zénith. The Zenith, which gained the designation Zenith CH 200 when Heintz produced plans for larger and smaller derivatives, is a low-winged cantilever monoplane of all metal construction. The pilot and passenger sit side-by-side under a clear, sideways opening <b>plexiglas</b> canopy, while the aircraft is fitted with a fixed nosewheel undercarriage. It {{is designed to be}} powered by a single piston engine of between 85 and 160hp (63.5 and 119kW).|$|E
25|$|The Redskins had {{the number}} 21 {{painted on the}} field, at a parking lot {{entrance}} and in the Redskins Ring of Fame, all three of which became temporary memorials. In addition to the black No. 21 sticker {{on the back of}} every NFL helmet, the Redskins also wore the number as a patch on player uniforms, warmup shirts and coaching staff jackets, as well as unveiling a banner bearing his name and number. His locker at Redskins Park was encased in <b>Plexiglas</b> and left the same way Taylor had left it. The organization also established a trust fund for Taylor's daughter, Jackie.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{broke apart}} in the crash, and burst into flames, the entire nose section breaking off. The escape hatches there were jammed and would not open, but passengers and crew were able to exit {{through a hole in}} the nose caused by the crash, and through a window from which the commander and co-pilot removed the <b>plexiglas.</b> Travis was thrown clear from the wreckage but died from his injuries on his way to hospital. One other man in the forward section, Staff Sergeant Joseph Prachniak, was also fatally injured. All ten people in the rear compartment died in the crash.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{the city}} of Rockford {{purchased}} two-thirds of the Chick House {{with the intention of}} redeveloping the historic property. In October the city shut off gas and water, in part because of an old boiler which would not survive another winter; the electricity remained on during this time. The city set about to make immediate repairs to prevent the building from deteriorating structurally. The work included the installation of <b>Plexiglas</b> windows to keep further moisture out, the installation of a green awning on the east facade which wraps around to the south slightly, and repairs to the parapet wall.|$|E
25|$|The Katana {{has several}} {{distinctive}} features, including its all-composite construction, low-mounted wing, T-tail arrangement, and a castering nosewheel. All models {{make use of}} a composite airframe which is constructed of glass- and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic. The one-piece fuselage has removable wings, which assists with transportation and servicing activities. The wings themselves have transparent <b>plexiglas</b> panels present so that key control elements can be readily inspected without disassembly. The airframe is complete with a sleek finish across the entirety of its exterior, which serves to eliminate corrosion and rivets in order to lower maintenance requirements. The maintenance costs of the Katana have been considered to be relatively low.|$|E
25|$|Early {{marks of}} the Whitley {{featured}} bomb bay doors, fitted on both the fuselage and wing bays, that were held shut by bungee cords; during bombing operations, these were opened {{by the weight of}} the bombs as they fell on them and closed again by the bungee cord. The short and unpredictable delay for the doors to open led to highly inaccurate bombing. The Mk.III introduced hydraulically actuated doors which greatly improved bombing accuracy. To aim bombs, the bomb aimer opened a hatch in the nose of the aircraft, which extended the bomb sight out of the fuselage but the Mk IV replaced this hatch with a slightly extended transparent <b>plexiglas</b> panel, improving crew comfort.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{compartment}} had two side-by-side {{seats and}} dual controls, {{all of which}} being contained within a large <b>Plexiglas</b> nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which {{had the advantage of}} being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot's compartment was the freight loading door on the port side; the hinged door could also be used as a loading ramp. The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another access door on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a verdict}} was issued {{in the new}} 1993 Rodney King federal civil rights trial against the four officers, Korean shop owners {{prepared}} for the worst as fear ran throughout the city, gun sales went up, virtually all of them by those of Korean descent, some merchants at flea markets removed their merchandise from their shelves, storefronts were fortified with extra <b>Plexiglas</b> and bars. Throughout the region, merchants readied to defend themselves as if {{on the eve of a}} war. College student Elizabeth Hwang spoke of the attacks on her parents' convenience store in 1992 and the fact that if trouble erupted following the 1993 trial, that they were armed with a Glock 17 pistol, a Beretta and a shotgun and they planned to barricade themselves in their store to fight off looters.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from its}} method of propulsion, the Djinn was a {{relatively}} conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided {{with an array of}} <b>plexiglas</b> panels, which provide the occupants {{with a high level of}} all-round visibility. Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the rotorcraft's single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be hand-started via a crank handle located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54 per cent of the rotorcraft's overall gross weight.|$|E
25|$|In some styles or settings, such as {{country music}} clubs or churches, small venues, {{or when a}} live {{recording}} is being made, the drummer may use a transparent perspex or <b>plexiglas</b> drum screen (also known as a drum shield) to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit {{is known as a}} drum booth. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.|$|E
