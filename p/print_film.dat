5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in <b>print,</b> <b>film</b> and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E

The developed wet chemical precipitation method allows the synthesis of metal nanoparticles by a high yield. Based on these nanoparticles customized eco-friendly water based inks are formulated. These inks show a high compatibility with the printing process and a high shelf life. Critical ink and printing parameters are summarized and discussed. Due to the fact, that the industry uses a variety of electronic and sensory substrates, a method to adapt the curing temperature to low (polymer), middle (glass) and high temperature (ceramic) substrates for the printing of electronic conductors and sensor electrodes is presented. Important physical and chemical ink specifications like particle size, viscosity, surface tension, sedimentation stability as well as electronic conductivities and adhesion of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> will be shown. Especially, solutions to optimize the adhesion, curing and electronic conductivity of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> on low temperature substrates like PET are presented.

40|$|Abstract. Color <b>film</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> is {{a special}} printing. Screen printing {{is an important part}} of Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> Because the process of screen <b>printing</b> in color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> is complex, its printing quality is affected by various factors. This paper proposes a set of normative test methods about standard operating, which is to find out these factors of Screen overprinting in Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> by actual test in production. And it is to improve product quality at the same time. Scope of Screen overprinting in Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> The Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> process is printing on a hydraulic permeability paper as what the customer requested. Then transferring the printed pattern to the objects, where the pattern is attached on to achieve the purpose of transferring printing ink. This process is called Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> The whole process of color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> can be divided into four parts ―pro-printing process, screen printing; offset printing and die-cutting. The oil <b>film</b> of screen <b>printing</b> is used to bear multi color patterns, that is to say which overprinting the multi color patterns on screen printing’s oil film. The production of Color print requires a very high quality of <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> and overprinting accuracy. So do the coordination from the four parts. Screen printing is an extreme important part of Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> And result of improving screen overprinting is the key of improving the quality o...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} produce a usable image, the film needs to be exposed properly. The amount of {{exposure}} variation that a given film can tolerate while still producing an {{acceptable level of quality}} is called its exposure latitude. Color <b>print</b> <b>film</b> generally has greater exposure latitude than other types of film. Additionally, because <b>print</b> <b>film</b> must be printed to be viewed, after-the-fact corrections for imperfect exposure are possible during the printing process.|$|E
