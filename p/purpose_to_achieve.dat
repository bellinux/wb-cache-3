60|$|Mr. Ticknor {{was most}} kind in his alacrity {{to solve the}} point on which Mr. Folsom, in my behalf, had {{consulted}} him (as to whether there had been any English translation of the Tales of Cervantes); and most liberal in his offers of books from his library. Certainly, he is {{a fine example of}} a generous-principled scholar, anxious to assist the human intellect in its efforts and researches. Methinks he must have spent a happy life (as happiness goes among mortals), writing his great three-volumed book for twenty years; writing it, not for bread, nor with any uneasy desire of fame, but only with a <b>purpose</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> something true and enduring. He is, I apprehend, a man of great cultivation and refinement, and with quite substance enough to be polished and refined, without being worn too thin in the process,--a man of society. He related a singular story of an attempt of his to become acquainted with me years ago, when he mistook my kinsman Eben for me.|$|E
60|$|And {{who that}} attends, {{even in the}} most {{superficial}} way, to the conditions upon which the stability of modern society--and especially of a society like ours, in which recent legislation has placed sovereign authority {{in the hands of the}} masses, whenever they are united enough to wield their power--can doubt that every man of high natural ability, who is both ignorant and miserable, is as great a danger to society as a rocket without a stick is to the people who fire it? Misery is a match that never goes out; genius, as an explosive power, beats gunpowder hollow; and if knowledge, which should give that power guidance, is wanting, the chances are not small that the rocket will simply run a-muck among friends and foes. What gives force to the socialistic movement which is now stirring European society to its depths, but a determination on the part of the naturally able men among the proletariat, to put an end, somehow or other, to the misery and degradation in which a large proportion of their fellows are steeped? The question, whether the means by which they <b>purpose</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> this end are adequate or not, is at this moment the most important of all political questions--and it is beside my present purpose to discuss it. All I desire to point out is, that if the chance of the controversy being decided calmly and rationally, and not by passion and force, looks miserably small to an impartial bystander, the reason is that not one in ten thousand of those who constitute the ultimate court of appeal, by which questions of the utmost difficulty, as well as of the most momentous gravity, will have to be decided, is prepared by education to comprehend the real nature of the suit brought before their tribunal.|$|E

50|$|In economics, an expansionary {{fiscal policy}} {{includes}} higher spending and tax cuts, that encourage economic growth. In turn, an expansionary monetary policy is one that seeks to {{increase the size of}} the money supply. As usual, inciting of money supply is aimed at lowering the interest rates on <b>purpose</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> economic growth by increase of economic activity. Conversely, contractionary monetary policy seeks {{to reduce the size of}} the money supply. In most nations, monetary policy is controlled by either a central bank or a finance ministry. Neoclassical and Keynesian economics significantly differ on the effects and effectiveness of monetary policy on influencing the real economy; there is no clear consensus on how monetary policy affects real economic variables (aggregate output or income, employment). Both economic schools accept that monetary policy affects monetary variables (price levels, interest rates).|$|E

He has an extremely pretty, efficient young actress named Marilyn Hassett to play Jill, and he has Beau Bridges to play the daredevil of a fellow—skier, motorcyclist, sky diver—who loves Jill through thick and thin. In a film like this, Mr. Bridges's appearance is the sort of certificate of honor the audience looks for. ...There are some beautiful ski scenes and some terrifying scenes in the hospital. The movie also contains a couple of moments of genuine feeling—all set in a Los Angeles center for the rehabilitation of the handicapped—that raise the over-all tone. Mostly, though, the inspiration one detects in The Other Side of the Mountain is the inspiration to make the kind of prefabricated romantic movie that every few years turns the American public into a bunch of blubbering idiots." ...|$|E
