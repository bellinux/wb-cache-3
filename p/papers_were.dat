Forty of her <b>papers</b> <b>were</b> published after her retirement date. After suffering a heart attack in early July 1968, Morgan died on July 20.

5|$|To {{maintain}} morale, wartime censors minimized early {{reports of}} illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. However, <b>papers</b> <b>were</b> free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII). This reporting dichotomy created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, Spanish Flu. In Spain, a different nickname was adopted, the Naples Soldier (Soldado de Nápoles), which came from a musical operetta (zarzuela) titled La canción del olvido (The Song of Forgetting), which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave. Federico Romero, one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, Naples Soldier, was as catchy as the flu.|$|E
5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies {{with the doctor}} Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These <b>papers</b> <b>were</b> left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E
