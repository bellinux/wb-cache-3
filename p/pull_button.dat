40|$|Traditional {{operating}} systems {{support the notion}} of hardware abstraction level in which each application is supposed to possess its own processor (and other resources). This situation {{and the fact that}} in general all commercial {{operating systems}} are based on multitasking concept (introduced in 1964), contribute to enforce problems identified 30 years ago [1]. This problems range from security to usability, including lack of adequate behavior in fluctuating execution conditions and user’s privacy. However, today we are faced with new demands like pervasive computing, teleworking and e-commerce where self-adaptation and selfreconfiguring are the main goals. Besides that, there are two other concepts that contribute to make things worse: (i) the operator concept and, (ii) the program concept. The operator function was necessary during the first years of computing since computers were big and difficult to use. Operators at that time were responsible for turning the machine on/off, starting programs, collecting reports, restarting programs and so on. This scenario has changed as the computers become smaller, cheaper and faster as they are today. However, what was a real need in the past is employed today as if {{there was no other way}} to interact with computers. In fact, we are today operators – all of us using some kind of computer (desktops, palmtops, mobile phones). We are trained today to learn how to <b>pull</b> virtual <b>buttons</b> the same way the former operators were trained to <b>pull</b> real <b>buttons</b> in real panels on those old mainframes. This aspect has consequences and the program concept is the main one. A program could be thought as the programmer’s hands virtually extended inside our machines.

Barrichello, however, was unable to create enough of a gap to the chasing pack before his second pit-stop, and lost the lead to Button. After all the other drivers had pitted at least once, Barrichello found himself behind third-placed Massa and fourth-placed Vettel. After the last round of pit-stops were completed, Button was first, while Barrichello had moved up to second, and Red Bull's Mark Webber took third position - the result of a long second stint that Red Bull had opted for in order to emerge in front of the slower Ferrari of Massa.|$|R

5000|$|The {{appeal of}} the Fotoplayer to theatre owners {{was the fact that}} it took no major musical skill to operate. The Fotoplayer would play the piano and pipe organ {{mechanically}} using an electric motor, an air pump, and piano rolls while the user of the Fotoplayer would follow the onscreen action while <b>pulling</b> cords, pushing <b>buttons,</b> and pressing pedals to produce relatable sounds to what was occurring onscreen. [...] These actions could create sounds such as a steamboat whistle, a bird chirp, wind, thunder, a telephone bell, as well as many others. On Fotoplayers specifically, most effects were created using leather cords, with wooden handles on the ends, directly connected to the effects. For example, the steamboat whistle sound effect was created using a household bellows with a whistle at the end. Pulling the cord compressed the bellows, delivering a gust of air into the whistle. Creating a drum roll on the other hand was a bit more complicated. A clockwork device was needed to time the strikes of the drum which required constant winding.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{quenching}} and partitioning (Q&P) {{steel sheets}} {{have been proposed}} for the fabrication of car body components. However, {{the use of this}} steel grade isconditional on its attitude to be assembled with other automotive steel grades by welding techniques. In this work, a Q&Psteel sheet and a transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steel sheet were welded together byresistance spot welding at varying process parameters. Particularly, the effects of the welding current, clamping force, and welding time on the mechanical strength of the Q&P/TRIP joints have been assessed. An L- 9 (33) orthogonal array was used to design the welding tests, performing three replications for each welding condition. Optical microscopy and SEM fractographic examinations were conducted to evaluate the microstructure of the steels and the weld nugget size, and to detect the possible occurrence of welding defects, in each welding condition. The welded samples mainly failed by <b>button</b> <b>pull,</b> with interfacial fracture occurring in very few cases. Moreover, metal expulsion, which occurred in the samples welded at the highest welding current, limits the achievable maximum extent of the weld nugget and the shear tension strength...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{previous}} handhelds in {{the series}} such as the Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword, which played in a side-scrolling two-dimensional form, reminiscent of 8-bit games, The Prophecy instead plays in an isometric viewpoint, giving the player a viewpoint from above the player character's head. The game contains many familiar elements of the franchise such as being able to jump, run, climb and shoot. As the game was the first Tomb Raider to be rendered in an isometric view until Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, the game was also given a completely new combat system to suit the view style. The system {{does not include the}} regular player-controlled lock on gun play of previous games. It does instead contain an auto-lock system to make combating enemies easier.

40|$|Dissimilar {{resistance}} spot welding of TWinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) and Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) steel grades has been investigated by evaluating the effects of clamping force, welding current, and welding time on the microstructure, shear tension strength, and fracture of welded samples. The spot welding of TWIP and Q&P steels promotes the occurrence of an asymmetrical weld nugget with a greater dilution of TWIP steel because of its lower melting temperature and thermal conductivity. As a result, weld nuggets exhibit an austenitic microstructure. TWIP steel undergoes a grain coarsening in the HAZ, whereas Q&P steel undergoes some phase transformations. Welded samples tend to exhibit higher shear tension strength as they are joined at the highest welding current, even though an improper clamping force can promote excessive metal expulsion, thereby reducing the mechanical strength of the welded joints. Shear tension welded samples failed through interfacial fracture with partial thickness fracture mode for a low welding current, while partial thickness with <b>button</b> <b>pull</b> fractures were observed when a high welding current was used. The weld spots predominantly failed atthe TWIP side. However, as TWIP steel can work harden significantly in the more resistant welded joints, the failures occur, instead, at the Q&P side...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} preparation made to enable mathematics teachers to appropriately prepare school leavers entering {{directly into the}} workforce upon graduation to handle the different branches of mathematics. The methodology {{was that of the}} interpretive qualitative paradigm. The method was that of the multi method case study and the tools included: constructed conversation; interviews; telephone calls; email; focus group; photography; video recording; participatory observation; observation and documentation. The theoretical framework was informed by components of the Engeström (2001) second generation model. The study found that while there was hardly any preparation made in the system to accommodate mathematics teachers in the appropriate preparation of students to cope with rapid changes in technology and mathematical skills in the workplace, because of on-the-job training, the newly employed were able to handle the mathematics at their workplaces. Additionally, the technological tools in use at workplaces allowed employees to handle the mathematics in work: complicated algorithms associated with mathematical operations were hidden in these technological tools. Employees were then only required to perform an operation of a push or a <b>pull</b> of a <b>button</b> (switch) to turn on or to turn off the device. Equally, mathematical knowledge at the workplace was an activity; thus {{there was no need for}} the pedagogical format required for school mathematics classes. This research is significant since this is the first of its kind in the Caribbean using components of the Engeström (2001) second generation model as its theoretical framework and for examination of the mathematics informing workplaces in Antigua and Barbuda. It has also served to bridge a gap between school teachers and employers on communication of the different branches of mathematics required in the workplaces of Antigua and Barbuda. Simultaneously it represents a new block in the wall of literature from scholars in the field of workplace mathematics since the Caribbean’s space was empty...|$|R
40|$|Over {{more than}} three decades, the video game {{industry}} has grown to become a multi-billion dollar industry. Users of all ages dedicate countless hours of their valuable free time to engage themselves in a flourishing world of adventure and entertainment, enabling them to escape their modern daily routines. With giant leaps in hardware and software development, the industry has managed to take gamers from a world of monotone pixel jumping to incredibly complex and realistic environments. Video games give users the ability to become warriors, heroes, drivers or strategists that can either challenge or cooperate with players from across {{the world in a}} community based on mutual interests. But the industry seems to be slowing down. The big players in the field, basing their new products solely on more realistic graphics, do not live up to the consumers expectations for innovation. It is the realism that makes the player want to achieve more. But what exactly is realistic, when considering that you are pushing and <b>pulling</b> plastic <b>buttons</b> on a gamepad? A trend that can be observed, is that the industry is slowly moving into virtual reality with the introduction of new products by start-ups such as the Oculus Rift, providing glasses capable of tracking your head movement or the Virtuix Omni, allowing the use of your body to freely move through a virtual environment. These products gained a lot of attention at the latest game conventions and although they still encounter minor technical problems, they are powerful tools for the gaming world, especially when working together. The player is now capable of traveling through fictional environments by foot and able to freely look around, but what about the hands? When being fully engaged in an imaginative world, the user wants to further interact with the environment by grabbing objects or opening doors for instance. This thesis investigates the idea of incorporating the user physically into the game, aiming {{for the development of a}} functional tactile glove prototype providing users with an even more immersive gaming experience. Tactile gloves use various mechanisms to create the illusion of grabbing actual objects in a virtual environment. This goes as far as being capable to feel the density of an object. In order to identify the weaknesses and opportunities with tactile gloves, various tools such as literature, expert insights, and consumer studies are utilized. The data collected and work conducted throughout this process is evaluated and discussed critically to obtain the most adequate and suitable solution. Various tactile gloves exist already, however the most sophisticated glove on the market is priced at over $ 39, 000 and is mainly used at research institutions. The overall aim will be to create an affordable solution for commercial usage in the gaming industry...|$|R

Nicieza felt that this created a scenario in which each could be used for different effects. As he put it, [...] "one can prove a physical opposition to Robin (Ulysses as Anarky), the other an intellectual one (Lonnie as MoneySpider)." [...] Nicieza also acknowledged that this dramatic change in the character's presentation would upset fans of the character, but countered that he felt he had not made any changes to the character which could not be undone easily by other writers.|$|R
