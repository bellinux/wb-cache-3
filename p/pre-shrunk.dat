500|$|During Jack's initial {{appearances}} in Doctor Who, Russell T Davies held a [...] "half-hearted" [...] theory that Jack would dress {{specific to the}} time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits {{that this was a}} [...] "bit of a lame idea" [...] and decided that Jack [...] "never looked better than {{when he was in his}} World War II outfit". [...] From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that [...] "We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour." [...] Because the character was expected to [...] "be running around a lot", Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less [...] "weighty". Jack's other costumes are [...] "loosely wartime based", such as the trousers are [...] "getting more and more styled to suit his figure". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The [...] "hero version" [...] is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with <b>pre-shrunk</b> fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two [...] "stunt coats" [...] that had been [...] "hero coats" [...] in the first series." [...] Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character [...] "likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity". Julie Gardner describes the coat as [...] "epic and classic and dramatic", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack [...] "a sweep and a presence".|$|E
50|$|Izod Advantage with Sportflex Technology: Introduced in Spring 2016. A {{collection}} of high-performance clothing aimed at active individuals such as tennis players. This line often features lightweight cotton/polyester blends, non-iron fabric, <b>pre-shrunk</b> fabric, stretch fabric, and/or moisture-wicking fabric. Available at many department stores.|$|E
50|$|The aim of {{the process}} is a cloth which does not shrink {{significantly}} during production by cutting, ironing, sewing or, especially, by wearing and washing the finished clothes.Cloth and articles made from it may be labelled to have a specific shrink-proof value (if <b>pre-shrunk),</b> e.g., of under 1%.|$|E
50|$|GTB Holding Corp {{holds the}} {{trademark}} licensing {{rights to the}} Sanforization process of <b>pre-shrinking</b> fabric, named for its inventor, Sanford L. Cluett, who developed the process for Cluett Peabody & Company, which he joined in 1919.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, he {{developed}} the process of Sanforizing (patented in 1930), to <b>pre-shrink</b> cotton or other fabrics by squeezing material against a stretched rubber strip or band and allowing the pair to shrink together, to offset the stretching of fabrics during prior weaving or finishing.|$|R
50|$|Sanforizing or <b>Pre-shrinking</b> {{prevents}} {{a fabric}} and the produced garment from shrinking after production. This {{is also a}} mechanical finish, acquired by feeding the fabric between a roller and rubber blanket, {{in such a way}} the rubber blanket compresses the weft threads and imparts compressive shrinkage.|$|R
50|$|Salsa jeans {{are made}} from denim, {{strengthened}} and then dyed to indigo blue. To ensure a good fit throughout the garment's life, Salsa jeans are <b>pre-shrunk</b> and the fibres compressed before being cut in Salsa’s characteristic styles. Salsa Push Up Wonder Jeans are the brand's top selling jeans model.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s Brunswick Street began to change, {{with a number}} of more {{mainstream}} establishments replacing what had been a much more alternative area. This resulted in a significant increase in property rents all along the strip, and when the Punters Club's lease came up for renewal in 2002, Everett saw continuing as unsustainable. The club closed its doors on 17 February 2002, with a twelve-hour music marathon that featured Gaslight Radio, Rocket Science, <b>Pre-Shrunk,</b> TISM and the The Beat End Profilers.|$|E
50|$|In 1962 Levi Strauss {{introduced}} <b>pre-shrunk</b> jeans, {{which did}} not shrink further after purchase, allowing the consumer to buy his or her correct size. These jeans were known as the 505 regular fit jeans. The 505 are almost identical to the 501s {{with the exception of}} the button-fly. The Levi's Corporation also introduced a slim boot-cut fit known as 517 and 527. The difference between the two is the 517s sit at the waist line and the 527s sit below the waist line. Later, Levi's would develop other styles and fits such as the loose, slim, comfort, relaxed, skinny, and a regular fit with a tapered leg.|$|E

5000|$|Stretching (<b>pre-shrinking)</b> {{paper is}} {{necessary}} {{if you are}} printing more than one color or multiple times with the same color to build up density. If your paper is not sized (most watercolour papers are, though to varying degrees) it’s also advisable to size the paper to help minimize staining. A gelatin size (coating) prevents the unhardened dichromate from permeating the paper fibers. Without stretching, the paper will change shape between layer printings. Make lots of sized paper at one time. Label all paper with pencil after sizing.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, Broome {{transferred}} {{the business to}} his wife, Ivy. Broome himself died four years later at aged 69 years. In 1952, Ivy sold the business and trademark to John McKendrick, who operated a clothing factory at Waitara. McKendrick began purchasing fabric that was closely woven and <b>pre-shrunk</b> which enabled him to make different pattern sizes and garments. He sourced his cloth from South Island-based Alliance textiles, and the business expanded with factories in Waitara and Opunake. Alliance purchased Swanndri in 1991 when McKendrick retired and continued {{for a few years}} until production centered in Timaru and the Taranaki operation closed. In 1994, Swanndri New Zealand Ltd purchase the brand from Alliance Textiles.|$|E
50|$|Judogi {{are sold}} in many thicknesses, which can be {{generally}} grouped together in the two classes: single-weave and double-weave. Single-weave judogi are thinner and weigh less (upper jacket textile fabric weight usually 300-550 g/m2). The thinner judogi are less durable, although some judoka (judo practitioners) may prefer them for long practices as {{they are less likely}} to foster overheating. Double-weave judogi are thicker and weigh more (fabric weight usually 650-1050 g/m2). They are harder to grab than single-weave gis, which is considered an advantage in competition. Double-weave gis shrink less and those of high quality are often sold entirely <b>pre-shrunk,</b> this is important to know when comparing the fit of the gi. Double-weave gis generally cost considerably more than single-weave gis of comparable quality.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of wrestling/grappling and the {{diseases}} that can come from close contact between people, the gi is typically washed after each class. As with most cotton products, a cotton gi must be laundered in cold water and line dried to avoid shrinkage. This is important to most Jiu-Jitsu practitioners as even <b>pre-shrunk</b> gi material has a tendency to shrink further in hot water and a hot dryer cycle. To preserve the life of the Gi, bleaching is highly discouraged, as this can weaken the fibers of the material and cause them to tear more easily. Line drying in bright sunlight is commonly suggested to help remove smells from the gi, due to the bacterial killing properties of UV light. Hanging the gi in direct sunlight can damage the integrity of the fabric and reduce its durability, and can also stiffen up fibres in a gi.|$|E

2500|$|Industry {{consequently}} became {{prominent in}} the area. Gloversville was labeled the [...] "headquarters of the glove and mitten industry" [...] and became the preeminent glove-manufacturing and leather-working region in New York. Cohoes {{became known as the}} Spindle City for its large cotton mills, due mainly to Harmony Mills, the largest cotton mill complex in the world when it opened in 1872. Troy became famous for its iron works due to Burden Iron Works, though later Troy would earn the nickname of Collar City due to Cluett, Peabody & Co., which made Arrow brand shirts at the largest collar, cuff, and shirt factory in the world at the time. In 1887 Thomas Edison moved his Edison Machine Works to Schenectady, and in 1892 Schenectady became the headquarters of the General Electric Company (GE). Schenectady Locomotive Works, along with seven other locomotive manufacturers, merged in 1901 and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed and headquartered in Schenectady. Due to the dominance of GE and ALCO in their respective industries, Schenectady would gain the nicknames of Electric City and [...] "The City that Lights and Hauls the World". The nature of this industry lent itself to the creation of many labor-saving inventions, such as the horseshoe machine of Henry Burden, the <b>pre-shrinking</b> fabric machines of Sanford Cluett, the power knitting loom of Timothy Bailey, the railroad air-brake of George Westinghouse, and the hundreds of electricity-related improvements of General Electric Company scientists.|$|R
5000|$|The comic {{starts with}} a truck leaving {{a nuclear power plant}} with a bucket of Nuclear Waste driving to the toxic waste dump. One barrel falls off and lands in a cotton field, where the cotton absorbs the Nuclear Waste and grows to an {{unbelievable}} size. One day, the cotton was harvested and taken to the underwear factory. The cotton is then made into [...] "Glow In the Dark underwear", and Melvin's mother gives Melvin this so-called [...] "Glow-in-the-Dark underwear" [...] because they were having a big sale. Overnight, the radioactive underwear causes Melvin to grow into a monster, and on his way to school the next morning, the police spot the oversized nerd. The police call the military, and war is declared. Melvin picks up a tank, throws it, and it lands on the gym teacher. Then Captain Underpants flies in and tries {{to figure out how to}} defeat him, and he notices a tag on the back on the underwear saying the underwear will shrink if washed. Then Melvin grabs Captain Underpants and he pleads Melvin not to dunk him in the lake. Then Melvin takes Captain Underpants to the lake to dunk him, but his underwear becomes soaked and starts shrinking. Captain Underpants asks a passing bird to pop Melvin because he looks like a balloon. The bird pops him and Captain Underpants whisks Melvin away to a Jail House for Stupid Nerds. The comics ends with a moral saying that people should buy <b>pre-shrunk</b> underwear.|$|E

40|$|Background: Biomechanical {{stresses}} play {{an important}} role in determining plaque stability. Quantification of these simulated stresses can be potentially used to assess plaque vulnerability and differentiate different patient groups. Methods and Results: 54 asymptomatic and 45 acutely symptomatic patients underwent in vivo multicontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carotid arteries. Plaque geometry used for finite element analysis was derived from in vivo MRI at the sites of maximum and minimum plaque burden. In total, 198 slices were used for the computational simulations. A <b>pre-shrink</b> technique was used to refine the simulation. Maximum principle stress at the vulnerable plaque sites (ie, critical stress) was extracted for the selected slices and a comparison was performed between the 2 groups. Critical stress in the slice with maximum plaque burden is significantly higher in acutely symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients (median, inter quartile range: 198. 0 kPa (119. 8 - 359. 0 kPa) vs 138. 4 kPa (83. 8 - 242. 6 kPa), P= 0. 04). No significant difference was found in the slice with minimum plaque burden between the 2 groups (196. 7 kPa (133. 3 - 282. 7 kPa) vs 182. 4 kPa (117. 2 - 310. 6 kPa), P= 0. 82). Conclusions: Acutely symptomatic carotid plaques have significantly high biomechanical stresses than asymptomatic plaques. This might be potentially useful for establishing a biomechanical risk stratification criteria based on plaque burden in future studies...|$|R
