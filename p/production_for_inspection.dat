5000|$|The {{production}} of sexually explicit materials is regulated under 18 U.S.C. 2257, requiring [...] "original" [...] producers to retain records showing that all performers were {{over the age}} of 18 {{at the time of the}} <b>production</b> <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by the Attorney General. The 18 U.S.C. 2257 disclaimer is common on Internet sites distributing pornography, but the Department of Justice has rarely if ever enforced the provision. Although the law had been on the books for over 10 years, the Justice Department never actually inspected anyone. It was not until pressure from Congress, and conservative religious groups spurred the administration of George W. Bush and Attorney General Gonzales to begin inspections of larger commercial porn companies primarily in the Los Angeles area. Despite fearing mass inspections, harassment, and prosecution, the Justice Department inspected less than two dozen companies (out of several thousand operating), and no prosecutions resulted from any of the inspections. Retired FBI agents conducted the inspections, and generally arrived with a list of videos whose records they wanted to examine (most likely, to avoid potential Fourth Amendment conflicts on issues of probable cause). According to porn executives, the agents were always courteous and professional, suggesting changes or modifications to the companies' record-keeping processes. Once Attorney General Alberto Gonzales left the Justice Department, the inspections ended.|$|E

The problem under study is an optimization problem and has been formulated with a cost-based criterion. The main aim is to know which power plants must stop their operation of elec-tricity <b>production</b> <b>for</b> periodic <b>inspection</b> over a time horizon. The management of this problem has a considerable impact on power system performance because an unexpected failure in a power plant may cause a general breakdown in an electric system.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of honed surfaces {{is one of}} the most important tasks in tribology. Although many established techniques exist for texture characterization, such as SEM, tactile stylus or white-light interferometry, none of them is suited for a machine integrated measurement. Harsh conditions such as the presence of cooling lubricant or vibrations prohibit the use of commercial sensors inside a honing machine. Instead, machined engine blocks need time-consuming cleaning and preparation while taken out of the <b>production</b> line <b>for</b> <b>inspection.</b> A full inspection of all produced parts is hardly possible this way. Within this paper, an approach for a machine-integrated measurement is presented, which makes use of optical sensors for texture profiling. The cooling lubricant here serves as immersion medium. The results of test measurements with a chromatic-confocal sensor and a fiber-optical low-coherence interferometer show the potential of both measuring principles for our appr oach. Cooling lubricant temperature and flow, scanning speed and measurement frequency have been varied in the tests. The sensor with best performance will later be chosen for machine integration...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{control is}} an {{important}} problem <b>for</b> <b>production</b> <b>inspection</b> in industry. Traditionally it is solved using mechanical and optical profilometry, providing high spatial resolution. However, such methods are inappropriate for bodies immersed in opaque liquids and require preliminary preparation of samples. Current work focuses on an application of a method of laser ultrasound tomography to mapping of solid surfaces. The suggested approach combines high acoustical resolution, high performance and allows profilometry of contaminated and immersed samples. An automated prototype for real-time surface profile measurements is constructed and tested on several bodies of revolution. Linear approximation of a cylinder profile obtained by the prototype shows maximum approximation inconsistency of 15 μm.

40|$|Abstract: Complex {{materials}} such as multilayer bonded composites present fresh challenges for non-destructive testing. Many materials are highly attenuating due both to losses in the bulk material and propagation losses at interfaces. Additionally, some new composite materials exhibit resonances due to the geometry of the laminar structures, and require special consideration. These applications have required {{the development of more}} rapid and flexible ultrasonic techniques <b>for</b> <b>production</b> <b>inspection</b> that are capable of performing non-standard measurements on difficult structures. This paper describes recent developments by NDT Solutions concerning ultrasonic data analysis and <b>inspection</b> techniques <b>for</b> the testing of composite structures. Examples from current applications utilising DSP pulse compression techniques and arbitrary function generators will be presented. Introduction: With the introduction of {{materials such}} as multilayer bonded composites has come an increased level of inspection difficulty due to complex wave propagation characteristics of some of these materials. Standard ultrasonic pulse based techniques are often not sufficient <b>for</b> the <b>inspection</b> of these materials due to filtering effects or lack of dynamic range. This pape...|$|R

Advanced 3 D solid modelling and digital fabrication methods are growing in construction. Iconic building design is driving the industry towards {{a new era of}} the Building Information Model (BIM) where a building is modelled entirely using 3 D solid CAD tools containing all the required information for construction. CNC machinery can utilise this information to manufacture components enabling highly bespoke and non-repeating components to be cost competitive. Rapid Manufacturing machines also use this information to build components by selectively adding material rather than the traditional subtractive or formative processes. The BIM drives current machines <b>for</b> the <b>production</b> of models <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> or to explore assembly issues.

40|$|Due to {{the rising}} demand in {{efficiency}} and sustainability in commercial aviation, aircraft manufacturers increase the usage of high performance, lightweight materials like carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). These materials pose new challenges to manufacturing processes concerning cost-effectiveness and quality requirements.

40|$|An Automatic Optical <b>Inspection</b> (AOI) system <b>for</b> optical <b>inspection</b> of imaging devices used in {{automotive}} industry using an inspecting optics of lower spatial resolution than the device under inspection is described. This system is robust {{and with no}} moving parts. The cycle time is small. Its main advantage {{is that it is}} capable of detecting and quantifying defects in regular patterns, working below the Shannon-Nyquist criterion for optical resolution, using a single low resolution image sensor. It is easily scalable, which is an important advantage in industrial applications, since the same inspecting sensor can be reused for increasingly higher spatial resolutions of the devices to be inspected. The optical inspection is implemented with a notch multi-band Fourier filter, making the procedure especially fitted for regular patterns, like the ones that can be produced in image displays and Head Up Displays (HUDs). The regular patterns are used in <b>production</b> line only, <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> purposes. <b>For</b> image displays, functional defects are detected at the level of a sub-image display grid element unit. Functional defects are the ones impairing the function of the display, and are preferred in AOI to the direct geometric imaging, since those are the ones directly related with the end-user experience. The shift in emphasis from geometric imaging to functional imaging is critical, since it is this that allows quantitative <b>inspection,</b> below Shannon-Nyquist. <b>For</b> HUDs, the functional detect detection addresses defects resulting from the combined effect of the image display and the image forming optics.
