The thesis deals with computation {{of part of}} risk which falls on <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> and on insurance company. There is used the Bayesian approach in the first part. A portfolio is assumed in which the risk parameter of each <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> is a random variable. There is established a model with two kinds of <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> too, every kind has a given distribution of the risk parameter again. There are mentioned some bonus-malus systems used {{in the world in}} third-party liability insurance in the second part. It is shown how to modify the systems which do not satisfy the Markovian condition to a model which satisfies this condition. It is useful for next calculations.

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of a term {{insurance}} {{policy is to}} secure the immediate needs of nominees or beneficiaries {{in the event of}} sudden or unfortunate demise of the <b>policy</b> <b>holder.</b> The <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> does not get any monetary benefit {{at the end of the}} policy term except for the tax benefits he or she can choose to avail of throughout the tenure of the policy.

50|$|Life {{insurance}} (or life assurance, {{especially in}} the Commonwealth of Nations), is a contract between an insurance <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the benefit) {{in exchange for a}} premium, upon the death of an insured person (often the <b>policy</b> <b>holder).</b> Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) can also be included in the benefits.|$|R

40|$|According to {{insurance}} theory, agents who have insurance coverage have less incentives to make preventive actions. In {{the case of}} complete coverage, this behavior, called ex ante moral hazard, {{is so strong that}} <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> make no preventive action.

Using a bi-dimensional utility function, we show that a deductible is not necessarily optimal : it may induce a decrease of the wealth that increases the cost of preventive actions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{proposes a}} {{utilitarian}} and newfangled design of life insurance premium payment. Insurance companies provide insurance to the <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> {{and in turn}} the <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> have to pay insurance premium periodically. In this paper, we study the important factors to be considered {{at the time of}} selecting the term of premium payment of insurance. The intention is to extend this study to a method which can machinate and assist users in deciding the term and amount of premium payment. Our aim here is twin-fold; one, to evoke a novel way to <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> to decide the least premiums to be paid and second, to devise a manner for insurance provider to collect maximum premiums. With this twofold aim, we propose a hybrid soft computing optimization model using Neuro-Fuzzy approach and Particle Swarm Optimization...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} costly {{internal capital}} into a standard insurance model, {{in which a}} risk-averse <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> buys insurance from a risk-neutral insurer with limited liability. We show that the optimal contract is unique, and leads to a positive probability for insurer default. Some risks are uninsurable, {{in the sense that}} it is optimal for the insurer not to provide insurance against such risks. We characterize when such situations arise, as a function of the properties of the risk, the cost of internal capital, and the <b>policy</b> <b>holder's</b> utility function. An increase in the cost of capital may lead to a higher optimal amount of internal capital. The results continue to hold when there are multiple <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> who are exposed to identical risks. This extension of the classical model to include costly internal capital provides a fruitful approach to many real world insurance markets...|$|R

40|$|Public health {{insurance}} system with more {{health insurance}} companies fully operates in the Czech Republic since 1 January 1993. The main task of {{health insurance companies}} is collection of health insurance premiums from premium payers and reimbursement of health care to medical facilities. Legal regulations governing public health insurance in our country have changed a lot since 1993. The basic principle of our public health insurance system is the principle of solidarity. Participation in public health insurance {{does not depend on}} the decision of a citizen, but is legally required. The fundamental rights of each insured person are the right to choose a health insurance company and the right to choose a doctor or medical facility which is under contract with health insurance company of the <b>policy</b> <b>holder.</b> The theoretical part of the thesis describes basic concepts and legal regulations of public health insurance in the Czech Republic, with the help of available literature. In more detail it deals with obligations of individual groups of health insurance premium payers to health insurance company and property sanctions which can be imposed by respective health insurance company. The objective of the practical part of this thesis was to make a survey of legal awareness of <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> { [...] } premium payers about their obligations under existing legislation. Two hypotheses were set in line with this objective. Hypothesis number one assumes that university graduates are more aware of obligations of the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> { [...] } public health insurance premium payer than <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> with lower education. Hypothesis number two assumes that <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> under the age of 50 years are more aware of obligations of the policyholder - public health insurance premium payer than <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> aged 50 years and over. Quantitative research, method of questioning was chosen to test the hypotheses. To collect data the questionnaire technique was used. Both hypotheses were confirmed based on research findings. Objective of the thesis has been achieved.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the interaction between}} optimalportfolio choice and fair pricing of specific insurance contracts. In particular, we consider so-called participating policies. We find fair contract specifications {{in the sense that}} the market values of future claims to <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> and equity holders, respectively, are equal to their initial deposits. We motivate that the manager should maximize expected utility for the <b>policy</b> <b>holders</b> and find closed form solutions for the portfolio strategy and final wealth. The utility in the fixed portfolio case is compared to the case with dynamic portfolio choice. The utility loss, measured by a certain equivalent wealth, of not introducing portfolio choice is remarkably high in some situations. We consider both the case where the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> might not get the guaranteed amount, and the case where the guarantee is satisfied for sure. We find that fair contract specifications as well as the comparative statics change considerably when we introduce dynamic portfolio choice. The findings suggest that dynamic portfolio choice should not be ignored when analyzing fair life insurance contracts. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The term of 'risk {{transfer}}' {{is often}} used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract {{is often described as}} a [...] "transfer of risk." [...] However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses [...] "transferred", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> then some compensation may be payable to the <b>policy</b> <b>holder</b> that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.|$|R
