40|$|Problem statement: A two {{dimensional}} steady laminar free convective flow of viscous incompressible fluid between two <b>parallel</b> porous <b>walls</b> is considered. Approach: Using the similarity variable, the partial differential equations {{were reduced to}} ordinary differential equations. The coupled ordinary differential equations were solved numerically using shooting method. The effect of various physical parameters, such as the Prandtl number, Grashof number, permeability parameter and ratio of the free stream velocity to <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> parameter on the boundary layer velocity and skin-friction coefficient were investigated. Results: Some of the several important findings of the results were (i) the fluid velocity increased as either of the Grashof number, permeability parameter, ratio of free stream velocity parameter to <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> parameter was increased. (ii) The fluid temperature decreased as either of the Grashof number, ratio of free stream velocity parameter to <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> parameter increased and increased as permeability parameter was increased. (iii) Skin friction increase owing {{to an increase in}} Grashof number, ratio of free stream velocity parameter to <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> parameter and decrease with increasing permeability parameter. In this study, a similarity solution for free convective flow between two parameter porous walls situated a distance L apart was considered. Numerical results were presented to illustrate the details of the flow, skin-friction characteristics and their dependence on the flow conditions and fluid properties. Conclusion: In particular, we found that, the fluid velocity increased as either of the Grashof number, permeability parameter, ratio of free stream velocity parameter to <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> parameter was increased...|$|R

500|$|The {{walls of}} the {{northern}} terrace (about [...] in length) defend the whole inner courtyard. The courtyard's northwestern walls form the Old Castle, ending between the Day and Rozhanka Towers. They {{are made up of}} two <b>parallel</b> <b>walls,</b> which include the Petty Western Tower, the remnants of the Black Tower, and a two-level casemate, or fortified gun emplacement. The older of the two walls dates {{back to the beginning of}} the 12th century and is built with crenelations. Another casemate was located at the eastern walls. An entrance to the castle in the eastern walls is known as the New Castle Gate, and there were two more gates, one, in the northern walls, called the Old Castle Gate, and another, the Field Gate, connecting the Water Tower with the rest of the castle. The northern walls are reinforced with the Northern Bastion along their whole length. The bastion was built in 1790, just before the second partition of Poland. There is also the New Castle that was designed as a hornwork and located west from the main castle complex.|$|E

[...] The chimney is emphasized by the centrally placed room on the second floor, but the actual chimney is small and off-center. The effect is to magnify the scale of the small house and make the facade appear to be monumental. The scale magnifying effects are not carried over to the sides and rear of the house, thus making the house appear to be both large and small from different angles.|$|E

2500|$|Early Bronze Age (3300/3500-2200 BCE) - The 2009 {{discovery}} at the tell {{of a stone}} palette with Egyptian motifs, {{including an}} ankh, points to trade/political relations with the First dynasty of Egypt, at approximately 3000 BCE. Excavators have identified four levels of occupation from the Early Bronze Age (EB). Architectural development shows the procession from (sometimes oval) pit dwellings (I) to mud-brick (II), to basalt foundations with mud-brick (III), {{and then on to}} basalt structures (IV), over approximately 1000 years. The basalt houses belong to the same phase as the Khirbet al-Kerak pottery, dated to the Early Bronze Age III. From the earliest phases, the settlement was protected from the south and west by a city wall (the north and east facing the Sea of Galilee). The wall consisted of three connecting <b>parallel</b> <b>walls,</b> forming a massive wall, [...] thick, built of mud-bricks. The gate was on the south and was built of basalt.

40|$|Growing {{demand on}} transportation, road and railway {{networks}} {{has increased the}} risk of annoyance from these sources {{and the need to}} optimise noise mitigation. The potential traffic noise reduction arising from use of acoustically-soft surfaces and artificial roughness (0. 3 m high or less) is explored through laboratory experiments, outdoor measurements at short and medium ranges and predictions. Although the applicability of ground treatments depends on the space usable for the noise abatement and the receiver position, replacing acoustically hard ground by acoustically-soft ground without or with crops and introducing artificial roughness configurations could achieve noise reduction along surface transport corridors without breaking line of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers. A particularly successful roughness design has the form of a square lattice which is found to offer a similar insertion loss to regularly-spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> arrays of the same height but twice the width. The lattice design has less dependence on azimuthal source-receiver angle than <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> configurations...|$|R
40|$|Measured {{insertion}} losses due to {{the ground}} effects associated with low configurations of loosely stacked household bricks on a car park are reported. A particularly successful design has {{the form of a}} two brick high square lattice which is found to offer a similar insertion loss to regularly-spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> arrays of the same height but twice the total width. Part of the insertion loss {{due to the}} roughness configurations is the result of transfer of incident sound energy to surface waves which can be reduced by introducing wall absorption or material absorption in the form, for example, of shallow gravel layer. Predicted finite length effects have been explored using a Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain Method, which models the complete 3 D roughness profile. It is concluded from measurements and predictions that the lattice design has less dependence on azimuthal source-receiver angle than <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> configurations. These predictions are supported by measurements of level difference spectra as a function of azimuthal angle. A 2 D Boundary Element Method gives predictions that agree well with data for <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> arrays up to 16 m long and it is used to investigate the potential insertion loss of longer configurations up to 0. 3 m high. It has been found possible also to make predictions of the insertion loss due to infinitely long 3 D lattices using the 2 D BEM with the lattice represented by the surface impedance derived from fitting short range data with a slit-pore impedance model. The insertion losses of recessed configurations are predicted to be approximately 3 dB less than those of embossed configurations of the same size. Outdoor experiments also show that pathways can be made through such roughness configurations without significantly affecting their insertion loss. It is concluded that artificial roughness configurations could achieve substantial noise reduction along surface transport corridors without breaking line of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers...|$|R

40|$|Carbon nanofibers (CNF), with {{fishbone}} and <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> structures, {{were grown}} by catalytic {{chemical vapor deposition}} {{on the surface of}} carbon foam and stainless steel foam, in order to improve their heat exchange performance. Enhancement in heat transfer efficiency between 30 % and 75 % was achieved with CNF-modified stainless steel foam as measured in a filled copper channel for varied lengths of heat exchanger (between 0. 05 and 0. 01 m). The heat transfer coefficient of carbon foam decreased when modified with CNF by ∼ 40 % in average. The increase in heat transfer efficiency of the CNF-modified stainless steel foam is explained by an increase in surface area provided by the carbon filaments grown on stainless steel of one order of magnitude, and by the carbon fibers’ specific <b>parallel</b> <b>wall</b> structure, providing excellent thermal conductivity in the axial direction (h = 1130 W/K− 1 m− 2). However, nanofibers grown on carbon foam have fishbone type structure, exhibiting lesser conductivity in the axial direction resulting in lower thermal conductivity of the fibers from the wall to the air (h = 428 W/K− 1 m− 2). The higher crystallinity of carbon nanotubes of modified stainless steel material in contrast to chaotic mal-alignment and relatively high concentration of structural defects of carbon nanofibers grown on carbon foam can also contribute to the big difference in heat exchange propertie...|$|R
