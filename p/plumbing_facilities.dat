The design and development of a Scaleable Square Solar Sail System (S^ 4) is well underway a t AEC-Able Engineering Co. Inc., and the design and production of the Solar Sails for this system is being carried out by SRS Technologies. In April and May of 2004 a single quadrant 10 -meter system was tested at NASA LARC's vacuum chamber and a four quadrant 20 -meter system has been designed and built for deployment and testing in the Spring of 2005 at NASA/Glenn Research Center's <b>Plumb</b> Brook <b>Facility.</b> SRS has developed an effective and efficient design for triangular sail quadrants that are supported are three points and provide a flat reflective surface with a high fill factor. This sail design is robust enough for deployments in a one atmosphere, one gravity environment and incorporates several advanced features including adhesiveless seaming of membrane strips, compliant edge borders to allow for film membrane cord strain mismatch without causing wrinkling and low mass (3 % of total sail mass) ripstop. This paper will outline the sail design and fabrication process, the lessons learned and the resulting mature production, packaging and deployment processes that have been developed. It will also highlight the scalability of the equipment and processes that were developed to fabricate and package the sails. Based on recent experience, SRS is confidant that flight worthy solar sails in the 40 - 120 -meter size range with areal density in the 4 - 5 g/sq m (sail minus structure) range can be produced with existing technology. Additional film production research will lead to further reductions in film thickness to less than 1 micron enabling production of sails with areal densities as low as 20 g/sq m using the current design resulting in a system areal density of as low as 5. 3 g/sq m. These areal densities are low enough to allow nearly all of the Solar Sail missions that have been proposed by the scientific community and the fundamental technology required to produce these sails has been demonstrated on the ground test sails that have recently been built. These demonstrations have shown that the technology is mature enough to build sails needed to support critical science missions. Solar Sails will be an enabling technology for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration by allowing communication satellite orbits that can maintain continuous communication with the polar regions of the Moon and Mars and to support solar weather monitoring to provide early warning of solar flares and storms that could threaten the safety of astronauts and other spacecraft...|$|R

40|$|Surveillance for waterborne-disease {{outbreaks}} [...] United States, 1995 - 1996 : "Abstract Problem/Condition: Since 1971, CDC and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency {{have maintained}} a collaborative surveillance system for collecting and periodically reporting data {{that relate to}} occurrences and causes of waterborne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs). Reporting Period Covered: This summary includes data for January 1995 through December 1996 and previously unreported outbreaks in 1994. Description of the System: The surveillance system includes data about outbreaks associated with drinking water and recreational water. State, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and for voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. Results: For the period 1995 - 1996, 13 states reported a total of 22 outbreaks associated with drinking water. These outbreaks caused an estimated total of 2, 567 persons to become ill. No deaths were reported. The microbe or chemical that caused the outbreak was identified for 14 (63. 6 %) of the 22 outbreaks. Giardia lamblia and Shigella sonnei each caused two (9. 1 %) of the 22 outbreaks; Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and a small round structured virus were implicated for one outbreak (4. 5 %) each. One of the two outbreaks of giardiasis involved {{the largest number of}} cases, with an estimated 1, 449 ill persons. Seven outbreaks (31. 8 % of 22) of chemical poisoning, which involved a total of 90 persons, were reported. Copper and nitrite were associated with two outbreaks (9. 1 % of 22) each and sodium hydroxide, chlorine, and concentrated liquid soap with one outbreak (4. 5 %) each. Eleven (50. 0 %) of the 22 outbreaks were linked to well water, eight in noncommunity and three in community systems. Only three of the 10 outbreaks associated with community water systems were caused by problems at water treatment plants; the other seven resulted from problems in the water distribution systems and <b>plumbing</b> of individual <b>facilities</b> (e. g., a restaurant). Six of the seven outbreaks were associated with chemical contamination of the drinking water; the seventh outbreak was attributed to a small round structured virus. Four of the seven outbreaks occurred because of backflow or backsiphonage through a cross-connection, and two occurred because of high levels of copper that leached into water after the installation of new plumbing. For three of the four outbreaks caused by contamination from a cross-connection, an improperly installed vacuum breaker or a faulty backflow prevention device was identified; no protection against backsiphonage was found for the fourth outbreak. Thirty-seven outbreaks from 17 states were attributed to recreational water exposure and affected an estimated 9, 129 persons, including 8, 449 persons in two large outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. Twenty-two (59. 5 %) of these 37 were outbreaks of gastroenteritis; nine (24. 3 %) were outbreaks of dermatitis; and six (16. 2 %) were single cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri, all of which were fatal. The etiologic agent was identified for 33 (89. 2 %) of the 37 outbreaks. Six (27. 3 %) of the 22 outbreaks of gastroenteritis were caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and six (27. 3 %) by E. coli O 157 :H 7. All of the latter were associated with unchlorinated water (i. e., in lakes) or inadequately chlorinated water (i. e., in a pool). Thirteen (59. 1 %) of these 22 outbreaks were associated with lake water, eight (36. 4 %) with swimming or wading pools, and one(4. 5 %) with a hot spring. Of the nine outbreaks of dermatitis, seven (77. 8 %) were outbreaks of Pseudomonas dermatitis associated with hot tubs, and two (22. 2 %) were lake-associated outbreaks of swimmer's itch caused by Schistosoma species. Interpretation: WBDOs caused by E. coli O 157 :H 7 were reported more frequently than in previous years and were associated primarily with recreational lake water. This finding suggests the need for better monitoring of water quality and identification of sources of contamination. Although protozoan parasites, especially Cryptosporidium and Giardia, were associated with fewer reported outbreaks than in previous years, they caused large outbreaks that affected a total of approximately 10, 000 persons; all of the outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis were associated with recreational water, primarily swimming pools. Prevention of pool-associated outbreaks caused by chlorine-resistant parasites (e. g., Cryptosporidium {{and to a lesser extent}} Giardia) is particularly difficult because it requires improved filtration methods as well as education of patrons about hazards associated with fecal accidents, especially in pools frequented by diaper-aged children. The proportion of reported drinking water outbreaks associated with community water systems that were attributed to problems at water treatment plants has steadily declined since 1989 (i. e., 72. 7 % for 1989 - 1990, 62. 5 % for 1991 - 1992, 57. 1 % for 1993 - 1994, and 30. 0 % for 1995 - 1996). This decrease might reflect improvements in water treatment and in operation of plants. The outbreaks attributed to contamination in the distribution system suggest that efforts should be increased to prevent cross-connections, especially by installing and monitoring backflow prevention devices. Actions Taken: Surveillance data that identify the types of water systems, their deficiencies, and the etiologic agents associated with outbreaks are used to evaluate the adequacy of current technologies for providing safe drinking and recreational water. In addition, they are used to establish research priorities and can lead to improved water-quality regulations. " - p. 1 Cardiovascular disease risk factors and preventive practices among adults [...] United States, 1994 : a behavioral risk factor atlas : "PROBLEM/CONDITIONS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, is the leading cause of death in the United States, and state rates of CVD vary by state and by region of the country. Several behavioral risk factors (i. e., overweight, physical inactivity, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) and preventive practices (i. e., weight loss and smoking cessation) are associated with the development of CVD and also vary geographically. This summary displays and analyzes geographic variation in the prevalences of selected CVD risk factors. REPORTING PERIOD: 1994 (1992 for prevalence of hypertension). DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based random-digit-dialing telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged > or = 18 years; 50 states and the District of Columbia participated in BRFSS in 1994, and 48 states and the District of Columbia participated in 1992. METHODS: Several different analyses were conducted: a) analysis of state risk factor and preventive practice prevalences by sex and race (i. e., black and white); b) mapping; c) cluster analysis; d) correlations of state prevalence rates by sex and race; and e) regression of state risk factor prevalences on state CHD and stroke mortality rates. RESULTS: Mapping the prevalence of selected CVD risk factors and preventive health practices indicates substantial geographic variation for black and white men and women, as confirmed by cluster analysis. Data for blacks are limited by small sample size, especially in western states. Geographic clustering is found for physical inactivity, smoking, and risk factor combinations. Risk factor prevalences are generally lower in the West and higher in the East. White men and white women are more similar in state risk factor rates than other race-sex pairs; white women and black women ranked second in similarity. State prevalences of physical inactivity and hypertension are strongly associated with state mortality rates of CVD. INTERPRETATION: Geographic patterns of risk factor prevalence suggest the presence (or absence) of sociocultural environments that promote (or inhibit) the given risk factor or preventive behavior. Because the risk factors examined in this summary are associated with CVD, further exploration of the reasons underlying observed geographic patterns might be useful. The BRFSS will continue to provide geographic data about cardiovascular health behaviors with a possible emphasis on more data-based small- area analyses and mapping. This will permit states to more adequately monitor trends that affect the burden of CVD in their regions and the United States. Mapping also facilitates the exploration of patterns of morbidity, health-care use, and mortality, as well as the epidemiology of risk factors. Finally, by identifying those segments of the population with high levels of these risk factors and lower levels of the preventive health practices, public health personnel can better allocate resources and target intervention efforts for the prevention of CVD.

40|$|Home {{production}} has dramatically changed {{during the course}} of the 20 th century and labor saving technologies, from running water to modern appliances, have reduced the time demands of home production. This paper uses 1940 and 1950 US Census data to assess the impact of the increased diffusion of <b>plumbing</b> <b>facilities</b> and modern refrigeration (which presence nearly doubled during the decade) on female labor market supply and occupational choices. It finds that increased female labor force participation rates are strongly correlated with the increased adoption of indoor <b>plumbing</b> <b>facilities</b> but not with the increased adoption of modern refrigerators. For counties in the South however, there is a positive correlation between increases in female labor force participation rates and the adoption of modern refrigerators. One interpretation is that in these counties the benefits of modern refrigeration were higher- either because of the weather, because ice was not easily available and/or because of being further away from shopping areas. Despite the important increase in clerical occupations during these two decades, this study finds that neither clerical nor professional jobs (which were the best paid occupations) increased relatively to other occupations in counties which experienced higher adoption of modern refrigerators. The implications of these results are important to modelling technological changes to the household production function and suggest giving less weight to durables and the acquisition of modern appliances- or formal inclusion of substitutes- and more weight to improvements in the structure of the house...|$|E

Among different land cover/land use variables evaluated, urban areas (high and medium intensity urban areas and urban areas in general) and evergreen forests and forest/woodlands in general were significant risk factors. Among socio-economic and demographic determinants evaluated, houses lacking complete <b>plumbing</b> <b>facilities,</b> poverty status by age (18 - 64), and living within 2500 meters of a university/college or parks/forests were significant risk factors. Proximity to water features, hydrologic density and frequently flooded areas were identified as significant risk factors for canine leptospirosis among hydrologic and soil-hydrologic variables. Pet owners whose dogs live in such areas or under these circumstances should consider vaccination to prevent canine leptospirosis...|$|E
40|$|After having {{researched}} {{a construction}} {{system based on}} CAD-CAM and CNC, {{we come to the}} conclusion that this system is appropriate for implementing it in refurbishment processes in old buildings. More precisely, refurbishment in buildings erected before industrialization with wooden structure and masonry facades in dense and historic city quarters. The main goals of the construction system are the recyclability of all elements, energy savings, bioclimatic performance, economy, accuracy and safety in the building site and simple procedures to write the project documentation. The old quarters accessibility is often a handicap for implementing standardized components. In this case, the structural panels can be elevated to the floors with a reasonable physical effort for the worker, using the staircase, instead of an electric elevator. Moreover, the heterogeneous personal economical resources of the neighbours in the building, is often an added problem for executing overall refurbishment of buildings. This system allows to make partial refurbishments and can work in different phases. The new program layout planned for the buildings or apartments solved with the common refurbishment technologies and systems, requires an added slab of 20 cm for the drainage piping system. The application of the system can avoid this. The construction system is adaptable to any geometry. In this way, there is no problem to applying the system on non-orthogonal plots. Using a CAD-CAM coordinated system the structure is easily adaptable to irregular geometries and dimensions. During the first industrial era, in the historic city centre buildings, the insertion of plumbing system in a wooden structure building was rarely successful. The wooden structure near these <b>plumbing</b> <b>facilities,</b> is almost always rotten or damaged. The proposed construction system offers a solution for this problematic. Normally such historic buildings don´t have a correct insulation. The system allows a bioclimatic performance of the whole building...|$|E
