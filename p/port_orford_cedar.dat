25|$|A large {{concentration}} of diverse coniferous species of trees exists in these mountains. Thirty conifer species (or more, {{depending on where}} one delineates the region) inhabit the area, including two endemic species, the Brewer's spruce and the <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> <b>cedar,</b> making the Klamath Mountains {{one of the richest}} coniferous forest regions of {{the world in terms of}} concentrated species diversity. The region also has several edaphic plant communities, adapted to specific soil types, notably serpentine outcrops.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to several}} factors, {{including}} climate, weather, and terrain, {{there is a}} great variety of plants within the coast region. In some areas, large trees are uncommon. This is because severe winter storms and poor soil limit the growing height of many species. Shore pine (Pinus contorta subsp.contorta) are common in these areas. However several species of fir, pine, and cedar can be found, including a few endemic species, such as the <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> <b>cedar</b> (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). Because of this, logging has been a historically viable trade for the region. In the North Coast region near Astoria, and in Lincoln County, large tracts of land are second and third generation woodland, having been logged and replanted in the past.|$|E

50|$|During the 1850s the Tututni game {{trails and}} hunting grounds were {{destroyed}} by whites clearing land for farms. In 1851 some settlers built <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> on Tututni land. The Tututni came under more pressure as settlers and miners were attracted to <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> after the discovery of gold in the Rogue River valley. Mining activities heightened the competition for resources and tensions between the Tututni and the European Americans. Armed conflicts finally led to the Rogue River Wars of 1855-1856, in which United States troops, volunteer militia and others fought against the Native Americans. On February 1856 Tututni attacked the Gold Beach Guards, who were encamped opposite the large Tututni village at <b>Port</b> <b>Orford.</b> In the conflict the Tututni burned most of the settlers' homes between <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> and Smith River.|$|R
500|$|With the {{exception}} of rocky alpine regions in the highest mountains, the Trinity River watershed is almost entirely forested. Mixed coniferous (fir and pine) forests dominate the landscape at elevations of up to [...] Common tree species include ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir, sugar pine, knobcone pine and incense cedar. The watershed also includes some hardwood forests, typically located along canyon bottoms and streams, which are home to black oak, madrone, tanbark oak, canyon live oak and bigleaf maple. Stands of <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> <b>cedar</b> are common along the upper Trinity River; Oregon white oak is widespread throughout lower elevations.

Fir forests comprise almost 74percent of the forests in the Trinity River watershed; pine and hardwoods account for 13percent each. There are also limited amounts of chaparral, brush and grass/rangeland within the basin.

40|$|August 31, 2010 <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> {{is a small}} fishing {{community}} on the southern Oregon coast. Like many coastal towns in Oregon, <b>Port</b> <b>Orford's</b> main economy is the commercial fishing industry. As such, the community has a high dependence on its nearshore marine resources.

The market for live fish in <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> has increased rapidly {{over the past two}} decades.
