40|$|Abstract <b>Position</b> <b>effects</b> {{may occur}} in both paper–pencil tests and {{computerized}} assessments when examinees {{respond to the}} same test items located in different positions on the test. To examine <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> in large-scale assessments, previous studies often used multilevel item response models within the generalized linear mixed modeling framework. Using the equivalence of the item response theory and binary factor analysis frameworks when modeling dichotomous item responses, this study introduces a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach {{that is capable of}} estimating various types of <b>position</b> <b>effects.</b> Using real data from a large-scale reading assessment, the SEM approach is demonstrated for investigating form, passage position, and item <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> for reading items.

40|$|Whenever {{competing}} {{options are}} considered in sequence, their evaluations {{may be affected}} by order of appearance. Such serial <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> would threaten the fairness of competitions using jury evaluations. Randomization cannot reduce potential order effects, but it does give candidates an equal chance of being assigned to preferred serial positions. Whether, or what, serial <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> emerge may depend on the cognitive demands of the judgment task. In end-of-sequence procedures, final scores are not given until all candidates have performed, possibly burdening judges’ memory. If judges’ evaluations are based on how well they remember performances, serial <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> may resemble those found with free recall. Candidates may also be evaluated step-by-step, immediately after each performance. This procedure should not burden memory, though it may produce different serial <b>position</b> <b>effects.</b> Yet, this paper reports similar serial <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> with end-of-sequence and step-by-step procedures used for the Eurovision Song Contest: Ratings increased with serial position. The linear order effect was replicated in the step-by-step judgments of World and European Figure Skating Contests. It is proposed that, independent of the evaluation procedure, judges’ initial impressions of sequentially appearing candidates may be formed step-by-step, yielding serial <b>position</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{learning}} curve described by Ebbinghaus refers to how fast one learns information.

The two main concepts in the serial <b>position</b> <b>effect</b> are recency and primacy. The recency effect describes the increased recall {{of the most recent}} information because it is still in the short-term memory. The primacy effect causes better memory of the first items in a list due to increased rehearsal and commitment to long-term memory.|$|E

Nevertheless, <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> remain poorly characterized. Here, we present a systematic analysis of chromosomal <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> by characterizing single-cell gene expression from euchromatic positions spanning the length of a eukaryotic chromosome. We demonstrate that position affects gene expression by modulating the size of transcriptional bursts, rather than their frequency, and that the histone deacetylase Sir 2 plays a role in this process across the chromosome...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{transgene}} insertions {{differ in}} expression {{based on their}} location in the genome; these <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> are of interest because they reflect the influence of genome organization on gene regulation. <b>Position</b> <b>effects</b> also represent potentially insurmountable obstacles to the rigorous functional comparison of homologous genes from different species because (i) quantitative variation in expression of each gene across genomic <b>positions</b> (generalized <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> or GPEs) may overwhelm differences between the genes of interest, or (ii) divergent genes may be differentially sensitive to <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> reflecting unique interactions between each gene and its genomic milieu (lineage-specific <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> or LSPEs). We have investigated both types of position-effect variation by applying our method of transgene coplacement, which allows comparisons of transgenes {{in the same position}} in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report an experimental test for LSPE in Drosophila. The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes of D. melanogaster and Drosophila affinidisjuncta differ in both tissue distribution and amounts of ADH activity. Despite this striking regulatory divergence, we found a very high correlation in overall ADH activity between the genes of the two species when placed in the same genomic position as assayed in otherwise Adh-null adults and larvae. These results argue against the influence of LSPE for these sequences, although the effects of GPE are significant. Our new findings validate the coplacement approach and show that it greatly magnifies the power to detect differences in expression between transgenes. Transgene coplacement thus dramatically extends the range of functional and evolutionary questions that can be addressed by transgenic technology...|$|R

50|$|<b>Position</b> <b>effect</b> is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the variation of expression exhibited by identical transgenes that insert into different regions of a genome.

Since each transgenic organism has the transgene in a different location each transgenic organism has the potential for a unique expression pattern.|$|E

40|$|The white gene, {{which is}} {{responsible}} for eye pigmentation, is widely used to study <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> in Drosophila. As a result of insertion of P-element vectors containing mini-white without enhancers into random chromosomal sites, flies with different eye color phenotypes appear, which is usually explained by the influence of positive/negative regulatory elements located around the insertion site. We found that, in more than 70 % of cases when mini-white expression was subject to positive <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> deletion of the white promoter had no effect on eye pigmentation; in these cases, the transposon was inserted into the transcribed regions of genes. Therefore, transcription through the mini-white gene could be responsible for high levels of its expression in most of chromosomal sites. Consistently with this conclusion, transcriptional terminators proved to be efficient in protecting mini-white expression from positive <b>position</b> <b>effects.</b> On the other hand, the best characterized Drosophila gypsy insulator was poorly effective in terminating transcription and, as a consequence, only partially protected mini-white expression from these effects. Thus, to ensure maximum protection of a transgene from <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> a perfect boundary/insulator element should combine three activities: to block enhancers, to provide a barrier between active and repressed chromatin, and to terminate transcription...|$|R

40|$|Germ line {{transformation}} of white− Drosophila embryos with P-element vectors containing white expression cassettes results in flies with different eye color phenotypes due to <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> at {{the sites of}} transgene insertion.

We have used this system to determine whether human matrix attachment regions (MARs) can function as insulator elements in vivo. Two different human MARs, from the apolipoprotein B and α 1 -antitrypsin loci, insulated white transgene expression from <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. Both elements reduced variability in transgene expression without enhancing levels of white gene expression. In contrast, expression of white transgenes containing human DNA segments without matrix-binding activity was highly variable in Drosophila transformants.

50|$|In humans, {{the role}} of subtelomere {{disorders}} is demonstrated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), Alzheimer's disease, and peculiar syndromic diseases (malformation and mental retardation).

A series of 10 to >100 kb repeats is located in the normal 4q subtelomere, but FSHD patients have only 1-10 repeat units. This deletion is thought to cause disease owing to a <b>position</b> <b>effect</b> that influences the transcription ofnearby genes, rather than through the loss of the repeat array itself.|$|E

5000|$|Recency in {{the serial}} <b>position</b> <b>effect</b> can be {{explained}} because more recent memories encoded will share a temporal context most similar to the present context, as the stochastic nature of time will not have had as pronounced an effect.

The stochastic contextual drift is also thought to account for forgetting because {{the context in which}} a memory was encoded is lost over time, so summed similarity for an item only presented in that context will decrease over time.|$|E

40|$|Posttranslational {{modifications}} and remodeling of nucleosomes {{are critical}} {{factors in the}} regulation of transcription. Higher-order folding of chromatin also is likely {{to contribute to the}} control of gene expression, but the absence of {{a detailed description of the}} structure of the chromatin fiber has impaired progress in this area. Mammalian somatic cells contain a set of H 1 linker-histone subtypes, H 1 (0) and H 1 a to H 1 e, that bind to nucleosome core particles and to the linker DNA between nucleosomes. To determine whether the H 1 histone subtypes play differential roles in the regulation of gene expression, we combined mice lacking specific H 1 histone subtypes with mice carrying transgenes subject to <b>position</b> <b>effects.</b> Because <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> result from the unique chromatin structure created by the juxtaposition of regulatory elements in the transgene and at the site of integration, transgenes can serve as exquisitely sensitive indicators of chromatin structure. We report that some, but not all, linker histones can attenuate or accentuate <b>position</b> <b>effects.</b> The results suggest that the linker-histone subtypes play differential roles in the control of gene expression and that the sequential arrangement of the linker histones on the chromatin fiber might regulate higher-order chromatin structure and fine-tune expression levels...|$|R
5000|$|Serial <b>position</b> <b>effect</b> is the {{tendency}} of a person to recall {{the first and last}} items in a [...] best, and the middle items worst. The term was coined by Hermann Ebbinghaus through studies he performed on himself, and refers to the finding that recall accuracy varies as a function of an item's position within a study list. When asked to recall a list of items in any order (free recall), people tend to begin recall {{with the end of the}} list, recalling those items best (the recency effect). Among earlier list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the primacy effect).|$|E

Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the Von Restorff effect.Many models of working memory have been made.

40|$|Previous articulatory {{studies have}} shown that English syllable-initial and syllable-final consonants exhibit {{different}} patterns of gestural organization. These differences – syllable <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> – are manifested primarily in the relative timing and magnitude of gestures. In general, syllable-initial consonants show more stable patterns of coordination and “tighter ” articu-latory constrictions than the same consonants in syllable-final position. This paper addresses the question of whether syllable <b>position</b> <b>effects</b> hold for other languages by examining the articulatory properties of some Rus-sian syllable-initial and syllable final consonants: the palatal glide /j / and labial stops /pj / and /p/. In general, the articulometer (EMMA) results con-firm the hypothesis that the same consonants in these two positions differ with respect to their inter-gestural timing and gestural magnitude. At the same time, some predictions made based on patterns observed in English are not supported. The results thus provide evidence that, although syllable positions are characterized by different patterns of gestural organization, actual manifestations of this organization are not always the same; they may vary between gestures within a language and between similar gestures in different languages. It is further suggested that while the task-dynamics of gestural coordination is crucial to explaining syllable <b>position</b> <b>effects,</b> some non-contrastive and variable information still has to be specified – possibly by being lexically encoded. 1.
