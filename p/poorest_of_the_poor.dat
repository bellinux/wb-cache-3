Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high {{compared to that of}} traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok.

It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always the <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers often felt betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E
500|$|From 2003 to 2007, {{the number}} of piracy {{incidents}} worldwide declined from 452 to 282; however, piracy increased by 100% in Somalia, which suffered from severe poverty and lacked an effective central government since the 1991 ouster of Siad Barre. By 2005, the International Maritime Bureau advised ships to stay 200 nautical miles off the Somalian coast. According to academics J. Ndumbe Anyu and Samuel Moki, [...] "the overwhelming majority of pirates in Somalia come from Puntland, a semi-autonomous region in the northeast of the country... where [...] <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> live." [...] By 2008, as Anyu and Moki write, Somalia was the [...] "epicenter of piracy," [...] with 100 ships attacked that year; pirate ransom demands had spiked [...] "from {{tens of thousands of}} dollars a few years before to between $500,000 and $3.5 million," [...] since shipowners were willing to pay relatively small amounts to recover much more expensive ships. Pirates extorted about $120 million in ransoms in 2008. Accordingly, insurance premiums for shipping in the Gulf of Aden increased ten times from 2007 to 2008, from $900 to $9,000. The pirates frequently targeted yachts or commercial ships, which are unarmed and may hold valuable cargo. They sometimes targeted ships bearing humanitarian aid, such as the MV Semlow and MV Miltzow in 2005, which were hijacked while delivering food to Somalia under the UN World Food Programme. Despite international naval patrols working to curb piracy, The Telegraph noted that the region remained [...] "the most dangerous in the world for pirate attacks," [...] with 24 attacks between April and June 2008. In addition, 94 mariners were captured in the Gulf of Aden in the first half of the year.|$|E
