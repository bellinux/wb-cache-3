40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} a <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> from <b>scattered</b> field data, is addressed within the Heitler equation. This equation relates the on shell {{components of the}} T matrix directly to the scattering: potential. This relationship leads to a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm for recovering {{the distribution of the}} possibly complex index of refraction of the <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> from measurements of the scattered field outside the potential at a single frequency. Reconstructions of cylindrical objects from data obtained in a suite of scattering experiments show that the method can handle relatively large objects compared to the wavelength whose index of refraction is close to the index of refraction of the surrounding medium...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{electron}} and phonon transport characteristics {{is crucial for}} designing and developing high performance thermoelectric materials. Weak scattering effects on charge carriers, characterized by deformation <b>potential</b> and alloy <b>scattering</b> <b>potential,</b> are favorable for thermoelectric solid solutions to enable high carrier mobility and thereby promising thermoelectric performance. Mg_ 2 (Si,Sn) solid solutions have attracted much attention due to their low cost and environmental compatibility. Usually, their high thermoelectric performance with ZT ∼ 1 is ascribed to the band convergence and reduced lattice thermal conductivity caused by alloying. In this work, both a low deformation potential Ξ = 13 eV and a low alloy <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> U = 0. 7 eV are found for the thermoelectric alloys by characterizing and modeling of thermoelectric transport properties. The band convergence is also verified by the increased density-of-states effective mass. It is proposed that, in addition to band convergence and reduced lattice thermal conductivity, the low deformation <b>potential</b> and alloy <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> are additional intrinsic features {{that contribute to the}} high thermoelectric performance of the solid solutions...|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Regge {{discovered}} a mathematical property of <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> in the Schrödinger equation—that the scattering amplitude {{can be thought}} of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determines power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle (i.e. , requiring complex angles). This formulation is known as Regge theory. Regge trajectory, a part of Regge's theory which tries to explain slowly rising cross section of hadronic collisions at high energies, was first demonstrated at CERN for Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR).|$|E
5000|$|The main {{result of}} {{the theory is that}} the {{scattering}} amplitude for <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> grows {{as a function of the}} cosine [...] of the scattering angle as a power that changes as the scattering energy changes:where [...] is the noninteger value of the angular momentum of a would-be bound state with energy [...] It is determined by solving the radial Schrödinger equation and it smoothly interpolates the energy of wavefunctions with different angular momentum but with the same radial excitation number. The trajectory function is a function of [...] for relativistic generalization.

5000|$|The shape {{resonances}} {{were observed}} around the years 1949-54 in nuclear scattering experiments. They indicate broad asymmetric {{peaks in the}} scattering cross section of neutrons or protons scattered by nuclei. The name [...] "shape resonance" [...] has been introduced to describe {{the fact that the}} resonance in the <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> for the particle of energy E is controlled by the shape of the nucleus. In fact the shape resonance occurs where the integral number of wavelengths of the particle sit within the potential of the nucleus of radius R. Therefore, the measure of the energies of the shape resonances in the neutron-nucleus scattering have been used in the years from 1947 to 1954 to measure the radii R of the nuclei with the precision of ±1×10−13 cm as it {{can be seen in the}} chapter [...] "Elastic Cross Sections" [...] of A Textbook in Nuclear Physics by R.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of wave tails has {{attracted much attention}} over the years from both physicists and mathematicians. However, our understanding of this fascinating phenomenon is not complete yet. In particular, most former studies of the tail phenomenon have focused on <b>scattering</b> <b>potentials</b> which approach zero asymptotically (x→∞) faster than x^- 2. It is well-known that for these (rapidly decaying) <b>scattering</b> <b>potentials</b> the late-time tails {{are determined by the}} first Born approximation and are therefore linear in the amplitudes of the <b>scattering</b> <b>potentials</b> (there are, however, some exceptional cases in which the first Born approximation vanishes and one has to consider higher orders of the scattering problem). In the present study we analyze in detail the late-time dynamics of the Klein-Gordon wave equation with a (slowly decaying) Coulomb-like scattering potential: V(x→∞) =α/x. In particular, we write down an explicit solution (that is, an exact analytic solution which is not based on the first Born approximation) for this scattering problem. It is found that the asymptotic (t→∞) late-time behavior of the fields depends non-linearly on the amplitude α of the <b>scattering</b> <b>potential.</b> This non-linear dependence on the amplitude of the <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> reflects the fact that the late-time dynamics associated with this slowly decaying <b>scattering</b> <b>potential</b> is dominated by multiple scattering from asymptotically far regions.

In 1950, William Vallance Douglas Hodge presented [...] "The topological invariants of algebraic varieties" [...] at the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians. Between 1954 and 1957, Eugenio Calabi worked on the Calabi conjecture for Kähler metrics and the development of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In 1957, Tullio Regge formulated the mathematical property of <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> in the Schrödinger equation. Stanley Mandelstam, along with Regge, did the initial development of the Regge theory of strong interaction phenomenology. In 1958, Murray Gell-Mann and Richard Feynman, along with George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak, deduced the chiral structures of the weak interaction in physics. Geoffrey Chew, along with others, would promote matrix notation for the strong interaction, and the associated bootstrap principle, in 1960. In the 1960s, set-builder notation was developed for describing a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Also in the 1960s, tensors are abstracted within category theory by means of the concept of monoidal category. Later, multi-index notation eliminates conventional notions used in multivariable calculus, partial differential equations, and the theory of distributions, by abstracting the concept of an integer index to an ordered tuple of indices.|$|E
5000|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} inverse scattering problems {{is given in}} {{a long series of}} papers (see monographs, and papers,) where a summary of some of the author’s results is given. In a recent paper [...] the problem which has been open for many decades is solved: uniqueness of the solution to a non-overdetermined inverse scattering problem is proved. Exact inversion of low-frequency scattering data is given in the book. [...] A powerful method, Property C method, based on the notion of completeness of the set of products of solutions of PDE is developed and applied to many important inverse problems. In these works several problems are solved which have been open for decades. For example, the first global uniqueness theorems in geophysics and <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> with fixed-energy data are obtained, the first mathematically justified method for solving the 3D inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data is given, and, for the first time, stability estimates for the solution to the inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data are obtained.The first variational principle for solving inverse scattering problems which is equivalent to the inverse problems was found; this work is published as a monograph, which is an expanded version of monograph, translated into Russian in 1994. Very recently (paper [...] ) a fundamentally new uniqueness theorem is obtained: it says that a compactly supported real-valued square-integrable spherically symmetric potential is uniquely defined by any part of the fixed-energy phase shifts with the angular momenta [...] running through an arbitrary set [...] of non-negative integers such that [...] Property C is defined and proved for ordinary differential equations (ODE) and its many new applications are demonstrated. Most of the known results for one-dimensional inverse problems are obtained by using this property, and many new results. Among the classical results which are obtained by using property C for ODE are Marchenko and Borg’s uniqueness theorems concerning recovery of the potential from two spectra and from scattering data or spectral function. Inverse problems for an inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation are studied for the first time, a non-over-determined three-dimensional inverse problem of recovery of a potential from the diagonal values of the spectral function known on the boundary of a bounded domain and all real values of the spectral parameter is considered and a uniqueness theorem is proved for this problem. [...] A new approximate method for solving the inverse scattering problem with fixed energy data is given for a spherically symmetric potentials which are known for r > a but unknown for , where [...] is an arbitrary large fixed number. Numerical results are obtained by this method. Krein’s method in inverse scattering is justified and its consistency is proved. Analytical theory is given for inversion of the surface scattering data in the ground-penetrating radar problem for two functions: permittivity and conductivity of the ground, under the assumption that these functions depend on the vertical coordinate only,. A method for recovery of a quarkonium system from experimental data is developed. Inverse problem of finding point scatterers from the surface scattering data is posed and solved. For the first time uniqueness theorems are proved for three-dimensional scattering problems with non-overdetermined data. Stability of the Pompeiu property is established [...] and further results are obtained. In papers [...] and [...] a method for constructing a ”smart material” is given. It is proved that one can distribute small particles in a bounded domain so that the resulting material has the a priori chosen radiation pattern. Moreover, a method for calculating the density of these particles and their properties is developed. In paper [...] theory of scalar wave scattering by one and many small bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed for various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, transmission). In paper [...] theory of EM (electromagnetic) wave scattering by one and many small impedance bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed. Methods for creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient are given {{on the basis of the}} above theory.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{numerical}} {{results are}} derived for transport properties of Kondo impurity systems with <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> and orbital degeneracy. Using the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method, static and dynamic physical quantities are derived {{in a wide}} temperature range across the Kondo temperature T_K. With strong <b>potential</b> <b>scattering,</b> the resistivity tends to decrease with decreasing temperature, {{in contrast to the}} ordinary Kondo effect. Correspondingly, the quasi-particle density of states obtains the antiresonance around the Fermi level. Thermopower also shows characteristic deviation from the standard Kondo behavior, while magnetic susceptibility follows the universal temperature dependence even with strong <b>potential</b> <b>scattering.</b> It is found that the t-matrix in the presence of <b>potential</b> <b>scattering</b> is not a relevant quantity for the Friedel sum rule, for which a proper limit of the f-electron Green's function is introduced. The optical theorem is also discussed in the context of Kondo impurity models with <b>potential</b> <b>scattering.</b> It is shown that optical theorem holds not only in the Fermi-liquid range but also for large energies, and therefore is less restrictive than the Friedel sum rule.
