The goal {{of the study was}} to understand the effect of interlayer coupling, dilution of magnetic atoms in the lattice, and symmetry-changing strain. Experimental work by T. M. Giebultowicz et al. and J. A. Borchers et al. greatly inspired my work [1, 2]. J. A. Borchers's group studied NiO/CoO superlattices and observed that the magnetic order of CoO persisted above its Neel temperature due to the effect of interlayer coupling with NiO, which has a higher Neel temperature than CoO [1]. Simulating on a model of NiO/CoO bilayer reproduced the experimental results from Borchers et al. [1]. I concluded that exchange pinning on the NiO/CoO interface preserves the magnetic order of CoO above its Neel temperature significantly. Building on this initial result, a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/ferromagnet (FM/AFM/FM) trilayer model was studied, where the ferromagnetic (FM) layers were antiferromagnetically coupled. First, I calculated the strength of the AF coupling as a function of the number of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spacer monolayers and concluded that the strength of AFM coupling decreases as the number of AFM spacer monolayers increases. Secondly, I added a uniaxial anisotropy to the model and obtained magnetization curves which exhibited hysteresis-like features with an external field and a first order magnetic transition. Lastly, I diluted the AFM spacer layer in the FM/AFM/FM trilayer by replacing magnetic spins with zero spins in the model. The dilution of AFM spacer layer caused fluctuations in the magnetization curves with external field but the strength of AFM coupling decreases as the number of AFM monolayers increases as in the nondiluted cases. The experimental results from T. M. Giebultowicz's group on MnSe/ZnTe superlattices by neutron scattering showed incommensurate helical spin order in MnSe, where MnSe layers were under tensile strain due to a small mismatching in the lattice parameter [2]. In addition, they observed that the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spin</b> helix increased as the temperature increased [2]. I modeled the MnSe/ ZnTe system with Monte Carlo method and found that the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spin</b> helix increased with temperature. In fact, the dependence <b>of</b> helix <b>pitch</b> on temperature was present regardless of the thickness of the sample, so I concluded that this pitch increase is not from the weakening of coupling <b>of</b> surface <b>spin...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{considered}} a spin chain with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The conditions <b>of</b> the spiral <b>spin</b> state {{as the ground}} state were analyzed. Our method was to build {{the connection between the}} spiral state and the fully polarized state with a unitary transformation. Under this transformation, anisotropic exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can be transformed to each other. Then we used positive semi-definite matrix theorem to identify the region of fully polarized state as the ground state for the transformed Hamiltonian, and it is the region <b>of</b> spiral <b>spin</b> state as the ground state of the original Hamiltonian. We also found that the effect of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is important. Its strength is related to the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>of</b> spiral <b>spins.</b> Our method can be applied to coupled spin chains and two dimensional triangular lattice systems. The result can be compared with experiment data. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Background. This work {{is devoted}} to the {{application}} of geometrical optics formalism to describe the behavior <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> waves, which is propagating in a ferromagnetic medium with non-uniform distribution of magnetic parameters. Use of this approach allows to describe the process <b>of</b> refraction <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> waves to determine the focal length <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> lenses or mirrors and to operate it by changing the frequency <b>of</b> the <b>spin</b> wave with a given magnetic parameters of a medium. Objective. The objective is to calculate the index of refraction, reflection coefficient and focal length <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> lens as function <b>of</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> waves, the external magnetic field and magnetic parameters of the medium. Methods. In this paper, to find the refractive index and the focal length was used the geometrical optics approach. To describe the dynamics of the magnetization vector the formalism was used of the parameter <b>of</b> order <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> density that also gives an opportunity to use the methods of quantum mechanics to calculate the spin wave reflection coefficient. Results. In the paper the refractive index and focal length <b>of</b> a bulk <b>spin</b> lens have been found. By considering the generalized boundary conditions the expression has been found for the reflection coefficient <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> lens. In addition, results of investigation says that strong dependence exists <b>of</b> transparency <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> lens on the frequency <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> waves that is characterized by corresponding magnetic parameters of structure. Conclusions. It is shown the possibility to change ?optical? spin lens parameters {{in a wide range of}} values by changing only the frequency <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> waves and keeping constant the values of the external magnetic field and magnetic structure parameters. In addition, the results of studies prove that exists a strong dependence <b>of</b> the <b>spin</b> lens transparency on the quality of its borders, which is characterized by appropriate parameters of interface. ????????????. ?????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ???????? ????????? ???????? ????, ??????? ???????????????? ? ?????????????? ????? ? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????. ????????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ????, ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??? ????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ????????? ?? ?? ???? ????????? ??????? ???????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ?????. ???? ????????????. ????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????, ???????????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? ???????? ?????, ???????? ?????????? ???? ? ????????? ?????????? ?????. ???????? ??????????. ??? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????. ??? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????, ??? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ?????????. ?????????? ????????????. ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ?????. ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??????????????? ????????? ??? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????. ???????? ??????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????? ?? ??????? ???????? ???? ??? ?????? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????. ??????. ???????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ? ??????? ????????? ????????, ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ? ???????? ??? ???? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ???? ? ????????? ?????????? ?????????. ?????????? ???????????? ??????????, ??? ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????? ?? ??????, ??????? ??????????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ??????????...|$|R
