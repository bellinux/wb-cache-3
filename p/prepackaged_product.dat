40|$|IntroductionThis {{qualitative}} study explores facilitators and barriers to a proposed food procurement {{policy that would}} require food purchasers, distributors, and vendors of food service in the County of Los Angeles government to meet specified nutrition standards, including limits on sodium content. MethodsWe conducted 30 key informant interviews. Interviewees represented 18 organizations from the County of Los Angeles government departments that purchased, distributed, or sold food; public and private non-County entities that had previously implemented food procurement policies in their organizations; and large organizations that catered food to the County. ResultsStudy participants reported 3 key facilitators: their organization’s authority to impose nutrition standards, their organization’s desire to provide nutritious food, {{and the opportunity to}} build on existing nutrition policies. Eight key barriers were identified: 1) unique features among food service settings, 2) costs and unavailability of low-sodium foods, 3) complexity of food service arrangements, 4) lack of consumer demand for low-sodium foods, 5) undesirable taste of low-sodium foods, 6) preference for <b>prepackaged</b> <b>products,</b> 7) lack of knowledge and experience in operationalizing sodium standards, and 8) existing multiyear contracts that are difficult to change. Despite perceived barriers, several participants indicated that their organizations have successfully implemented nutritional standards that include limits on sodium. ConclusionDeveloping or changing policies for procuring food represents a potentially feasible strategy for reducing sodium consumption in food service venues controlled by the County of Los Angeles. The facilitators and barriers identified here can inform the formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation of sodium reduction policies in other jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|Title: Unexpected {{allergic}} reactions to food in adult patients with hazelnut or peanut allergy: an explorative study. Background: There {{is lack of}} knowledge about the prevalence, incidence, severity and causes of unexpected {{allergic reactions}} to food in adult. Previous studies are often carried out in mixed populations, with a qualitative and/or retrospective design. Aim and research question(s) : Contribute to improvement of information from health care professionals, and food safety {{to reduce the number of}} allergic reactions. The abbreviated research question was: what is the period prevalence, incidence, severity and causes of unexpected allergic reactions to food in peanut and/or hazelnut allergic adults? Method: A quantitative, explorative study, with a retrospective and longitudinal, prospective part. Peanut and hazelnut allergic adults were non-random recruited from a Dutch academic hospital. Data collection took place between January and June 2012. The main study parameter was period prevalence. Two questionnaires were used for retrospective data collection. One questionnaire was used for prospective data collection, during a longitudinal period of 8 - 12 weeks. Parameters were analysed with descriptive and univariate analyses. Results: Thirty-four participants were included. The 5 -year period prevalence was in 52 %, > 10 reactions. The person time incidence rate was 0. 17 reactions per person-month. Of the retrospective reported reactions, 30 % was severe. Causes were prepackaged/fresh products (46 %), constituted dishes at home (2 %) and constituted dishes outside the home (30 %). Of the prospective reported reactions on <b>prepackaged</b> <b>products</b> (n= 7), three participants read the label. Conclusion: Peanut and hazelnut allergic adults often experience allergic reaction, whereof almost a third is severe. Reactions on constituted dishes mostly occur outside the home. There are food labelling and attitude issues, for example not every label mentions all allergens and not every patient reads labelling. Recommendations: Improve information from health care professionals about management of food allergy and prevention of allergic reactions. Improve food safety, e. g. improving food labelling and knowledge about food allergy in public eating places...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to first}} {{investigate}} how unit pricing affects consumers’ grocery purchase decisions {{and perceptions of}} the shopping task’s information load. The second goal is to test how time pressure enhances the behavioural and perceptual effects of displaying unit prices. Design/methodology/approach - Two on-line experiments were conducted using national samples of shoppers. In Study 1, participants indicated their choices and perceptions in an inter-brand shopping scenario where <b>prepackaged</b> <b>products</b> have conflicting positions on retail price and unit price. In Study 2, participants conducted the same shopping task but now under a condition of time pressure. Findings - Study 1 shows that unit pricing shifts consumer choices towards the lower unit priced options and improves their perceptions of task information load. Study 2 shows that when consumers are under time pressure, unit pricing shows stronger effects on choices but not on perceptions. Research limitations/implications - The study comprised a fairly homogenous set of low involvement categories and relatively small assortments in a hypothetical purchase setting. Exploration {{of the role of}} unit pricing in more complex and more realistic purchase environments pose suitable avenues for future research. Practical implicationsThis study shows that consumers benefit from unit pricing because it makes it easier for them to find the lower unit priced items and to more quickly complete their shopping task. Retailers will benefit from increased customer satisfaction and possibly an improved store image. Social implications - The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of unit pricing and that unit price information does not create harmful effects in terms of increasing their information load. Originality/value - This study uses a specifically designed and controlled but nevertheless realistic grocery choice task to study the effects of unit pricing in an inter-brand context where there are only small differences in size and price. The study contributes to the literature by showing that in such conditions, unit prices help consumers compare the economic losses associated with product options. Their heuristic role is more pronounced when consumers are under time pressure. The study shows that consumers generally benefit from the presence of unit prices. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Some product firms {{increasingly}} rely on service revenues as part {{of their}} business models. One possible explanation is that they turn to services to generate additional profits when their product industries mature and product revenues and profits decline. We explore this assumption by examining the role of services in the financial performance of firms in the <b>prepackaged</b> software <b>products</b> industry (Standard Industrial Classification code 7372) from 1990 to 2006. We find a convex, nonlinear relationship between a product firm's fraction of total sales coming from services and its overall operating margins. As expected, firms with a very high level of product sales are most profitable, and rising services are associated with declining profitability. We find, however, that additional services start to have a positive marginal effect on the firm's overall profits when services reach a majority of a product firm's sales. We show that traditional industry maturity arguments cannot fully explain our data. It is likely that changes in both strategy and the business environment lead product firms to place more emphasis on services...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that {{adequate}} water resources are available during a mission, any net water loss from the habitat must be balanced with an equivalent amount of required makeup water. Makeup water may come from a variety of sources, including water in shipped tanks, water stored in <b>prepackaged</b> food, <b>product</b> water from fuel cells, and in-situ water resources. This paper specifically addresses the issue of storing required makeup water in prepackaged food versus storing the water in shipped tanks for the Mars Dual Lander Transit Mission, one of the Advanced Life Support Reference Missions. In this paper, water mass balances have been performed for the Dual Lander Transit Mission, to determine the necessary requirement of makeup water under nominal operation (i. e. no consideration of contingency needs), on a daily basis. Contingency issues are briefly discussed with respect to impacts on makeup water storage (shipped tanks versus storage in prepackaged food). The Dual Lander Transit Mission was selected for study because it has been considered by the Johnson Space Center Exploration Office in enough detail to define a reasonable set of scenario options for nominal system operation and contingencies. This study also illustrates the concept that there are multiple, reasonable life support system scenarios for any one particular mission. Thus, the need for a particular commodity can depend upon many variables in the system.

40|$|Modified {{atmosphere}} packaging (MAP) {{is being}} utilized extensively in European countries as a preservation technique for meat products. In the United States, large supermarkets are reducing or eliminating in-store meat departments and {{replacing them with}} <b>prepackaged</b> case-ready <b>products</b> shipped from a centralized processing facility. Fresh ground pork shoulder (SBLDR) and ground pork knuckles with sirloin fat trim (GS) were packaged in either 80 : 20 O 2 :CO 2 (80 / 20) or 100 % CO 2 (CO 2) and held for 2 days (2 DAY) or 8 days (8 DAY) in unlighted storage (2 °C) prior to lighted display for 8 days to determine differences in retail shelf-life due to these parameters. ^ A high level of carbon dioxide (CO 2) was more effective in inhibiting microbial growth than a gas mixture of 80 : 20 O 2 :CO 2. During extended storage, (8 DAY) in 100 % CO 2 inhibition of growth of aerobic microorganisms resulted in a 2 log reduction in aerobic plate counts (APC). During lighted storage, aerobic plate counts of ground GS and SHLDR packaged in CO 2 were at least 1 log lower than when packaged in 80 / 20. ^ Increased storage time prior to retail display resulted in higher APC and psychrotropic plate counts. A half-log difference in bacterial counts (log 10 c. f u. /gram) resulted in a 6 day difference in product shelf-life as measured by aerobic bacterial plate counts for ground pork. Ground pork knuckles with sirloin trim in 80 / 20 had higher surface oxymyoglobin than ground pork shoulder, but ground pork shoulder displayed a more red color (higher a* values). After 8 days of lighted display, metmyoglobin reducing ability was still present and capable of keeping surface metmyoglobin levels below 40 %, the point where customers reject red meat due to discoloration. ^ The findings reported in this dissertation {{support the use of}} pork knuckles with sirloin trim in MAP to produce a ground pork product of the highest quality. In situations were shipping times are lengthy and/or distances from the distribution center to retail display are long, an atmosphere of 100 % CO 2 is recommended to give product the longest possible shelf-life. ^ Oxidation of lipids is another important characteristic determining the shelf-life and quality of food products. Assays exist which measure malonaldehyde, a secondary product of lipid oxidation. Each assay has advantages and drawbacks which are unique to the specific assay. Disadvantages common to aqueous extraction and distillation techniques include creation of large quantities of spent chemicals, number of samples which can be analyzed in a single day, and the time necessary to evaluate the samples which have been processed. ^ Rapid distillation and extraction methods to quantify malonaldehyde were developed. These methods used microliter quantities of material, increased the quantity of samples evaluated and reduced the time necessary to process a large number of samples when compared to the original methods. ...|$|R
