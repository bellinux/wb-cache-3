5|$|Leander Paes was {{paired with}} Vishnu Vardhan at the London Olympics 2012, {{following}} {{the refusal of}} Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at the Olympics. Paes threatened {{to withdraw from the}} Olympics rather than play with Vardhan, whose world ranking was 296, but withdrew the threat a week later. Paes and Vardhan reached {{the second round of the}} tournament, losing to eventual silver medalists Michaël Llodra and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France.|$|E
5|$|After playing AAA midget {{with the}} Strathmore Bisons of the Foothills Bisons Hockey Association, Raymond began a two-year Junior A {{career with the}} Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL in 2003–04. Raymond had been {{hesitant}} about pursuing his career {{due to a lack}} of interest from major junior teams, but his friend Dan Bertram encouraged him to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in Camrose. Bertram also played midget with Raymond and went on to be a Chicago Blackhawks draft pick, three selections after him.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Buzz and {{the other}} toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a new Buzz Lightyear toy, who {{believes}} Buzz is a rogue space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After revealing Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who in turn follows him {{with the intent of}} destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them, and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on TV, Woody realizes Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase, and leaves for the airport.|$|E
25|$|After the aborted solo effort, Davies' solo {{career was}} not revived until 1980, {{with the release}} of Dave Davies (AFL1-3603), which {{featured}} Davies performing all the instruments by himself. The album, named after its own serial number, peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200. He went on to release Glamour (1981), which charted at number 152. Davies brought in a back-up band to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on this record. Chosen People was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.|$|E
25|$|Swann {{had done}} {{enough in the}} year {{preceding}} the 2009 Ashes to be considered England's premier spinner, overtaking Panesar. The pertinent question was not whether Swann would play, but which of Panesar and Adil Rashid, the other two spinners in the England squad, would <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He went on to play in all five matches of the series. Panesar was selected for the first Test, but his bowling did not impress and he was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the series, leaving Swann as England's only slow bowler.|$|E

25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down {{when he wants to}} explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E
25|$|Crosby's musical endeavors {{began at}} the age of 13, where he was noted in Guitar Player Magazine as a {{promising}} guitarist of the future. He often recorded home demos with nothing more than a guitar] and a drum machine, sometimes a bass player with him as well. He nearly signed onto a guitar-based label Shrapnel, but turned it down to work on his budding songwriting skills. Crosby eventually left Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park, California, to do home study and begin his own band, which he dubbed VAST. Much like fellow alternative rock/industrial band Nine Inch Nails, Crosby was the only member but found a touring band who knew the songs well enough to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> live.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2005–06 season, the Islanders lost {{several key}} players to free agency or {{retirement}} and significantly retooled their roster. Captain Michael Peca {{was traded to}} free up room to sign free agents such as high-scoring wing Miroslav Šatan and Yashin became team captain. Journalists suggested that the team had finally been built around Yashin and would sink or swim with his performance. A common defence of Yashin's decreased offensive output had been {{the lack of a}} legitimate first line winger to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Satan and Yashin showed signs of chemistry early in the season, but generally produced disappointing results. When Satan was moved off Yashin's line, his offensive output increased markedly. After the season ended with the Islanders out of the playoffs {{for the first time since}} his arrival, Yashin acknowledged that he needed to score more. After the season ended, there had been speculation that the Islanders would buy out his contract and rebuild in a different image, but the team decided to retain him.|$|E

25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when she saw his face in the morning light ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their love had a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson's {{best teams}} {{came during the}} first eleven years of his tenure. In that time, he {{recorded}} winning streaks of 31 and 47games and went 114–10–3, a winning percentage of 90.9%. Wilkinson left Oklahoma after the 1963 season {{with a record of}} 145–29–4, 14 conference titles and 123 straight games without being shut out. During Wilkinson's tenure, another first would be recorded. Prentice Gautt would become the first black football player at the University of Oklahoma. Gautt had been a superior student at his Oklahoma City high school. He {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society and president of his senior class. During his junior and senior years of high school, he helped his team amass a 31-game win streak. He was also the first black player to participate in the Oklahoma state all-star game. Because of Gautt's academic success in high school, he was supported financially by a group of local black doctors and pharmacists. A couple months into his freshman year, Gautt was placed on athletic scholarship and the money was returned to the investors. Unfortunately, some members of Gautt's team were not too happy to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> One player even left Oklahoma because he refused to play with an African American. However, most of the team had his support. After a freshman game in Tulsa, Gautt was refused service in the restaurant where the team was scheduled to eat. His teammates abruptly left and found an eating establishment that would also serve him. As a player, Gautt broke out in 1958. In 1959, he was named the Orange Bowl MVP. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1985.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E

500|$|The Diane Martel-directed {{music video}} for [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] premiered on March 22, 2009. In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E
500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E
