5|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically {{possible for the}} foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the model's aging and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{volunteer}} citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{dissatisfaction with the}} police effort. They petitioned the government to raise a reward {{for information about the}} killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.|$|E
50|$|If red, blue, {{and green}} light (the {{additive}} primaries) are mixed, {{the result is}} something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> subtractive mixing <b>of</b> the pigments is avoided, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> some <b>of</b> the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.|$|R
60|$|Our {{work was}} {{not taken up}} so soon as theirs, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the spirit <b>of</b> {{colonization}} did not begin amongst us so early as in Spain and Portugal, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the foundations <b>of</b> most of our colonies were laid by private enterprise, rather than by public adventure, and moreover some of the earlier ones in unsettled times.|$|R
50|$|In winter it is graded Scottish Grade IV, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> its {{difficulties}} (in {{particular the}} Eastern Traverse and the Tower Gap), lie {{high up on}} the route.|$|R
5|$|Altrincham {{today is}} an {{affluent}} commuter town, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its transport links. The town {{has a strong}} middle class presence; {{there has been a}} steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and three ice hockey clubs, Manchester Storm, Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the decreased quality of the content and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
50|$|While Saddam Hussein {{remained}} in power {{as president of}} Iraq, Al-Mayah called for elections. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, he was imprisoned. He was released from prison, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> one <b>of</b> his former students {{was one of the}} interrogators.|$|R
25|$|This was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> attitudes <b>of</b> racial superiority {{were the}} norm among white Americans of that era, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the NAWSA {{believed}} it had {{little hope of}} achieving a national amendment without at least some support from southern states that practiced racial segregation.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Het Parool {{quickly became}} one of the largest {{newspapers}} in the Netherlands, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> much <b>of</b> the population appreciated it for being the most prolific resistance paper and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> newspapers that had collaborated with the German occupier were banned from publication.|$|R
5|$|Even so, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did {{not proceed}} according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left {{to join a}} simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of}} the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, {{which was}} {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Macintosh and Lisa personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Apple University Consortium, which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount. The consortium had earned more than $50million on computers by February 1984.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009 Manning {{wrote to}} a gender {{counselor}} in the United States, said she felt female, and discussed having surgery. The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her gender concerns, but also because she was opposed {{to the kind of}} war in which she found herself involved.|$|E
5000|$|Delafosse (1904:192 - 217) was {{the first}} {{linguist}} to write on the Senufo languages. He noted that the Senufo were often confused with the Mande, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> use <b>of</b> Mande languages by the Senufo was widespread: ...|$|R
50|$|As always, {{the host}} of the tournament was South Korean club Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma. The other teams were <b>partly</b> chosen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the South Korean {{football}} players they have in their squads.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} the Story Girl tell many a more {{dramatic}} tale; but that one stands out for me in memory above them all, <b>partly,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the spot in which she told it, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{it was the last}} one I was to hear her tell for many years--the last one she was ever to tell me on the golden road.|$|R
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} owner was viewed favorably, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Browns' on-field success {{but also because}} he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players. One of the new {{ownership}} group's first acts was to assure Cleveland fans that Brown would retain complete control over the football side of the operation.|$|E
5|$|The 5th National Congress again {{amended the}} party constitution, adding {{a chapter on}} control {{commissions}} and their aims but devoting little attention to their operations. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this, the control commissions actively participated in several party rectification campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s. At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles, most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming.|$|E
3000|$|... 2) {{could be}} <b>partly</b> {{explained}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lower lipophilicity of (+)- 125 I]IV-OH. The suggestion {{is consistent with}} the previous reports that decreasing the lipophilicity of radiolabeled compounds resulted in lower hepatic uptake [...]...|$|R
25|$|Acidosis such as {{caused by}} {{inflammation}} at a wound partly reduces {{the action of}} LAs. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> the anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the sodium channel.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{show that}} more {{economic}} freedom {{is the cause}} of beneficial effects and that Economic Freedom of the World was used for most <b>of</b> the research, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Index <b>of</b> Economic Freedom only goes back to 1995 and because it uses more subjective variables.|$|R
5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans {{frequent use of}} hallucinogens {{is seen as the}} closest they are able to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why they are able to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 {{males in the}} island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the {{national}} average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.|$|E
50|$|Castillo de Gauzón (Gauzón Castle) is {{a ruined}} Spanish fortification. It {{is located in}} the {{municipality}} of Castrillón, Asturias. Little remains <b>of</b> it, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> the stones that formed it were taken by the area residents to build houses and other structures.|$|R
50|$|Acidosis such as {{caused by}} {{inflammation}} at a wound partly reduces {{the action of}} LAs.

50|$|Studies {{show that}} more {{economic}} freedom {{is the cause}} of beneficial effects and that Economic Freedom of the World was used for most <b>of</b> the research, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> Index <b>of</b> Economic Freedom only goes back to 1995 and because it uses more subjective variables.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{specific}} medical or screening tests {{that can be}} used in diagnosing Tourette's; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare, but more widely recognized and publicized cases). Coughing, eye blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|WebObjects {{failed to}} achieve wide {{popularity}} <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the initial high price of US$50,000, but it remains {{the first and most}} prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content. WebObjects is now bundled with macOS Server and Xcode.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
30|$|The {{pursuit of}} the typological aspect of these goals in {{systemic}} linguistics has, however, been slow, partly due to practical reasons (see Caffarel et al. 2004 : Ch. 1 for details), and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> description <b>of</b> individual languages antedates language typology of the kind described here.|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of wild animals with people needs proper {{conservation and management}} measures of wild animals including population control. However, {{there is not enough}} necessary information for management of large-sized mammals such as population sizes, habitat, etc [1].

50|$|Like {{the nearby}} tribes, the Batangan or the early Batangueños were a non-aggressive people. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> the tribes in their {{immediate}} environment {{were related to}} them by blood. Some weapons Batangans used included the bakyang (bows and arrows), the bangkaw (spears), and the suwan (bolo).|$|R
