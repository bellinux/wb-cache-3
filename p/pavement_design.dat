[...] This is important because in <b>pavement</b> <b>design,</b> a workable, stable mix with resistance to water is important. [...] With an open gradation, the bulk density is relatively low, {{due to the lack of}} fine particles, the physical stability is moderate, and the permeability is quite high. [...] With a rich gradation, the bulk density will also be low, the physical stability is low, and the permeability is also low.

40|$|Abstract]: Australia has {{approximately}} 300, 000 km of sealed {{roads and}} maintenance of these roads imposes a significant financial burden on road agencies. Premature pavement failure exacerbates this burden. Longitudinal pavement cracking often occurs independent of traffic loading and may be attributed in many instances to moisture changes in expansive subgrade soils. This project investigates a possible relationship between the Atterberg limits of low strength subgrade materials (CBR < 3) and the incidence of longitudinal cracking in unbound granular (flexible) pavements supported by them. Unbound granular pavements {{are the most common}} form of pavement construction in Australia. <b>Design</b> of these <b>pavements</b> is undertaken in accordance with individual authorities’ empirical design charts. These design charts are usually presented as a series of curves whereby the depth of pavement is set by the relationship between subgrade strength, expressed in terms of a four day soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and traffic loading over the <b>pavement’s</b> <b>design</b> life, expressed in Equivalent Standard Axles (ESAs). These charts typically provide pavement depths for subgrade CBR values of 3 and above. Where the subgrade CBR is less than 3, the guidelines recommend an additional depth of pavement gravel depending on the CBR. The primary objective of this research is to determine if any of the Atterberg limits can be used as a predictor of longitudinal cracking in unbound granular <b>pavements</b> <b>designed</b> in accordance with authority guidelines. This would enable consultants and authorities to determine if alternate methods of pavement construction should be considered (using tensile reinforcement for example) in lieu of unbound granular construction. Analysis of results indicated that a relationship exists between two of the Atterberg limits of a subgrade material and longitudinal cracking in unbound granular <b>pavements</b> <b>designed</b> in accordance with existing authority empirical design charts. Due to the small sample size, recommendation on specific values of these limits to determine when alternate <b>pavement</b> <b>designs</b> should be considered would be premature...|$|R

40|$|Shakedown {{theory has}} been {{recognised}} as a more rational basis for structural design of flexible road pavements. A lower-bound shakedown approach, which aims to find the maximum design load of a pavement structure, {{was developed by the}} University of Nottingham, that forms part of efforts among other researchers’ in applying shakedown theory in <b>pavement</b> <b>designs.</b> The lower-bound shakedown solutions were consistent with existing shakedown solutions assuming that the materials are isotropic and homogeneous following an associated plastic flow rule. Recently, this lower-bound approach was further developed to consider more realistic cases. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional shakedown analyses were carried out taking into account cross-anisotropic or heterogeneous materials, the properties of which were programmed into a finite element software ABAQUS. For pavement materials obeying a non-associated flow rule, the corresponding two-dimensional lower-bound shakedown limits were also estimated by extending the lower-bound shakedown approach. A numerical step-by-step approach was also applied to address the non-associated problems and obtained similar results. Through these studies, influences of the original assumptions on the shakedown-based <b>pavement</b> <b>designs</b> can be assessed...|$|R
