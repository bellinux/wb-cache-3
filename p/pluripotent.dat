5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a <b>pluripotent</b> hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various <b>pluripotent</b> cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{approaches are}} in use or under investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore {{the ability of the}} mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
25|$|However, {{reprogramming}} {{allows for}} the creation of <b>pluripotent</b> cells, induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells, from adult cells. It {{is important to note that}} these are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with <b>pluripotent</b> capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein transcription factors, <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived. The first demonstration of Induced <b>Pluripotent</b> Stem Cells was conducted by Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University. They used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into <b>pluripotent</b> cells. Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells. Junying Yu, James Thomson, and their colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human foreskin. However, they were able to replicate Yamanaka's finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.|$|E
25|$|Induced <b>pluripotent</b> {{stem cells}} are similar to natural <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells, such as {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells, in many aspects, such as the expression of certain stem cell genes and proteins, chromatin methylation patterns, doubling time, embryoid body formation, teratoma formation, viable chimera formation, and potency and differentiability, but {{the full extent of}} their relation to natural <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells is still being assessed.|$|E
25|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transplantation}} {{has become}} a focus of study in stem cell research. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain <b>pluripotent</b> cells from a cloned embryo. These cells genetically matched the donor organism from which they came.This gives them {{the ability to create}} patient specific <b>pluripotent</b> cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 and 2007 it was {{reported}} that introducing a small number of specific transcription factor genes into normal skin cells of mice or humans can turn these cells into <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells, known as induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. The technique uses modified retroviruses to transform the cells; this is a potential problem for human therapy since these viruses integrate their genes at a random location in the host's genome, which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} study on motor {{functional}} recovery after {{spinal cord injuries}} in mice showed that after human-induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells were transplanted into the mice, the cells differentiated into three neural lineages in the spinal cord. The cells stimulated regrowth of the damaged spinal cord, maintained myelination, and formed synapses. These positive outcomes were observed for over 112 days after the spinal cord injury, without tumor formation. Nevertheless, a follow-up study by the same group showed distinct clones of human-induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells eventually formed tumors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pluripotent</b> {{stem cells}} are the {{descendants}} of totipotent cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells, i.e. cells derived {{from any of the}} three germ layers.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{approach}} {{was taken to}} model long QT syndrome in cardiomyocytes derived from <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. These CRISPR-generated cellular models, with isogenic controls, provide {{a new way to}} study human disease and test drugs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{stem cells}} form tumors after transplantation; pluripotency {{is linked to}} tumor {{formation}} especially in embryonic stem cells, fetal proper stem cells, induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. Fetal proper stem cells form tumors despite multipotency.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} SCNT-based stem cell {{research}} has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based {{stem cell research}}: the derivation of <b>pluripotent</b> stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. This {{raises the question of}} how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies.|$|E
25|$|Interaction between {{homeobox}} protein NANOG and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) {{has been}} shown to be important in establishing pluripotency during the generation of induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. QSER1 protein was shown to interact with both NANOG and TET1.|$|E
25|$|Extraembryonic fetal {{stem cells}} come from extraembryonic membranes, and are {{generally}} not distinguished from adult stem cells. These stem cells are acquired after birth, they are not immortal but have {{a high level of}} cell division, and are <b>pluripotent.</b>|$|E
25|$|American {{scientists}} transform {{skin cells}} into bone cells using induced <b>pluripotent</b> methods, {{in which the}} cells were grown on scaffolding, allowing them to gain a 3D structure. This {{is the first time}} a fully functioning three-dimensional bone structure has been created from cell lines.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, two {{articles}} were published claiming that {{a type of}} <b>pluripotent</b> stem cell can be generated by subjecting the cells to certain types of stress (bacterial toxin, a low pH of 5.7, or physical squeezing); the resulting cells were called STAP cells, for stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency.|$|E
25|$|Various {{pharmacological}} agents are {{applied for the}} production of induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells (iPSC) or maintain the embryonic stem cell (ESC) phenotypic via epigenetic approach. Adult stem cells like bone marrow stem cells have also shown a potential to differentiate into cardiac competent cells when treated with G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{with the ability}} of {{scientists}} to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells, and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer and techniques to create induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells, controversy has crept in, both related to abortion politics and to human cloning.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, it was {{demonstrated}} that generation of iPS cells is possible without any genetic alteration {{of the adult}} cell: a repeated treatment of the cells with certain proteins channeled into the cells via poly-arginine anchors was sufficient to induce pluripotency. The acronym given for those iPSCs is piPSCs (protein-induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells).|$|E
25|$|These second-generation iPSCs {{were derived}} from mouse {{fibroblasts}} by retroviral-mediated expression of the same four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, Klf4). However, instead of using Fbx15 to select for <b>pluripotent</b> cells, the researchers used Nanog, a gene that is functionally important in ESCs. By using this different strategy, the researchers created iPSCs that were functionally identical to ESCs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pluripotent</b> {{stem cells}} hold great promise {{in the field}} of {{regenerative}} medicine. Because they can propagate indefinitely, as well as give rise to every other cell type in the body (such as neurons, heart, pancreatic, and liver cells), they represent a single source of cells {{that could be used to}} replace those lost to damage or disease.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the ability to differentiate along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be unipotent, multipotent, or <b>pluripotent,</b> meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively. <b>Pluripotent</b> stem cells can become cells derived {{from any of the}} three embryonic germ layers. Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner. Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Similar to ESCs, these iPSCs had {{unlimited}} self-renewal {{and were}} <b>pluripotent,</b> contributing to lineages {{from all three}} germ layers {{in the context of}} embryoid bodies, teratomas, and fetal chimeras. However, the molecular makeup of these cells, including gene expression and epigenetic marks, was somewhere between that of a fibroblast and an ESC, and the cells failed to produce viable chimeras when injected into developing embryos.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, three {{separate}} research groups, {{including that of}} Yamanaka's, a Harvard/University of California, Los Angeles collaboration, and a group at MIT, published studies that substantially improved on the reprogramming approach, giving rise to iPSCs that were indistinguishable from ESCs. Unlike {{the first generation of}} iPSCs, these second generation iPSCs produced viable chimeric mice and contributed to the mouse germline, thereby achieving the 'gold standard' for <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Induced <b>pluripotent</b> {{stem cells}} were first {{generated}} by Shinya Yamanaka's team at Kyoto University, Japan, in 2006. They hypothesized that genes important to {{embryonic stem cell}} (ESC) function {{might be able to}} induce an embryonic state in adult cells. They chose twenty-four genes previously identified as important in ESCs and used retroviruses to deliver these genes to mouse fibroblasts. The fibroblasts were engineered so that any cells reactivating the ESC-specific gene, Fbx15, could be isolated using antibiotic selection.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} in 2011 showed that induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells (iPSCs) {{can be used}} to aid in Parkinson's {{research}} and treatment. The cells {{can be used to}} study the progression of Parkinson's as well as used in regenerative treatment. Animal {{studies have shown that the}} use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson's. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes.|$|E
25|$|The {{school is}} a pioneer in cancer, immunology, alcohol, neuroscience, and {{diabetes}} research (see section below). Notably, some of its recent research discoveries that have received international acclaim include a curative therapy in testicular cancer used to treat patient Lance Armstrong, the development of echocardiography, several genes linked to Alzheimer's, and creation of inner ear sensory cells from <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. The IU School of Medicine {{is home to the}} Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, an NCI—designated Clinical Cancer Center.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 and 2005, Hwang Woo-suk, a {{professor}} at Seoul National University, published two separate articles in the journal Science claiming to have successfully harvested <b>pluripotent,</b> embryonic stem cells from a cloned human blastocyst using somatic-cell nuclear transfer techniques. Hwang claimed to have created eleven different patent-specific stem cell lines. This {{would have been the}} first major breakthrough in human cloning. However, in 2006 Science retracted both of his articles on clear evidence that much of his data from the experiments was fabricated.|$|E
25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical human cloning are therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells {{from a human}} for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, <b>pluripotent</b> stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} are {{undifferentiated}} cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a <b>pluripotent</b> potential {{because they have the}} ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.|$|E
25|$|Since iPSCs can {{be derived}} {{directly}} from adult tissues, they not only bypass the need for embryos, but {{can be made in}} a patient-matched manner, which means that each individual could have their own <b>pluripotent</b> stem cell line. These unlimited supplies of autologous cells could be used to generate transplants without the risk of immune rejection. While the iPSC technology has not yet advanced to a stage where therapeutic transplants have been deemed safe, iPSCs are readily being used in personalized drug discovery efforts and understanding the patient-specific basis of disease.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there was}} initial {{evidence}} of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the best constructed studies {{up to date}} indicate that cell transplants have no effect. An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to dystonias. Stem cell transplants are a main research recent target: {{they are easy to}} manipulate and when transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys, cells survive and improve behavioral abnormalities of the animals. Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial. Some have proposed that such controversy may be overcome with the use of induced <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells from adults.|$|E
25|$|As the vitelline duct {{is made up}} of <b>pluripotent</b> cell lining, Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic {{remnants of}} other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E
25|$|Sox family: The Sox {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors {{is associated with}} maintaining pluripotency similar to Oct-3/4, although it is associated with multipotent and unipotent stem cells in contrast with Oct-3/4, which is exclusively expressed in <b>pluripotent</b> stem cells. While Sox2 was the initial gene used for induction by Yamanaka et al., Jaenisch et al., and Thomson et al., other transcription factors in the Sox family {{have been found to}} work as well in the induction process. Sox1 yields iPS cells with a similar efficiency as Sox2, and genes Sox3, Sox15, and Sox18 also generate iPS cells, although with decreased efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic stem (ES) {{cells are}} {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass of a {{blastocyst}}, an early-stage embryo. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ES cells are <b>pluripotent</b> and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta.|$|E
