50|$|Above the semi-improved {{grassland}} is some bracken {{but much}} of the higher ground is covered in typical Calluna / Erica communities interspersed with large areas of Juncus, Carex and Sphagnum bogs. The tops of Cribin Fawr are flat expanses of <b>peat-hags.</b> On the eastern flanks Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) grows in abundance with Cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) common on the highest ground.|$|R

60|$|The sun {{was high}} {{next morning when}} the wrecked men awoke, and began to feel the outcries of nature with {{reference}} to breakfast. Long before that time the men of Cove had gone off to the hills, the <b>peat-hags,</b> or the sea, according to their respective callings. But Mrs Anderson had a sumptuous breakfast of oatmeal porridge and fresh milk ready for the strangers.|$|R
60|$|In thir days, dwalled {{upon the}} Bass {{a man of}} God, Peden the Prophet was his name. Ye'll have heard tell of Prophet Peden. There was never the wale of him sinsyne, and it's a {{question}} wi' mony {{if there ever was}} his like afore. He was wild 's a <b>peat-hag,</b> fearsome to look at, fearsome to hear, his face like the day of judgment. The voice of him was like a solan's and dinnle'd in folks' lugs, and the words of him like coals of fire.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Whisht! whisht! gudewife,' {{said her}} husband, with a smack that {{had much more}} affection than {{ceremony}} in it; 'never mind, never mind; there's a gentleman that will tell you that, just when I had ga'en up to Lourie Lowther's, and had bidden the drinking of twa cheerers, and gotten just in again upon the moss, and was whigging cannily awa hame, twa landloupers jumpit out of a <b>peat-hag</b> on me or I was thinking, and got me down, and knevelled me sair aneuch, or I could gar my whip walk about their lugs; and troth, gudewife, if this honest gentleman hadna come up, I would have gotten mair licks than I like, and lost mair siller than I could weel spare; so ye maun be thankful to him for it, under God.' With that he drew from his side-pocket a large greasy leather pocket-book, and bade the gudewife lock it up in her kist.|$|E
60|$|The Lord Justice-Clerk was a {{stranger}} {{in that part of}} the country; but his lady wife was known there from a child, as her race had been before her. The old “riding Rutherfords of Hermiston,” of whom she was the last descendant, had been famous men of yore, ill neighbours, ill subjects, and ill husbands to their wives though not their properties. Tales of them were rife for twenty miles about; and their name was even printed in the page of our Scots histories, not always to their credit. One bit the dust at Flodden; one was hanged at his peel door by James the Fifth; another fell dead in a carouse with Tom Dalyell; while a fourth (and that was Jean’s own father) died presiding at a Hell-Fire Club, of which he was the founder. There were many heads shaken in Crossmichael at that judgment; the more so as the man had a villainous reputation among high and low, and both with the godly and the worldly. At that very hour of his demise, he had ten going pleas before the Session, eight of them oppressive. And the same doom extended even to his agents; his grieve, that had been his right hand in many a left-hand business, being cast from his horse one night and drowned in a <b>peat-hag</b> on the Kye-skairs; and his very doer (although lawyers have long spoons) surviving him not long, and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux.|$|E
60|$|The {{light was}} rapidly going {{and the wind}} was falling. In front lay a stretch of moor, seamed by black <b>peat-hags,</b> in some of which water glistened; beyond the moor rough heather-covered slopes ran up to the black hillcrest. A curlew whistled overhead, and the sharp cry of a grouse rose from the darkening heath. Except for this, it was very still and the {{landscape}} looked strangely desolate. Not far ahead a patch of roof showed faintly among some stunted ash-trees.|$|R
60|$|It {{looked a}} lonely region on the map, {{and when he}} glanced south the hills loomed, dark and forbidding, through thin gray mist. Pools of water dotted the marish fields, and beyond these lay a wet, brown moss where wild cotton grew among the <b>peat-hags.</b> Plover were crying about the waste and a curlew's shrill tremolo rang out as it flitted across the leaden sky. The outlook was not encouraging, but Foster picked {{his way across the}} bog and struck up the side of a fell. There was a road, but it would take him some {{distance}} round.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning they}} landed and joined Murray at a village among the hills. They {{spent the day}} upon the heather, working inland across broad, grassy spaces and red moors where the sheep fled before them, and then climbed a line of rugged hills. These were not high, but Whitney found them romantically {{interesting}} as he scrambled among black <b>peat-hags</b> where the wild cotton grew, up marshy ravines, and past great granite boulders. Stopping {{now and then to}} get his breath, he watched the line of small figures stretched out across the waste and thought that nobody lurking among the stones and heather could escape. Still, when the different detachments met upon a windy summit, none of them had seen anything suspicious.|$|R

60|$|Leaping {{the ditch}} that skirted the road, the youth soon crossed the belt of furze and heather that lay {{between him and}} the river, about which he and his host had been conversing. Being unaccustomed {{to the nature of the}} Western Isles, he was a little {{surprised}} to find the country he had to cross extremely rugged and broken, and it taxed all the activity for which the laird had given him credit, as well as his strength of limb, to leap some of the <b>peat-hags</b> and water-courses that came in his way. He was too proud of his youthful vigour to pick his steps round them! Only once did he make a slip in his kangaroo-like bounds, but that slip landed him knee-deep in a bog of brown mud, out of which he dragged his legs with difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|It {{became quite}} evident to John Barret {{that his new}} friend was [...] "used to" [...] a good many more things besides {{tumbling}} into the river, for as they went slowly along the winding footpath that led them through the <b>peat-hags,</b> MacRummle tripped over a variety of stumps, roots, and other excrescences which presented themselves in the track, and which on several occasions {{brought him to the}} ground. The old gentleman, however, had a fine facility in falling. Being slow in all his movements, he usually subsided rather than fell; a result, perhaps, of laziness as well as of unwillingness to struggle against fate. His frequent staggerings, also, on the verge of dark peat holes, caused his companion many a shock of alarm and many a start forward to prevent a catastrophe, before they gained the high road. They reached it at last, however, rather breathless, but safe.|$|R
