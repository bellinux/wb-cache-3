Socio-psychological {{models have}} been used to {{describe}} factors that influence the implementation of food safety management systems (FSMSs) in food processing facilities. The theory of planned behavior posits that perceived control over one’s own behavior, one’s attitude and the influence of others are antecedents of behavioral intention and/or behavior. The objectives of this study were to identify background factors that influence food safety behaviors of production workers in small and medium sized meat processing facilities and examine how these factors are applicable to the theory of planned behavior. Using a qualitative approach, the researchers conducted 13 in-depth interviews at five meat plants and two focus group interviews with representatives of government and industry agencies. These interviews generated 219 single-spaced pages of verbatim transcripts, which were analyzed by use of NVivo 7 software. Ten themes found in the data relate to elements in the theory of planned behavior that were demonstrated to be applicable to a meat <b>processing</b> <b>establishment.</b> Confirmation of factors having the strongest influence on production workers in meat plants may assist in developing targeted interventions that improve the implementation of FSMSs in the meat and other food processing sectors...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} parameters that can influence bacterial decontamination during washing of {{machinery and equipment}} in a food <b>processing</b> <b>establishment.</b> Incomplete decontamination of bacteria will {{increase the risk of}} biofilm formation and consequently increase the risk of pathogen contamination or prevalence of other undesirable microorganisms such as spoilage bacteria in the processing line. The efficiency of a typical washing protocol has been determined by testing three critical parameters and their effects on bacterial decontamination. Two surface materials (plastic and stainless steel), water temperatures (7 and 25 °C) and detergent concentrations (2 and 4 %) were used for this purpose in combination with two types of detergents. Biofilm was prepared on the surfaces with undefined bacterial flora obtained from minced cod fillets. The bacterial flora of the biofilm was characterised by cultivation and molecular analysis of 16 S rRNA genes. All different combinations of washing protocols tested were able to remove more than 99. 9 % of the bacteria in the biofilm and reduce the cell number from 7 to 0 or 2 log units of bacteria/cm 2.

40|$|Abstract This paper compares SPS-requirements of the USA {{and of the}} EU {{from the}} {{perspective}} of the <b>processing</b> <b>establishment,</b> and analyzes the consequences of differences for national as well as firm policies. Differences in safety requirements may impede the competitiveness of the food industry. Backward, forward and location-specific requirements are described to see whether the US- and EU SPS-requirements are comparable. The paper shows that the systems are quite similar, although individual standards can defer. Such differences influence not only the compliance costs, but also prospected mending costs. Only the first category has been stressed by science and practice. It is shown that opposite effects of the two cost categories when safety levels increase, can lead to different interpretations by firms versus national authorities. It is concluded that differences in SPSs can be bridged by means of effective dispute settlement within the WTO. To assess the gravity of such disputes an economic analysis of the before-mentioned cost categories should be combined with a analysis of consumer perceptions. Differences in consumer perception (as is the case with hormone-use in the production of meat) can be addressed by means of improved compliance efforts, or by means of compensation. Economically, both could lead to the same economic equilibrium, as national as well as firms could desire the same safety levels.

The first of these promoters, SxlPe, responds to the female dose of two X chromosomes to produce a pulse of Sxl protein that acts on the premRNA products from the second promoter, SxlPm, to establish the splicing loop. SxlPm is active in both sexes throughout most of development, but nothing is known about how SxlPm is expressed during the transition from X signal assessment to maintenance splicing. We found that SxlPm is activated earlier in females than in males {{in a range of}} Drosophila species, and that its expression overlaps briefly with that of SxlPe during the syncytial blastoderm stage. Activation of SxlPm depends on the scute, daughterless, and runt transcription factors, which communicate X chromosome dose to SxlPe, but is independent of the X signal element sisA and the maternal co-repressor groucho. We show that DNA sequences regulating the response of SxlPe to the X chromosome dose also control the sex-differential response of SxlPm. We propose that co-expression of Sxl protein and its premRNA substrate facilitates the transition from transcriptional to splicing control, and that delayed activation of SxlPm in males buffers against the inappropriate activation of Sxl by fluctuations in the strength of the X chromosome signal...|$|E

40|$|Non-typhoidal Salmonella is {{estimated}} to be the most common bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the United States, causing an estimated one million domestically acquired foodborne illnesses annually. Recent, large outbreaks have highlighted the importance of ground beef as an important source of multidrug-resistant Salmonella. We analysed the epidemiology of salmonellosis outbreaks that were attributed to beef in the United States reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1973 to 2011. During 1973 - 2011, of the 1965 outbreaks of Salmonella where a food vehicle was implicated, 96 were attributed to beef, accounting for 3684 illnesses. We observed a shift in the type of beef implicated in salmonellosis outbreaks, from roast to ground beef. Delicatessen-style roast beef cooked in commercial <b>processing</b> <b>establishments</b> was the predominant type during the 1970 s and early 1980 s; regulations on cooking and processing essentially eliminated this problem by 1987. Ground beef emerged as an important vehicle in the 2000 s; it was implicated in 17 (45 %) of the 38 beef-attributed outbreaks reported during 2002 - 2011. Although this emergence was likely due in part to increased participation in CDC's PulseNet, which was established in 1996, and proactive decisions by the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, stronger measures are needed to decrease contamination of ground beef with Salmonella.

40|$|In {{the meat}} industry, a high-event period (HEP) {{is defined as}} a time period when beef <b>processing</b> <b>establishments</b> {{experience}} an increased occurrence of product contamination by Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. Our previous studies suggested that bacterial biofilm formation and sanitizer resistance might contribute to HEPs. We conducted the present study to further characterize E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains isolated during HEPs for their potential to cause contamination and to investigate the genetic basis for their strong biofilm-forming ability and high sanitizer resistance. Our results show that, compared with the E. coli O 157 :H 7 diversity control panel strains, the HEP strains had a significantly higher biofilm-forming ability on contact surfaces and a lower susceptibility to common sanitizers. No difference in the presence of disinfectant-resistant genes or the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was observed between the HEP and control strains. However, the HEP strains retained significantly higher copy numbers of the pO 157 plasmid. A positive correlation was observed among a strain’s high plasmid copy number, strong biofilmforming ability, low sanitizer susceptibility, and high survival and recovery capability after sanitization, suggesting that these specific phenotypes could be either directly correlated to gene expression on the pO 157 plasmid or indirectly regulated via chromosomal gene expression influenced by the presence of the plasmid. Our data highlight the potential risk of biofilm formation and sanitizer resistance in HEP contamination by E. coli O 157 :H 7, and our results call for increased attention to proper and effective sanitization practices in meat processing facilities...|$|R
40|$|Petrifilm(R) (6410) {{was used}} {{directly}} on lamb carcasses to enumerate coliforms. 10 sites on 30 carcasses were sampled {{at each of}} 4 separate meat <b>processing</b> <b>establishments</b> (works). Coliform counts obtained by this technique were statistically analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to select the optimum sampling sites on the carcass and to assess contamination of the carcass by gut flora at a particular establishment. There was a large variation between sites and between works. In general, works 3 and 4 produced cleaner carcasses than works 2, which in turn was cleaner than works 1. Works 1, 2 and 4 used conventional dressing techniques and works 3 used the inverted dressing method, therefore, the coliform counts found at works 3 and 4 are achievable regardless of dressing technique. Coliform bacteria were most concentrated around the posterior pelvic rim and less prevalent at the carcass extremities. The posterior pelvic rim (sites 3 and 4) had higher (P < 0. 05) coliform counts than the exterior ventral flank area (sites 5, 6, 7 and 8), which in turn had higher (P < 0. 05) counts than the proximal hind and proximal fore limbs (sites 1, 2, 9 and 10) across all works. With in-line routine testing {{it is recommended that}} the majority of carcasses sampled should give coliform counts of < 50 cfu/ 20 cm 2 for sites 4 and 8.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the organic load on the downstream domestic wastewater treatment plant, a three stage, fully aerated activated sludge system was established for the pretreatment of a vegetable processing wastewater. The results of the research verified that this design was inappropriate at the given, highly fluctuating wastewater quality. Nitrate formed through nitrification of the pea processing wastewater could not be denitrified, thus rising sludge occurred in the secondary clarifiers. On the other hand, during the corn campaign, severe deterioration of the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency, {{as well as the}} overproduction of extracellular polysaccharides leading to viscous bulking, were caused by the extremely high C/N ratio. In order to efficiently treat the wastewater of the vegetable <b>processing</b> industry, <b>establishment</b> of highly flexible systems with unaerated first stage proves to be necessary...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand {{material}} in Japan {{continues to be}} sawn predominantly for packaging, in contrast to other supplies which are sawn overwhelmingly for construction uses. Overall recovery percentages for New Zealand material sawn (for packaging) in Japan are {{of the order of}} 64 - 68 % which is much higher than the national average in New Zealand of approximately 50 %. The higher recovery in Japan can be explained by: the JAS under-estimate of log volume; the volume of large squares in the raw {{material in}}put; the high raw-material cost which has instigated slow, accurate, finer kerf sawing; the combination of products and dimensions produced. The Japanese sawmilling industry is adaptable, adjusting to rising raw material costs and reduced supplies by adopting strategies such as diversification into value-added <b>processing,</b> the <b>establishment</b> of industrial complexes, downstream integration such as housing construction, and real estate...|$|R
