Funding was won from the Science Research Council to study design processes, and postgraduates were recruited to undertake masters and doctoral studies. Design graduates arrived {{to learn how to}} conduct research, while others from disciplines like psychology and mathematics learned to apply their skills to the discipline of design. Archer’s own lectures ranged widely across the philosophy of science, ethics, aesthetics, economics, innovation, measurement and value theory, and were delivered with directness and enthusiasm.

More substantial payments on the loan begin 90 days after graduation and the loans are usually scheduled to be paid off, with a modest 3-4% interest, over the course of 2-6 years. Recipients are also encouraged to make further contributions to the fund as their circumstances allow. Loan repayments and subsequent donations are channeled back into the fund corpus, making it a truly “perpetual” resource.|$|E

40|$|Concurrent design {{can reduce}} the time {{required}} to develop new products and redesign old ones. In contrast to the conventional approach, in which the product design is (nearly) completed before it is "thrown over the wall" to the process design group, concurrent design for manufacturability, as conceptualized here, conducts a number of <b>progress</b> <b>reviews</b> during the product design process. Frequent reviews have two benefits: (1) (Parallel Development) process designers receive sufficient information about the design to enable them to work in parallel with the product designers, and (2) (Quality Control) flaws in the design are discovered soon after they are introduced, saving the time and resources required for redesign later. The disadvantage of frequent reviews is that each review requires setup/penalty time that otherwise would not be required. The optimal policy is derived for some special stationary cases of the model. When the parallel development benefit dominates, the review periods either increase or decrease according to the rate at which product design work empowers useful process design work to be conducted. When the quality control benefit dominates, the review periods will vary {{only to the extent that}} the quality related parameters change. Numerical examples illustrate the insights gained from the analysis. concurrent design, concurrent engineering, simultaneous engineering, product design, process design, parallel development, quality control, <b>progress</b> <b>reviews,</b> optimization, quadratic program...|$|E

40|$|In the Eastern Cape Department of Health the {{performance}} management and development system <b>progress</b> <b>reviews</b> are {{performed in a}} summative manner. This happens when a supervisor leaves out all the other <b>progress</b> <b>reviews</b> and conducts a final progress assessment and monitoring {{at the end of}} the year. It is worse when {{the performance}} agreements are not even signed during the start of a financial year, neither does a newly qualified employee sign. As a result employees are not appraised because there are no <b>progress</b> <b>reviews</b> that are entered on the Persal system. Employees miss an opportunity to be sent for training at the same time they are rewarded late or not at all. It is obvious that the managers do not understand the aims and objectives of the PMDS policy. The research was an assessment of the effectiveness of the performance management and development system in inculcating professional behaviour in the nursing staff in the three Buffalo City hospitals, namely, East London Hospital Complex, Grey and Bisho hospital. The aspects of the policy investigated were the performance reviews, the competency framework and the performance incentive scheme. This research is qualitative in nature. Data was collected using unstructured interviews and open ended questions. The population of this study involved selected Performance Management Managers, Quality Assurance Manager, Area Managers, junior nurses and clerks working in the Buffalo City Hospitals. The respondents of the study were selected using the stratified random sampling technique. Descriptive methods were used to analyse data. Confidentiality was highly maintained and consent form even distributed from the start of the research. The three Buffalo City hospitals are practising a balanced scorecard as a performance measurement tool. It is in the form of workplans that are different for different levels of employees such as the performance workplans, standard framework workplan and individual workplans. ix The study discovered that there is poor compliance in performing the performance reviews. The attention is on the appraisal aspect more than the development aspect. Also, there is a delay in taking the employees for training as a result they end up not being trained. The employees are not rewarded according to their performance. The PMDS policy states that employees that get a score of three are entitled to get a one percent and those that are rated a four or a five qualify for a performance bonus. The study found that the PMDS policy is not implemented well. It is recommended that the performance management manager and the quality assurance manager need to apply a radical strategic transformation and change management to address the challenges...|$|E

Until this is done, there is a case for simplifying PAFs but not for making them more results-based. PAFs should build country ownership by including only the sorts of conditionalities that are likely to work, and combining these with a multi-level selectivity and complementary actions to address missing preconditions for aid effectiveness...|$|E
