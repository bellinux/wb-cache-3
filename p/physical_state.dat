It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its <b>physical</b> <b>state.</b> With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E

Two-dimensional topological gauge theories have recently appeared in various places of field theoretical models. They have an action which can be obtained from the Chern-Simons action in three dimensions [1] by a dimensional reduction. The SL(2, R) topological gauge theory was shown [2, 3] to describe two-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field [4]. The world-sheet action for two-dimensional stringy black-hole near the spacetime singularity contains an abelian topological gauge theory as a part [5]. The topological gauge theories are also interesting by themselves as an example of topological conformal field theories [6]. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the structure of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> in the topological gauge theories. We will use the BRST formalism in the light-cone gauge developed for the gauge group SL(2, R) in Ref. [3]. ∗ <b>Physical</b> <b>states</b> are identified with elements of the BRST cohomology. We mainly study the abelian theory and obtain all its <b>physical</b> <b>states.</b> There are an infinite number of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> with different ghost numbers. The <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> are generated by the zero modes of the fields acting on various vacua. The non-zero modes of the fields are excluded from <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> due to the BRST quartet mechanism [7]. We also study non-abelian theories but the analysis is far from complete. We only give several simple examples of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> for the gauge group SL(2, R). We consider a topological gauge theory with a gauge group G in two dimensions. The topology of the two-dimensional surface is chosen to be M = R × S 1 with coordinates x µ (µ = 0, 1), x 0 ∈ R, 0 ≤ x 1 < 2 π.
