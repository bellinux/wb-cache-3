5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension</b> describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (<b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension),</b> which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension,</b> a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{background}} Interferon alpha 2 {{is widely}} used in hepatitis and high-risk melanoma. Interferon-induced <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> as a side effect is rare. Case presentation We describe a melanoma patient who developed severe <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> 30 months after initiation of adjuvant interferon alpha 2 b therapy. Discontinuation of interferon did not improve <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension.</b> This patient could be treated successfully with phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor therapy. Conclusion This is only the 5 th case of interferon-induced <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> and the first documented case where <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> was not reversible after termination of interferon alpha 2 therapy. If interferon alpha 2 treated patients develop respiratory symptoms, <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis. For these patients phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors, e. g. sildenafil or vardenafil, could be an effective therapeutic approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Although <b>pulmonary</b> {{arterial}} <b>hypertension</b> {{is usually}} associated with advanced stages of sarcoidosis, its occurrence in early stage disease is rare. Herein, a case of associated <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> {{in the setting of}} Hashitoxicosis and stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis is reported. The case of associated <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> occurred in a young female without clinically significant medical history and who completely recovered after receiving oral corticotherapy only.

5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension</b> and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E
5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension</b> may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E

40|$|In <b>pulmonary</b> {{arterial}} <b>hypertension,</b> {{the blood}} vessels that carry blood between the heart and lungs are constricted, {{making it difficult for}} the heart to pump blood through the lungs. Prostacyclin, a prostanoid metabolized from endogenous arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, is a potent vasodilator that has been identified {{as one of the most}} effective drugs for the treatment of <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension.</b> Currently, prostacyclin and its analogues are widely used in the clinical management of <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> patients. However, the mortality rate associated with <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> has not been significantly reduced within the past 5 years. More powerful therapeutic approaches are needed. This article briefly reviews the current management of <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> to identify the problems associated with present therapies; then it focuses on the emerging technology of prostacyclin synthase gene therapy and cell-based therapy using native stem cells and engineered stem cells with enhanced prostacyclin production capacity. By using the recent advances in technology and the molecular understanding of prostacyclin synthesis, researchers are prepared to make significant advances in the treatment of <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pathophysiology of <b>pulmonary</b> {{arterial}} <b>hypertension</b> {{is based}} on three basic mechanisms: thrombotic pulmonary vascular lesions, vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling.

The role of platelets is more prominent in some types of <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>hypertension,</b> including those which are secondary to inflammatory and infectious diseases, hemoglobinopathies, essential thrombocythemia, drugs, thromboembolism, and cardiac surgery.

40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> {{arterial}} <b>hypertension</b> is {{a serious}} complication of adult congenital heart disease associated with systemic-to-pulmonary shunts.
