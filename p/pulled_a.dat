5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a bet they had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E

A 200m win {{followed}} at the Doha Diamond League meet. He entered the 2012 US Olympic Trials and reached the 100m final but, having <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> muscle in his semi-final, he finished last in the race. This brought an end to his season.|$|E

50|$|In {{behavioral}} psychology, reinforcement is {{a consequence}} that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus. This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever more frequently), longer duration (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever {{for longer periods of}} time), greater magnitude (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., <b>pulling</b> <b>a</b> lever more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).|$|R

5|$|Liverpool's {{opponents in}} the third round were Brighton & Hove Albion. The match was played at Brighton's home ground, the Falmer Stadium. Liverpool took the lead in the 7th minute when Craig Bellamy scored. Dirk Kuyt {{extended}} the lead in the second half, scoring in the 82nd minute. Brighton <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> goal back courtesy of an Ashley Barnes penalty kick, but were unable to score an equaliser; the match finished 2–1 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The Quadrophenia and More tour {{started in}} November 2012 in Ottawa with keyboardists John Corey, Loren Gold and Frank Simes, {{the latter of}} whom was also musical director. In February 2013, Starkey <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> tendon and was {{replaced}} for a gig by Scott Devours who performed with less than four hours' notice. The tour moved to Europe and the UK, and ended at the Wembley Arena in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E

5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton. Soon after, Pollard <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, forcing him into hospital. The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67.|$|E

5|$|Hutton then edged a {{ball from}} left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack through the slips, and was dropped by Lindsay Hassett on 25 after {{flicking}} the ball behind square leg from the medium pace of Sam Loxton. Hutton then hit a square drive past point and Washbrook <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> ball {{along the ground}} past Harvey, who was patrolling the midwicket boundary. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five boundaries were hit from a spell of six overs by Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Bayern Munich {{were drawn}} against Group F winners and fellow German side Kaiserslautern, while Manchester United were paired with Group C winners Internazionale. Two Dwight Yorke goals gave United a 2–0 win {{in their first}} leg at Old Trafford, while Bayern beat Kaiserslautern by the same {{scoreline}} at the Olympiastadion through goals from Élber and Effenberg. In the second leg, Nicola Ventola <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> goal back for Inter, but Paul Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. Meanwhile, Bayern won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe Rösler gave them a 4–0 win, 6–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{travelled}} to Prenton Park to play Tranmere Rovers in {{the sixth}} round. Danny Murphy and Michael Owen each scored in a first half in which the visitors dominated play. Steve Yates <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> goal back for Tranmere after half-time, but in the 52nd minute Steven Gerrard headed-in a cross to restore Liverpool's two-goal advantage. A mistake by Robbie Fowler gifted substitute Wayne Allison the chance to score, but the striker made amends as he converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute. In the semi-final, Liverpool faced Wycombe Wanderers at Villa Park. Goals from Heskey and Fowler and a consolation scored by Wycombe's captain Keith Ryan ensured Liverpool won 2–1 and earnt {{a place in the}} final.|$|E

5|$|Steele was {{investigated}} by a joint FA/Football League inquiry for {{his time as}} Mansfield Town manager in regard to suspected illegal payments – found guilty, {{he was given a}} £250 fine. The good run of results continued though, as they beat fifth-placed Barnsley 1–0 at Oakwell through a Hayward goal. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day Vale recorded two 1–0 wins over Chester, with Hayward again the only player to find the net. Captain Tommy Cheadle <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> hamstring against Chester, and lost his place in the team as Steele moved the positions around to accommodate Derek Tomkinson in the team. Roland Lewis was made available on a free transfer in December, and moved to non-league side Witton Albion.|$|E
5|$|Tom later <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} stunts {{in order to}} get the pair back together, in the end a stint that ended up seeing Tom in {{hospital}} managed to get them to see the error of their ways. Happily reunited, Max and Steph go to tell Frankie that the wedding's back on. Frankie's elated but warns Steph that Max shouldn't let Cindy come between them. Max is reluctant to choose sides but when things come to the boil between the two, his loyalty is tested. Fed up, Max tells Cindy that unless she will accept his decision to marry Steph than she and Holly can no longer stay with them.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Manchester United at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002; {{the home}} team had beaten title challengers Liverpool the {{previous}} weekend. Manchester United opened the scoring in the 21st minute – a poor clearance by Cygan allowed Juan Sebastián Verón to score. Arsenal goalkeeper Rami Shaaban was substituted {{before the start of}} the second half, having <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> thigh muscle. He was replaced by Stuart Taylor, who was helpless to prevent Paul Scholes from scoring a second goal, 15 minutes before the final whistle. A 1–1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur was followed by a win against Middlesbrough; a goal apiece from Campbell and Pirès meant Arsenal were top of the table on Christmas. On Boxing Day, Arsenal came from a goal down to beat West Brom 2–1; in doing so, they extended their lead at the top to four points. Three days later, Arsenal's lead was increased to five points, having drawn with Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|As of January 2015, Valve {{themselves}} had provided some user-developed Workshop content as paid-for features in Valve-developed games, including Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2; with over $57 million {{being paid to}} content creators using the Workshop. Valve began allowing developers to use these advanced features in January 2015; both the developer and content generator share the profits of the sale of these items; the feature went live in April 2015, starting with various mods for Skyrim. This feature was <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> few days afterward following negative user feedback and reports of pricing and copyright misuse. Six months later, Valve stated they were still interested in offering this type of functionality in the future, but would review the implementation to avoid these previous mistakes. In November 2015, the Steam client was updated with the ability for game developers to offer in-game items for direct sale via the store interface, with Rust being the first game to use the feature.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E
5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton before he was run out. Soon after, Pollard <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Toshack then bowled Pollard and Young was caught from Johnston's bowling as England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl and the remaining four frontline bowlers sent down at least 38 overs each.|$|E
