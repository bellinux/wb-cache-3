50|$|For {{light-duty}} applications a bushing type follower can be used. Instead {{of using}} a type of a roller a <b>plastic</b> <b>bushing</b> is used to reduce friction, which provides a maintenance free follower. The disadvantage {{is that it can}} only support light loads, slow speeds, no thrust loads, and the temperature limit is 200 F. A bushing type stud follower can only support approximately 25% of the load of a roller type stud follower, while the heavy and yoke followers can handle 50%. Also all-metallic heavy-duty bushing type followers exist.|$|E
40|$|In brake {{mechanism}} of cooling bed rolling mill construction, bush bearing is bronze made. For replaces {{of this material}} with engineering plastic product, it was calculated analytical and using simulation, forces in node of braking mechanism. Using these loads, it was make simulation regarding behaviour of static loads with finite element software. Finally, it was studied behaviour in service of this engineering <b>plastic</b> <b>bush</b> using of scale model mechanism. Based of these researches, this bush bearing {{can be made from}} engineering plastic product, in same qualitative and technical condition, and {{this is a way to}} reduce maintenance and exploitation cost...|$|R
50|$|Bearing {{housings}} {{are usually}} made of grey cast iron. However, various grades of metals {{can be used}} to manufacture the same, including ductile iron, steel, stainless steel, and various types of thermoplastics and polyethylene-based plastics. The bearing element may be manufactured from 52100 chromium steel alloy (the most common), stainless steel, <b>plastic,</b> or <b>bushing</b> materials such as SAE660 cast bronze, or SAE841 oil impregnated sintered bronze, or synthetic materials.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturer of the Model 2210 {{copying machine}} {{was looking for}} a <b>plastic</b> valve <b>bushing</b> {{material}} that could be produced by a low-cost injection molding process to replace the unsuitable valve bushing they were using. NERAC conducted a computer search of the NASA database and was able to supply Nashua Corporation with several technical reports in their area of interest. Information aided the company's development of a urethane valve bushing which solved the problem and created a dramatic reduction in unit cost...|$|R
