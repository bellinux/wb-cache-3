5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said {{that there would be no}} further talks over the sovereignty of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E
5|$|Saar was a {{province}} formed from parts of Prussia and the Rhenish Palatinate and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite {{was to be}} held after fifteen years of League rule {{to determine whether the}} province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{cessation}} of passenger-only service in 2003, the state legislature passed a bill allowing non-state entities to operate their own public or private ferries near Washington State Ferries routes. Kitsap Transit, a public transit agency serving Kitsap County with bus service, decided to place a 0.3 percent sales tax increase and motor vehicle excise tax on the November 2003 ballot to fund a passenger-only ferry service to replace the state-run ferries. The ballot measure was rejected by 61 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters,</b> with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E

During the same year's gubernatorial election, 42.9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Arlington <b>voters</b> {{preferred}} incumbent Democrat Jay Inslee, while 56.8 percent voted for Republican Bill Bryant.

5|$|The private ferry {{struggled}} {{to operate at}} a profit, leading Kitsap Transit to consider a new ballot measure to fund a public passenger-only ferry service. A 0.3 percent sales tax {{was placed on the}} February 6, 2007, ballot, and was rejected by 54.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters.</b> As a result, Kitsap Transit pulled its funding for the private Kitsap Ferry Company, and the company suspended service on March 30, 2007. Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after a few months in 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three referendums in modern Croatia: Croatian {{independence}} referendum, Croatian European Union membership referendum and Marriage definition referendum, and in all three majority voted in favor. There have been four other public initiatives to collect the support of 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> for a referendum, none of which were successful: concerning Croatian cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, concerning accession of Croatia to NATO in 2008, concerning Arbitration Agreement on Croatian-Slovenian border issues in 2009, and concerning Labour Act in 2010.|$|E
5|$|New York voters {{passed a}} {{transportation}} bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for that phase. Its passage {{had been seen}} as critical to its construction, but the bond was passed only by a narrow margin, with 55 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> approving and 45 percent disapproving. At the time, the MTA said that the project would be done in 2012 in case the city's 2012 Summer Olympics bid succeeded, which it had not. On December 18, 2006, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that they would allow the MTA to commit up to $693 million in funds to begin construction of the Second Avenue Subway and that the federal share of such costs would be reimbursed with FTA transit funds, subject to appropriations and final labor certification. The USDOT also later gave $1.3 billion in federal funding for the project's first phase, to be funded over a seven-year period.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the Conservative—Liberal Democrat {{coalition}} government agreed {{to hold a}} national referendum on the alternative vote, held on 5 May 2011. The proposal would have affected {{the way in which}} Members of Parliament are elected to the British House of Commons at Westminster. It was only the second national referendum ever to be held within the United Kingdom and the result of the referendum was a decisive rejection of the adoption of the alternative vote by a margin of 67.9 percent to 32.1 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> on a national turnout of 42%.|$|E

Bridge foes and the city sponsored an unofficial referendum on the project, which was placed on the November 4, 1969, general election ballot. The bridge was opposed by 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> in the city. The day before the election, construction trailers at the construction site were firebombed.|$|E
25|$|Ninety <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> voted yes, and the {{overwhelming}} support gave the Federal Government a clear mandate to implement policies to benefit Aboriginal people. A lot of misconceptions have arisen {{as to the}} outcomes of the referendum, some {{as a result of}} it taking on a symbolic meaning during a period of increasing Aboriginal self-confidence. It was some five years before any real change occurred {{as a result of the}} referendum, but federal legislation has since been enacted covering land rights, discriminatory practices, financial assistance, and preservation of cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|Barack Obama {{scored a}} major victory in the Iowa Democratic Caucuses due {{to a number of}} factors.

Hale became the first presidential candidate to visit the burgeoning city, although the returns on that visit were minimal, given that he received only 28 percent of the vote. During the Civil War, {{one of the first}} Illinois regiments to be mobilized, the Zouaves, were from Rockford, which served as the site for Camp Fuller, a training site for four other infantry regiments.|$|E
25|$|Palin opposed state-covered {{health and}} retiree {{benefits}} to same-sex partners of state employees but complied with an Alaska Supreme Court directive {{to do so}} and subsequently vetoed {{a bill that would have}} denied the benefits. In an interview with Newsweek in 2007, she affirmed her support for an amendment to the state constitution denying benefits to same-sex couples. She later signed a bill ordering a non-binding referendum for a constitutional amendment to deny the benefits. Although the referendum passed in April 2007, with 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>voters</b> supporting a constitutional amendment, a bill to place such an amendment on the ballot in November 2008 stalled in the state legislature.|$|E
