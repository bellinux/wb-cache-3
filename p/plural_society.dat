40|$|A {{fundamental}} challenge {{faced by}} many countries is the accommodation {{of ethnic and}} religious diversity. The search for methods to mitigate or resolve conflicts in <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> {{has been a major}} concern of both scholars and politicians, and there is a vast literature on this topic. This general debate about appropriate institutional design for <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> plays itself out in terms of arguments about choice of electoral system. The two key academic protagonists in the debate over the appropriate electoral system to use in <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> are Arend Lijphart, in his work on power sharing and consociationalism, and Donald Horowitz, in his work on constitutional design and ethnic accommodation. The former has advocated list PR, the latter advocates methods such as AV. Their two approaches to electoral system choice in <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> are widely viewed as being in direct opposition to one another, both by academics studying ethnic conflict and by politicians in <b>plural</b> <b>societies,</b> themselves. This paper focuses on Horowitz’s approach {{to the use of the}} alternative vote as a tool for mitigating ethnic conflict. We illustrate such a situation hypothetically for the case of Fiji, a country where, largely due to Horowitz’s influence, in 1999, the alternative vote was adopted for national parliamentary elections...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 8158 This project {{includes}} the most carefully constructed, large scale {{statistical analysis of}} the influence of the components of consociational government on stability. The variables and cases used in this analysis conform as closely as possible to the concepts of consociationalism, stability, and <b>plural</b> <b>societies,</b> as they are described by Lijphart in his extensive body of work regarding consociationalism. Accurate quantitative representation of his theory and recognition of the value of its analysis are facilitated by the discussions presented in Chapters 2 and 3. These chapters confirm the precise components of the theory, discuss criticisms that have been made concerning it, and describe another quantitative treatment of the performance of one of consociationalism?s components. This project?s quantitative analysis comprises multiple regression tests involving two sets of cases, which correspond to <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> and <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> which are also democratic. The latter set of cases and an independent controlling variable corresponding to democracy are used to ascertain whether consociationalism produces the stability which characterizes democracies, in contrast to the lack of upheaval, rebellion, and protest that results from severe oppression under undemocratic regimes. After the definition of <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> to be used to choose cases is identified in Chapter 4, the independent variables and data representing them are identified and justified in Chapter 5...|$|R

50|$|A <b>plural</b> <b>society</b> {{is defined}} by Fredrik Barth as a society {{combining}} ethnic contrasts: the economic interdependence of those groups, and their ecological specialization (i.e., use of different environmental resources by each ethnic group).

40|$|Democratization of <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> is an oft-cited {{source of}} identity-based conflict. It {{has come to}} a point where {{concepts}} such as transition and stability sometimes are polarized by scholars and politicians and this is the case in Uganda. This study challenges the notion that elections must underpin identity-based conflicts and presents a more optimistic view on the role of democratic institutions. Through the prism of theories on polyarchy, identity-based conflicts and institutional design, the Ugandan case is analyzed in terms of democratic status, arguments for the country’s no-party system and, above all, the possibilities of institutional re-design. A more general summary of research in the field of institutional design in <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> is also given. The result of this case study shows how a change in Uganda’s electoral system can facilitate, though not guarantee, a relatively peaceful transition to democracy. Concurrently, the discussion emphasizes the contextual dependence of the outcome of system...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development of}} an operational analytical model to illustrate the possibility of successfully resolving or managing conflict in <b>plural</b> <b>societies</b> by effectively accommodating different geographically dispersed ethnic groups as groups in democratic constitutional structures and processes in these societies. The few existing models or theories of this kind (i e pluralism, consociationalism, corporatism, personalism/integral federalism) are either too vague or too incomplete to operationalise effectively. The dynamic resurgence of ethnicity across the world stresses the need for such a workable model, especially in view of important prevailing misconceptions {{about the nature of the}} phenomenon of "ethnicity" and its implications for effective democratic conflict resolution in <b>plural</b> <b>societies.</b> INLEIDING: Die effektiewe demokratiese akkommodasie van verskillende geografies verspreide etniese groepe in die staatkundige struktuur van 'n plurale samelewing is 'n politieke doelwit wat dusver nog selde in die wêreld verwesenlik kon word.
