60|$|Sometimes, when Statira and 'Manda Grier took a Saturday {{afternoon}} off, he {{went with}} them into the country {{on one of the}} horse-car lines, or else to some matinee at a garden-theatre in the suburbs. Statira liked the theatre better than anything else; and she used to meet other girls whom she knew there, and had a gay time. She introduced Lemuel to them, and after a few moments of high civility and distance they treated him familiarly, as Statira's beau. Their talk, after that he was now used to, was flat and foolish, and their pert ease incensed him. He came away bruised and burning, and feeling himself unfit to breathe the refined and gentle air to which he returned in Mr. Corey's presence. Then he would vow in his heart never to expose himself to such things again; but he could not tell Statira that he despised the friends she was happy with; he could only go with a reluctance it was not easy to hide, and atone by greater tenderness for a manner that wounded her. One day toward the end of August, when they were together at a suburban theatre, Statira wandered off to a pond there was in the grounds with some other girls, who had asked him to go and row them, and had called him a bear for refusing, and told him to look out for Barnum. They left him sitting alone with 'Manda Grier, at a table where they had all been having ice-cream at his expense; and though it was no longer any <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> her, it was better than to be with them, for she was not a fool, at any rate. Statira turned round at a little distance to mock them with a gesture and a laugh, and the laugh ended in a cough, long and shattering, so that one of her companions had to stop with her, and put her arm round her till she could recover herself and go on.|$|E

The argument is based on the observation that precision measurements at a given energy scale allow us to make predictions concerning the next energy scale. It is remarkable that the origin of this observation can <b>be</b> traced back <b>to</b> 1927, the two fundamental papers on the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field written by Dirac, which are among the cornerstones of quantum field theory.

40|$|Good morning. It is a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> you in Coeur d’Alene, {{which is}} truly a scenic gem. One of the things I most enjoy about my job {{representing}} the nine western states in the Federal Reserve System {{is the opportunity to}} visit many of the most beautiful parts of our country. I’ve been invited to give a talk on the economy. This morning, I’ll outline how the economy is doing and where it appears to be heading. I’ll explain some of the factors holding us back. And I’ll discuss some of the major risks that threaten even my subdued outlook— especially the ongoing crisis in Europe. I’ll also speak about what this challenging environment means for Federal Reserve policy, given our mandate to pursue maximum employment and price stability. As always, my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System. The backdrop is that we are still recovering from the most severe financial crisis and the deepest recession since the 1930 s.

This is my first opportunity {{as president of the}} San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank to meet with the CBA. I look forward to continuing the productive relationship we’ve built between our two organizations over the years. The Fed has been under quite a lot of scrutiny in recent years. One of my goals here is to help improve understanding of what we are doing, both as regulators and monetary policymakers. During the past 120 years, the banking industry has transformed dramatically. But one thing hasn’t changed. Banks rooted in local communities continue to play an essential role in the American economy. Community bankers have detailed knowledge of the people and businesses in their towns, cities, and regions that can’t be duplicated by computer algorithms. That makes community banks uniquely suited to serve customers who might otherwise fall through the cracks in the financial system. The theme of my talk is how the recent housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis and severe recession that followed, continue to affect us. These events have shaped the economic recovery and transformed the regulation of the financial system. I’ll start by looking a...|$|E

40|$|It {{is both a}} <b>pleasure</b> and {{surprise}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> you this afternoon. A pleasure, for this conference addresses matters of eternal importance, yet responds to matters rooted deeply in the turmoil of our time. Candidly, I couldnʼt have <b>been</b> more surprised <b>to</b> receive an invitation from the planning committee. I warned the conference coordinators that I am not a theologian. Iʼm surely not an exegete. Iʼm not a biologist; an ethicist nor a bio-ethicist. I assured them that they didnʼt want a clinical psychologist.

40|$|It <b>is</b> a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{read and}} a great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> argued <b>with.</b> Perhaps the {{greatest}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> answer, especially insofar as one feels that one 2 ̆ 7 s critics have misunderstood or gone wrong. But although it <b>is</b> sometimes helpful <b>to</b> clarify confusions, {{there is always the}} risk that an effort <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exhaustive in this respect will become exhausting instead and that a rigorous emphasis on small differences will suppress larger and more important ones. For this reason, and also in order not to abuse the luxury of writing (at least for the moment) last, I shall resist the temptation to defend my earlier argument against every objection at every turn and instead use these pages (in the main) to emphasize the principal themes of the discussion and to articulate continuing disagreements. This approach has its drawbacks, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure. For example, the effort to emphasize larger themes requires me to leave many excellent smaller points unaddressed. Moreover, I will undoubtedly fall short of my ambition to convey a fair account of the main lines of disagreement. My view of the broader terrain is itself influenced by the peculiar ground upon which I stand, and even a dispassionate treatment of the differences that these Responses illustrate will inevitably take on something of the character of a rebuttal. But even as I recognize the shortcomings of this approach - and my own shortcomings in executing it - I shall continue to emphasize the main lines of disagreement that the Responses display rather than to vindicate my own position. This effort will be most useful in propelling the discussion forward, even if progress necessarily occurs only in fits and starts. The account of the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical position that I propose in Legal Ethics from the Lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s Point of View may be broken, roughly, into three parts, and the three Responses to my argument fortuitously divide their attentions more or less evenly among them. First, I develop a set of quite general philosophical ideas about ethics, which emphasize a structural distinction between third- and first-personal ethical argument - that is, between ethical argument that emphasizes impartial concern for others and ethical argument that emphasizes a person 2 ̆ 7 s own projects and plans. I argue that the single-minded pursuit of third-personal impartial morality undermines the integrity of the moral personality, which I claim depends upon sustaining free-standing first-personal ethical commitments. These ideas form the backdrop against which the 2 ̆ 2 extraordinary complexity and intractability 2 ̆ 2 that I claim characterizes the modem adversary lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s ethical position arises. Alec Walen, however, doubts whether freestanding first-personal ethical ideals can be justified - and indeed whether they are intelligible at all - and he therefore rejects the philosophical frame into which I place my account of adversary legal ethics...|$|R

[...] Two {{faculty members}} at the University of Georgia School of Law were {{presented}} awards for teaching excellence by the Class of 1997 during commencement exercises on May 24. Assistant Professor Anne Proffitt Dupre, who teaches {{in the areas of}} contracts, education law, and children in the legal system, received both the Student Bar Association Faculty Book Award for Excellence in Teaching and the Phi Delta Phi John C. O 2 ̆ 7 Byrne Memorial Faculty Award for Significant Contributions Furthering Student-Faculty Relations. Herman E. Talmadge Professor Walter Ray Phillips received the Student Bar Association and Younger Lawyers Section of the State Bar of Georgia Award for the Teaching of Legal Ethics. Dupre, who graduated summa cum laude and first in the UGA law class of 1988, served as judicial clerk to Eleventh Circuit Judge J. L. Edmondson and U. S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, then practiced with the Washington, D. C. law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts 2 ̆ 6 Trowbridge before joining the UGA law faculty in 1994. She was one of nine UGA assistant professors chosen as Lilly Teaching Fellows in 1995, a program designed to expose promising junior faculty members to new classroom techniques and theories. 2 ̆ 2 It is altogether appropriate and I am delighted that the students have chosen to recognize the outstanding work of Anne Dupre in this tangible way, 2 ̆ 2 said Professor Paul Kurtz, associate dean for academic and student affairs. 2 ̆ 2 She is one of the hardest-working faculty members it has ever <b>been</b> my <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated <b>with.</b> She <b>is</b> rigorous, yet caring in her dealings <b>with</b> students. She <b>is</b> a superb classroom teacher who puts forth the extra effort to make the law and the law school accessible to students. 2 ̆ 2 Phillips, a member of the UGA law faculty since 1973, earned his undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina and his law and master of laws degrees from Emory University. Phillips teaches in the area of bankruptcy, legal profession, corporate reorganization, and business problems. He served as a bankruptcy judge for the Northern District of Georgia and {{was a member of the}} State Bar of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s Code of Professional Responsibility Committee for a decade. 2 ̆ 2 Ray Phillips continues to do a wonderful job in the teaching of legal ethics in his Legal Profession course, 2 ̆ 2 said Kurtz. 2 ̆ 2 He has been an anchor of our upperclass curriculum for many years and the students obviously appreciate his efforts. At a time when the legal profession is under attack by those who feel more attention must <b>be</b> paid <b>to</b> the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s ethical obligations, Ray Phillips is a superb teacher who can challenge, inform and stimulate his students in the field. His wealth of practical and academic experience suits him very well for his task. 2 ̆...|$|R
