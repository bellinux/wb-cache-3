5|$|Acid2 was {{released}} on 13 April 2005. On 31 October 2005, Safari 2.0.2 became the first browser to pass Acid2. Opera, Konqueror, Firefox, and others followed. With the release of Internet Explorer 8 on 19 March 2009, the latest versions of all major desktop web browsers now <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> until IE10 {{was released}}, which fails the test. Its successor, Microsoft Edge, is able to render correctly it as of Windows 10 version 1607. Acid2 was followed by Acid3.|$|E
5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E

500|$|In 1951, Penney {{wrote that}} [...] "the discriminative test for a {{first-class}} power {{is whether it}} has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally." [...] There was fear of being left behind, and hope that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to resume the Special Relationship. The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. [...] Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even [...] "Can machines think?" [...] is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the Turing test. [...] To <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them. [...] The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious, while David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> yet fail to be conscious. A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology. Jürgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is simply the result of compression. As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called consciousness.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test {{is inappropriate}} where {{the issue is}} not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute, but discriminatory application of a neutral statute. [...] This is because the statute would inevitably <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons (stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test) will always be in the negative. In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test, holding that [...] "he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".|$|E

500|$|Yugoslav and Serb {{propaganda}} portrayed Croatian separatists as genocidal Ustaše, who had illegally {{taken over}} Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti-Serb pogroms of the Second World War. Kadijević later justified the JNA's offensive against Vukovar {{on the grounds}} that it was part of the [...] "backbone of the Croatian army" [...] and had to be [...] "liberated". The JNA's periodical Narodna Armija claimed after the battle that Vukovar [...] "had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube." [...] Šešelj declared: [...] "We're all one army. This war is a great test for Serbs. Those who <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> will become winners. Deserters cannot go unpunished.

500|$|In 2004 Josephson criticized an {{experiment}} by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina {{that she could}} see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> she had to make five correct matches, but made only four. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was [...] "woefully inadequate" [...] to determine any effect.|$|E
500|$|In July 1946, the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{recommended}} that Britain acquire nuclear weapons. They estimated that 200 bombs {{would be required}} by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of production facilities {{that had already been}} approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Portal submitted a proposal to do so at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, a subcommittee of the Gen 75 Committee, which agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. It also endorsed his proposal to place Penney, now the Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR) at Fort Halstead in Kent, in charge of the bomb development effort, which was codenamed High Explosive Research. Penney contended that [...] "the discriminative test for a first-class power is whether it has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2005, Chris Wilson, the Internet Explorer Platform Architect, {{stated that}} passing Acid2 {{was not a}} {{priority}} for Internet Explorer 7, describing the test as a [...] "wish list" [...] of features rather than a true test of standards compliance. In December 2007, Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in Internet Explorer 8, but that the changes would not be turned on by default, meaning that IE8 would not actually <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> The concern was that switching to a new behavior would cause too many problems in web pages expecting Internet Explorer's old, non-compliant behavior. Then in March 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 1 {{and turned on the}} changes by default after all. James Pratt, product manager for IE8, explained that this decision was made so that [...] "developers can spend more time building features and cool stuff, and less time just trying to tweak their sites across different browsers." ...|$|E
500|$|After Phips {{returned}} to London in August 1685, Samuel Pepys ordered the Navy Board {{to assess the}} Rose. Pepys {{had been out of}} power when Narborough set the strange plan in motion. In March and May 1686, Phips was ordered to attend the Lord Treasurer where {{it was found that the}} King was only to receive £471 in treasure, though the wear and tear on the Rose was estimated at £700. [...] In this age of piracy and high mortality, Phips making it back to London alive and with the King's ship still afloat was probably enough for him to <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> Already Narborough had a new plan in the works for Captain Phips, though this time it would be a private venture. Narborough's long infatuation with the Hispaniola treasure had not been diminished by Captain Stanley's discouragement on the Bonetta. And Knepp's report on Phips did not disqualify him. Phips had shown that he was serviceable: willing to harass the harbor of his hometown and to compromise between his own interests, and the interests of the crown. This was surely noted at Whitehall, even by the more conservative elements.|$|E
500|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which {{emphasizes}} the character of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> such as [...] "Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity {{as an end in itself}} by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalized. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|E
