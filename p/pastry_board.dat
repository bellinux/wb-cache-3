A gas-powered sac griddle can be seen inside the red oven to the right, with two thin wooden rolling pins ("oklava") and pastry brushes used to prepare the dough to the lower left. The cook is seen cutting up the finished gözleme on her <b>pastry</b> <b>board</b> table to prepare for final serving.|$|E
50|$|Move {{the dough}} to a floured <b>pastry</b> <b>board</b> and stretch {{it out into}} an oblong. Take one side, fold it into the centre {{and do the same}} for the other side, turn it over and repeat. Place the dough into a well greased tin, cover with a {{sprinkling}} of flour and leave to rise for 30-40 minutes in a warm place, or for about an hour at room temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} this pasta {{name is not}} certain. It is {{believed}} {{to come from the}} Ligurian verb strufuggiâ ("to rub") as a reference to its method of preparation, which consists in [...] "rubbing" [...] or rolling a small piece of dough on the <b>pastry</b> <b>board.</b> Similarly, the root of Ligurian strofia might be Ancient Greek στρωφαω ("to twist, to spin"), referring to the same motion required to produce trofie.|$|E

50|$|Royds individualistic {{approach}} to her woodcuts - applying pigments to printing blocks using a brush {{rather than a}} roller - resulted in unique variations of each of her prints. Additionally, Royds preferred to produce on demand, rather than creating limited edition runs, further ensuring a one-of-a-kind piece. To prepare, Royds often created colored paper collages before her final drawing. Although cherry wood was ideal, Royds usually used Woolworth’s 6d <b>pastry</b> <b>boards</b> - a cheaper alternative. Despite using chopping boards that cost her only sixpence, Royds' prints remained professional and sophisticated, proving her mastery of the technique. After carving the woodblocks, she printed impressions by rubbing the sheet with a Japanese barren. In her later works, Royds would either eliminate the keyblock entirely or print it in multiple colors - creating direct relationships between the colors instead of having them separated by borders.|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{microbial}} quality of food service kitchen surfaces and ready-to-eat foods were collected {{over a period}} of 10 years in Rutgers University dining halls. Surface bacterial counts, total aerobic plate counts, and total and fecal coliform counts were determined using standard methods. Analysis was performed on foods tested more than 50 times (primarily lunch meats and deli salads) and on surfaces tested more than 500 times (36 different surfaces types, including <b>pastry</b> brushes, cutting <b>boards,</b> and countertops). Histograms and statistical distributionswere determined using Microsoft Excel and Palisades Best t, respectively. All data could be described by lognormal distributions, once data above and below the lower and upper limits of detection were considered separately. Histograms for surfaces counts contained one peak near 1 CFU/ 4 cm 2. Surfaces with higher levels of contamination tended to be nonmetal, with the exception of buffalo chopper bowls, which commonly had high counts. Mean counts for foods ranged from 2 to 4 log CFU/g, with shrimp salad, roast beef, and bologna having higher means. Coleslaw, macaroni salad, and potato salad (all commercially processed products, not prepared in the dining halls) had lowest overall means. Coliforms were most commonly found in sealeg salad (present in 61 % of samples) and least commonly found in coleslaw (present in only 7 % of samples). Coliform counts (when present) were highest on average in shrimp salad and lowest in coleslaw. Average coliform counts for most products were typically between 1 and 2 log most probable number per gram. Fecal coliforms were not typically found in any deli salads or lunch meats...|$|R
50|$|Adana cuisine is {{influenced}} mainly from Yörük, Arabic and Armenian cuisine {{and the city}} has kept up its traditions. Spicy, sour and fatty dishes made of meat (usually lamb) and bulghur are common. Bulghur and flour are found in all Çukurova kitchens. In almost every home, red pepper, spices, tahini, a chopping block and <b>pastry</b> <b>board</b> can be found. The bulghur used in cooking is specific to Adana, made from dark colored hard wheat species with a preferred flavor.|$|E
50|$|Silverware {{is not a}} part of {{traditional}} Bengali cookery. A flat metal spatula, khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for puréeing dal, the old wooden belun chaki (round <b>pastry</b> <b>board</b> and rolling pin), and the shil nora, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is a unitasker, there to grate coconuts.|$|E
50|$|Chapati {{diameter}} and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens {{are usually not}} larger than 15 cm to 18 cm in diameter since the 'tava' on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stove top. Tavas were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen work top {{as a sort of}} <b>pastry</b> <b>board,</b> but homes have round flat-topped 'boards' that may be made of wood or stone and nowadays stainless steel, specifically for rolling out chapatis.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the pastry {{is made by}} heating water, melting the fat in it, {{bringing}} the mixture to a boil, and finally incorporating the flour. This {{can be done by}} beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a <b>pastry</b> <b>board.</b> Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste {{that can be used for}} hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. The molded crust retains its shape as it cools, and is prepared for baking with a filling and additional layer of pastry crust on top. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to bake the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.|$|E
50|$|Dining car Sky View (Pullman plan number 7556) could {{accommodate}} 52 {{people in}} three different dining rooms. It sat 24 in its main dining room, 18 in its dome, and 10 in its reserve private dining room beneath the dome. It was both the first dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. At its front end, the car featured the crew's toilet, an icemaker, and food storage accessible from the kitchen. The kitchen covered roughly the first third of the car, and it entirely constructed of stainless steel and featured a pan floor made of the anti-slip material Martex. The kitchen featured {{a wide array of}} electric appliances, including a frozen food locker, a General Electric (GE) broiler, a GE garbage disposal unit, three GE ranges, a Hobart dishwasher, a hot table, a water heater, a Hotpoint fry kettle, a KitchenAid mixer, three ovens, plate warmers, and Pullman-Standard refrigerators with mechanics made by Frigidaire. The kitchen also featured long counter spaces, a <b>pastry</b> <b>board,</b> a sink, and storage lockers.|$|E
5000|$|Hot water crust pastry: Hot water crust pastry is {{used for}} [...] pies, such as pork pies, game pies and, more rarely, steak and kidney pies. Hot water crust is {{traditionally}} used for making hand-raised pies. The usual ingredients are hot water, lard and flour, the pastry is made by heating water, melting the fat in this, bringing to the boil, and finally mixing with the flour. This {{can be done by}} beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a <b>pastry</b> <b>board.</b> Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste {{that can be used for}} hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. As the crust cools, its shape is largely retained, and it is filled and covered with a crust, ready for baking. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie, which is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie.|$|E
50|$|In Malay food preparation, {{varieties}} of ingredients used are {{often described as}} spicy and flavorful as it is melting pot of spices, herbs and roots. Strong, tangy and flavorful fresh herbs, spices and ingredients such as serai (lemon grass), pandan (screwpine), kemangi (a type of basil), kesum (polygonum), buah pala (nutmeg), kunyit (turmeric) and bunga kantan (wild ginger buds), biji sawi (mustard seeds) and halba (fenugreek) are often used. Apart from the Malay ingredients terminologies, another important aspect for Malay food terminologies is the equipment and utensils used. Several traditional Malay cooking equipments including several types of grinders called lesung batu (pestle and mortar), batu giling (stone roller), and the batu boh (mill) used for preparing spices and pastes. Vegetables are diced on a landas (wooden board); while a coconut scraper or kukur niyur is indispensable in making both curries and sweets. Pastries are also made for desserts and for this a torak (rolling pin) and papan penorak (<b>pastry</b> <b>board)</b> are considered essential. Besides the preparation and the cooking methods, food names also {{play an important role}} in Malay food terminologies. There is an abundance of unique food names that can be found for Malay delicacies that typically are named after the appearance of the food, the way food is prepared, places, people and by certain event or incident. Some of the famous and unique Malay food names include buah melaka, lompat tikam, badak berendam, tahi itik, cek mek molek, serabe, beriani gam, cakar ayam, nasi dagang and many more.|$|E
