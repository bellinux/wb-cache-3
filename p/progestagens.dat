40|$|ABSTRACT: Gestation {{length in}} swine has a {{considerable}} amplitude and both early and delayed parturition are common. This variation increases {{the occurrence of}} unassisted farrowing and {{could lead to a}} wide-ranging age at weaning for piglets born from one batch. Supervision of sow parturition is crucial to reduce mortality of neonate piglets. To facilitate assistance, induction of farrowing using prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF) has been widely used in batch farrowing systems, whereby synchronization would concentrate the time of farrowing, allowing for better organization of employees. However, a viable alternative method that can be implemented to manage farrowing is to sustain high <b>progestagen</b> levels {{in the final days of}} gestation and, consequently, prevent early parturition. Efficient techniques to delay farrowing such as using oral <b>progestagen</b> supplementation have been previously described, but are only recently being considered for commercial use. The present manuscript reviews publications regarding delaying parturition and discusses the use of intravaginal devices (IVDs) containing <b>progestagen.</b> There is limited data addressing the effect of <b>progestagen</b> treatment during gestation on productive and reproductive performance. Therefore, future studies should focus on improving synchronization protocols following <b>progestagen</b> supplementation and evaluating piglet viability and sow fertility, before widely using <b>progestagen</b> supplementation to manipulate parturition...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{overpopulation}} of African {{elephants in}} South Africa {{and the consequent}} threat to biodiversity, {{the need for a}} method of population control has become evident. The potential use of the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine as a safe and effective means for population control is explored. While potential effects of pZP treatment on social behaviour of African elephants have been investigated, no examination of the influence of pZP vaccination on the endocrine correlates in treated females has been undertaken. The ovarian activity of freeranging, pZP-treated African elephant females was monitored non-invasively for one year duration by measuring faecal <b>progestagen</b> concentrations via enzyme immunoassay. Behavioural observations were recorded for comparison with <b>progestagen</b> concentrations and to determine any behavioural changes surrounding the pZP vaccine darting event. Each elephant under study showed <b>progestagen</b> concentrations rising above baseline at some period during the study indicating luteal functionality. Average <b>progestagen</b> concentrations were 1. 61 ± 0. 46 ìg/g. Within sampled females, 42. 9 % exhibited oestrous cycles within the range reported for African elephants, 14. 3 % had irregular cycles, and 42. 9 % {{did not appear to be}} cycling. Average oestrous cycle duration was 14. 72 ± 0. 85 weeks. Behavioural oestrous coincided with the onset of the luteal phase and a subsequent rise in <b>progestagen</b> concentrations. Focal sampling to determine activity budgets before and after the darting event revealed no significant change in behavioural activities. In the week following immunization, individual <b>progestagen</b> concentrations decreased significantly from overall average concentrations. Average <b>progestagen</b> concentrations positively correlated with rainfall and with herd dominance. No association between average individual <b>progestagen</b> concentrations or cyclicity status with age, lactation, or parity were detected. Earlier determination of efficacy was made indicating reproductive control was established 22 months post-treatment. Results indicate the presence of ovarian activity amongst pZP-treated female African elephants in two years following initial immunization. Further study should be aimed toward studying the long term effects of pZP vaccination on the reproductive function of female African elephants. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

50|$|Progestogens, also {{sometimes}} spelled <b>progestagens</b> or gestagens, are {{a class of}} steroid hormones that bind to and activate the progesterone receptor (PR).

Major examples of progestins include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative medroxyprogesterone acetate and the 19-nortestosterone derivative norethisterone (norethindrone). The progestogens are named for their function in maintaining pregnancy (i.e., progestational), although they are also present at other phases of the estrous and menstrual cycles. They are one of three types of sex hormones, the others being estrogens like estradiol and androgens/anabolic steroids like testosterone.|$|E

50|$|Rather {{than seeing}} aging as {{a loss of}} {{functionality}} as we get older, this theory defines aging as any change in an organism over time, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that if all chemical reactions in the body were stopped, no change, and thus no aging, would occur. Since the most important change in an organism through time is the chemical reactions that result in a single cell developing into a multicellular organism, whatever controls these chemical reactions that regulate cell growth, development, and death, is believed to control aging. The theory argues that these cellular changes are directed by reproductive hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis). Receptors for reproductive hormones (such as estrogens, <b>progestagens,</b> androgens and gonadotropins) {{have been found to be}} present in all tissues of the body. Thus, HPG axis hormones normally promote growth and development of the organism early in life in order to achieve reproduction. Hormones levels then begin to change in men around age 30 and more abruptly in women when they reach menopause, around age 50. When the HPG axis becomes unbalanced, cellular growth and development is dysregulated, and cell death and dysfunction can occur, both of which can initiate senescence, the accumulated damage to cells, tissues, and organs that occurs with the passage of time and that is associated with functional loss during aging.|$|E

Daily samples were taken during the week after parturition. Total immunoreactive <b>progestagens</b> in faecal extracts were analysed with three different enzymeimmunoassays (EIA) that had considerable specificity for <b>progestagens</b> containing either a 20 =ahydroxylor a 20 -keto group.

40|$|Progestagenic {{compounds}} {{are emerging}} contaminants found in surface and ground water around the world. Information {{on the effects}} and potency of <b>progestagens</b> is {{needed in order to}} understand the environmental risks posed by these compounds. Using the Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis test system, developmental and reproductive toxicity after exposure to selected <b>progestagens</b> were determined. Larval exposure to levonorgestrel (LNG) severely impaired oviduct and ovary development causing sterility. No effects on testicular development, spermcount or male fertility were observed. Hepatic mRNA expression of the androgen receptor was increased in the females indicating that the receptor is involved in LNG-induced developmental reproductive toxicity. Exposure of adult females to LNG, norethindrone (NET) or progesterone (P) increased the proportions of previtellogenic oocytes and reduced the proportions of vitellogenic oocytes compared with the controls, indicating an inhibited vitellogenesis. The effects on oocyte development were ascertained at environmentally relevant concentrations of LNG, NET and P (1. 3, 1 and 10 ng/L respectively). Since unintentional co-exposure of <b>progestagens</b> and ethinylestradiol (EE 2) occurs in wildlife and also in human infants, data on mixture effects of combined exposures to these hormones during development are needed. Co-exposure during development showed antagonistic effects of EE 2 and LNG. EE 2 caused a female biased sex ratio which showed a tendency to be antagonized by LNG. Moreover, the hepatic AR induction by LNG was counteracted by co-exposure to EE 2. In conclusion, the results show that female amphibians are susceptible to reproductive toxicity of <b>progestagens</b> after developmental exposure as well as after adult exposure during the breeding period. The differentiating Müllerianduct and ovary, and the egg development are sensitive targets for <b>progestagens.</b> Finally, the findings reported in this thesis show that environmental <b>progestagens</b> impairs reproductive function in amphibians and may present a threat to reproduction in wild populations...|$|E

The animals were grouped into 7 groups (15 doe per treatment 10 Nubian and 5 Crossed), according to breed, age, body condition score. The control group (A) received no treatment and were naturally mated at natural heat, the other groups(B-F) treated with interavaginal <b>progestagen</b> either sponges or CIDR for 12 days and inseminated with fresh – diluted semen, except group (B) which was naturally bred, group (C) was artificially inseminated and group (D) was injected with PMSG 48 hours before <b>progestagen</b> removal, group (E) was injected PMSG at the time of <b>progestagen</b> removal, group (F) was injected with PMSG and PGF 2 α at the of <b>progestagen</b> withdrawal.

40|$|The {{utility and}} safety of {{postmenopausal}} hormone replacement therapy has recently been put into question by large clinical trials. Their outcome has been extensively commented upon, but discussions have mainly been limited {{to the effects of}} estrogens. In fact, <b>progestagens</b> are generally only considered with respect to their usefulness in preventing estrogen stimulation of uterine hyperplasia and malignancy. In addition, various risks have been attributed to <b>progestagens</b> and their omission from hormone replacement therapy has been considered, but this may underestimate their potential benefits and therapeutic promises. A major reason for the controversial reputation of <b>progestagens</b> is that they are generally considered as a single class. Moreover, the term progesterone is often used as a generic one for the different types of both natural and synthetic <b>progestagens.</b> This is not appropriate because natural progesterone has properties very distinct from the synthetic progestins. Within the nervous system, the neuroprotective and promyelinating effects of progesterone are promising, not only for preventing but also for reversing age-dependent changes and dysfunctions. There is indeed strong evidence that the aging nervous system remains at least to some extent sensitive to these beneficial effects of progesterone. The actions of progesterone in peripheral target tissues including breast, blood vessels, and bones are less well understood, but there is evidence for the beneficial effects of progesterone. The variety of signaling mechanisms of progesterone offers exciting possibilities for the development of more selective, efficient, and safe <b>progestagens.</b> The recognition that progesterone is synthesized by neurons and glial cells requires a reevaluation of hormonal aging...|$|E

A total of 75 Hair goats, aged 2. 5 - 5 years-old were used in this experiment. Goats were divided equally into three groups (n= 25 per group). Animals in LT-FGA (long-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment), ST-FGA (short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment) and Gn-ST-FGA (GnRH-short-term <b>progestagen</b> treatment) groups received an intravaginal sponge (day 0) containing 30 mg fluorogestone acetate (FGA) for 14, 8 and 8 days, respectively, plus 75 μg cloprostenol i. m. 24 h before sponge removal and 400 I.

In addition, the goats in the Gn-ST-FGA group received 10. 5 μg busereline acetate i. m. at the time of sponge insertion (day 0). Oestrus response for all treatment groups was 100 %. The mean interval from sponge removal and the onset of oestrus for the LT-FGA, ST-FGA and Gn-ST-FGA groups was 28. 0 ± 1. 0 h, 28. 83 ± 1. 1 h and 33. 1 ± 2. 0 h, respectively. No significant difference in onset of oestrus among groups was recorded.

40|$|Summary. Mice {{were treated}} {{with one of the}} potent <b>progestagens,</b> {{medroxyprogesterone}} acetate (MAP) or melengestrol acetate (MGA), at different stages of the oestrous cycle. They were tested for deciduoma induction, or for egg implantation, by oestradiol treatment combined with either injection of air into the uterine lumen or transfer of blasto-cysts to the uterus. The two important variables for both deciduoma induction and egg implantation were the MAP=m- and the stage of the oestrous cycle during which the <b>progestagens</b> were injected. Maximal uterine sensitivity was obtained after the injection of MAP during oestrus with a 4 -day MAP=m-. Under these conditions, 34...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost {{analytical}} methodologies {{currently available}} for the determination of steroids in water only identify a few representative compounds (mainly estrogens). In this context, a multi-residue methodology based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of 26 steroids including natural and synthetic estrogens, <b>progestagens</b> and androgens. The method described involves limited sample preparation as it includes a filtration followed by a single solid-phase extraction step using a C 18 cartridge. The analytical procedure allows {{the determination of the}} target analytes in the lower ng/L range, with recoveries above 80 %. The methodology was successfully applied to the analysis of steroids in several surface and ground-waters. In all the waters, estrogens, androgens and/or <b>progestagens</b> were determined...|$|E
40|$|In goats, {{the control}} of estrous and {{ovulation}} is a valuable tool to improve and maintain the pro-duction of milk and meat throughout the year. Therefore, estrous synchronization together with AI is extensively applied in the reproductive man-agement of goat (Leboeuf et al., 1998). Progesterone or a <b>progestagen</b> analogue is generally used to syn-chronize estrous in does during the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Ak et al., 1998). Worldwide, the most common route of <b>progestagen</b> application in goats is via the intravaginal sponge (Bretzlaff, 1997). The most widely used procedures for syn-chronization and/or the induction of estrous are 12 – 21 days of FGA or MAP impregnated intra vagi-nal sponge treatment (Romano, 1996. 1998, 2002...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>progestagen</b> treatment of different duration, PGF 2 a and ram effect on estrus induction synchronization in ewes. In Experiment I, ewes (n= 48) received vaginal sponges with MAP (medroxyprogesterone) for nine or 14 days (G- 9 and G- 14, respectively), followed by PGF 2 a treatment and estrus detection. There were no differences in estrus (69. 6 and 80 %), conception (50 and 55 %), and pregnancy rates (34. 8 e 44. 0 %) between G- 9 and G- 14, respectively. In Experiment II, ewes (n= 151) were divided into three groups: G- 6 received vaginal sponges with MAP for 6 days, followed by PGF 2 a treatment and estrus detection, G-PGF received only PGF 2 a treatment, and G-EM were only exposed to males after a period of separation. Estrus rates were greater (p< 0. 05) in G- 6 and G-PGF groups (58 and 39 %, respectively) than in G-EM group (11 %). In conclusion, it was possible to reduce the duration of <b>progestagen</b> treatment; however, the use of PGF 2 a during the breeding season transition without <b>progestagen</b> seemed to reduce estrus rates...|$|R
40|$|Ovulation rate, {{fertilization}} {{rate and}} prenatal mortality were studied in yearling beef heifers treated with PMSG or FSH and in non-treated controls. Oestrus was synchronized in 50 % {{of the animals}} in each treatment with an oral <b>progestagen.</b> The gonadotrophin injections were given during the normal oestrous cycle or during the progestagen-administration period. All heifers were inseminated 6 to 10 hr after observation of standing oestrus. Ovulation rate and percentage fertility were determined in approximately {{a third of the}} animals in each treatment group. The reproductive tracts of the remaining animals were examined 81 to 104 days after insemination for number and condition of fetuses, number of corpora lutea and condition of the uteri. Ovulation and fertilization rates were 1 · 0 ± 0 · 4 and 100 % for the controls, 1 · 6 ± 1 · 0 and 87 · 5 % for the PMSG treatment and 4 · 4 ± 4 · 9 and 56 · 5 % for the FSH treatment. Treatment with a gonadotrophin during <b>progestagen</b> administration resulted in higher ovulation rates than gonadotrophin treatment during the normal oestrous cycle, 36 % higher in heifers given PMSG and 47 % higher in those given FSH. There was a negative relationship between ovulation and fertilization rates; therefore, the average number of fertilized ova/heifer increased as ovulation rate increased, but at a slower rate. Percentage fertility was not affected by the <b>progestagen</b> in the control and PMSG groups, but it was lower when FSH was given during <b>progestagen</b> treatment than when it was given during the normal oestrous cycle. At 81 to 104 days after insemination, abortions had occurred in 20 % of the animals treated with PMSG or FSH. There were no apparent differences in prenatal mortality between the PMSG- and FSH-treated animals...|$|R
