40|$|Laboratorians and clinicians often rely on <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> of {{diagnostic}} tests {{to assess their}} accuracy. We compared test accuracy for tuberculosis diagnostics reported in 19 <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> against estimates in publishedmeta-analyses and found that <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> generally report overoptimistic accuracy estimates. However, <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> of most tests approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or endorsed by theWorld Health Organization provide more realistic estimates that agree with meta-analyses. Most laboratory professionals anticipate that test performancewhen applied to patient care may be less impressive than what is reported in <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> by test manufacturers. How-ever, this gap between promise and reality has not been examined in a systematic way. One approach for studying this gap is to compare sensitivity and specificity estimates in <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> with pooled estimates from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which of-ten include studies from diverse settings and may provide a more realistic assessment of test accuracy.

40|$|Background: It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that accurate and reliable product information {{is essential for}} the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmaceutical companies are the primary source of most drug information, including <b>package</b> <b>inserts.</b> <b>Package</b> <b>inserts</b> are printed leaflets accompanying marketed drug products and contain information approved by the regulatory agencies. Studies on <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> in India, in 1996, had shown that crucial information was often missing and they lacked uniformity. Aim: To assess the presentation and completeness of clinically important information provided in the currently available <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> in India. Materials and Methods: <b>Package</b> <b>inserts</b> accompanying allopathic drug products marketed by pharmaceutical companies in India were collected. These <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> were analyzed for the content of clinically important information in various sections. Statistical Analysis: The results were expressed as absolute numbers and percentages. Results: Preliminary analyses revealed that most <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> did contain information under headings, such as, therapeutic indications, contraindications, undesirable effects, etc., listed in the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945. The findings indicated considerable improvement in <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> since 1996. However, on critical evaluation it was revealed that clinically important information was not well presented and was often incomplete. Information with regard to pediatric and geriatric use was present in only 44 &#x 0025; and 13 &#x 0025; of the <b>package</b> <b>inserts,</b> respectively. Only five of the inserts had information on the most frequent adverse drug reactions associated with the drug. Also, information on interactions and overdosage was often missing. Conclusion: Although the <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> appear to have improved over the past decade there is still a definite need to further refine the clinical information contained, to minimize the risks to patients. This could be brought about by self-regulation {{on the part of the}} industry as well as by updating the relevant guidelines in line with those of developed countries...|$|R

40|$|Background: Information {{given in}} drug <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> {{is often not}} easily {{accessible}} by patients and practitioners. Presentation of important information in an easily accessible manner fulfills the very purpose of inserts. In the present study, accessibility of important information in drug <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> is evaluated. Methods: We evaluated 110 <b>package</b> <b>inserts.</b> Accessibility to important information was noted under following headings: use of box, use of special/bigger font or color, use of table of contents and information in front sheet. Each of these parameters was given a point. Cumulative accessibility score of more than three considered as accessible. Provision of toll free numbers and internet addresses of the companies noted. Results: Information in inserts regarding posology, method of administration, precautions under special conditions, contraindications, pharmacokinetics, interactions, pregnancy and lactation, driving, and machine use precautions were adequate and orderly in most. Only seven drug inserts mentioned important information with special font/different color. 18 drug inserts had used boxes. About 13 inserts used bigger font size for revealing important information. We observed a mean accessible score was 0. 37 a insert. Only two inserts carried toll free numbers. Conclusion: Important information in drug <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> is not easily accessible.

To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: [...] "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" [...] in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.

At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained {{within two days}} of dosing. [...] Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion {{as evidenced by the}} high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose. [...] Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value.

Hence {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the completeness of PIs. Aim: To critically evaluate <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> of allopathic medicines. Material and Methods: 100 allopathic drug PIs were collected from pharmacies in Rohtak and were checked for the presence of each heading as per schedule D criteria, followed by scrutiny of the information included under the heading. Indian guidelines were also compared with US FDA guidelines for PIs. Scoring of package inserts: The informations were evaluated for completeness and scored as 1 if present otherwise scored as zero for no information or partial information. Scores for each heading were calculated by totaling the scores of all the <b>package</b> <b>inserts.</b> The total scores were expressed as absolute numbers and percentages. Results:  On an average PIs analyzed for the completeness of the criteria scored 10 (Mean± SD = 9. 73 ± 2. 48) out of 16. Absence of common layout and headings caused inconvenience. In comparison to US FDA guidelines it lacked, disclaimer statement, boxed warning, revision date, approval date, toll-free number etc. Conclusion: PIs don’t seem to be serving effectively because of multiple deficiencies like completeness, uniformity, absence of headings.
