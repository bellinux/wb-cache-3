40|$|Tracking error {{estimation}} is {{of great}} importance in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. Any inaccurate estimation for tracking error will decrease the signal tracking ability of signal tracking loops and the accuracies of position fixing, velocity determination, and timing. Tracking error estimation {{can be done by}} traditional discriminator, or Kalman filter-based <b>pre-filter.</b> The <b>pre-filter</b> can be divided into two categories: coherent and non-coherent. This paper focuses on the performance improvements of non-coherent <b>pre-filter.</b> Firstly, the signal characteristics of coherent and non-coherent integration—which are the basis of tracking error estimation—are analyzed in detail. After that, the probability distribution of estimation noise of four-quadrant arctangent (ATAN 2) discriminator is derived according to the mathematical model of coherent integration. Secondly, the statistical property of observation noise of non-coherent <b>pre-filter</b> is studied through Monte Carlo simulation to set the observation noise variance matrix correctly. Thirdly, a simple fault detection and exclusion (FDE) structure is introduced to the non-coherent <b>pre-filter</b> design, and thus its effective working range for carrier phase error estimation extends from (− 0. 25 cycle, 0. 25 cycle) to (− 0. 5 cycle, 0. 5 cycle). Finally, the estimation accuracies of discriminator, coherent <b>pre-filter,</b> and the enhanced non-coherent <b>pre-filter</b> are evaluated comprehensively through the carefully designed experiment scenario. The <b>pre-filter</b> outperforms traditional discriminator in estimation accuracy. In a highly dynamic scenario, the enhanced non-coherent <b>pre-filter</b> provides accuracy improvements of 41. 6 %, 46. 4 %, and 50. 36 % for carrier phase error, carrier frequency error, and code phase error estimation, respectively, when compared with coherent <b>pre-filter.</b> The enhanced non-coherent <b>pre-filter</b> outperforms the coherent <b>pre-filter</b> in code phase error estimation when carrier-to-noise density ratio is less than 28. 8 dB-Hz, in carrier frequency error estimation when carrier-to-noise density ratio is less than 20 dB-Hz, and in carrier phase error estimation when carrier-to-noise density belongs to (15, 23) dB-Hz ∪ (26, 50) dB-Hz...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{observe that}} for the {{correlation}} receiver, time reversal (TR) <b>pre-filter</b> is an optimum <b>pre-filter</b> that maximizes the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) for a given input power. However, using channel state information (CSI), the optimum SNR can be achieved by employing the matched filter (MF). Since the SNR of the MF depends on the transmitted pulse shape, we propose a new <b>pre-filter</b> which is a cascade of several TR filters to improve the SNR of the MF receiver. It is shown that with every additional TR <b>pre-filter</b> at the transmitter the SNR of the MF receiver increases. From the simulations it is observed that the first TR <b>pre-filter</b> focuses and subsequent TR <b>pre-filters</b> defocuses the received signal which results in higher inter symbol interference (ISI). Thus, depending on the data rate a suitable choice has to be made on the number of TR <b>pre-filters</b> to be used at the transmitter. I...|$|R

Such a scheme is of interest when a cost-efficient way to transmit potentially high data rates are sought after. We investigate {{the performance of the}} optimal <b>pre-filter</b> for this scheme, and compare it to a simplified, so-called time-reversal (TR) <b>pre-filter</b> which has very low complexity. At low SNRs, the TR <b>pre-filter</b> and the optimal <b>pre-filter</b> are equivalent. At high SNRs, the TR prefilter achieves a performance that is independent from the delay spread of the channel and hence its performance is the same for any bandwidth. In applications where bandwidth is abundant, such as ultra-wide band (UWB) communications, any required performance can be obtained by TR <b>pre-filters</b> with a rate back-off transmission (i. e. transmission rate lower than the allowable bandwidth). Similar performance can also be obtained with full-rate transmission using several transmit antennas. This performance is guaranteed, since the high diversity of the large delay spread channel effectively eliminates any fading. I...|$|R

Watermark data, belonging to the user, are embedded on an original work such as text, audio, image, and video and thus, product ownership can be proved. Various robust watermarking algorithms have been developed in order to extract/detect the watermark against such attacks. Although watermarking algorithms in the transform domain differ from others by different combinations of transform techniques, it is difficult to decide on an algorithm for a specific application. Therefore, instead of developing a new watermarking algorithm with different combinations of transform techniques, we propose a novel and effective watermark extraction and detection method by <b>pre-filtering,</b> namely Adaptive Unsharp Masking (AUM). In spite of the fact that Unsharp Masking (UM) based <b>pre-filtering</b> is used for watermark extraction/detection in the literature by causing the details of the watermarked image become more manifest, effectiveness of UM may decrease in some cases of attacks.
