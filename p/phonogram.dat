5|$|In 1990, TISM entered {{negotiations}} with CBS Records and <b>Phonogram</b> Records and were {{signed by the}} latter. In April that year, the band began work on what would become their next album with producer Laurence Maddy. When <b>Phonogram</b> released Hot Dogma (1990) it failed to reach the commercial charts, and TISM were fired six months later due to management issues, despite owing the label {{tens of thousands of}} dollars. Hot Dogma is the first release to use the acronymic form of the band's name exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with <b>Phonogram</b> in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 <b>Phonogram</b> of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E

5|$|Warlock signed {{their first}} {{recording}} contract with Mausoleum Records and released their debut album Burning the Witches in 1984. Doro attracted immediately {{the attention of}} fans and press, becoming the spokesperson and the main means of promotion for the band. The mix of traditional heavy metal and power ballads, together with her voice and stage presence led Warlock to success, an exception in the 80s' metal scene dominated by male-fronted metal bands. Warlock signed a new contract with the major label <b>Phonogram</b> and released the albums Hellbound in 1985 and True as Steel in 1986, sharing the stage of European rock festivals {{with some of the}} best hard rock and heavy metal bands of the period. On 16 August 1986, Doro was the first woman to front a metal band at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, the most important European rock meeting of the 80s. Warlock's long tours in Europe, supporting W.A.S.P. and Judas Priest, pushed Doro to give up her day job as a graphic designer to devote her life to music. In this period she also received vocal coaching.|$|E
5|$|While {{writing in}} Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, {{the number of}} {{documents}} written locally increased in the 7th century; though {{most of them have}} been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to {{become an integral part of}} Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the Daigakuryo ("University") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho ("Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (shakyōjo) before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the <b>phonogram</b> orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.|$|E

25|$|Concerning the {{neighbouring}} rights, {{the term of}} protection was fifty years since the original performance or broadcast. For phonograms, the term was fifty years since the first publication, or fifty years since the fixation of the <b>phonogram</b> if not published within that time. Similar rules as for copyright concerning posthumously published works or authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War or who were posthumously rehabilitated existed also for {{the neighbouring}} rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighbouring}} rights, introduced for {{the first}} time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law. The law covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Visual fixations (videograms) were not covered. Neighbouring rights were, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to formalities except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast. Performers were granted the moral rights to attribution and to the integrity of the work. The exclusive economic rights comprised the rights to (re-)perform a performance, including a right to be remunerated for any reuses of a performance, and the rights to reproduction, recording, distribution, broadcasts, and rebroadcasts of a performance, a <b>phonogram,</b> or a broadcast. <b>Phonogram</b> producers were even granted an exclusive right to adaptations of their recordings, a provision that goes even beyond the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The 1993 law covered phonograms first published in Russia or created by a Russian person or company, broadcasts of broadcasting organizations having their legal residence in Russia, and performances of Russian artists, as wells as performances first performed in Russia, and also performances recorded or broadcast in Russia, if the record or broadcast was covered by the law.|$|E

The treaties have two major portions. One portion includes works covered by several treaties in U.S. copy prevention laws and gave the title its name. For further analysis of this portion of the Act and of cases under it, see WIPO Copyright and Performances and <b>Phonograms</b> Treaties Implementation Act.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Russia {{also joined}} the Rome Convention, the {{analogue}} of the Berne Convention for neighbouring rights. The adherence of Russia to the Rome Convention became effective on May 26, 2003. The Rome convention covered performances, <b>phonograms,</b> and broadcasts. For <b>phonograms,</b> it stipulated that <b>phonograms</b> {{produced by a}} national of a contracting state, or fixated in a contracting state, or published in a contracting state were covered, but allowed signatory countries to choose among the latter two (article 5). Russia chose to apply the criteria of nationality and publication, declaring the criterion of fixation as inapplicable in its adherence to the treaty. The Rome Convention is non-retroactive and applies only to <b>phonograms</b> created after and to performances or broadcasts that occurred after a country jointed the convention (article 20).|$|R

25|$|The {{characters}} are largely pictorial but include many abstract signs. The inscriptions {{are thought to}} have been mostly written from right to left (because there are several instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side, as if the writer was running out of space {{at the end of the}} row there), but sometimes follow a boustrophedonic style. The number of principal signs is about 400. Since this is too large a number for each character to be a <b>phonogram,</b> it is taken that it must, instead, be a logo-syllabic script.|$|E

In Europe the album was released on the Vertigo or Mercury labels (depending on the country), both labels being imprints of the <b>Phonogram</b> Records group. In the UK Yello's record label Stiff Records {{was in the process}} of going into administration, so the album was licensed to Elektra Records. In the US the album came out on both Mercury and Elektra.|$|E
25|$|Performers {{are granted}} the {{exclusive}} rights to their performance, including a right to remuneration for any uses of a performance or a recording thereof. Besides the right to perform a performance and to deny others to perform it, these exclusive rights cover also the live broadcasting of a performance, and the video or audio recording of a previously unfixed performance. As in article 7(1)(c) of the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations, performers' rights also cover the reproduction of non-authorized recordings, and also the reproduction of recordings for purposes other than those agreed upon, including the broadcast of a recording made for non-commercial purposes only. For broadcasts of records made for commercial purposes, the performers, together with the <b>phonogram</b> producer, have only a remuneration right on this secondary use of phonograms.|$|E

25|$|This {{issue was}} settled decisively in 1993 (i.e., {{two years before}} {{directive}} 93/98/EC became effective) by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in {{what became known as}} the Phil Collins decision. In that case, Phil Collins sued a German <b>phonogram</b> distributor who was marketing records of a concert Collins had given in the U.S. German law of that time granted German performers full neighbouring rights, and in particular the right to prohibit the distribution of recordings made without their consent, regardless of the place the performance had occurred. At the same time, German law granted the same right to foreign performers only for their performances that had occurred in Germany. The ECJ decided on October 20, 1993 that this was a violation of the non-discrimination clause of article 7 of the EC treaty. It also clarified that the non-discrimination clause was indeed applicable to copyright.|$|E
25|$|The year 1975 saw {{a turning}} point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With {{financial}} support from <b>Phonogram</b> Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the Autobahn album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up {{in the form of a}} quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The pair also started singing live for the first time, Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on self-built electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.|$|E
