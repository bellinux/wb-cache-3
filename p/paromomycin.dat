25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and <b>paromomycin,</b> and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, <b>paromomycin,</b> fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for visceral leishmaniasis acquired in India is now Amphotericin B in its various liposomal preparations. In East Africa, the WHO recommended treatment is SSG (sodium stibogluconate and <b>paromomycin)</b> developed by Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi)in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{around the}} treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. A number of topical treatments {{may be used for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical <b>paromomycin</b> effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. Pentamidine is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral fluconazole or itraconazole appears effective in L. major and L. tropica.|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} {{approach is}} to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of nitazoxanide, <b>paromomycin,</b> and azithromycin together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that nitazoxanide be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.|$|E
25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and <b>paromomycin</b> is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, <b>paromomycin</b> and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and <b>paromomycin,</b> have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
2500|$|The nonprofit Institute for OneWorld Health {{has adopted}} the broad {{spectrum}} antibiotic <b>paromomycin</b> {{for use in}} treating VL; its antileishmanial properties were first identified in the 1980s.

2500|$|... {{nitazoxanide}} is {{the only}} antiparasitic drug treatment with proven efficacy for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent individuals; however, it lacks efficacy in severely immunocompromised patients. Certain agents such as <b>paromomycin</b> and azithromycin are sometimes used as well, but they only have partial efficacy.|$|E
2500|$|Physicians have {{described}} the successful use {{of a variety of}} discontinued antiprotozoals in treatment of Blastocystis infection. [...] Emetine was reported as successful in cases in early 20th century with British soldiers who contracted Blastocystis infection while serving in Egypt. [...] In vitro testing showed emetine was more effective than metronidazole or furazolidone. Emetine is available in the United States through special arrangement with the Center for Disease Control. Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections. [...] For example, in Australia, production of diloxanide furoate ended in 2003, <b>paromomycin</b> is available under special access provisions, and the availability of iodoquinol is limited.|$|E
2500|$|Kala-azar, {{also known}} as visceral leishmaniasis, {{has been one of}} the major health {{problems}} in Sudan. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan on 9 January 2005, the increase in stability within the region helped further efforts in healthcare delivery. Médicins sans Frontières tested a combination of sodium stibogluconate and <b>paromomycin,</b> which would reduce treatment duration (from 30 to 17 days) and cost in 2008. In March 2010, MSF set up its first Kala-Azar treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infection. Since the treatment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 Kala-Azar patients with a success rate of approximately 90–95%. There are plans to open an additional Kala-Azar treatment centre in Malakal, Southern Sudan to cope with the overwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment. MSF has been providing necessary medical supplies to hospitals and training Sudanese health professionals to help them deal with Kala-Azar. MSF, Sudanese Ministry of Health and other national and international institutions are combining efforts to improve on the treatment and diagnosis of Kala-Azar. Research on its cures and vaccines are currently being conducted. [...] In December 2010, South Sudan was hit with the worst outbreak of Kala-Azar in eight years.|$|E

Antimicrobial activity of <b>paromomycin</b> against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus has been shown.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paromomycin</b> {{belongs to}} the {{aminoglycoside}} drug class and therefore are toxic to the kidneys and to ears. These toxicities are additive {{and are more likely}} to occur when used with other drugs that cause ear and kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of foscarnet increases the risk of kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of colistimethate and <b>paromomycin</b> can cause a dangerous slowing of breathing known as respiratory depression, and should be done with extreme caution if necessary. When used with systemic antibiotics such as <b>paromomycin,</b> the cholera vaccine can cause an immune response. [...] Use with strong diuretics, which can also harm hearing, should be avoided. <b>Paromomycin</b> may have dangerous reactions when used with succinylcholine by increasing the neuromuscular effects.|$|E
