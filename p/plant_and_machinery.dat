25|$|After {{fifteen years}} with the company, during which time he {{acquired}} experience {{in the building of}} both iron and wooden ships, Thomas Reaney decided to establish a shipyard of his own in partnership with his son, William B. Reaney. Selling his share of Reaney, Neafie & Levy to the other two partners (who renamed it Neafie & Levy) Thomas Reaney purchased the property of the Pennsylvania Oil Works at Chester, Pennsylvania, whose plant had recently been destroyed by fire. With its 1,200 feet of frontage along the Delaware River, at a point where the River was a mile wide and 21 feet deep, the property was an ideal location for a shipyard. Reaney named his new company Reaney & Son, and spent about a million dollars outfitting the yard for iron shipbuilding. The yard was thereby very well equipped, but the large expenditure on <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> was to leave the company chronically short of cash.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant depreciation rate (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between depreciated value and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are got rid of, and therefore the assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant depreciation rate, the effect of overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a special adjustment is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if the effect of capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is the accelerating replacement of fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference of 10% to the estimate of the annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure of the capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity at market value.|$|E

60|$|The {{crisis at}} the African fields {{was even more}} acute than had been {{anticipated}} by the conspirators. Nothing approaching to it had ever been known in South Africa before. Diamonds went steadily down in value until they were selling at a price which no dealer would have believed possible, and the sale of claims reached such a climax that men were glad {{to get rid of}} them for the mere price of the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> erected at them. The offices of the various dealers at Kimberley were besieged night and day by an importunate crowd of miners, who were willing to sell at any price in order to save something from the general ruin which they imagined was about to come upon the industry. Some, more long-headed or more desperate than their neighbours, continued to work their claims and to keep the stones which they found until prices might be better. As fresh mails came from the Cape, however, each confirming and amplifying the ominous news, these independent workers grew fewer and more faint-hearted, for their boys had to be paid each week, and where was the money to come from with which to pay them? The dealers, too, began to take the alarm, and the most tempting offers would hardly induce them to give hard cash in exchange for stones which might prove to be a drug in the market. Everywhere there was misery and stagnation.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a great concern about the {{environmental}} issues such as global warming. In the construction industry, traditional construction consumed huge amount of fuels and produce a large amount of carbon emissions that affect the environment. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the environmental impacts on global warming potential (GWP from fuel consumption during building construction activities by <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>machineries.</b> The methodology that is used in this study is Midpoint Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). GaBi software has been used for the LCIA purposes. The findings revealed that there was a great impact from construction <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>machineries</b> on GWP. Three types of machineries namely tower crane, lorry, and concrete mixer truck have been analysed in this study. Thed concrete mixer truck was found to be the highest contribution of global warming potential with the highest capacity of engine power. Results also shown that the global warming potential value for tower crane JT 170 -H 10 and Potain H 30 / 30 C were 2. 31 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 37 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. Meanwhile GWP for for Nissan lorry, Isuzu lorry and ZZ 1257 M 3641 concrete mixer truck were 2. 27 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq, 2. 24 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 74 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. The total global warming potential for all of these machineries were estimated to be around 3. 7 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq. Consequently, the concrete mixer truck were identified to contributed the highest carbon emissions because of the long usage duration and the engine power as well. Followed by the Potain H 30 / 30 C and JT 170 -H 10. Moreover, Nissan lorry and Isuzu lorry were found to be the lowest contribution of carbon emissions. It can be concluded that the construction activities should take more consideration on the fuel consumption in order to reduce the GWP. Modern <b>and</b> efficient <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>machineries</b> could help to reduce the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions...|$|R
