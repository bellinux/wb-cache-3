5|$|The Progress Party {{was founded}} {{at a meeting}} at the movie theater Saga Kino in Oslo on 8 April 1973, {{attended}} by around 1,345 persons. The address was held by Anders Lange, after whom the party was named Anders Lange's Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and <b>Public</b> <b>Intervention,</b> commonly known as Anders Lange's Party, and abbreviated ALP. Lange had some political experience from the interwar era Fatherland League, and was part of the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker. Lange held his first public speech as chairman of ALP at Youngstorget in Oslo on 16 May the same year. ALP was to a large extent inspired by the Danish Progress Party, which was founded by Mogens Glistrup. Glistrup also spoke at the event, which gathered around 4,000 attendees.|$|E

40|$|Like {{many cities}} in {{developing}} countries, Sao Paulo, Brazil, {{is characterized by}} major intra-urban inequalities with respect to human development. The center-periphery spatial regimes are the most obvious spatial manifestation of this phenomenon. In this paper we apply confirmatory spatial data analysis to examine these inequalities {{and their relationship to}} <b>public</b> <b>interventions.</b> Using district-level data, we examine the relationship between <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> and the level of human development, while controlling for population density, spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Our results suggest that <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> reinforce the existing differences between center and periphery. Specifically, public services and utilities and social programs are allocated more intensively in districts with higher human development levels. These findings call for a more careful consideration of distribution of societal resources and effectiveness of public programs and policies.

25|$|<b>Public</b> <b>intervention</b> in {{collective}} health problems {{has always been}} of interest to governments and societies, especially in the control of epidemics through the establishment of naval quarantines, the closing of city walls and prohibitions on travel in times of plague, but {{also in terms of}} hygienic and palliative measures. Al-Andalus—Muslim-ruled medieval Spain—was distinguished by its level of medical knowledge relative to the rest of Europe, particularly among the physicians of the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. In the years after the Reconquista, the Real Tribunal del Protomedicato regulated the practice of medicine in Spain and in its colonies. However, the system of medical faculties at the various universities was very decentralized. Surgery and pharmacy were quite separate from medicine and were considerably less prestigious; the systems of Galen and Hippocrates dominated medical practice during most of the era of the Antiguo Régimen.|$|E

In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his Tijuana Projection executed for InSite 2000. In this <b>public</b> <b>intervention,</b> women working in the “maquiladora” industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore media technology designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their parrhesiastic speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose of moral and political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein.|$|E

The current financial malfunctions, accordingly, would not result from free competition, but rather from insufficient competition. This statement is strong, for it rests on a sophisticated conceptual framework within which there is no dysfunction when perfect competition prevails. But it is also strongly unrealistic, for it rejects <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> even when markets obviously lost there bearings in the storm.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a {{methodology}} useful to verify the impact of <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> directed to support the technological innovation in local groups of SMEs. In the last decades, in several agglomerations of firms, some difficulties emerged, related to the small-medium enterprises gaps in innovation, to their low competitiveness and to the rising of distinct historical heritages in specific areas. To overcome them, some <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> have been put into place, aimed at supporting the local units’ development, and at sustaining {{the growth of the}} area. The work examines two central points of this mechanism. Is it possible to evaluate the effects and the utility of the above mentioned public actions on the involved SMEs? Which is the methodology that is appropriate for such an evaluation? In the economic literature these questions are linked to the “evaluation problem”. This work suggests four methodologies (statistical - descriptive analysis and the application of regression, Probit and difference in difference models) to achieve these targets and, before that, it discusses the type of data that should be collected to apply them.
