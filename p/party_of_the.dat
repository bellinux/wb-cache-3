40|$|This {{contribution}} to the special issue on conservatism and gender uses expert and election surveys to explore {{the extent to which}} the feminist or traditional gender ideology <b>of</b> <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right relates to their economic and liberal/authoritarian ideology. We show that, although <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left generally espouse more feminist ideologies than <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right, there are a significant number <b>of</b> rightist <b>parties</b> in Western Europe that combine laissez-faire economic values with liberal feminist ideals. That said, there is more homogeneity among <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populist radical right than rightist parties more generally. We find that despite some variation in their gender ideology, <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populist radical right overwhelmingly- with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PVV in the Netherlands- continue to adopt traditional or anti-feminist gender ideologies. In terms of attracting women voters we find that rightist parties who adopt a feminist gender ideology are able to attract more women voters than other <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right. We detect several examples <b>of</b> centre-right <b>parties</b> who include feminist elements in their gender ideologies, and are able to win over larger proportions of women voters than rightist parties who fail to adopt feminist positions...|$|R

5|$|The Soviet Union never {{participated in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several {{attempts}} in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the Soviet Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due {{to the number of}} political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.|$|E
