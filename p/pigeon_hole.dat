60|$|Here, I resign {{the active}} duties {{of life to}} an eager being, of preternatural sharpness, with a {{shelving}} forehead and a shabby snuff-coloured coat, who (from the wharf) brought me down with his eye before the boat came into port. He darts upon my luggage, on the floor where all the luggage is strewn like a wreck {{at the bottom of}} the great deep; gets it proclaimed and weighed as the property of 'Monsieur a traveller unknown;' pays certain francs for it, to a certain functionary behind a <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Hole,</b> like a pay-box at a Theatre (the arrangements in general are on a wholesale scale, half military and half theatrical); and I suppose I shall find it when I come to Paris - he says I shall. I know nothing about it, except that I pay him his small fee, and pocket the ticket he gives me, and sit upon a counter, involved in the general distraction.|$|E
60|$|But {{who shall}} {{describe}} the social charms of our dinner? All wedged together, as we were, in the snuggest little <b>pigeon</b> <b>hole</b> of a dining room, pretty little chattering children and all, whom papa held upon {{his knee and}} fed with bonbons, all the while impressing upon them the absolute necessity of their leaving the table! There the salad was mixed by acclamation, {{each member of the}} party adding a word of advice, and each, gayly laughing at the advice of the other. There a gay, red lobster was pulled in pieces among us, with infinite gout; and Madame Belloc pathetically expressed her fears that we did not like French cooking. She might have saved herself the trouble; for we take to it as naturally as ducks take to the water. And then, when we returned to the parlor, we resolved ourselves into a committee of the whole on coffee, which was concocted in a trim little hydrostatic engine of latest modern invention, before the faces of all. And so we right merrily spent the evening. H. discussed poetry and art with our kind hosts to her heart's content, and at a late hour we drove to the railroad, and returned to Paris.|$|E

She came into my office, looking so shabby,--not unlike one of those poor shop-girls; and as I was very well dressed from having just been to see you, why, you know, I felt the difference. 'Well, my dear?' said I, not quite liking the look of reproach she was giving me. 'You are groins to leave me,' she answered sadly. 'Well, yes; I suppose I must. You see the insurance business is very absorbing; and besides, it has a bad appearance, your coming about so in office hours, and in those clothes.' 'O,' she moaned out, 'you used to welcome me at all times, out in the country, and thought me prettily dressed.' 'Yes, yes; but this is Boston; and Boston makes a great difference in one's ideas; and I'm going to be married, too. Come, I don't want to seem ungrateful; we have had many pleasant times together, I own it; and I've no objections to your being present at Christmas and Thanksgiving and birthdays, but really I must draw the line there.' She {{gave me a look}} that made my heart ache, and went straight to my desk and took out of a <b>pigeon</b> <b>hole</b> a lot of papers,--odes upon your cruelty, Isabel; songs to you; sonnets,--the sonnet, a mighty poor one, I'd made the day before,--and threw them all into the grate. Then she turned to me again, signed adieu with mute lips, and passed out. I could hear the bottom wire of the poor thing's hoop-skirt clicking against each step of the stairway, as she went slowly and heavily down to the street." [...] "O don't--don't, Basil," [...] said his wife, [...] "it seems like something wrong. I think you ought to have been ashamed." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Pigeon</b> <b>hole</b> mail {{boxes are}} used by postal offices in the United Kingdom, as they allow for easy categorising of mail for later {{preparation}} of items ready for despatch.

50|$|APS saw a spurt of {{interest}} in the U.S. in the late 1940s and 1950s with the Bowser, <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Hole</b> and Roto Park systems. In 1957, 74 Bowser, <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Hole</b> systems were installed, and some of these systems remain in operation. However, interest in APS in the U.S. waned due to frequent mechanical problems and long waiting times for patrons to retrieve their cars. In the United Kingdom, the Auto Stacker opened in 1961 in Woolwich, south east London, but proved equally difficult to operate. Interest in APS in the U.S. was renewed in the 1990s, and there are 25 major current and planned APS projects (representing nearly 6,000 parking spaces) in 2012. The first American robotic parking garage opened in 2002 in Hoboken, New Jersey.|$|E

The chimney runs behind the <b>pigeon</b> <b>holes,</b> ensuring the birds were kept warm in winter.|$|R

50|$|The Dovecote which overlooks Bruton {{was built}} in the 16th century. It was at one time used as a house, {{possibly}} as a watchtower and as a dovecote.
