40|$|The most {{important}} structural application of cellular solids is in light-weight sandwich structures {{where they are}} used as a core material. A sandwich is a laminated composite consisting of two dense high-performing skins bonded together with a light core. The sandwich design is efficient for structures working under bending loads, and is common in wind turbine blades and boat hulls. Although usually low-performing, core materials have to meet sufficient mechanical requirements to allow transfer of the acting load from one skin to another without failure. The most commonly used cores today are balsa wood and polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> <b>foams.</b> Despite their good mechanical properties, there are certain disadvantages associated with their use in practice. Balsa is a hydrophilic material, which is of concern in marine applications. <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> have an outgassing problem, {{which can be a}} reason for delamination in sandwich structures. Both balsa wood and <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> are expensive. In order to promote development of new core materials, a good understanding of the structure-property relations of cellular solids with closed-cell structures is essential. The goal of this PhD research was to systematically study the behaviour of popular core materials, such as balsa wood, PVC and styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) foams, as well as nano-reinforced polyurethane (PU) and polypropylene (PP) foams that are currently still under development. The study was carried out using experimental methods supported by modelling investigations. The experimental methodology included micro-CT image analysis of the cellular structure, compression tests on two structural levels and fracture toughness evaluation. Some of the tests are not standardised and were designed specifically for this study. The established structure-property relation helped identify strategies that can be implemented to achieve, for a given density, higher Youngs moduli in cellular materials. These strategies included increasing stiffness of the solid polymer and adjusting it with the foam density; creating an anisotropic cell structure; minimising bending deformation of cell walls. Balsa wood was found to have superior elastic properties, explained by its sophisticated multi-level structure where all aforementioned strategies were well implemented. Among <b>foams,</b> <b>PVC</b> and SAN <b>foams</b> were the best alternatives to balsa wood. Their microstructures and the polymer properties were found to be tuned with foam density. While nano-reinforced PP and PU foams underperformed in comparison with commercially available foams, they showed potential for further improvement. Nanoclays were found to help with nucleation of additional bubbles and production of microcellular structures. The average cell size of the nanoclay-reinforced foams decreased in comparison with the pure foams, and it also resulted in higher stiffness of the foams. The influence of nanofillers on foam mechanical properties was twofold. For brittle PU foams, nanoclays acted as stress concentrators in cell walls, leading to a decrease of the mechanical properties. By contrast, ductile PP foams showed improved performance after addition of both nanoclays and carbon nanofibres. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{excellent}} thermal insulation properties, low-density polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> <b>foams</b> find applications {{in a wide}} variety of technological fields. They are notably used as thermal insulation in fuel tanks of Ariane rockets at very low temperatures. For this application, a relatively high mechanical strength is also required since the foams undergo significant mechanical loads during the flight. As a consequence, the mechanical strain undergone by the foams may affect their thermal behavior and vice versa, leading to a coupling between the mechanical and thermal properties. That is the reason why, in order to improve the modeling of the mechanical and thermal behaviors and to better understand their mutual influences, an original thermal model has been developed that is based on a shell mesh of the porous structures of <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> obtained by X-ray tomography. This permits the quick computation of the temperature field prevailing in the solid and fluid phases constituting the material and of the equivalent thermal transfer properties. The temperature field and thermal properties could then be used as entrance data of a mechanical finite-element computation. The effective thermal conductivities computed for non-deformed structures were compared with various correlations in the literature. Thereafter, the numerical model was applied to deformed structures obtained from mechanical finite-element computations modeling various mechanical loads. The analysis of the results highlights the major modifications of the thermal properties brought by different types of mechanical loads...|$|R
2500|$|Spinning rods {{are made}} from {{graphite}} or fiberglass with a cork or <b>PVC</b> <b>foam</b> handle, and tend to be between 5 and 8.5 feet (1.5–2.6 m) in length. Typically, spinning rods have anywhere from 5-8 guides arranged along {{the underside of the}} rod to help control the line. The eyes decrease in size from the handle to the tip, with the one nearest the handle usually much larger than the rest to allow less friction as the coiled line comes off the reel, and to gather the very large loops of line that come off the spinning reel's spool. Unlike bait casting and spin casting reels, the spinning reel hangs beneath the rod rather than sitting on top, and is held in place with a sliding or locking reel seat. The fisherman's second and third fingers straddle the [...] "leg" [...] of the reel where it is attached to the reel seat on the rod, and the weight of the reel hangs beneath the rod, which makes for a more comfortable way to fish for extended periods. This also allows the rod to be held in the fisherman's dominant hand (the handle on most modern spinning reels is reversible) which greatly increases control and nuance applied to the rod itself. Spinning rods and reels are widely used in fishing for popular North American sport fish including bass, trout, pike and walleye. Popular targets for spinning in the UK and European continent are pike, perch, eel and zander (walleye). Longer spinning rods with elongated grip handles for two-handed casting are frequently employed for saltwater or steelhead and salmon fishing. Spinning rods are also widely used for trolling and still fishing with live bait.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{mechanical}} properties and fracture behaviour {{of a range}} of core materials have been investigated in order to elucidate the impact properties of sandwich structures. Initially, the compression properties of the core have been evaluated at quasi-static and impact rates of strain. It has been shown that the plastic collapse strength of the cores is highly rate-sensitive, increasing by up to one hundred percent in passing from quasi-static to dynamic rates of loading. Subsequently, the SENB (Mode I) and shear (Mode II) fracture properties of the polymer foams were evaluated. Mode I tests have shown that the crosslinked <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> and the PET foams fail in a brittle manner, however, the linear <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> fail in a ductile mode. Here, {{it has been shown that}} the Mode II shear toughnesses of the crosslinked <b>PVC</b> <b>foams</b> were up to thirty-five times greater than their corresponding Mode I values. Following this, a series of indentation tests were conducted on polymer-foam sandwich structures and their response was characterised using a Meyer indentation law of the form P = Cn. It has been shown that the value of the exponent parameter, n, does not vary significantly with the properties of the core or the skin, typically being close to unity for all tests. The contact stiffness, C, was found to depend on the plastic collapse strength of the foam, the indentor radius and the properties of the skin. It has been shown that a plot of contact stiffness against plastic collapse strength, containing all of the quasi-static and dynamic data, appears to yield a unique curve. Subsequently, the perforation resistances {{of a range of}} foam-based sandwich structures were investigated. The influence of the plastic collapse stress of the foam in determining the failure thresholds of the front and rear composite skins has been established. Here, a simple model has been used to successfully predict failure of the top surface composite skin in the sandwich structures. In addition, the force associated with perforating the lightweight core has been shown to be strongly dependent on the shear strength of the polymer foam. The perforation response of sandwich structures based on fully-recyclable materials has also been investigated. The design of the SRPP skin has a significant effect on the energy-absorbing characteristics of the sandwich structure, with the performance of systems based on multiple layer skins greatly exceeding that associated with a monolithic skin. It has been shown that when normalised by the areal density of the panels, those sandwich structures with multiple layer skins out-perform systems with monolithic skins as well as conventional GFRP/aluminium honeycomb sandwich structures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: When a {{sandwich}} structure {{is subjected to}} transverse loads, the face sheets carry bending moments as tensile and compressive stresses and the core carries transverse forces as shear stresses. The core is typically the weakest component of the structure and {{is the first to}} fail in shear. In this study the shear fatigue behavior of two closed-cell cellular <b>PVC</b> <b>foams,</b> Divinycell HD 130 (linear) and H 130 (cross linked), with the same nominal density of 130 kg/m 3, were investigated. Static shear tests reveal that HD 130 foams are more ductile, have almost twice the energy absorption capability, and an extraordinary crack propagation resistance when compared to the H 130 foams. Shear fatigue tests were conducted at room temperature, at a frequency of 3 Hz and at a stress ratio, R 0. 1 on the HD 130 and H 130 foams. S–N curves were generated and shear fatigue characteristics were determined. The number of cycles to failure for the linear foams was substantially higher than that of the cross-linked <b>PVC</b> <b>foams.</b> HD foams have smaller cells with thicker faces and edges. This microstructure supports absorption of larger amounts of liquid resin forming a resin rich sub interface zone just below the actual core–skin interface. The high intrinsic toughness of the sub interface delays the initiation of fatigue cracks and thereby increases the fatigue life of the HD foams. For both foams, shear deformation occurs without volume change and the materials fail by shearing {{in the vicinity of the}} centerline of the specimen along the longitudinal axis. In both cases numerous 45 shear cracks form across the width of the specimen and are equidistantly spaced along the length of the specimen. The occurrence of these through the thickness shear cracks signals the final failure event during fatigue. Details of the experimental investigation and the evaluation of the fatigue performance are presented. KEY WORDS: foam core, shear fatigue, cross-linked, linear cores...|$|R
