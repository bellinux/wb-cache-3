The assessment, published in 2013, recommended the construction of the light rail along a 3.9 km route from Bondi Junction to Bondi Beach along Bondi Road.

It can now accommodate up to 1200 bus trips a day. The bridge now has a load-carrying capacity of 40 tonnes, instead of the previous 13 tonnes. In October 2009 the bridge was reopened by Mayor John Banks. The footpaths are covered with curved transparent screens installed in 2002, to prevent people from falling or jumping off and providing weather cover (the bridge had suicide prevention barriers from as early as 1936, replaced with mesh screens in 1957 that were removed in 1997. After the removal, suicides increased fivefold, leading to a quiet re-installation in 2002). There have been no suicides from the bridge since then until 2015, and the feature has been called an example of best practice of preventing such acts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Automation of {{logistic}} processes {{is essential}} to improve productivity and reduce costs. In this context, intelligent warehouses are becoming a key to logistic systems thanks to their ability of optimizing transportation tasks and, consequently, reducing costs. This paper initially presents briefly routing systems applied on intelligent warehouses. Then, we present the approach used to develop our router system. This router system is able to solve traffic jams and collisions, generate conflict-free and optimized paths before sending the final paths to the robotic forklifts. It also verifies the progress of all tasks. When a problem occurs, the router system can change the tasks <b>priorities,</b> <b>routes,</b> etc. {{in order to avoid}} new conflicts. In the routing simulations each vehicle executes its tasks starting from a predefined initial pose, moving to the desired position. Our algorithm is based on Dijkstra's shortestpath and the time window approaches and it was implemented in C language. Computer simulation tests were used to validate the algorithm efficiency under different working conditions. Several simulations were carried out using the Player/Stage Simulator to test the algorithms. Thanks to the simulations, we could solve many faults and refine the algorithms before embedding them in real robots. T I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Existing priority-based QoS routing {{protocols}} in ad hoc wireless networks {{did not consider}} the effect of mutual interference between routes in wireless medium during routing. We have investigated the effect of mutual interference on the routing performance in wireless environment and explored the advantage of using zone-disjoint routes to avoid mutual interference and to improve the network performance. In this paper, a priority based QoS routing scheme is proposed that uses the notion of zone-disjoint routes. Our protocol avoids the contention {{between high and low}} <b>priority</b> <b>routes</b> by reserving high priority zone of communication. Low priority flows will try to avoid this zone by selecting routes that is maximally zonedisjoint with respect to the high priority reserved zone and will consequently allow a contention-free transmission of high priority traffic in that reserved zone. If, under some unavoidable situations, a low priority flow has to go through high priority reserved zone causing interference then it will block itself temporarily to allow contention-free transmission of high priority flows and later may resume the blocked communication if possible. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed protocol on QualNet network simulator.
