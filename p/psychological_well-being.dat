50|$|According to Corey Keyes, who {{collaborated with}} Carol Ryff {{and uses the}} term flourishing as a central concept, mental {{well-being}} has three components, namely hedonic (c.q. subjective or emotional), <b>psychological,</b> and social <b>well-being.</b> Hedonic well-being concerns emotional aspects of <b>well-being,</b> whereas <b>psychological</b> and social <b>well-being,</b> c.q eudaimonic well-being, concerns skills, abilities, and optimal functioning.

40|$|Whether {{conceived}} of as a momentary state or as an ongoing process of growth and adaptation to changing life circumstances, well-being has {{become the focus of}} much research in recent years. Quality of life, wellness, happiness, and thriving are related terms used by researchers that similarly convey the notion of experiencing life as something positive and satisfying. The term <b>psychological</b> health and <b>well-being</b> further delineates this idea by suggesting that psychological health is central to the experience of well-being. In 2009, Bishop’s University identified <b>psychological</b> health and <b>well-being</b> as one its four strategic research areas which focuses on finding ways to improve {{the health and well-being of}} individuals and the communities. The <b>Psychological</b> Health and <b>Well-being</b> Research Cluster is the research group with members from the Social Sciences, Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Business, whose activities are aligned with this aim. Their overall objective is to produce knowledge regarding how people and groups within the community can pursue their goals in ways that support health and well-being, and to identify the tools to help them achieve this. As the recently appointed Tier II Canada Research Chair for the <b>Psychological</b> Health and <b>Well-being</b> research cluster at Bishop’s University it is my pleasure to have this opportunity to present and discuss this important topic. In this paper I will outline current conceptualizations of <b>psychological</b> health and <b>well-being,</b> and why it is an important goal both for individuals and communities.

The study used a survey design and MEQI to collect data. One thousand and four teachers participated in this study. The study examines EI from four different factors (personal management, people management, spirituality and maturity) and 28 core competencies. Findings from the study show that both groups have similar EI profile. However, they have low abilities in a number of areas, namely; emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment, achievement drive, influencing skills, conflict management, change catalyst, and leadership. Both groups also scored high in spirituality and maturity. In conclusion, although both groups have similar EI profile, the study shows that the residential school teachers have higher EI when compared to the daily school teachers...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relation between coping strategies of inmates and their <b>psychological</b> and physical <b>well-being.</b> General affective states such as optimism were related to both <b>psychological</b> and physical <b>well-being.</b> Moreover, inmates who experienced specific negative emotions such as regret, anxiety, and sadness reported more psychological and physical complaints. The way in which inmates coped with these negative emotions was also important. Inmates who used an active emotion-focused coping strategy were in better health than inmates inclined to keep their negative feelings to themselves. Emotion-focused coping by sharing negative emotions with people in one's social network can help to increase both <b>psychological</b> and physical <b>well-being.</b> Engaging in emotion management in a more cognitive way, by emphasizing positive aspects of the situation, can help to reduce the intensity of negative emotions.

25|$|Caring in {{intimate}} relationships is {{the practice of}} providing care and support to an intimate relationship partner.

Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's <b>psychological</b> <b>well-being,</b> {{as well as the}} quality {{of the relationship between the}} caregiver and the care-recipient.

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to ascertain the associations between acculturation and well-being in first-generation and second-generation immigrant college students. Acculturation was operationalized as a multidimensional construct comprised of heritage and American cultural prac-tices, values (individualism and collectivism), and identifications, and well-being was operationalized in terms of subjective, psychological, and eudaimonic components. Method: Participants were 2, 774 first-generation and second-generation immigrant students (70 % women), from 6 ethnic groups and from 30 colleges and universities around the United States. Participants completed measures of heritage and American cultural practices, values, and identifications, as well as of subjective, psycho-logical, and eudaimonic well-being. Results: Findings indicated that individualistic values were positively related to <b>psychological</b> and eudaimonic <b>well-being,</b> and positively, although somewhat less strongly, linked with subjective well-being. American and heritage identifications were both modestly related to <b>psychological</b> and eudaimonic <b>well-being.</b> These findings were consistent across gender, immigrant generation (first versus second), and ethnicity. Conclusions: <b>Psychological</b> and eudai-monic <b>well-being</b> appear to be inherently individualistic conceptions of happiness, and endorsement of individualistic values appears linked with these forms of well-being.

METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized to laparoscopic or open 360 degrees fundoplication. Data were collected by questionnaires and interviews preoperatively, 1 month and 6 months after operation. RESULTS: Five patients in the laparoscopic group were converted to open surgery. <b>Psychological</b> general <b>well-being</b> increased after surgery and reached norm values in both study groups. No significant differences were found between the two types of surgery in the per protocol analysis, while the domain self-control was significantly better after open surgery in the intention-to-treat analysis. There was improvement of diet and sleep in both study groups; after 6 months, disturbed sleep was significantly more uncommon after open surgery. Dysphagia and flatulence were new symptoms that were reported after surgery. Overall perception of the results of the operation did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Psychological</b> general <b>well-being,</b> diet and sleep improved after both laparoscopic and open surgery. There were only small differences between the groups, but in some respects the results were better after open surgery...|$|R

This study investigated the extent to which differences in the presence of trauma, political and normative stressors, family resources, family coping, and family hardiness could account for variation in women <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>well-being.</b> Results indicated that normative stressors were more predictive of <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>well-being</b> than was the presence of trauma or political stressors. However, political stressors and normative stressors had albeit different effects on the mental health status of both traumatized and non-traumatized women. While the social-psychological resources of women were found to be negatively related to <b>psychological</b> distress and <b>well-being,</b> the sociodemographic resources had different patterns of relations. Also, family hardiness was evidenced to have an influence on perceived psychological distress among traumatized and non-traumatized women, whereas effective coping and supportive resources may directly affect functioning among traumatized women only.
