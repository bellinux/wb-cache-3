40|$|In this thesis, a {{numerical}} study of film cooling in hypersonic laminar and turbulent flows has been performed using an in-house Navier-Stokes solver. The {{aim of this}} computational work is to investigate the mechanism and effectiveness of film cooling in hypersonic laminar and turbulent flows. Hypersonic flow over a flat plate without film cooling was first studied to provide a reference datum to check the effectiveness of film cooling. For laminar film cooling (M¥ = 9. 9), three different primary flow conditions were first used for validation. The inclusion {{of the development of}} the flow in the plenum chamber upstream of the slot was found to provide better heat prediction than a uniform boundary condition at the slot exit. Detailed information of the flow field including velocity profile, Mach contour, temperature contour and heat transfer rate was presented. The mechanism of film cooling has been revealed according to the plots of calculated velocity profiles, Mach contours and temperature contours downstream of the slot. The coolant fluid was found to affect the primary boundary layer in two ways: 1) initially a separate layer established by the coolant fluid itself in the near slot area, 2) later a mixing layer between the primary and coolant flow streams. Then five coolant injection rates between 2. 95 x 10 - 4 and 7. 33 x 10 - 4 kg/s and three slot heights 0. 8382, 1. 2192, 1. 6002 mm, were examined in hypersonic laminar film cooling. For turbulent film cooling (M¥ = 8. 2), for the geometry used in the experiment, the injection at an angle of 20 ° was found to be appropriate. Different turbulence models including Wilcox's k - w model. Menter's baseline and SST model have been tested. It is concluded that the Wilcox's k - w turbulence model with dilatation-dissipation correction provides the best heat prediction. Again, five coolant injection rates varies from 5. 07 x 10 - 4 to 30. 69 x 10 - 4 kg/s and three slot heights (the same as studied in the laminar film cooling) were studied to check the influence on film cooling effectiveness. Both the coolant and the primary flow were air. Film cooling was found to be an effective way to protect wall surfaces that are exposed under a high heat transfer environment especially in hypersonic laminar flow. Increasing the coolant injection rate can obviously increase the film cooling effectiveness. Again, this works better in laminar flow than in turbulent flow. The coolant injection rate in turbulent flow should be considered to be high enough to give good heat <b>protection.</b> <b>Slot</b> height in both laminar and turbulent flows under the flow conditions in this study was found to be less important, which means other factors can be considered in priority when constructing film cooling systems. With the application of curve fitting, the cooling length was described using power laws according to curve fitting results. A two-equation film coating model has been presented to illustrate the relation between the film cooling effectiveness and the parameter x/(h/m). For film cooling effectiveness in log-log coordinates, a second-order polynomial curve can be used to fit the laminar flows, whilst a straight line is suitable for the turbulent flows...|$|E
40|$|Viruses are {{ubiquitous}} in natural environments {{where they can}} exist as natural inhabitants or as contaminants from the disposal of human and animal wastes. Studies of viruses in nature are hampered because currently available methods for detection are not ideally suited to environmental applications. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, a modified hybridization assay is presented which employs DNase <b>protection</b> and <b>slot</b> blot methods to measure quantitatively the concentration of soluble and bacteriophage-encapsulated DNA in fluid samples. The potential use of this assay for estimating virus viability was tested with a model system consisting of inactivating bacteriophage lambda particles. These experiments show that the new hybridization assay provides upper-limit estimates of bacteriophage viability when inactivation results in the release of DNA. The mobility and ecology of viruses in natural environments is strongly influenced by the adsorption of virus particles to solid surfaces. In the second part of this thesis, a kinetic theory for virus adsorption and inactivation in batch experiments is presented. Based on the results of this theory, a new experimental approach is proposed for studying the effects of solid surfaces on virus partitioning and survival over long time scales. In the third part of the thesis, this new experimental approach was used to investigate the interactions between bacteriophage lambda particles and Ottawa sand over the course of days. Virus/surface interactions on these time scales were strongly dependent on solution pH and electrolyte composition. Sand stabilized the virus at high pH (10) and reduced fluid-phase virus infectivity at intermediate to low pH (5 and 7). The observed reduction in virus infectivity at pH 7 was attributed to virus adsorption to the sand surface, based on data from elution experiments. Viruses adsorbed to the sand at pH 7 desorbed when the sand was resuspended in nutrient broth, but not when the sand was resuspended in a virus-free pH 7 buffer. When model simulations were compared to elution data, virus adsorption did not follow the predictions of quasi-equilibrium adsorption models. On the basis of these results, several alternative kinetic mechanisms for virus adsorption are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Bets are {{a special}} type of game of chance. In a certain sense, {{you could think}} of all games of chance as a bet (bet that the {{roulette}} ball comes to rest in number 7, betting on the correct result in the lottery etc.), but most countries have implemented a categorisation. A categorisation {{that is not only}} under pressure online, but just as much in the real world with the introduction of virtual bets. In Belgium, virtual bets were accepted because bets are highly dependent on events, and players also like to make a bet when no events are taking place. First virtual online betting appeared on the market via the websites of the arcades and the bets, but following a new framework memorandum from the Gaming Commission, it also became a success in the real world. Success that went hand in hand with growing criticism {{in the interests of the}} coherence rules in the area of protecting the player. Although the criticism also partly arose among the betting operators who ran gambling machines in arcades, the discussion about a further restriction on virtual bets showed many similarities with the discussion about the FOBT (fixed odds betting terminals) in the United Kingdom. Betting premises have ease of access and in Belgium a high threshold was introduced for games of chance that were considered more dangerous (e. g. slots, black jack, roulette etc.). Since there is no betting event, the odds are more RNG driven and the playing frequency can be very high, some people are offended that somebody aged 20 may not enter arcade, but he may, without any embarrassment, wager large sums on virtual betting events. In response to the rule applied by the Gaming Commission not to allow people under the age of 21 to make virtual bets on a betting website. In Belgium, bets can be placed in a newspaper shop (sport bets up to 200 euro per day per person), in a mobile betting office (bets linked to the event for which the mobile licence has been obtained) and in a betting shop (no limit to the number of bets or wagers, but for wagers above 1000 euro, a complete identification and registration of the player and the bet must be made). Bets on virtual (sport) events can only be accepted in betting shops and not in newspaper shops or via mobile betting offices. In summary, virtual betting is permitted in Belgium, but there are constricting provisions in force. The online virtual bets are placed on the same level of <b>protection</b> as <b>slot</b> machines, unlike the virtual bets in the real world, which are accessible from the age of 18, but can only be operated in a limited manner. Further restrictions, including even a prohibition for betting offices to operate virtual bets, also remain a possibility, if the virtual bets evolve further into a game of chance with high playing frequently whereby the event is in practice no longer of no significance and no sufficient protection of the player can be guaranteed...|$|R
