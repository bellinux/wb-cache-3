The deposition of copper on <b>pyrite</b> from cyanide <b>bearing</b> solutions is unknown {{and is the}} objective of this study. The electrochemical behaviour of pyrite in a solution with CN/Cu mole ratio of 3 / 1 has been investigated in different solution pH values. It was found that, at pH 7, cuprous cyanide can be oxidized to Cu(ii) oxide/hydroxide which deposit on the pyrite surface and transform to Cu(i) -sulfide during the subsequent cathodic sweeping. However, this anodic deposition process is inhibited either at pH 10 due to the dissolution of solid Cu(ii) /Cu(i) -species by Cu(CN), or at pH 5 due to the high solubility of Cu(ii) oxide/hydroxide. On the other hand, Cu(CN) can be deposited onto pyrite, forming a Cu(i) -sulfide layer at more reducing potentials.

40|$|Introduction Pyrite is {{the most}} {{abundant}} sulfide mineral in low sulfidation ore deposits. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} low-temperature (200 °C) from hydrothermal or metamorphic fluids (Butler and Rickard, 2000). Framboidal pyrite mostly occurs in sedimentary environments, though it could also form during metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration (Scott et al., 2009). The pyrite formed tends to be enriched in various trace elements such as Au and As. For this study we have combined the geology, alteration, mineralization with recent studies of the description of the deposit from core logging and underground mapping and geochemistry in the CheshmehZard gold district and also investigated the compositional variation and textural differences between pyrite types. This study is {{based on the results of}} our alteration and mineralization mapping and detailed logging of 1937. 8 m of drill core. Materials and Methods Geology, hydrothermal alteration and mineralization were examined in drill holes along several cross sections. Host-rock alteration minerals and veins were determined for 11 samples using standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) techniques. Polished sections were studied by reflected light microscopy and backscattered electron images (BSE). In this study, the trace-element composition of pyrite samples from the Au-III vein system was obtained using electron microprobe analyzer (EMPA) data. All analyseswere carried out at the department of Materials Engineering and Physics of the University of Salzburg in Austria. The EMPA measurements and BSE imaging were made using a JXA- 8600 electron microprobe. Spot analyses of 30 pyrite grains from CheshmehZard are given in Table 1. Results The study area is located in the north of Khorasan Razavi Province 45 km to the south of Neyshabour. The area near CheshmehZard could become important as a site of economically significant gold mineralization. Six gold-bearing vein systems were recognized east of Arghash. The estimated resources are about 2 million metric tons of potential ore with an average of 1. 9 g/t Au (Samadi, 2001;Ashrafpour et al., 2012). Multiple intrusive events are recognized in the region including Precambrian to post-Oligocene-Miocene igneous rocks (Alaminia et al., 2013 a). This includes the Arghash diorite pluton, upper Cretaceous granitoids (minor diorite, mainly quartz monzodiorite and granodiorite), early Eocene granite and several lamprophyre and small intrusions of quartz monzodiorite porphyries. Volcanicsinclude andesite, dacite, pillow basalt and tuffs. Sedimentary rocks are conglomerate and minor limestone. Gold veins are hosted by intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks, tuffs, granite, granodiorite, and conglomerate. Veins consist of calcite and quartz. The main alteration zones mapped at the surface and underground are sericite-quartz-pyrite-calcite, withsilicified, propylitic, argillic, and carbonate zones. The mineralization associated with sericiticalteration and silicificationoccurs asveinlets and disseminated in the propylitic zone. Gangue minerals are quartz, chalcedony, calcite, adularia, illite, and kaolinite. Mineralization occurs as veinlets, breccia filling and disseminated. The veinlets are comprised of pyrite, arsenopyrite, minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, magnetite and hematite. Pyrite is the main sulfide mineral in the hypogene ore. Samples were collected with the objective of studying the pyrite in the Au (III) vein systems. All samples were therefore pyrite rich. The paragenesiswas determined to show four stages of mineralization based on the following microscopic observations: 1. an initial pyrite veinlet stage with associated quartz, chlorite, epidote. Pyrite is fine to medium grained, anhedral and gold-poor. 2. a second pyritic stage (polymetallic sulfide stage) contains pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, quartz and chalcedony, minor adularia and arsenopyrite. 3. An As-bearing pyrite stage with sericite, chalcedony and quartz. The pyrite isframboidal [...] 4. Finally, a carbonate-dominated stage. The pyrite is euhedral to anhedral and coarse grained. The Au concentration in Stages 2 and 3 pyrite is higher than that in Stage 4 pyrite. Conclusions The gangue mineral assemblages of carbonate, chlorite, quartz, and minor sericite and potassium feldspar in the ore-forming process of the CheshmehZard gold district suggest that the pH value of the hydrothermal fluids was near neutral to slightly acid (approximately 4. 5 to 5. 3 under 250 to 300 °C and 1 kbar conditions) and that gold would be transported mainly as Au(HS) 2 - (Stefansson and Seward, 2004). Three types of pyrite based on the chemical composition have been investigated: As- <b>bearing</b> <b>pyrite,</b> Ti-V - <b>bearing</b> <b>pyrite</b> and pure or barren pyrite.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to provide}} an in-depth analysis and interpretation of the mechanical behaviour of lime-slag treated <b>pyrite</b> <b>bearing</b> Coode Island Silt (CIS), a widely occurring problematic soft soil in the Melbourne CBD area. This study analyses the time-dependent strength development characteristics, compression behaviour and undrained shear behaviour of CIS treated with different amounts of lime and slag. In {{the course of this}} study a new virgin compression model that can reproduce the compression behaviour {{of a wide range of}} structured soils including naturally structured soils and artificially cemented soils has been developed. The new model has been employed to interpret the compressibility behaviour of lime-slag treated CIS. An investigation on the time-dependent strength development of the treated soils mass through unconfined compressive strength tests revealed that slag, in combination with a lime content higher than the lime saturation point (the minimum lime content at which the pH of the solution prepared with soil, lime, and water becomes approximately 12. 4), can effectively improve the strength and stiffness of soft <b>pyrite</b> <b>bearing</b> CIS. Strength was found to be almost independent of lime content at different curing periods whereas slag was found to have considerable influence on the developed strength at all curing periods. The effect of curing was found to be most prominent at earlier phases of curing. However, its effect on the strength development was found to cease gradually due to gradual decline in the rate of pozzolanic reactions. A comprehensive review of literature revealed that the virgin compression behaviour of structured soils immediately after yield is controlled by the progressive collapse of larger inter-aggregate pores and when these macro pores are collapsed, compression behaviour is controlled by the mineralogy of the soil aggregates. A new virgin compression model based on two easily determinable parameters was developed and the developed model is able to reproduce the compression behaviour of a wide range of structured soils including naturally structured soils and artificially cemented soils. One of the parameters corresponds to the compression caused by the collapse of larger macro-pores while the other parameter corresponds to the compression behaviour at the stress range where the effect of soil mineralogy is the dominant factor. Study on the compressibility behaviour of lime-slag treated CIS revealed that the influences of different experimental variables on the yield strength were very similar to their influences on the UCS values. It was found that compressibility generally increases with an increase in yield strength. The model parameter which characterizes the compression behaviour in the structure controlled zone was found to decrease with an increase in the degree of cementation. On the other hand the parameter that controls the compression behaviour in the de-structured state was found to vary within a much narrow range for all the cases investigated possibly due to comparatively less influence of different experimental variables on the mineralogical alteration of the treated material. Investigation on the undrained shearing behaviour of treated CIS divulged that slag content increases both strength and stiffness of the treated CIS. Consolidation pressure was found to have significant influence on the strength, stiffness and overall stress-strain characteristics. The effect of a change in consolidation pressure on the stress-strain behaviour was found to be more prominent when the treated CIS was sheared from an elevated level of consolidation pressure. It was suggested that at low level of consolidation pressure, the behaviour up to the peak stress is controlled by the response of the cementitious bonds and the post-peak response is characterized by the inhomogeneous deformations of the samples. At elevated consolidation pressure, the brittleness at peak stress state was found to decrease and the stress-strain behaviour was found to be of progressively strain-softening type. The peak strength parameters derived from the result of triaxial tests indicated that peak friction angle does not change significantly with a change in the degree of cementation but the cohesion intercept was found to increase with the degree of cementation. Due to presence of strong discontinuities in the post-peak region, especially for the samples sheared from low level of consolidation pressures, it was not possible to derive a unique set of strength parameters corresponding to de-structured state of the lime-slag treated CIS. The outcomes of this study will equip the geotechnical practitioners with the knowledge required to incorporate cementitious stabilization of <b>pyrite</b> <b>bearing</b> soft soils with lime and slag, which is an abundantly available industrial by-product in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) {{is one of}} {{the major}} environmental challenges facing the South African mining sector. Acid mine drainage has received significant public attention in recent years. South Africa's long mining history has led to a growing concern that coal-related AMD from these mines (both operational and defunct) will continue for centuries to come. <b>Pyrite</b> <b>bearing</b> fine waste, generated during coal preparation and beneficiation, is thought to carry a significant amount of AMD pollution risk. Coal-related AMD generation has not been afforded the same exposure as AMD generation from high sulphide minerals such as gold and copper ores. This is exacerbated by the growing concern over water quality degradation in the Mpumalanga region of South Africa. The development of integrated solutions to address the management of coal-related AMD requires an understanding of the principle causes behind coal-related AMD. To date, most of the prediction methods described in literature have been derived for the prediction of AMD in metal bearing ores. Furthermore, some of these methods are based on assumptions and do not take into consideration the various sulphur species present. Additionally, some of these methods have limited applicability to coal due to the high total organic carbon content (TOC) of the material. This research project attempts to address these short comings and uncertainties by developing a systematic and meaningful framework for the characterisation of South African coal and coal waste. The research project contributes to the knowledge of coal-related AMD with particular emphasis on the characterisation methods responsible for sulphur speciation and mineralogy for coal. The approach entails carrying out a case study assessment aimed at empirically assessing a coal tailings sample according to: particle size distribution, textural reference, mineralogical characteristics, and how the aforementioned factors influence the acid potential in coal. The approach intends to address key factors which include: identifying the sulphur bearing organic and inorganic constituents related AMD generation in coal, assessing how the mineralogy, texture and particle size distribution contribute to AMD potential in coal tailings, and then identifying suitable analytical techniques and test methods which can provide data. The combination of these key outcomes will seek to provide a systematic and meaningful framework for the characterisation of coal and coal waste streams. The characterisation methods used in this case study outlined a framework focusing on four main areas of acid mine drainage characterisation for coal wastes, these included: chemical characterisation, mineralogical characterisation, sulphur speciation and AMD prediction. This comprehensive approach employed a suite of techniques, including: petrography, quantitative x-ray diffraction (QXRD) and quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron spectrometry (QEMSCAN) ...|$|E
40|$|Mine {{abandonment}} and {{the discharge}} of contaminated mine water is recognised globally as {{a major source of}} surface water and groundwater pollution. Contamination generally arises from the oxidation of sulphide minerals, principally pyrite, by the mining process, and the subsequent chemical reactions can lead to {{the discharge of}} mineralised, often acidic, iron, and sulphate rich waters. In many historically mined river catchments, mine water discharge is the main cause of poor water quality. Within the UK, managing the legacy of abandoned mines is one of the principal challenges presented by modern environmental legislation, particularly the EU Water Framework Directive, a challenge that is exacerbated by the diverse and widespread nature of historical mining. The impact and hazard associated with abandoned mining in one of the UK’s most intensively mined regions, the Almond River Catchment, Scotland, was examined via: 1) a detailed GIS mapping and investigation of historical mining processes in the catchment, 2) mine site discharge sampling, 3) detailed site investigations, 4) geochemical modelling of four mine waste sites and 5) analysis of temporal and spatial river water quality in the catchment. The results are then brought together to produce a catchment scale mine water hazard map. Mapping has identified over 300 mine sites in the catchment including coal, oil shale and ironstone mine wastes and flooded coal and oil shale mines. The historical development of oil shale retort methods has been shown {{to have an impact on}} potential hazard. Sampling of discharge waters from the different mining activities, in conjunction with detailed mineralogical analysis and geochemical modelling at the four mine waste sites has characterised the main hazards. Ironstone and <b>pyrite</b> <b>bearing</b> coal mine wastes discharge waters with highly elevated Fe and sulphate concentrations, up to 160 mgl- 1 and 1900 mgl- 1 respectively, due to extensive pyrite oxidation and acid generating salt dissolution (principally jarosite). Coal mine wastes show variable mineralogy, due to the diverse nature of coal bearing strata, and discharge waters with variable chemistry. Oil Shale mine wastes are generally depleted in pyrite due to historic processing and discharge low sulphate waters with moderately elevated Fe concentrations, up to 5 mgl- 1. Flooded coal mines discharge sulphate dominant alkaline waters, due to the availability of carbonate minerals in the mine complex, with elevated Fe concentrations, up to 50 mgl- 1, while flooded oil shale mines discharge waters with moderately elevated Fe concentrations, up to 4 mgl- 1, due to lower pyrite content in mine strata and reduced availability of oxygen related to mine abandonment age. Once in the surface water environment iron and sulphate display significant concentration-flow dependence: iron increases at high flows due to the re-suspension of river bed iron precipitates (Fe(OH) 3); sulphate concentrations decrease with increased flow as a result of dilution. Further examination of iron and sulphate loading at low flows indicates a close correlation of iron and sulphate with mined areas; cumulative low flow load calculations indicate that coal and oil shale mining regions contribute 0. 21 and 0. 31 g/s of iron, respectively, to the main Almond tributary. Decreases in iron loading on river sections demonstrate the deposition and diffuse storage of iron within the river channel. This river bed iron is re-suspended with increased flow resulting in significant transport of diffuse iron downstream with load values of up to 50 g/s iron. Based on this hazard classification, a catchment scale mine water hazard map has been developed. The map allows the prioritisation of actions for future mine water management...|$|E

Molybdenite, pyrite and chalcopyrite samples from mineralized quartz veins and mylonitic shear zones yield Re–Os model ages that range from 1. 95 to 1. 88 Ga, whereas ca. 1. 88 Ga <b>pyrite</b> with gold <b>bearing</b> inclusions and sampled from the host mylonitic shear zone suggest that gold occurred relatively late in this hydrothermal history. The ca. 1. 88 Ga gold event is recorded at all five of the studied prospects, whereas the relationship between gold and the disparately older 1. 95 and 1. 94 Ga Re–Os molybdenite ages is unclear. New U–Pb metamorphic titanite dating of a foliated Archaean granite sample (ca. 2. 76 Ga) suggests that the onset of ductile deformation within the Lupa Goldfield occurred at ca. 1. 92 Ga, and some ca. 40 Myr prior to auriferous and brittle–ductile mylonitic shear zones at ca. 1. 88 Ga. Early ductile deformation is not associated with gold mineralization, but the ductile deformation fabrics and, in particular the development of rheologically weak chloritic folia, may have acted as zones of pre-existing weakness that localized strain and influenced the geometry of later auriferous mylonitic shear zones.

40|$|The Ertsberg {{district}} hosts multiple skarn and porphyry-related deposits comprising one of {{the largest}} Cu-Au resources in the world. The geological and geochronological framework suggests economically significant igneous and hydrothermal events in the district occurred as two distinct evolving episodes separated by less than 500, 000 years. The igneous complexes (Grasberg Igneous Complex ca < 3. 33 - 3 Ma and Ertsberg ca 3 - 2. 67 Ma) are respectively post-dated by early porphyry-style mineralisation and spatially related skarn Cu-Au mineralisation. Deep-intermediate high sulphidation style mineralisation occurred as a late development at both locations. The West Grasberg estimated gold resource (ca. 700, 000 ounces) overprints limestone breccias and banded clay maar sediments on the western margin of the Grasberg Igneous Complex (GIC). Volcanic-diatreme activity is interpreted to have facilitated banded clay subsidence after extensive porphyry-style potassic, magnetite and quartz alteration occurred in the GIC but prior to cessation of hydrothermal mineralisation. Native gold±pyrite occurrences are spatially associated with smectite-chlorite clay, and Au-As-Bi-Te <b>bearing</b> <b>pyrite.</b> Gold mineralisation may have occurred contemporaneously with high sulphidation Au-As-Bi associations in the Kucing Liar Cu-Au deposit which occurs at depth nearby.

The Big Gossan occurrence is younger « 2. 82 ±O. 04 Ma based on a new ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar phlogopite date from the Big Gossan skarn). Adularia deposited in leached sandstone at the Wanagon Gold occurrence has a ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar K-feldspar age of 3. 62 ±O. 05 Ma. A published K-Ar date (3. 81 ±O. 06 Ma) from the Wanagon Sill constrains formation of the overprinting skarn Cu-Au and late-stage Wanagon Gold occurrence to a period of ca.

40|$|Problem statement: The Muteh mining {{district}} {{is located in}} 70 km northeast of Golpaygan city within the Sanandaj-Sirjan metamorphic belt. There are 2 gold mines, 7 gold occurrences and numerous mineral indices in the Muteh gold district. There are few researches on Muteh gold district, but a detailed model is not clear yet. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine mineralogy of gold-bearing rocks and the role of these rocks in concentration of gold and to improve our knowledge about Muteh model. Approach: Detailed fieldwork carried out at different scales at the Muteh district. About 50 outcrops samples examined petrographically. Fifteen samples containing veinlets of sulfides and quartz selected for H, O and S stable isotope analysis. Petrography characterized by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray powder Diffraction (XRD) analysis. Results: Geological studies indicated that the study area show a major poly-phase metamorphism. Since the latest metamorphism was weaker than the earlier ones, the older rocks were affected by more intense metamorphism. The metamorphic rocks mainly consist of schists, quartzite, marble, amphibolite and gneisses. These rocks show two foliations (S 1 and S 2). The S 2 foliation is the major phase in the metamorphic rocks. Pyrite is the most abundant and the important gold-bearing mineral at the study area. Based on evidences of deformation (S 2) and crystallization, three main types of pyrites can be distinguished in the Muteh deposit: (1) pre-tectonic or gold <b>bearing</b> <b>pyrite</b> (2) syn-tectonic or disseminated pyrites along the foliation of the host rocks. (3) pyrite aggregates in the host rocks or in the metamorphic segregation quartz veins crosscutting the foliation of the host rocks. The sulfur isotope studies were carried out on pyrites within quartz veinlets, biotite schist and meta-volcanic rocks at the Muteh deposit. Five available data are highly variable even from the same types of hosted rocks and their &# 948; 34 S are + 2. 2, 6. 6, 9. 1, 13. 9 and 16. 9 % 0. Conclusion: There are three generations of pyrite in Muteh gold district. According to isotope data, it seems that source of sulfurs were not homogenous. The values showed more than one geological event for generation of pyrites in the study area. Compositions of sulfur isotopes indicated several different sources or processes for the sulfide fluids.

Although at high temperature HSE are expected to be in lattice of sulfides they are usually found as discrete phases or platinum-group minerals (PGM). Many of PGM have metalloids (As, Se, Sb, Te and Bi) as essential constituents but, despite this relationship, the role of metalloids on HSE mineralization is still unclear. This dissertation documents the results of three experimental studies undertaken to investigate the effect of metalloids on the geochemistry of HSE. The first study examined whether the metalloids can mobilize HSE in an anhydrous environment. The results show that metalloids do not transport the HSE but also that Au, Pd and Pt can be efficiently fractionated from the other HSE and transported away from a sulfide assemblage through a relatively low-porosity, low-permeability medium in absence of hydrothermal fluids. The second study investigated the solubility of metalloids in monosulfide solid solution (mss) and intermediate solid solution (iss), to asses the conditions required for the formation of immiscible metalloid liquids and their effect on HSE partitioning. The results show that the metalloids form two separate phases, one that is As-rich and strongly sequestered Pt from the sulfides and another that is Bi-Te rich and affected mostly Pd and Au. The results also show that the other HSE (Ru, Rh, Re, Os, Ir) are largely unaffected by the presence of metalloids. In addition the results show that mss can dissolve significant amounts of metalloids (hundreds of ppm) before metalloid V saturation can occur. The third study constrained the geochemical behavior of metalloids and HSE in a pyrite-bearing sulfide system. The results show that Co-Ni-rich and HSE <b>bearing</b> <b>pyrite</b> can form during cooling of a sulfide melt and also that the HSE partition roughly equally between mss and pyrite, whereas Pd that partitions preferentially into mss and Au partitions preferentially into iss. Moreover, pyrite showed compositional zonation of many elements similar to that documented in natural pyrite samples that are also Co-rich and HSE-bearing. Thus, identification of such pyrite in natural assemblages is consistent with a magmatic origin. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in Mineral Deposits and Precambrian Geolog...|$|R
