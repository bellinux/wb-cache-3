25|$|Bromelain {{is present}} {{in all parts of}} the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> (Ananas sp.), but the stem is the most common {{commercial}} source, presumably because usable quantities are readily extractable after the fruit has been harvested.|$|R
5000|$|The camisa blouse is {{a garment}} that {{originated}} in the Philippines. It is made from a cloth that has been woven using thread made from the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant.</b> The thread is known as piña thread. Clothing and accessories, like shawls, were made out of piña. These began to be woven in the Philippines in the 16th century, and are still being made today. THE TEXTILE MUSEUM says that [...] "The <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> is not a native species to the Philippines it {{is thought to have}} been introduced by the Spanish". Because the cloth took a very long time to make, it was highly sought after and wearing a camisa blouse was seen as a sign of wealth.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> in Queensland were {{landed at}} the new Redcliffe {{settlement}} by the brig Amity in 1824, and in 1829 the Colonial Botanist Charles Fraser listed 34 <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> amongst the crops flourishing in the 15-acre government garden at Brisbane that he had laid out in 1828. In the 1870s and 1880s experiments in pineapple growing occurred in {{what would become the}} Maroochy Shire, but the first commercial pineapple crop in the area was at Thomas Davey's Woombye farm in 1895.|$|E

50|$|Piña is a fiber {{made from}} the leaves of a <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> and is {{commonly}} used in the Philippines. It is sometimes combined with silk or polyester to create a textile fabric. Piña's name comes from the Spanish word piña which means pineapple.|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{state of the}} <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> has a large effect on plant growth, on fruit production, and fruit quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the uptake, accumulation, and export of nutrients by the irrigated 'Vitória' <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> during and at the end of its development. A randomized block statistical design with four replications was used. The treatments were defined by different times of plant collection: at 270, 330, 390, 450, 510, 570, 690, 750, and 810 days after planting (DAP). The collected plants were separated into the following components: leaves, stem, roots, fruit, and slips for determination of fresh and dry matter weight at 65 ºC. After drying, the plant components were ground for characterization of the composition and content of nutrients taken up and exported by the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant.</b> The results were subjected to analysis of variance, and non-linear regression models were fitted for the significant differences identified by the F test (p N > S > Ca > Mg > P, which corresponded to 898, 452, 134, 129, 126, and 107 kg ha- 1, respectively, of total accumulation. The export of macronutrients by the pineapple fruit was in the following decreasing order: K > N > S > Ca > P > Mg, which was equivalent to 18, 17, 11, 8, 8, and 5 %, respectively, of the total accumulated by the pineapple. The 'Vitória' <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> exported 78 kg ha- 1 of N, 8 kg ha- 1 of P, 164 kg ha- 1 of K, 14 kg ha- 1 of S, 10 kg ha- 1 of Ca, and 6 kg ha- 1 of Mg by the fruit. The nutrient content exported by the fruits represent important components of nutrient extraction from the soil, which need to be restored, while the nutrients contained in the leaves, stems and roots can be incorporated in the soil within a program of recycling of crop residues...|$|R
50|$|In 1800, Joséphine built {{a heated}} orangery {{large enough for}} 300 <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants.</b> Five years later, she ordered the {{building}} of a greenhouse, heated by a dozen coal-burning stoves.

50|$|Heart-rot is {{the most}} serious disease {{affecting}} <b>pineapple</b> <b>plants.</b> The disease is caused by Phytophthora Cinnamoni and P. parasitica, fungi that often affect pineapples grown in wet conditions. Since it is difficult to treat, it is advisable to guard against infection by planting resistant cultivars where these are available; all suckers that are required for propagation should be dipped in a fungicide, since the fungus enters through the wounds.|$|E
30|$|Bromelain is {{a general}} name given {{to the family of}} {{sulfhydryl}} proteolytic enzymes (cysteine proteases) obtained from the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant,</b> Ananas comosus. Depending on the source, it is usually classified as either fruit bromelain or stem bromelain (Kelly 1996). The sulfhydryl proteolytic fraction is the primary component of bromelain. The pineapple enzyme also contains several protease inhibitors, a peroxidase, acid phosphatase, and organically bound calcium (Kelly, 1996).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the uptake and distribution of nutrients during the growth of the Cayenne cultivar of Ananas comosus (L) Merr under field conditions in the Eastern Cape. The study was also done to help explain the apparent drop in the nutrient levels in the basal section of the "D"- leaf of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> during the winter months and to determine the best part or parts of the plant to sample in order to measure the nutrient status of the <b>pineapple</b> <b>plant</b> at any stage of its growth. The investigation was conducted by selecting a plot within a production land on two farms in the pineapple growing region of the Eastern Cape. Plants were sampled from each plot at regular intervals from <b>planting</b> of the <b>pineapple</b> tops until the harvesting of the fruit of the first plant crop. Plant growth was measured and the nutrient concentrations in each section of the plant were determined. The total amounts of nutrients for each plant part were calculated and the nutrient uptake was compared and plotted on distribution diagrams...|$|R
50|$|The climatic {{conditions}} in Homalin {{have been found}} suitable to grow Rubber plantations. The conditions have been well exploited by establishing viable rubber cultivation practices by introducing high-yield strains like the PRIM 600, PB-260, BPM-24, GT-1 and PBIG. This has resulted in expansion of rubber plantation areas in the township, which has created ample employment opportunities to the local people and thus improved their economic conditions and living standards. <b>Pineapple</b> <b>plants</b> are also intercropped within the rubber plantations to make the economic yield from the land even more viable. Since Rubber has a worldwide demand, local people have been urged to expand area under cultivate rubber cultivation as also as tea as a commercial venture.|$|E
