5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael.

Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> around the world.

5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. Jane had remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town.

In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, {{which was one of the}} city's few {{hospitals}} to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery.

5|$|Inspired by {{the works}} of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written {{in the form of}} letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of <b>poor</b> <b>people,</b> their {{relationship}} with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature.|$|E

5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of <b>poor</b> <b>people</b> and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did.

A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
