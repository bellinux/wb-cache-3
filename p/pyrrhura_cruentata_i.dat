50|$|The Descobrimento National Park {{is in the}} Atlantic Forest biome.It {{holds an}} {{important}} fragment of Atlantic Forest of the northeast plateau of Brazil, {{and the most important}} wildlife refuge of the south of Bahia.Protected species in the park include the cougar (Puma concolor), the characid fish Mimagoniates sylvicola and the bird species ringed woodpecker (Celeus torquatus), black-headed berryeater (Carpornis melanocephala), red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii), banded cotinga (Cotinga maculata), band-tailed antwren (Myrmotherula urosticta), ochre-marked parakeet (<b>Pyrrhura</b> <b>cruentata)</b> and striated softtail (Thripophaga macroura).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pyrrhura</b> <b>cruentata</b> was {{formerly}} common {{throughout much of}} south-east Bahia, Espírito Santo, east Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its current distribution is highly fragmented and now mostly restricted to isolated reserves. The stronghold is the Sooretama Biological Reserve and adjacent Linhares Forest Reserve, Espírito Santo. It remains common in Estação Vera Cruz (formerly the Porto Seguro Reserve), Bahia. Elsewhere it can be relatively common, but numbers in the large Chapada da Diamantina and Monte Pascoal National Parks, Bahia, appear low.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimated}} population sizes of parrots {{in a large}} (Sooretama/Linhares) and a small (Porto Seguro) lowland Atlantic forest reserve, and examined their habitat associations within the reserves, and their use of forest fragments. In Sooretama, most species had {{estimated population}}s between 1000 and 20, 000 individuals, but in the smaller reserve population densities were low and all but one species had population estimates < 500. Two Amazons, including the `Endangered' Amazona rhodocorytha, were strongly linked to primary forests whereas the `Vulnerable' <b>Pyrrhura</b> <b>cruentata</b> was associated with non-pristine forest. There was considerable movement of parrots between the Sooretama reserve and the surrounding country with Amazona species tending to fly into the reserve during the mornings, and the macaw Propyrrhura maracana flying out. Other species, notably P. cruentata and P. leucotis, were never recorded away from the reserve. Most parrot populations {{in the region are}} likely to be small, and the substantial populations around Sooretama make this reserve a parrot stronghold. It is crucial that ®re, illegal logging and parrot capture are adequately controlled within Sooretama, and there is a strong argument for extending conservation management efforts to area...|$|R
40|$|Road {{mortality}} {{is the leading}} source of biodiversity loss in the world, especially due to fragmentation of natural habitats and loss of wildlife. The survey of the main species victims of roadkill is of fundamental importance for the {{better understanding of the}} problem, being necessary, for this, the correct species identification. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify if DNA barcodes can be applied to identify road-killed samples that often cannot be determined morphologically. For this purpose, 222 vertebrate samples were collected in a stretch of the BR- 101 highway that crosses two Discovery Coast Atlantic Forest Natural Reserves, the Sooretama Biological Reserve and the Vale Natural Reserve, in Espírito Santo, Brazil. The mitochondrial COI gene was amplified, sequenced and confronted with the BOLD database. It was possible to identify 62. 16 % of samples, totaling 62 different species, including <b>Pyrrhura</b> <b>cruentata,</b> Chaetomys subspinosus, Puma yagouaroundi and Leopardus wiedii considered Vulnerable in the National Official List of Species of Endangered Wildlife. The most commonly identified animals were a bat (Molossus molossus), an opossum (Didelphis aurita) and a frog (Trachycephalus mesophaeus) species. Only one reptile was identified using the technique, probably due to lack of reference sequences in BOLD. These data may contribute to a better understanding of the impact of roads on species biodiversity loss and to introduce the DNA barcode technique to road ecology scenarios...|$|R
