A randomized controlled trial was con- ducted in Évora, Portugal, in 2008, in which 62 healthy adult women were randomized to a Pilates-based mat (experimental group) (n D 38, mean age ̇ SD, 41. 08 ̇ 6. 64 years) or a control group (n D 24, mean age ̇ SD, 40. 25 ̇ 7. 70 years). Experimen- tal group participants performed the Initial Mat of Body Control Pilates twice per week, 60 -minutes per session. Repeated measure- ments were performed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. No significant differences between the two groups were observed in life satisfaction, <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> appreciation by other people, <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> physical appearance, <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> functionality, total physical self-concept, and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> health status at three time point measures (baseline, after 3 months, and after 6 months).

40|$|We {{inherently}} {{maintain a}} stable <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> the world despite frequent {{changes in the}} head, eye, and body positions. Such “orientation constancy” {{is a prerequisite for}} coherent spatial perception and sensorimotor planning. As a multimodal sensory reference, <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> upright represents neural processes that subserve orientation constancy through integration of sensory information encoding the eye, head, and body positions. Although <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> upright is distinct from <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> body orientation, they share similar neural substrates within the cerebral cortical networks involved in <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> spatial orientation. These cortical networks, mainly within the temporo-parietal junction, are crucial for multisensory processing and integration that generate sensory reference frames for coherent <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> self-position and extrapersonal space transformations. In this review, we focus on these neural mechanisms and discuss (i) neurobehavioral aspects of orientation constancy, (ii) sensory models that address the neurophysiology underlying <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> upright, and (iii) the current evidence for the role of cerebral cortex in <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> upright and orientation constancy, including findings from the neurological disorders that affect cortical function...|$|R

25|$|Justice or {{fairness}} {{refers to}} the idea that an action or decision is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, fairness, equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. Fairness is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to focus}} on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX). It is assumed that the perceived quality of the relationship is not only related to the actual quality of the relationship, but also to followers' expectancies and preferences. However, little is known about person characteristics that are related to LMX perceptions. This study seeks to examine how far followers' leadership-related characteristics (romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence) are related to the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 588 Dutch employees from different professions filled in questionnaires on romance of leadership, idealised supervisor, need for leadership and dependence and their <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Findings – Results indicate a positive relationship between need for leadership/dependence and the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX, thought not for romance of leadership/idealised supervisor and the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. An interaction was found between idealised supervisor and dependence on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. Research limitations/implications – The study only focuses on four antecedents, although many others could {{have an effect on the}} <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. The study comprised a one-dimensional assessment of LMX. For future research, a multi-dimensional assessment is recommended. Practical implications – The results of this study imply that organisations need to address the expectations that followers have towards their leaders in order to avoid disappointments. Originality/value – This paper focuses on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX and how follower characteristics are related to the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX. It extends prior research on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leadership into LMX research. Similar to effect on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> leadership behaviour, effects on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> LMX are important to take into account when LMX is assessed through follower ratings in order to avoid making incorrect conclusions. ...|$|R
