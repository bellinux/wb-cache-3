She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home.

Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
