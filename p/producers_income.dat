40|$|The {{growth of}} the dairy sector in many ACP countries, welcome {{as it is in}} terms of <b>producers</b> <b>income</b> and {{consumers}} nutrition, is full of challenges. Among them are issues of marketing, regularity of supplies from producers and delivery to markets, health and hygiene, storage and management. In a word, the core issue is formalisation. What used to be an informal sector, with its short but uncontrolled networks of delivery to small numbers of customers is now faced with the task of organising itself. This includes making contracts with producers, suppliers, transporters and sales outlets; setting up and implementing rigid procedures for storage and processing of milk products; and safe distribution. These major points were all raised during a study visit to the dairy sector in Mali undertaken by 18 representatives of dairy enterprises, milk processors and support agencies in early October 2001. Participants from eight countries in West and Central Africa spent 12 days visiting milk collection points, dairies, bottling plants, and cheese and yoghurt producers and discussing future directions for their work. They highlighted the value of sharing experiences and launched an African Milk forum to continue their discussions by email.

The case study portrayed in this article aimed to evaluate and compare the socioeconomic impacts generated by the PAA and PNAE among Ubá's family farmers in Minas Gerais. To do this, two tipes of questionnaires were applied to managers and farmers who participate in the programs and obtained data were analyzed by descriptive statistic methods and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney). Results showed that the two policies present positive socioeconomic benefits to family farmers, although the PNAE's <b>producers</b> <b>income</b> be higher and the food prices traded in PAA are superior.

40|$|History {{shows that}} {{different}} rates of poverty reduction {{over the past}} five decades have been closely related to differences in agricultural performance - particularly the rate of growth of agricultural productivity. In Asia, the rapid productivity gains of the Green Revolution increased <b>producers,</b> <b>income,</b> raised labourers, wages and lowered the price of food. In addition, new livelihood opportunities were generated when success in agriculture provided the basis for economic diversification. However, despite decades of investment in new agricultural technology and rural development, hunger and poverty continue to plague large areas of the developing world. The problem is particularly acute in sub-Saharam Africa, where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals is slowest. While increasing agricultural productivity perhaps remains the single most important determinant of economic growth and poverty reduction, serious doubts are emerging as to whether agricultural productivity can be futher increased, where it is most needed and what part, if any, small scale farming will play in future. Development experts need greater understanding of the links between agricultural productivity and poverty. They also need to asess just how far they have changed {{and the extent to which}} small scale agriculture can remain a ladder out of poverty for millions of people living in rural areas.

Beef Exports for calendar year 1997 will meet or exceed 1996 levels with an impressive 3 billion sales (wholesale value) or 13 percent of the U. S. beef supply.

40|$|The {{instability}} of export earnings in LDCs and its presumably harmful economic effects have been broadly {{discussed in the}} economic literature and among policy makers in international meetings. In analyzing these effects, the destabilization of <b>producer</b> <b>incomes</b> and farmers' risk response play a prominent role. <b>Producer</b> <b>incomes</b> may be destabilized by either domestic factors {{on the supply side}} (yield instability due to weather, crop diseases, etc.), or by fluctuating producer prices reflecting the {{instability of}} international primary commodity markets. If unstable <b>producer</b> <b>incomes</b> induce risk aversion among farmers, the sectoral factor input will be reduced and will be suboptimal from a welfare point of view, thus possibly hampering economic growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to quantify the effects of <b>producer</b> <b>income</b> instability on farmers' planting and long-run supply decisions in the coffee, tea, and sisal production of the Kenyan large farm sector. Coffee, tea, and sisal are the leading Kenyan export crops, the domestic consumption of which is negligible. About half of the Kenyan coffee and tea, and all the sisal are grown in the large farm sector, and nearly always on plantations. Coffee, tea, and sisal are permanent crops the planting of which requires long-run decisions. It is the long-run we shall focus on in this paper; hence the influence of income instability on short-term production planning will be neglected. The analysis will be based on a time series approach covering the period 1951 - 1975. In the following section we shall develop the methodological framework of how to measure the risk response of farmers. Next the estimation equations will be specified, and the estimation techniques will be demonstrated. Subsequently, the regression results are presented and interpreted.

40|$|Abstract: Given {{the large}} {{territorial}} extension {{and the high}} social and economic diversity, Brazil has a remarkable variability in agricultural cropping systems. The description and the understanding of this variability is fundamental for proposing research gaps, technology transfer and appropriate public policies for the sector. Sugarcane is used for several purposes on farms, such as household consumption, energy and sugar production, and forage production. Data collected during the 2006 agricultural census, accomplished by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), shows that 192, 931 farms (3. 7 % of Brazilian farms) reported having grown sugarcane in 2006. This paper addresses the classification and characterization of the sugarcane producing municipalities in Brazil, using techniques of multivariate statistical analysis (factor and cluster analysis). The 41 variables used were created from the data collected by the 2006 agricultural census, covering 3, 576 municipalities. Data went through a sugarcane filter, and was then regrouped by municipality. Those variables gather socioeconomic and technological information on the farms, such as land usage, harvested area, production goal, productivity, input usage, use of industrial wastes, irrigation, source of <b>producer?s</b> <b>income,</b> percentage of the income that comes from sugarcane, family or conventional farming, size of herds, distance from the farms to sugar mills, among the most important.

The results of the statistical analysis and {{the characteristics of the}} groups were discussed among scholars specialized in sugarcane research and were considered coherent with Brazilian reality. 2013 ICAS VI...|$|E
40|$|The current {{sales tax}} {{collection}} system is affecting negatively the <b>producers</b> <b>income,</b> traders ’ profit margins and consumers purchasing power. While {{the conventional wisdom}} in Ethiopia is that the tax on grain sales falls on traders, the evidence indicates that in large part these taxes are passed on to farmers {{in the form of}} lower producer prices and to consumers in the form of higher retail prices. In some cases, the taxes collected are unregistered and {{do not appear to be}} fully channeled to the government treasury. There are regional variations in the rules and regulations regarding the implementation of grain taxation which impose price risks and uncertainty on grain traders in moving grain from one to another region. These costs and risks reduce the amount of grain traded nationally and impede the potential contribution of spatial arbitrage and regional interdependence in improving national food security. While the objective of collecting tax revenue for regional governments is clearly justified and necessary, during lean grain harvests such as in 1997 / 98, replacing a grain sales tax with taxes on other commodities produced and consumed more by higher-income groups may be advisable. Grain makes up a large share of poor consumers expenditures. Further study is advised to identify potentially taxable commodities that are produced and/or consumed disproportionately by relatively middle- and higher-income groups. Moreover, making tax rates more uniform throughout the country may also reduce the uncertainty as to correct tax rates and thereby reduce the scope for unregistered payments that do not contribute to regional tax revenue. On the part of traders, the tradition of compliance to tax rules and regulations is also not well-developed and the traders must be made more aware of why taxes are collected through appropriate information dissemination. Collection of tax revenues from traders may also improve if local governments are more successful in showing that tax funds are in part used to upgrade marketing infrastructure such as the development of new market places for grain trading. ...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture in India is {{the most}} {{important}} segment of the economy. Growth of Agricultural sector is crucial for Indian economy as it employs two-third of its population and contributes nearly one-third of national income. However its importance in the economic, social and political fabric of India goes well beyond what is indicated by its contribution to the economy. The large number of poor agricultural households and their income vulnerability are major concern among policy makers. These concerns have driven both agricultural policies and public expenditures in agriculture in India as well as in other part of the globe. India made significant advances towards achieving its goal of rapid agricultural growth, improving food security, and reducing rural poverty during the last four decades. Sustainable food production growth enabled India to achieve foodgrain self sufficiency, eliminating the threat of famines and acute starvation in the country. More rapid agricultural productivity growth, as past experiences shows, can have major impacts on poverty reduction trough direct effects on <b>producers</b> <b>income,</b> indirect effects on consumer welfare trough changes in food prices, employment and wage effects, and growth induced effects throughout the economy. Agriculture {{is also one of the}} major sources of export earnings of our country and is crucial for improving the balance of payments. In recent years, the export of agricultural and allied products accounted for about one-fifth of total export earnings of India. India's share of agricultural export has remained very low in many commodities despite inherent strength of Indian agriculture with the exception of few commodities. The performance of agricultural export depends not only on adequate surplus, international prices, quality of product, market competition and comparative advantage of producing the exportable commodities but also on domestic and international trade policy. Hence the subsidies and supports to agricultural commodities of country play a major role to stand in international market. Present paper is an effort to evaluate competitiveness of Indian wheat and rice in international market. Keeping in view the overall foodgrain production, marketable surplus and number of farmers, among the major foodgrain producing states, Uttar Pradesh has been taken for comparison of trade competitiveness. Since agricultural trade is highly distorted due to huge subsidies and support to agriculture in developed countries; paper also evaluate competitiveness of these commodities in alternative case if both countries withdraw their subsidies to these commodities in form of Producer Support Estimate (PSE). The Paper is divided in four parts; Part one is about the methodology to calculate competitiveness. Trade competitiveness of wheat and rice at normal prices and at PSE adjusted prices has been calculated in part two. Part three evaluate the implications of agricultural subsidy and part four is the concluding part with suggesting some corrective measures for fair agricultural trade and due space of developing countries in international agricultural trade. ...|$|E

These initiatives mainly regard areas where a local food culture is still present, and some local supply chains have survived even in recent decades. In some other rural areas, on the contrary, standardization of food production and consumption led to a completely export-oriented primary sector and to the disappearance of almost any sort of local supply chains. In some of these areas, mainly in Northern European countries, grass root initiatives of re-localisation of the food supply chains have recently emerged, aiming at promoting the local consumption of locally produced food. This entails strengthening (or re-creating) local food productions, creating local markets and encouraging local consumption of the products. This phenomenon emerged also within the eu funded research "corason - A cognitive approach to rural sustainable development - the dynamics of expert and lay knowledges", in which about 30 case-studies of local food production from twelve countries have been investigated. Five of them represent initiatives of relocalisation: Cahir Farmers’ Market in Ireland, Skye and Lochalsh Horticultural Development Association and Food Link Group in Scotland, Eldrimner project in Sweden, and Netzwerk Vorpommern in Germany. All these initiatives share some basic aims: social sustainability at community level, environmental sustainability, local culture valorisation. Shortening the distance that food travels means sustaining local <b>producers</b> <b>income</b> and, often, delivering better quality food to consumers. At {{the same time it}} encourages diversification of agriculture, it supports environmental protection, and it provides opportunities for the revitalization of rural communities. Other evidences arise from a comparative analysis of these experiences. A relevant role of civil society has been noticed. Further, a strong ideological component is sometimes present, with initiatives promoted by actors belonging to, or inspired by, social movements. All the initiatives show a high degree of selfgovernance, with a central role played by pro-active local actors. There is a re-definition of food quality. Emphasis is given to localness, as a key attribute in itself as well as a condition influencing other attributes. An emphasis is also given to the positive relational and social aspects related to the establishment of local networks. These initiatives require specific knowledge dynamics, in particular the rediscovery of a traditional food culture (varieties, cultivation methods, recipes) that had been forgotten among local communities.

40|$|Sheep {{production}} {{is an integral}} part of the subsistence crop-livestock systems of Ethiopian highlands and plays crucial role in economic development and poverty reduction. So far, there have been very limited efforts exerted to introduce and promote market oriented sheep production and hence the current income generating capacity of the sector is not at all encouraging. Therefore, reorientation of sheep production systems towards consumer preferences and demands through timely and comprehensive transformation need to be given due emphasis. With the intent of contributing in this line, this study analyzed whether prices of indigenous sheep breed are influenced by their own traits as well as other market and temporal factors. The level and intensity of market participation was also investigated as the willingness and level of market participation by the sheep keepers determines the effectiveness of interventions to reorient the production system. Determinants of the decision to participate in sheep production were also identified and analyzed in this study. Data were generated both from the rural households in their villages and from sheep sellers and buyers in four rural markets in Horro-Guduruu Wollega Zone of Oromia. Hedonic pricing model was fitted for the analysis of determinants of indigenous sheep price. The empirical result indicates that phenotypic traits of traded sheep (age, color, body size, and tail condition) are major determinants of price implying the need for development of comprehensive breeding program. Season and market locations are also very important determinants of price suggesting the need to target season and market place in breeding program so that sheep keepers benefit from the intervention and hence the program become sustainable. To investigate production participation decision, Probit model was employed and the result show that livestock asset base, access to extension service, access to market information and educational background of the household head are significant determinants of production participation decision. Thus, the implications are that improving farmers’ access to extension service including livestock market information, improving access to credit service to develop farmers’ asset base, and expanding educational opportunity in the rural area would result in farm households’ ability to diversify their livelihood strategy. Poisson and Negative Binomial models were employed to examine factors determining the level of market participation by sheep keepers. The empirical results of both types of models consistently show that flock size, family size, educational background, experience, access to market information, and access to veterinary service were decisive determinants of level of market participation for sheep keeping farm households. The implications of these empirical results indicate the need to expand and capacitate service providing institutions, like veterinary services and livestock market information services, to improve access to the services and hence enhance market participation and advance <b>producers</b> <b>income.</b> As educational background and production experience are also the vital determinants, provision of training to farm household is important to increase market participation by sheep keepers...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} income-producing {{sector in}} the Texas economy and {{a large part of}} this {{economic}} activity originates in irrigated crop production. For example, in 1973, 50 % of all grain sorghum and 46 % of all cotton in Texas were produced on irrigated acreage [Texas Crop and Livestock Reporting Service]. These two crops alone produced 26 % of the cash receipts from the sale of Texas farm commodities in 1973 [Texas Crop and Livestock Reporting Service]. There are several other crops in Texas including vegetables which generate significant levels of income and rely heavily on irrigation. Further there are several associated industries which rely on production from irrigated agriculture, such as the cattle feeding industry in the Texas Panhandle. It is evident from this rather cursory examination of statistics that irrigation plays a large role in Texas agriculture. Both producers and policy-makers have found themselves faced {{in the past two years}} with many uncertainties. The U. S., plagued in the past with surplus production and supply control problems, now finds itself in a world shortage of food products. The long range signals seem to call for increased production, yet the policy-maker faces decisions concerning not only how to increase production, but more basically, how to maintain current levels of production. Groundwater resources in many areas are being diminished and annual irrigation water supplies fully committed in other areas. Long run planning for Texas agriculture requires that interbasin transfers of water be evaluated. Texas holds a position of prominence in the production of U. S. food and fiber products, and the evaluation of these alternatives has implications not only for Texas, but for the U. S. and possibly the world. To objectively evaluate water transfer proposals, it is necessary that the value of irrigation water in different regions of Texas be established. The producer faces the same call for maintaining or increasing production as the policy-maker, but he does so with many uncertainties which often have not disturbed the policy-maker in evaluating alternatives. Product prices have risen and fallen at an unprecedented rate while input prices have steadily risen at rates which preclude realistic budgeting. For example, during the recent energy crisis, the prices of fuel and fertilizer have more than doubled. These variable input and product prices weigh heavily upon production decisions by the producer, and likewise must receive serious consideration in evaluation of resource allocation alternatives by policy-makers. The demand for irrigation water is derived from the production of crops and any change in production patterns, input prices or availability, and product prices directly affects this demand. Current and future water resources planning requires an estimate of the various quantities of water which will be used for irrigation under differing assumptions concerning price of water, other input prices, and product prices. Of particular importance are shifts in cropping patterns, changes in level of agricultural production and net effect on <b>producers</b> <b>income.</b> Since many policy decisions are made in relatively short periods of time, there is an urgent need for a capability to evaluate alternative policies and change input or product prices in a timely fashion...|$|E

Our {{results show that the}} positive effects of contract farming on productivity and <b>producer</b> <b>income</b> that previous studies showed for high-value crops and export-oriented food chains (e.g. Key and McBride 2003; Maertens and Swinnen, 2009; Maertens et al., 2011; Miyata et al., 2009) also hold for lower-value produce and local food chains.|$|R
40|$|São apresentados resultados pertinentes às culturas do milho (Z. mays), feijão (P. vulgaris) e caupi (V. unguiculata) consorciados com bananeira 'Terra' (Musa AAB) em Teolândia, Litoral Sul da Bahia, em cultivo simultâneo, no estabelecimento da bananeira e sucessivo logo após a colheita do primeiro. Os espaçamentos utilizados foram o 4, 0 x 2, 0 x 3, 0 m, 4, 0 x 2, 0 x 2, 6 m e 4, 0 x 2, 0 x 2, 8 m em fileira dupla, o que permitiu melhor proveito da área pelas culturas intercalares. O milho, ou o feijão, ou o caupi ocupou apenas as ruas entre as fileiras duplas de bananeiras, ficando livres as ruas formadas pelas fileiras duplas, devido ao seu sombreamento pela bananeira ser mais rápido. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho das culturas do milho, feijão e caupi na agregação de valor à bananeira 'Terra', quando consorciadas com esta cultura. Nos melhores tratamentos (T 9, T 6, T 8 e T 4), o índice de rentabilidade-IR (receita total ÷ custos) alcançou valores expressivos, de 3, 36 até 6, 68, resultando em efeitos altamente positivos em decorrência das tecnologias e insumos utilizados, o que vai permitir a agregação de um elevado valor à bananeira e, conseqüentemente, uma boa remuneração ao produtor. Estes resultados indicam que, para cada real investido, houve um retorno de R$ 3, 36 e R$ 6, 68, respectivamente. O IR 0, 91 (T 2), relativo à cultura do milho, implica que houve prejuízo, o que significa que a receita líquida deste tratamento vai reduzir e não incrementar a receita líquida proporcionada pela cultura da bananeira. Results are {{presented}} of a intercropping system of corn (Z. mays), beans (P. vulgaris) and cowpea (V. unguiculata) with plantains (Musa AAB) in Teolandia, South Coast of Bahia region in two successive plantations of these crops, being one simultaneous {{to the establishment}} of the plantain and the other right after the first harvest. Plants spacing in double rows were used (4. 0 x 2. 0 x 3. 0 m, 4. 0 x 2. 0 x 2. 6 m and 4. 0 x 2. 0 x 2. 8 m) and were the most efficient space arrangements of intercropping {{for a longer period of}} time. Corn, beans or the cowpea, occupied only the rows between the double rows of the plantains, whereas the interrows remained free in order to avoid shading effect of the plantain. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the performance of corn, beans and cowpea crops in addition of values in plantains. Rentability index - RI (total income ÷ costs) for the best treatments, (T 9, T 6, T 8 and T 4), reached significant values of 3. 36 (T 4) up to 6. 68 (T 9) resulting in positive effects due to technology and fertilizers applied, which allow greater addition of values to the banana crop and, consequently, increase the <b>producers</b> <b>income.</b> A RI of 3. 36 and 6. 68 means that for each Real (R$) invested there was a return of R$ 3, 36 and R$ 6, 68, respectively. RIs lower than 1. 0 indicate that the effect of intercrops on the addition of values of bananas crops was negative, resulting in a decrease of net income, which occurred in treatment T 2 that presented RI 0. 91...|$|E

30|$|This study {{revealed}} that with less government intervention, beef production would have been larger {{as well as the}} proportion exported, and producer and consumer prices would have been more stable for the analyzed period. This kind of government intervention has had important economic consequences, such as the drop in exports. The model estimated losses of 1.5 million tons of beef exports, with an estimated value of 8000 million dollars between the years 2010 and 2014. Decreases have also been found in <b>producer</b> <b>income</b> and consumer expenditures.|$|R
