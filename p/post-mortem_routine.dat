40|$|The bovine taeniasis-cysticercosis complex can {{be defined}} as a set of {{pathological}} changes caused by the adult form of Taenia saginata in humans and their larval form in animals (Cysticercus bovis). Data on the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis comes from the records of veterinary inspection of meat in slaughterhouses under fiscalization, where some positive cases may go unnoticed, especially in moderate infections. So, it is relevant the use of serological tests that have greater sensitivity than the <b>post-mortem</b> <b>routine</b> exams. Studies have shown the possible application of the ELISA test as a tool for epidemiological studies of the parasitosis and in the identification of animals with cysts. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the detection threshold of the indirect ELISA test, using experimentally and naturally infected animals in detecting cases of cysticercosis. The sensitivity of the test to naturally infected animals using a cut-off 1 and 2 added with 2 standart-deviation (SD) was of 12...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the <b>post-mortem</b> <b>routine</b> {{investigation}} of the sex organs of 19 mature bulls, the present authors encountered 6 cases having remnants of the Mullerian duct. These Mullerian remnants were located on the dorsal surface of the urogenital fold. They seemed to be grouped into two types; one is the tubular type which is characterized by a passway connecting with the urogenital canal, while the other is the small vesicular type without connection to the urogenital canal. Most of the cases belonged to the latter type, only one case belonging to the former type. Microscopically, both types of Mullerian remnants had a narrow central cavity lined with a single layered or stratified epithelium, consisting of cuboid, columnar, flattened and ciliated epithelial cells. Many smaller accessory cavities surrounding the central cavity resembled the female bovine uterine glands. But, the development of the accessory cavities varied from case to case. The lumina of the central and accessory cavities contained secretory products. The wall of the remnants consisted of connective tissues and several layers of smooth muscles. Thus, the histological features of the Mullerian remnant in the bull were very similar not only to those of the immature heifer uterus, but also to the Mullerian remnant observed in the case of "White heifer disease". As regards many problems concerning the rate of incidence, heredity or function of the Mullerian remnants in the bull, much remains to be studied. The present authors are indebted to Inspectors of the Sapporo Abattoir, for their great kindness and to members of the AI centers and farms who kindly sent the clinical data on the bulls used for this investigation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A 6 -year-old German {{shepherd}} dog {{was referred}} for investigation of lethargy, weakness and dyspnoea. Computed tomography revealed {{the presence of}} pleural and pericardial effusions and masses within the lungs and near the heart base. Materials and Methods: The dog was humanely destroyed and a <b>routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> examination was carried out. The mass near the heart base was observed to be within {{the wall of the}} aorta at the aortic arch. Multiple sections of this mass and the masses within the lungs were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin and processed routinely. Sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin. Results: Histopathological examination of the mass revealed it to be composed of sheets of well-differentiated adipocytes, and the mass appeared to arise within the adventitia of the aorta. The mass was therefore diagnosed as a lipoma. The pulmonary masses were diagnosed as bronchoalveolar carcinoma, thought to be unrelated to the lipoma.

Microscopy of a cortical lesion usually reveals a minute papillary adenoma, of a medullary one an area of fine fibrosis. Other types of nodule are less common. Newcomb (1936) and Apitz (1943) have made careful studies of small nodules found beneath the capsule in the hope of throwing light on the pathogenesis of malignant renal neoplasms.

40|$|Chronic pleuritis (CP) in Danish pigs for {{slaughter}} {{is by far}} the most frequent finding at the <b>routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> meat inspection. An initial investigation published in 1990 demonstrated infectious and management-related risk factors. Serological testing for additional infectious agents, as well as the need to consider the effect of disease clustering at the herd level, required a re-analysis of the data. Our re-analysis used a representative sample of 4800 pigs originating from 623 Danish herds. Each pig was examined for the presence of CP and progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR). The gender of the pig, the weight of the carcass, and the herd of origin were also recorded. Individual blood samples were examined for seropositivity for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (AP) serotypes 2, 6, 7, 12, Haemophilus parasuis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MYC) and swine influenza (SI). Herd-level information retrieved through a questionnaire included health status, production type, herd size (i. e. pigs per year) and vaccination procedures. Associations between CP and infectious, individual and herd-related factors were investigated by logistic regression with random effects. Among pigs from herds with conventional health status, seropositivity for AP serotypes 2 and 6, and MYC had odds ratios (ORs) of CP of 9. 0, 1. 6 and 1. 8...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{technical}} specifications of the Forensic Reference Phantom (FRP), to test its behavior relative to organic test materials, and discuss potential applications of the phantom in forensic radiology. Materials and method The FRP prototype is made of synthetic materials designed to simulate the computed tomography (CT) attenuation of water. It has six bore holes that accommodate multiuse containers. These containers were filled with test materials and scanned at 80 kVp, 120 kVp, and 140 kVp. X-ray attenuation was measured by two readers. Intra- and inter-reader reliability was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Significance levels between mean CT numbers at 80 kVp, 120 kVp, and 140 kVp were assessed with the Friedman-test. The T-test was used to assess significance levels between the FRP and water. Results Overall mean CT numbers ranged from − 3. 0 – 3. 7 HU for the FRP; − 1000. 3 –− 993. 5 HU for air; − 157. 7 – − 108. 1 HU for oil; 35. 5 – 42. 0 HU for musle tissue; and 1301. 5 – 2354. 8 HU for cortical bone. Inter-reader and intra-reader reliability were excellent (ICC> 0. 994; and ICC= 0. 999 respectively). CT numbers were significantly different at different energy levels. There was no significant difference between the attenuation of the FRP and water. Conclusions The FRP is a new tool for quality assurance and research in forensic radiology. The mean CT attenuation of the FRP is equivalent to water. The phantom can be scanned during <b>routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> CT to assess the composition of unidentified objects. In addition, the FRP may be used to investigate new imaging algorithms and scan protocols in forensic radiology...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal {{motility}} {{disorders are}} an important problem in horses and donkeys and this study {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the enteric neurons in animals with and without intestinal disease. Surplus intestinal tissue samples were collected from 28 horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for colic. In addition, surplus intestinal samples from 17 control horses were collected immediately following humane destruction for clinical conditions not relating to the intestinal tract. Similar samples were also collected during <b>routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> examinations from 12 aged donkeys; six animals were humanely destroyed for conditions related to the intestinal tract, while the remaining six were humanely destroyed for other reasons including dental and orthopaedic diseases. Tissue samples were fixed in formalin and immunohistochemical labelling was performed targeting the enteric neurons using a polyclonal antibody specific for the neuronal marker PGP 9. 5. The distribution and density of neuronal networks were assessed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. There was strong PGP 9. 5 expression in both the horse and donkey samples and labelling was detected throughout the tissue sections. In both species, PGP 9. 5 -immunoreactive nerve fibres were detected in all layers of the intestinal tract, both in large and small intestinal samples. Networks of enteric neurons were present in the donkey with a similar distribution to that seen in the horse. There was no demonstrable difference in enteric neuronal density and distribution in the groups of animals with intestinal disease compared with those without, apart from two (out of 28) horses with intestinal disease that showed a marked reduction in PGP 9. 5 immunoreactivity. Apart from these two animals, this total cohort analysis differs from some previously observed findings in horses with intestinal disease and may therefore reflect the different pathophysiological processes occurring in varying intestinal conditions resulting in colic both in the donkey and the horse. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|<b>Routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> {{inspections}} are {{enforced by}} governments worldwide to maintain meat hygiene standards. Through these systems, several pathologies and abnormalities are detected. In parallel, the industries {{of a number}} of countries have developed their own abattoir-based health schemes. These programs provide an integrated system to optimise the post-mortem pathological detection and the reporting of abattoir health information which is widely disseminated to both participating producers and veterinarians. In Great Britain, two initiatives have been implemented by the pig industry – Wholesome Pigs Scotland (WPS) and BPEX Pig Health Scheme (BPHS). This thesis brought together existing information from the health schemes to identify disease determinants for major pig abattoir conditions. Enzootic pneumonia-like (EP-like) lesions, pleurisy and ascariosis (identified through the presence of milk spot livers) are the three most prevalent conditions reported by the British pig health schemes, and their presence is associated with reduction in performance traits. This thesis combined records (from 2005 to 2007) on EP-like lesion, pleurisy and milk spots from 129, 819 slaughtered pigs with information from the (505) farms of origin in order to identify those production characteristics that may influence the prevalence of these lesions. Geographical location of the finishing unit appeared to be a statistically significant determinant for the presence of EP-like lesions, pleurisy and milk spots. Part-slatted floors also appeared as a potential risk factor for the presence of EP-like lesions and pleurisy, versus the use of solid floor with bedding which appeared protective. For milk spots, the use of bedding and/or outdoor production appeared as a risk factor. Time-series analyses were conducted to identify trends and the presence of seasonal variations for EP-like lesions and ascariosis. For visual analytics, the monthly prevalence for EP-like lesions (from July 2005 to June 2011) and for milk spots (from July 2005 to December 2010) were modelled using STL, a seasonal-trend decomposition method based on locally-weighted regression. Over 12, 000 pigs in average were assessed per month across 12 pig abattoirs over the studied periods. A trend toward reduction in the prevalence of EP-like lesions during {{the first three years of}} BPHS, followed by an increasing trend, was identified with November and December appearing as higher seasonal peaks of the occurrence of EP-like lesions. A mild overall decrease in the prevalence of milk spots over time was identified as well as a seasonal variation which showed peaks in September and October. This thesis also determined how different abattoir conditions are interrelated between them by the application of multi-dimensional machine learning methodology to the records from 6, 485 batches of slaughtered finishing pigs. The resulting network indicates that pathologies potentially associated with septicaemia (e. g. pericarditis, peritonitis) appear interrelated, suggesting on-going bacterial challenges by pathogens such as Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis. This thesis contributes to demonstrate the potential of combining animal health abattoir data to perform epidemiological analyses which may lead the industry to a better understanding of how the farm characteristics, geographic location and temporal distribution could influence the prevalence of EP-like lesions, pleurisy and ascariosis...|$|R
40|$|The present medico-legal {{investigation}} of the deaths of infants {{less than one year}} of age was designed to enhance our understanding of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Special emphasis was placed on the significance of cardiovascular pathology (including heart weight, malformations and myocarditis); exposure to nicotine; and mutations and/or polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). A total of 505 infants investigated at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm, between 1980 and 2001 were studied retrospectively. Body weight was found to be the best indicator of heart weight. A reference table for assessment of the heart weight {{as a function of the}} body weight is presented. Heart weights of SIDS victims did not differ from that of the other infants, with the exception of cardiovascular malformations. However, the data do strongly suggests that an increased heart weight, particularly greater than the 75 th percentile, should be regarded as an exclusion criterion for SIDS. Congenital cardiovascular malformations (CCMs) were present in 18 infants (3. 9 %) of the infants involved in this study. Surprisingly, 67 % of these CCMs, which were either the single, or the contributing cause of death were not diagnosed prior to death. The fact that undiagnosed and most likely operable CCMs as a cause of sudden unexpected death in apparently healthy infants indicates a need for more frequent examinations during the postnatal period. Myocarditis was detected in 16. 8 % of natural deaths and 7. 4 % of violent deaths. This condition was acute in 46, and chronic in 25 infants. Approximately 35 % of the infants with CMV exhibited myocarditis. With regards to fatality, the location of the inflammatory cells appeared to be more important than the number of foci. Foci of inflammatory cells in the interatrial septum and upper part of the interventricular septum appear to be most lethal, probably because parts of the conduction system are present in this area. High pericardial fluid levels of nicotine and cotinine were detected frequently among infants who slept with their parents and such high levels of nicotine correlated positively with signs of otitis media. In infants exhibiting high levels of cotinine, more focal necrosis and inflammatory changes were observed in the myocardium and liver. Unlike the other infants, approximately 25 % of the SIDS infants demonstrated high levels of cotinine, indicating exposure to nicotine before death. In a sudden infant death where the <b>routine</b> <b>post-mortem</b> examinations failed to establish a cause of death and who exhibited high levels of nicotine and/or cotinine, the infant's exposure to nicotine may have caused or contributed to the fatal outcome. The entire mitochondrial genome of 6 SIDS infants and shorter regions of this organellar DNA in additional 14 SIDS infants were analysed. No specific mutation or polymorphism associated with SIDS was detected. Thus, sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in sudden infant deaths, as a diagnostic tool, does not at present appear to provide useful information in the majority of SIDS infants. In conclusion, the sudden infant deaths seem to comprise a mixed group of pathophysiological mechanisms and disorders. The results illustrate the importance of meticulous death investigations -including systematic histopathology with special emphasis on cardiovascular alterations, as well as toxicological screening including nicotine and cotinine and microbiological analyses [...] for reliable diagnose and determination of the cause of death...|$|R
