500|$|The New York Daily Mirror critic wrote, [...] "Programmed as {{a musical}} play, South Pacific is just that. [...] It boasts no ballets and no hot hoofing. It has no chorus in the {{conventional}} sense. Every one in it plays a part. It is likely {{to establish a new}} trend in musicals." [...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E

[...] Her {{performance}} was called [...] "memorable...funny and poignant in turns", and {{she earned a}} Tony Award. Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote: [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush.... Hers is a completely irresistible performance." [...] She opened in the West End production on November 1, 1951.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Cisneros {{announced}} he would not seek a fifth two-year term as mayor and would leave public life after completing his current term as mayor. [...] Several factors contributed to his decision. [...] The same year, his son, John Paul Anthony, named for the pope, was born with congenital asplenia syndrome; instead of the normal four chambers, the heart functioned {{as if it had}} only two. [...] As a result, the blood that cycled through the baby’s system was poorly oxygenated and threatened to flood his lungs as the heart grew. [...] The condition also meant the child was born without a spleen and was 50 times more likely to contract a fatal infectious disease. [...] Cisneros desired to devote more time with his ailing son, whose doctors had given roughly six years to live and whose life would be filled with major surgeries. When John Paul reached his sixth birthday in 1993, Cisneros told Sophfronia Scott Gregory in Time Magazine of his son's ongoing fight for life: [...] "Nothing in my life has <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tony Blair {{called the}} [...] "Who's Calling Christian?" [...] hotline, after charity campaigner Graham Marsh {{contacted}} Blair. If {{he were to}} win, Marsh, who received a heart transplant in 1999, {{said he planned to}} donate his £10,000 to the two charities he supports - the Freemans Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Tyne Youth and Community Centre, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. Blair began by telling the programme: [...] "Probably nothing in my career has <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> this." [...] When O'Connell asked if he should be referred to as The Right Honourable Tony Blair, the Prime Minister replied: [...] "Refer to me any way you like as long as it's reasonably polite! Tony will do fine... Someone from my constituency phoned me and said 'Why don't we do this?' and I said yes because they are really, really good causes." [...] The exchange ended with O'Connell asking Blair to choose his favourite song from the 1980s. He chose [...] "Street With No Name" [...] by U2 - actually called [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". Marsh and Blair resoundingly won the contest on 7 November 2006.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I can {{remember}} the old house,' said the Duchess, as she took Mr. Lyle's arm; 'and I am happy {{to see the new}} one. The Duke had <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> much beauty, but the reality exceeds his report.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] {{cried the}} colonel, whose pleased smile had given place to unimaginable astonishment. [...] "You--you should have <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> this, Manuela.

60|$|I was not surprised--I {{was nothing}} less than alarmed by the change for the worse in him since we had last met. Mr. Playmore's letter had not <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the serious {{deterioration}} in him which I could now discern.|$|E
60|$|He {{started to}} address his ball, {{and there was}} a weak {{uncertainty}} in the way he did it that <b>prepared</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> what was to come. His club rose, wavered, fell; and the ball, badly topped, trickled two feet and sank into a cuppy lie.|$|E

6000|$|Aur. Then {{to despair}} you would my love betray, By taking hope, its last kind friend, away. You hold the glass, but turn the perspective, And farther off the lessened object drive.

60|$|All the way here, I had {{supposed}} {{that she was}} going to some house; indeed, I had vaguely entertained the hope that the house might be in some way associated with the lost girl.
