40|$|Conference {{are greatly}} appreciated. Abstract: Economic theory {{suggests}} that firms can gain competitive advantage, thereby impeding the normalization of risk-adjusted returns relative to industry peers. Thus, these advantages directly impact a firm’s future profitability {{as well as the}} assumptions incorporated into forecasting and valuation models. This paper utilizes realized operating performance, adjusted by estimates of operational risk, to establish which <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> competitive advantage (i. e., expenditure of resources and effort) are effective at protecting profits. We demonstrate that the inclusion of <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> competitive advantages in future profitability models significantly increases explanatory power. We find several <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> competitive advantages that generalize across the entire sample including <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> power over suppliers and the ability of a firm to credibly signal expected retaliation. Firms that develop these advantages experience a three percent premium in risk-adjusted return on net operating assets (RNOA) on average over their industry peers. This is economically significant given that the mean risk-adjusted RNOA for the sample over a 30 year period is 3. 3 percent. The empirical evidence suggests that traditional variables used to capture competitive advantages such as <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> product differentiation...|$|R

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan.

Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by <b>proxy</b> <b>for</b> Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further down the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful <b>proxy</b> <b>for</b> future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} this study are to empirically {{identify}} fraud risk factors and construct a model to predict the likelihood of financial statement frauds based on SAS No. 99.

Consistent with prior research, it seems that the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements is easier to be observed publicly using fraud risk factor <b>proxies</b> <b>for</b> Pressure and Opportunity rather than Rationalization.

5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a <b>proxy</b> <b>for</b> measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|Despite the honours and {{financial}} security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding a <b>proxy</b> <b>for</b> {{negotiations with the}} Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she addressed {{a letter to the}} Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, but in any case she failed to reunite with either of her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a <b>proxy</b> <b>for</b> magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the contention that}} the Fama-French (1993) model 2 ̆ 7 s ability to explain cross-sectional variation in equity returns occurs because the Fama-French factors, SMB and HML, are <b>proxying</b> <b>for</b> default risk. To assess the default risk hypothesis, we augment the CAPM and the Fama-French model with a default factor and run system regressions of the default enhanced models using the GMM approach. Our key findings are that: 1) default risk is not priced in equity returns; and, 2) the Fama-French factors are not <b>proxying</b> <b>for</b> default risk. Although {{our findings suggest that}} SMB and HML are not <b>proxying</b> <b>for</b> default risk, our analysis indicates that the Fama-French factors are capturing some form of priced risk. However, what type of risk the Fama-French factors are capturing remains an open question...|$|R

An example of the questions we explore is: Holding business quality fixed, what is the impact of the manager on the probability of business discontinuance? Regarding this question, we find that managers have a large impact on the course of their businesses, in particular, among businesses of the same age, managerial tenure has {{a significant impact on the}} probability of business discontinuance and transfer.
