5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
25|$|In August former Mudvayne bassist Shawn Barclay {{released}} his band Sprung's debut album, mastered by King's X guitarist Ty Tabor. That month rumors spread that Bullygoat Records would release We <b>Pay</b> <b>Our</b> Debt Sometimes: A Tribute to Alice In Chains, with performances by Mudvayne, Cold, Audioslave, Breaking Benjamin, Static-X and the surviving members of Alice in Chains. A spokesperson for Alice in Chains {{told the press}} that the band was unaware of any tribute album, and Mudvayne's manager said that reports of the album were only rumors.|$|E
500|$|With these {{troubles}} fresh, its expansion {{was dealt}} a critical blow by the NFL. On November 6, 1995—the {{week of the}} South Division Final—the NFL's Cleveland Browns announced they were moving to Baltimore for the following season. A day after the game, the American owners called Smith and requested a meeting in Toronto; Smith's summary of their position was [...] "we'll <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> bills but we're done." ...|$|E

500|$|The playoff {{goal was}} Richard's last, as on September 15, 1960, he {{announced}} his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that autumn, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, {{he said he had}} been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him. Upon learning of Richard's retirement, Gordie Howe offered praise for his former rival: [...] "He sure was a drawing card. He brought in the crowds that helped <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> wages. Richard certainly {{has been one of the}} greatest players in the game and we will miss him." ...|$|E

Charlene and my friends wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people. We wanted to <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects and see what this place was all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conservative {{criticism}} of OWS {{has sometimes been}} vitriolic, casting the demonstrators as a thoroughly marginal group. [...] Andrew Hartman wrote in The Chronicle Review that [...] "many conservatives and pundits view the Wall Street protesters as envious ingrates looking for government handouts because they fear responsibility." [...] Kate Zernike said in The New York Times that the Tea Party Patriots [...] "portrayed Occupy protesters as freeloaders, or would-be freeloaders: 'Those occupying Wall Street and other cities, when they are intelligible, want less of what made America great and more of what is damaging to America: a bigger more powerful government {{to come in and}} take care of them so they don’t have to work {{like the rest of us}} who <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> bills.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is the price we <b>pay.</b> <b>Our</b> first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E
2500|$|Ed Pilkington, {{writing for}} The Guardian, {{reported}} that it was factually correct that [...] "large donations to the foundation from the chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, at {{around the time of}} the Russian purchase of the company and while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, were never disclosed to the public. The multimillion dollar sums were channeled through a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation, CGSCI, which did not reveal its individual donors." [...] Following publication and in reaction to areas where it said improvements were warranted, the Clinton Foundation said it would put into place some new procedures for better financial reporting and that it would limit some kinds of foreign donations. Pilkington assessed those claims made by the Clinton Foundation as unlikely to put the matter to rest: [...] "But with Bill refusing doggedly to give up his speaker engagements – “I gotta <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> bills” – and foreign corporations and super-rich individuals still able to donate to the family charity, it looks like this controversy may run and run." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 10, 2005 a {{memorial}} service {{was held at the}} Fort Ord Main Chapel in the town of Seaside, California. Immediately thereafter, full military honors (which included a 21-gun salute and the traditional folding and presentation of the American flag) followed. The service ended with a six-plane missing man formation flyover by the Blue Angels. [...] "Butch Voris’ contributions to naval aviation and the nation’s history were epic," [...] said Cdr. Steve Foley, flight leader and commanding officer of the 2005 Blue Angels. [...] "Concluding his memorial service with a fly-by the 2005 Blue Angel team will be a highlight of not only this season, but our careers as naval aviators as well. It truly reinforces our responsibility to preserve the legacy and ideals Boss Voris bestowed upon us 59 years ago. Said Lt. Garrett Kasper, public spokesman for the Blue Angels, [...] "It is our team’s honor to conduct a flyby, as our final salute to Captain Voris, and the most fitting way we can <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects to the Voris family." ...|$|E
