40|$|During mega-sport events, such as FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games, Fan Fests {{and other}} <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events have been {{developed}} as an innovative value proposition for watching sports. Those events attract millions of sport spectators worldwide. Event organizers have already realized the tremendous economic potential, yet sport management literature provides little empirical evidence on this innovation in sport management. Therefore, this study investigates motivational drivers for sport consumption of <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events and provides {{a better understanding of}} innovation-induced value cocreation at sport events. As <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> represents an innovative mixture of stadium and television, we conduct a literature review of sport spectator motivations and study empirical findings in the stadium, television, and <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> context. Based on this theoretical background we conduct a quantitative analysis. During the UEFA EURO 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, 498 spectators were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire at official <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events. The findings of this analysis reveal two new motivational dimensions for passive sport consumption. Spectators of <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events enjoy the freedom to move around and the intercultural contact and therefore the chance to socialize with fan groups from different countries and cultures. Those new motivational dimensions represent key drivers of sport consumption behavior in the context of <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events. In addition to those empirical findings, we derive practical implications in order to understand how innovations in sport management such as <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> events open new ways to create value at sport events...|$|R

He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode.

The discovery was made by railway workers at 10:00am, and British Transport Police confirmed that the body was Speight's on 14 April 2008. An inquest into his death opened on 16 April 2008, and a post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as hanging. It was then adjourned until 20 May. The police said Speight may have used a sixth floor fire exit to get to the area where he was found.|$|E

After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from <b>public</b> <b>view,</b> except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who had asked him to stay away.|$|E

Bhati was later recorded on video boasting about getting the officer suspended within 40 minutes. Other leaders of the Samajwadi party such as Azam Khan and Naresh Agarwal have issued statements supporting the suspension order.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to <b>public</b> <b>view</b> in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from <b>public</b> <b>view.</b> In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E

5|$|An-Nasir Ahmad {{was known}} to be a seclusive sultan, {{surrounding}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, rarely making direct contact with the Mamluk emirs of Egypt and avoiding the <b>public</b> <b>view.</b> Two months into his reign, he relocated to al-Karak with substantial sums from the treasury and several horses and senior administrative officials. He ruled from the desert fortress, leaving a deputy, Emir Aqsunqur al-Salari, to oversee affairs in Egypt on his behalf. His unorthodox rule, alleged frivolity, and his execution of loyal partisans, namely Tashtamur and Qutlubugha, led to an-Nasir Ahmad being deposed from the sultanate by his half-brother, as-Salih Isma'il. He remained in the fortress of al-Karak, which the Mamluks besieged at least seven times, until being captured in July 1344. He was killed later that month on the orders of as-Salih Isma'il.|$|E
5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured {{a replica of}} the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from <b>public</b> <b>view</b> and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla was {{not subject}} to a proper damnatio memoriae after his assassination; while the Senate disliked him, his {{popularity}} with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring {{him to be a}} hostis. Macrinus, in an effort to placate the Senate, instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from <b>public</b> <b>view.</b> After his death, the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to be abolished and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted down. These events were, however, limited in scope; most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of re-use. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as Divus Antoninus. There {{does not appear to have}} been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.|$|E
