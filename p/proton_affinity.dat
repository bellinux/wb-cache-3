40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the kinetic method for estimating the <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> of bases that di-coordinate the proton is evaluated using α,ω-diaminoalkanes as model bases. The <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> of these diamines have previously been examined using the equilibrium method and critically evaluated. Calculations using density functional theory at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) level confirm that protonated α,ω-diaminoalkanes have cyclic structures with the proton covalently bound {{to one of the}} amino nitrogen atoms and hydrogen-bonded to the other. Furthermore, this cyclic structure persists in the protonated heterodimer ion between an α,ω-diaminoalkane and ammonia (the model reference base); binding of the two bases takes place via a second hydrogen bond between the RNH 3 + and ammonia. Measuring the <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> under several collision energies and extrapolating to zero collision energy yields <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> that are smaller than the reference values by - 2. 8 kcal/mol, on average. Application of the Fenselau correction gives <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> that differ from the reference values by ± 1. 0 kcal/mol. These results indicate that the kinetic method is effective for estimating the <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> of molecules that tend to have more than one potential protonation site. Application of this method is particularly suited to biological molecules, such as peptides, where application of the equilibrium method is impossible due to low sample volatility. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This method has determined that quinuclidone ranks among secondary and tertiary amines in terms of <b>proton</b> <b>affinity.</b> This high basicity is hypothesized to be due to the loss of electron delocalization when the amide bond is twisted—this causes misalignment of the pi orbitals, resulting in loss of electron resonance.|$|E
30|$|PTR-MS {{was used}} to provide {{compositional}} information about the VOCs in the reactor off-gas. PTR-MS uses H 3 O+ ions to protonate molecules (e.g. VOCs) with <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> greater than water (Lindinger et al. 1998). The singly charged ions are then typically detected as protonated molecules (ions with a mass-to-charge ratio, m/z, equal to the molecular weight plus 1 for the proton) by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Lindinger et al. 1998). Identity is assigned based on {{the mass of the}} ion and prior knowledge of the likely products of a specific reactor system (Luchner et al. 2012). Constituents of air like O 2, N 2 and CO 2 have <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> lower than water so are not protonated and do not interfere with measurements.

Recent progress in obtaining structures of bacteriorhodopsin and its intermediates with an increasingly higher resolution, together with functional studies utilizing mutant pigments and spectroscopic methods, have provided important information on the molecular architecture of the proton transfer pathways and the key groups involved in proton transport. In the present paper I consider mechanisms of light-induced proton release and uptake and intramolecular proton transport and mechanisms of modulation of <b>proton</b> <b>affinities</b> of key groups {{in the framework of}} these data. Special attention is given to some important aspects that have surfaced recently.

50|$|Both <b>proton</b> <b>affinity</b> and pKa are {{measures}} of the acidity of a molecule, and so both reflect the thermodynamic gradient between a molecule and the anionic form of that molecule upon removal of a proton from it. Implicit {{in the definition of}} pKa however is that the acceptor of this proton is water, and an equilibrium is being established between the molecule and bulk solution. More broadly, pKa can be defined with reference to any solvent, and many weak organic acids have measured pKa values in DMSO. Large discrepancies between pKa values in water versus DMSO (i.e., the pKa of water in water is 15.7, but water in DMSO is 32) demonstrate that the solvent is an active partner in the proton equilibrium process, and so pKa does not represent an intrinsic property of the molecule in isolation.
