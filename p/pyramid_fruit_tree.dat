40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>trees</b> are {{essential}} components {{of different types}} of greenery, including not only private gardens but also historical and modern public parks and gardens of many other cities. The research was carried out in spring 2016 by visiting different parks. <b>Fruit</b> <b>trees</b> were identified in 22 public parks of Warsaw situated in different districts of the city and picked up randomly for preliminary study. Observations were made by photographic documentation and mapping of the <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> on park plans using GPS coordinates which were taken during the site visit and Google Earth maps. According to the observations, selected <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> compositions have been recognized in public parks of Warsaw. The compositional structures that have been observed consist of solitaire <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> groups of <b>trees</b> (containing <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> but mostly composed of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and ornamental shrubs) and linear structures of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> (rows and alleys). The results of the preliminary study show that the most frequent <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> compositions used in the structure of selected public parks of Warsaw represent groups of trees - groups that consist of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and different species of ornamental shrubs. The undertaken study confirmed that <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> planted in the public parks of Warsaw have a high compositional value. They {{play an important role in}} the spatial arrangement of the parks selected, but also define the scope and borders of the selected garden interiors and create attractive sites...|$|R

Information {{technology}} includes neural networks, ontology technology, expert system, and so on, and {{the growth}} model can predict and manage growth conditions of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees.</b> The traditional expert system has shortcomings of poor self-learning ability, so the improved expert system is used to perform diagnosis of diseases and insects of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree.</b> Firstly the ontology is used to collect related symptoms of diseases and insects of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> the expert system and neural network are combined to build the prediction model of diseases and insects of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree,</b> then the conclusions of the diagnostic process are regarded as the input neurons and output neurons of neural networks, and are diagnosed by expert, so the prediction models of disease diagnosis of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> are made. The models can implement the function of expert diagnosis and prediction, and provide technical support and management decision for the growth management of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree,</b> greatly improving the diagnosis efficiency of diseases and insects of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} for acceptance of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in farmland was determined in four selected villages in Morogoro region. Farmers realizing {{the level of}} farmland degradation were highly motivated to adopt the innovation for incorporation of adapted <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species in their farms and household premises. In order to fast track <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> planting activities {{for the purpose of}} reducing the impact of climate change in local farming communities, at total 2, 600 of different grafted/budded (1, 400) and non grafted seedlings from <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species adapted to these areas were distributed and planted to three villages; Msingisi, Masenge (Gairo) and Mlimani ward (Morogoro). Most of transplanted <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> (72. 6 %) survived. Furthermore, for intensified and sustainable planting of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in the target and nearby villages, one nursery site was established and 50 farmers were trained in plant propagation and nursery establishment. A total of 1, 200 Avocado rootstocks were raised and more than 80 % (900 seedlings) of them have been successfully grafted. The use of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species as a strategic intervention for mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the study areas has been received positively with increasing demand for more <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> per village.

40|$|Well {{in advance}} of the {{hurricane}} season an assessment of the location and size of the <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in the home land-scape should be made. Ideally, <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> with a potential to become large (e. g., avocado and mango) and not regularly pruned should be planted 25 ft or more away from the home, other structures (e. g., garage and tool shed), power lines, and other trees. If, however, a large <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> is already in-place, a certified arborist should be contacted to reduce tree height and properly prune the tree to open the canopy to wind movement. Alternatively, large, potentially hazardous <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> may be transferred to a new location or removed completely and a new <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> established at a greater distance from the home, structure, or power lines.

40|$|Conventional {{breeding}} of temperate <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> is constrained by their extensive reproductive cycle with long juvenile periods, complex reproductive biology, and {{high degree of}} heterozygosity. As the commercial production of transgenic annual crops becomes a reality {{in many parts of}} the world, the question remains whether genetically engineering <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> will find commercial application. Gene transfer for <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> improvement has several inherent advantages. Once a useful transformant is isolated, vegetative propagation, which is the normal method of multiplying <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> provides unlimited production of the desired transgenic line. Fixation through the sexual cycle is unnecessary and inconvenient if commercially-accepted cultivars are transformed. Since production of most <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species is based on a few cultivars, the impact of transforming one of them would be significant. Currently, however, the only transgenic <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> commercially produced is papaya (Carica papaya L.) resistant to PRSV (papaya ringspot virus).

40|$|The {{study reveals}} the factors of {{transferring}} radionuclides 137 Cs, 40 K and 232 Th from soil under <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> to {{the components of}} <b>fruit</b> <b>trees.</b> Three <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> growing in two different places were chosen. 6 soil samples and apple tree components were taken from Ukmergė city.

The article discusses the methodology of preparing <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> components for radiometric research and submits the evaluation methods for transfer factors. The paper analyzes the obtained results of research on transfer factors. The conducted analysis has showed that 137 Cs, 40 K and 232 Th patterns of transfer depend on the type of a <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> and on the investigated components. The study has also disclosed that the pear tree collects all examined radionuclides {{to a greater extent than}} apple trees.

It {{is one of the}} indigenous <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species that is semi-domesticated by local people in Botswana. The species is an important indigenous source of food in Botswana. Besides proving people with <b>fruits,</b> the <b>tree</b> also provides goods (timber, firewood, fodder etc.) and services (soil conservation, shade etc.).
