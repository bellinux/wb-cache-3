RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF <b>Print</b> <b>Engine</b> from Adobe Systems and Jaws and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1992, {{this is the}} {{original}} LaserJet 4 with the Canon EX laser <b>print</b> <b>engine.</b> It prints eight pages per minute, and the user cannot extend the feeders.|$|E
50|$|The Photosmart Express Station is {{basically}} a PM1000 <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> with a user friendly kiosk mounted on top designed for customers to print photos quickly from memory cards or other sources.|$|E
50|$|For many years, Canon was the {{principal}} maker of the <b>print</b> <b>engines</b> found in industry-standard laser printers. The first models of Apple LaserWriter and the equivalent products made by HP used the Canon LBP-CX engine. The next models (LaserWriter II series, LaserJet II series) used the Canon LBP-SX engine. Later models used the Canon LBP-LX, LBP-EX, LBP-PX engines and many other Canon <b>print</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|They are all {{powered by}} a PMC-Sierra RM7065A CPU running at 300 MHz. This is a 64 bit {{processor}} based on the MIPS architecture. The <b>printing</b> <b>engine</b> is manufactured by Canon.|$|R
2500|$|IBM {{produced}} {{a series of}} typewriters called Thermotronic with letter-quality output and correcting tape along with printers tagged Quietwriter. Brother extended the life of their typewriter product line with similar products. The development of these proprietary <b>printing</b> <b>engines</b> provided the vendors with exclusive markets in consumable ribbons {{and the ability to}} use standardized <b>printing</b> <b>engines</b> with varying degrees of electronic and software sophistication to develop product lines. [...] Although these changes reduced prices—and greatly increased the convenience—of typewriters, the technological disruption posed by word processors left these improvements with only a short-term low-end market. To extend the life of these products, many examples were provided with communication ports to connect them to computers as printers.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>print</b> <b>engine,</b> [...] "the unit {{within a}} printer {{that does the}} actual printing." [...] For example, in a laser printer this would consist of the laser and drum and the {{mechanical}} paper feeds.|$|E
50|$|The first HP LaserJet and {{the first}} Apple LaserWriter used the same <b>print</b> <b>engine,</b> the Canon CX engine. HP chose to use their {{in-house}} developed Printer Command Language (PCL) as opposed to Apple, which adopted the PostScript language, as developed by Adobe Systems. The use of a less-ambitious and simpler Page description language allowed HP to deliver its LaserJet to the market about a year before Apple's CX based product, and for $1000 less. The sharing of an identical Canon engine in two competing products continued with the HP LaserJet II/III and the Apple LaserWriter II, which both used the Canon LBP-SX <b>print</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Basic {{label printer}} {{applicator}}s consist of three primary parts: a printer, or <b>print</b> <b>engine,</b> an applicator and {{a method to}} handle label and ribbons, referred to as media. Computing power also {{has the potential to}} increase the efficiency of label printer applicators.|$|E
5000|$|The first fully <b>printed</b> <b>engine,</b> the SuperDraco Engine {{combustion}} chamber is printed of Inconel, an alloy of nickel and iron, using {{a process of}} direct metal laser sintering. Engines are contained in a protective nacelle to prevent fault propagation if an engine fails.|$|R
50|$|By 2017, a 3D <b>printed</b> rocket <b>engine</b> had {{successfully}} launched a rocket to space.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 Lowry began {{manufacturing}} {{a line of}} label applicators and automated {{print and}} apply systems which they still sell today under the Paragon Brand name. They offer their customers a choice of Zebra, Sato and Datamax <b>print</b> <b>engines.</b> Paragon units are installed on a global basis {{for some of the}} largest Fortune 500 companies such as P&G, 3M, and many others.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{to address}} the need for both an {{affordable}} printer and a professional printer, the LaserWriter II was designed to allow for complete replacement of the computer circuit board that operates the printer. Across all the different models, the <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> was the same.|$|E
50|$|By {{comparison}} to an All-in-one product, a SOHO MFP {{is more likely}} to have an automatic document feeder, greater fax capabilities and faster output-performance.Most SOHO MFPs have their history in low-end black and white photocopiers, and the <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> is accordingly based around this type of technology.|$|E
50|$|Ancestral Quest is a {{genealogy}} {{software application}} for Microsoft Windows developed by Incline Software, LC. It features data entry with sourcing capabilities and scrapbook extensions; a <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> for standard or custom charts and reports; a web page creator; a collaboration engine; and an extension tool for other genealogy databases.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to conduct feasibility study of producing 3 D objects by printing thermoplastic elastomer using electrophotography technique and thereafter sintering the whole layer using infrared light source. The term Selective laser printing (SLP) has been coined by the author for this new process. This thesis provides the feasibility of developing experimental toner using thermoplastic toner using both mono and dual component <b>print</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R
50|$|Consumer and low-to-medium volume office {{printers}} use a duplexing {{unit that}} reverses {{a piece of}} paper after the first side has been printed. Duplex multifunction printers that also support duplex scanning have a reversing automatic document feeder (RADF) for scanning both sides. Higher volume printers may effectively have two <b>print</b> <b>engines</b> in a single device, and are able to print both sides of the paper in a single pass.|$|R
50|$|K Desktop Environment 3.0 debuted a new {{printing}} framework, KDEPrint. KDEPrint's modular design enabled it to support different <b>printing</b> <b>engines,</b> such as CUPS, LPRng, and LDP/LPR. In conjunction with CUPS, KDEPrint {{was able to}} manage an elaborate enterprise networked printing system. Since KDEPrint provides a command-line interface, its framework, including its GUI configuration elements, is accessible to non-KDE applications, such as OpenOffice.org, the Mozilla Application Suite, and Acrobat Reader.|$|R
50|$|The <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> of most All-in-one devices {{is based}} either {{on a home}} desktop inkjet printer, or on a home desktop laser printer. They may be {{black-and-white}} or colour capable. Laser models provide a better result for text while inkjet gives a more convincing result for images {{and they are a}} cheaper multifunctional.|$|E
50|$|The {{flagship}} of {{the family}} was the HP LaserJet 4 SiMX, launched in May 1993. It had several network interfaces by default, both Ethernet, Appletalk and TokenRing. Instant-on fusing was introduced with the HP LaserJet 4L {{in the spring of}} 1993. It included a new low cost <b>print</b> <b>engine.</b> It sold for $1,229.|$|E
50|$|Office MFPs {{are almost}} always networked, however some have {{optional}} or standard (but infrequently used) USB and parallel connections.Most Office MFPs have their history in mid-range photocopiers (both colour and black-and-white), and the <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> is therefore based around this type of technology, however, Hewlett-Packard recently introduced two Office MFPs based on fixed-head inkjet technology.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{commercial}} popularity of typewriters in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of printers were introduced. [...] These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and printing mechanisms of dot-matrix printers. The generation of teleprinters with impact pin-based <b>printing</b> <b>engines</b> was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative thermal transfer technologies used in thermal label printers had become technically feasible for typewriters.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter is Apple Inc.'s line of inkjet serial printers, {{targeted}} mainly towards consumers. They produced print {{quality that}} {{was better than}} the dot matrix ImageWriters, and were cheaper than the LaserWriters. All but a few models contained Canon <b>print</b> <b>engines,</b> while the last few were re-badged HP DeskJet printers. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued most of the company's accessory product lines, including the StyleWriter and LaserWriter.|$|R

50|$|In 1979, {{inspired}} by the Xerox 9700's commercial success, Japanese camera and optics company, Canon, developed a low-cost, desktop laser printer: the Canon LBP-10. Canon then began work on a much-improved <b>print</b> <b>engine,</b> the Canon CX, resulting in the LBP-CX printer. Lacking experience in selling to computer users, Canon sought partnerships with three Silicon Valley companies: Diablo Data Systems (who turned them down), Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Apple Computer.|$|E
5000|$|Preview can {{directly}} access image scanners {{supported by}} macOS and import {{images from the}} scanner. Preview can convert between image formats; it can export to BMP, JP2, JPEG, PDF, PICT, PNG, SGI, TGA, and TIFF. Using macOS's <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> (based on CUPS) {{it is also possible}} to [...] "print into" [...] a Postscript file, a PDF-X file or directly save the file in iPhoto, for example scanned photos.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973: Launch of the Océ 1700, {{the first}} plain paper copier. Instead of a drum, the Océ 1700 used a zigzag folded, endless master belt. The {{so-called}} copy press technology in this machine, differs from true xerographic reproduction {{in that it}} does not use developer, utilizes fewer electro-static charges in the <b>printing</b> <b>engine,</b> maintains a lower fusing temperature, and supposedly minimizes ozone emission. Soon after, the company also developed an application for wide-format printing.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} <b>print</b> <b>engines</b> for Production <b>Printing</b> MFPs, however in the [...] "light" [...] end of the Production Printing market, most are based on the large Office MFPs, which themselves are based on photocopier technology as described above.Production Printing MFPs may also be known as [...] "Print on demand" [...] devices, or [...] "Digital presses". This latter term {{can also be used to}} refer to the print controller controlling the MFP, however.|$|R
50|$|The LaserWriter {{used the}} same Canon CX <b>printing</b> <b>engine</b> as the HP LaserJet, and as a {{consequence}} early LaserWriters and LaserJets shared the same toner cartridges and paper trays. PostScript is a complete programming language that has to be run in a suitable interpreter and then sent to a software rasterizer program, all inside the printer. To support this, the LaserWriter featured a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 12 MHz, 512 kB of workspace RAM, and a 1 MB frame buffer.|$|R
50|$|Media {{handling}} controls how {{the label}} stock is {{delivered to the}} <b>print</b> <b>engine.</b> It also performs {{the separation of the}} label from its backing and rewinds the waste label backing that remains after label application. This process can be difficult since consistent tension must be maintained for the label to peel off the liner and onto the applicator. Too much tension can cause the liner to break, which requires the machine to be rethreaded.|$|E
50|$|MFPs, {{like most}} {{external}} peripherals that {{are capable of}} functioning without a computer, are essentially a type of computer themselves. They contain memory, one or more processors, and often some kind of local storage, such as a hard disk drive or flash memory. As mentioned in the Types of MFP section, the physical <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> may be based on several technologies, however most larger MFPs are an evolution of a digital photocopier.|$|E
50|$|In late 1991, Xerox re-branded the {{original}} DocuTech Production Publisher as the DocuTech Production Publisher Model 135 (DT135). This {{was done to}} distinguish it from the DocuTech Production Publisher Model 90 which the company anticipated announcing in 1992. The model numbers were chosen to reflect the speed page-per-minute print speeds of the two models. The controller and scanner where common for both models, but the Model 90 used a different <b>print</b> <b>engine</b> based on one developed for the previously announced Xerox 4090 printer.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, HP {{introduced}} both inkjet {{and laser}} printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, these have later been developed into successful multifunction products, {{the most significant}} being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's tremendously popular LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (<b>print</b> <b>engines),</b> which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software that convert data into dots for the mechanism to print.|$|R
50|$|VIPP was {{originally}} written by couple of Xerox systems Analysts in Switzerland {{to enable the}} highest speed Postscript printers, at that time 50 pages per minute, to have the features of Xerox's proprietary production printing languages PDL and FDL which provide simple variable data printing. Xerox Corporation adopted the idea and developed their work by putting these procedures on Sun Microsystems hosts where the Adobe interpreter also resides. Together, these modules give complete control over the <b>printing</b> <b>engine</b> and data stream.|$|R
40|$|Historically, in the 35 {{years of}} digital {{printing}} research, raster image processing has always lagged behind marking engine technology, i. e., {{we have never}} been able to deliver rendered digital pages as fast as digital <b>print</b> <b>engines</b> can consume them. This trend has resulted in products based on throttled digital printers or expensive raster image processors (RIP) with hardware acceleration. The current trend in computer software architecture is to leverage graphic processing units (GPU) for computing tasks whenever appropriate. We discuss the issues for rendering fonts on such an architecture and present an implementation...|$|R
