50|$|An {{active antenna}} is an antenna that {{contains}} active electronic components such as transistors, {{as opposed to}} most antennas which only consist of passive components such as metal rods, capacitors and inductors. Active antenna designs allow antennas of limited size to have a wider frequency range (bandwidth) than passive antennas, and are primarily used in situations where a larger <b>passive</b> <b>antenna</b> is either impractical (inside a portable radio) or impossible (suburban residential area that disallows use of large outdoor low-frequency antennas).|$|E

This {{is in contrast}} with active antennas where characterization is performed {{in one of two}} modes, with the other deemed not suitable due to non-reciprocity. This requires an antenna measurement facility be able to perform measurements in both transmit and receive modes. This article describes a measurement setup used to characterize an active radar module (ARM) in transmit mode and presents the results of these measurements, which were performed in the compact antenna test range at the Institute of High-Frequency Technology at the University of Aachen (RWTH), Aachen, Germany...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{new design}} of dual-port monopole-slot-like {{microstrip}} active integrated antenna (AIA) is presented and {{discussed in this}} paper. The primary designed <b>passive</b> <b>antenna</b> is capable of supporting two different WLAN bands at 2. 4 – 2. 84 GHz and 5. 15 – 5. 35 GHz due to its dual-port structure. In {{order to reduce the}} transmission coefficient between the two ports of antenna a coupling sleeve-arm and an inverted T-shaped slot are utilized on the ground plane of antenna each beneath one of the corresponding feed-lines which act as filtering structures at desirable frequencies. The proposed passive dual-port antenna is integrated with a power amplifier (PA) and a low noise amplifier forming a dual-port microstrip AIA which {{can be used as a}} full-duplex transceiver at its operating WLAN frequency bands. The measured results for both passive and active antennas show that the designed antennas have proper radiation characteristics at their desired operation frequencies. The fabricated <b>passive</b> <b>antenna</b> exhibits dual-band performance at 2 – 3. 42 GHz and 4. 5 – 5. 6 GHz while the fabricated AIA covers 2. 31 – 2. 82 GHz (at PA port) and 4. 45 – 5. 5 GHz (at LNA Port) with 13 dB and 9 dB gain level improvement respectively. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{dendritic}} arbor of pyramidal neurons {{is not a}} monolithic structure. We show here that the excitability of terminal apical dendrites {{differs from that of}} the apical trunk. In response to ßuorescence-guided focal photolysis of caged glutamate, individual terminal apical dendrites generated cadmium-sensitive all-or-none responses that were subthreshold for somatic action potentials. Calcium transients produced by all-or-none responses were not restricted to the sites of photolysis, but occurred throughout individual distal dendritic compartments, indicating that electrogenesis is mediated primarily by voltage-gated calcium channels. Compartmentalized and binary behavior of parallel-connected terminal dendrites can greatly expand the computational power of a single neuron. Dendrites are not <b>passive</b> <b>antennae</b> that simply receive synaptic inputs but actively process and transform inputs as they are received (1 – 5). The apical dendritic arbo...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{local area}} network (WLAN) {{applications}} nowadays has become more popular especially those operating in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. Newer laptops incorporated WiFi and Bluetooth technologies to connect to portable devices such as handsets and palmtop or to fixed devices such as printers. Nowadays, {{there are a lot}} of efforts on combining the WLAN, IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g bands together. Even though IEEE 802. 11 a is not allowed in Malaysia (for aeronautical navigation and fixed satellite communication), this frequency spectrum might be available in the future. Such new designs either provide inadequate coverage of the frequency band or not suitable for integration in some portable devices. This thesis describes the design of the dual band microstrip antenna using scaling factor technique and inset feed with the integration of active devices. Different shapes of patches have been used to investigate any improvements that can be achieved. The antennas were designed to operate in the ISM band at 2. 4 GHz and lower UNII band at 5. 2 GHz. The dimensions of each single element of the microstrip antenna, at these operating frequencies were calculated using transmission line model. Two elements of inset fed antenna were used for each frequency band. The simulation process was done using the Agilent Advanced Design System and Microwave Office software.

The present work has been to understand the new instrument system in response to different meteorological conditions and on fairweather days. In this paper we have selected the data of the days during magnetically quiet period to minimize the upper atmospheric contribution. Fairweather’ conditions, i.e., days with absence of high winds, drifting or falling snow and clouds. The diurnal variation curve of electric field during fairweather days is a single periodic with a minimum at 04 : 00 UT and a maximum at 19 : 00 UT. But atmospheric current variation has minimum 03 : 00 UT for Maxwell current and conduction current. The maximum for Maxwell current is at 20 : 00 UT and 19 : 00 UT for the conduction current, which is very similar to the Carnegie curve.

Such antenna are of increasing interest, as system designers require more complex functions to be implemented in reduced space. This thesis discusses the integration of active antennas by combining receive functions into one single antenna. Two main components in the design are passive dual band microstrip monopole antenna and active device (low noise amplifier). All the simulations are done using the CST Microwave Software and Advance Design System (ADS). The terminology of active integrated antenna indicates specifically that the <b>passive</b> <b>antenna</b> elements and the active circuitry are integrated on the same substrate. Two different set of frequencies have been allocated for the WLAN application. One is at 2. 4 GHz band and the other at 5. 8 GHz band. Two different set of frequencies need two different set of antenna. It can be solved by using one antenna for two different systems. Basically the design of transmit or receive passive microstrip monopole antenna the gain is not constant over a desired frequency band. The implementation of amplifier (low noise amplifier) in a <b>passive</b> <b>antenna</b> structure increases the antenna gain and improves the noise performance.

The latest mobile wireless terminals such as iPhone and iPad can be used in any random position and orientation thereby making the received LOS-component to appear as a random voltage at the antenna ports.
