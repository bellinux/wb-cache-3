5|$|Around midnight 7/8 June, {{during the}} slow voyage across the Channel, a German {{airplane}} hit West Honaker with two skip bombs. Because the ship, already {{prepared for a}} fast sinking for the blockship duties, began taking on water, {{a large portion of}} the crew, including Chief Engineer Poropat, abandoned ship. After drifting in the Channel for most of the rest of the moonless night, they were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning by a British trawler and returned to the UK.

A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800.

5|$|The {{estate is}} {{strongly}} reminiscent of Romanesque architecture, mainly due to alterations {{made to the}} house and grounds by Davenport. A member of the National Trust, the current owner of Beaumont House, explains how Davenport's travels influenced his styles:Samuel Davenport was a great world traveller.

And he would travel to every one of these expos...I'm sure that the influences that he <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> all of his travels are reflected here in Beaumont House.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sarria {{found himself}} {{at the center of}} a legal {{controversy}} over his role on the jury in the 1991 murder trial of Clifford Bolden. Bolden had been sentenced to death in 1991 for the 1986 murder of Henry Michael Pederson, whom Bolden allegedly <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a bar in San Francisco's Castro district. Bolden's attorneys claimed that Sarria, who was not on the jury that convicted Bolden but was seated as an alternate for the penalty phase, had known Bolden's lover, Pederson and another of the jurors. They alleged that he had concealed this knowledge in order to remain on the jury and push for a death sentence. Sarria acknowledged having spoken occasionally with the other juror but denied the rest of the allegations. Sarria was cleared of wrongdoing in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence.

The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day.

5|$|Liverpool {{began the}} 1975–76 Football League {{campaign}} losing 2–0 to Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Liverpool's form <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half}} of the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season games left them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, Club Brugge scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought back for a 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball {{in the first}} hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
