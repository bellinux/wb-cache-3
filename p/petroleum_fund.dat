40|$|Many natural-resource-abundant {{countries}} have established <b>petroleum</b> <b>funds</b> {{as part of}} their strategy to manage their resource wealth. This paper examines reasons that such funds may be established, discusses how these funds are organized, and draws some policy lessons. The paper then develops a theory of how <b>petroleum</b> <b>funds</b> may affect the economic and political equilibrium of an economy, and how this depends on the initial institutions. A challenge with <b>petroleum</b> <b>funds</b> is that they may produce economic and political incentives that undermine their potential benefits. An alternative to establishing <b>petroleum</b> <b>funds</b> is to use revenues to invest domestically in sectors such as infrastructure, education, and health. Such investments have the potential to produce a better economic, as well as institutional, development. This is particularly the case if the initial institutions are weak...|$|R

5000|$|The Timor-Leste <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> was {{established}} in 2005, and by 2011 it had reached a worth of US$8.7 billion. East Timor is labelled by the International Monetary Fund as the [...] "most oil-dependent economy in the world". The <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> pays for {{nearly all of the}} government's annual budget, which has increased from $70 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2011, with a $1.8 billion proposal for 2012.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>petroleum</b> <b>fund</b> is to invest parts of the large surplus {{generated}} by the Norwegian petroleum sector, generated mainly from taxes of companies but also payment for license to explore {{as well as the}} State's Direct Financial Interest and dividends from the partly state-owned Statoil. The current revenue from the petroleum sector is estimated to be at its peak period and to decline in the future decades. The <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> was established in 1990 after a decision by the country's legislature to counter the effects of the forthcoming decline in income and to smooth out the disruptive effects of highly fluctuating oil prices.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} main reason why natural {{resources}} induce prosperity in some countries but stagnation in others is policy differences.

50|$|The PRF traces {{its origins}} to the {{acquisition}} of the Universal Oil Products laboratory by a consortium of oil companies in 1931. The companies established a trust <b>fund,</b> The <b>Petroleum</b> Research <b>Fund,</b> in 1944 {{in order to prevent}} antitrust litigation tied to their UOP assets. The ACS was named the beneficiary of the trust. The first grants from the PRF were awarded in 1954. In 2000, the trust was transferred to the ACS. The ACS established The American Chemical Society <b>Petroleum</b> Research <b>Fund</b> and the previous trust was dissolved. The PRF trust was valued at $144.7 million in December 2014.|$|R

5000|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the 1972 Norwegian referendum to not join the European Union, the Norwegian Ministry of Industry, headed by Ola Skjåk Bræk moved quickly to establish a national energy policy. Norway decided to stay out of OPEC, keep its own energy prices in line with world markets, and spend the revenue—known as the [...] "currency gift"—in the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> of Norway. The Norwegian government established its own oil company, Statoil, and awarded drilling and production rights to Norsk Hydro and the newly formed Saga Petroleum.|$|E
50|$|The Government Pension Fund - Norway (Norwegian: Statens pensjonsfond Norge, SPN) was {{established}} by the National Insurance Act (Folketrygdloven) in 1967 under the name National Insurance Scheme Fund (Norwegian: Folketrygdfondet). The name was changed {{at the same time}} as the former <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund,</b> on 1 January 2006. It continues to be managed by a separate board and separate government entity, still named Folketrygdfondet. The Government Pension Fund - Norway had a value of NOK 106.9 billion at the end of 2006. Unlike the Global division, it is required to limit its investments to domestic companies on the stock market, predominantly on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Thus, it is a key stock owner in many large Norwegian companies.|$|E
50|$|The Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) is a fund {{where the}} surplus profit {{produced}} by Norwegian petroleum industry (oil and gas) is deposited. Previously reviously called ‘The <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> of Norway’ {{when it was}} established in 1990, the fund changed its name in 2006. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund, {{which is part of}} the Norwegian Central Bank and on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. It is not a normal pension fund in the sense as its financial backing comes from oil profits rather than pensioners. This makes continued investment dependent on the survival of the oil industry, despite the world realising fossil fuels directly attribute to global warming.|$|E

5000|$|Kerr-McGee {{received}} international {{criticism for}} undertaking exploration for hydrocarbon resources offshore the Moroccan controlled {{area of the}} disputed territory of Western Sahara in 2001. In 2003, one of Norway's main private investment funds, Skagen Vekst, sold their €3.6 million stake in the oil company, referring to ethic problems surrounding Kerr-McGee's engagement in Western Sahara. In May 2005, despite the number of growing protests, the company renewed the contract signed with Moroccan authorities until October. In June 2005, the Norwegian government sold the $52.7 million it had invested in the company through the Government <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> (one of the biggest investment funds of the world), characterizing Kerr-McGee's contract in Western Sahara as having [...] "particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms". That same month, another two Norwegian private investment funds (Storebrand and KLP) sold their participations on Kerr-McGee, €1 million and €1.45 million respectively. On May 2, 2006, the company declared its intention to no longer drill {{off the coast of}} the Western Sahara, by not renewing the contract signed with Morocco.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} December 2006, TT$750 million (US$125 million) {{of grant}} funds had been disbursed from the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund.</b> In 2009 the Fund {{amounted}} to US$79 million (TT$502.6) million. Among the projects funded by the Petroleum Stabilization Fund (PSF) in 2009 was a 10-day search and rescue course conducted by the Montserrat Institute of Disaster Research Education and Management for Community Emergency Response Teams. Students from the course came from Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Cayman Islands, Saint Lucia, Dominica and Montserrat with fourteen Montserratians participating in order to strengthen their island's capacity to cope with hazards, including its ongoing volcanic threat. In December 2009, the Manning administration offered ready and willing support to Jamaica from the PSF {{in the event that}} more money was needed to meet the requirements for a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Energy Minister Conrad Enill said that although Trinidad and Tobago itself is facing a $7 billion deficit, any assistance for Jamaica was already available by way of the PSF if it wanted any short term help to raise J$21.8 billion (TT$1.53 billion) needed to meet the requirements for the IMF loan.|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas {{provides}} about 95 % of Timor-Leste state {{revenues and}} four-fifths of GDP. Income from exporting non-renewable petroleum wealth is channelled through a <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> which contains US$ 15 billion. Many {{expect that the}} Fund’s balance and investment earnings will pay for state activities after {{the oil and gas}} fields are exhausted, which could be by 2020 if the Greater Sunrise project remains stalled. Unfortunately, the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> may be empty five years after that. This paper describes a model to estimate how long the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> will be able to finance state activities. The model incorporates historical and projected data, including recurrent and capital spending, domestic revenue, loans and repayments, petroleum income and return on <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> investments. It allows changes to these parameters as well as to anticipated oil market prices, interest rates and Sunrise development options. The prospect that the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund</b> could be gone in a decade underscores the urgency to develop Timor-Leste’s non-oil economy, increase domestic revenue and use public funds wisely. Oil and gas provided more than 95 % of Timor-Leste state revenues 2 and comprised 81 % of GDP (RDTL DGS 2013) in 2012. Income from exporting non-renewable petroleum wealth is channelled through the <b>Petroleum</b> <b>Fund,</b> which contains US$ 15 billion.

5000|$|In {{response}} to the low oil prices {{at the end of}} the 1990s, Chavez played a leading role within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reinvigorate that organisation and obtain members' adherence to lower production quotas designed to drive up the oil price. Venezuelan oil minister Alí Rodríguez Araque's announcement in 1999 that his country would respect OPEC production quotas marked [...] "a historic turnaround from the nation's traditional pro-US oil policy." [...] On 13 November 2001, under the enabling law authorized by the National Assembly, President Chávez enacted the Hydrocarbons Law, which came into effect in January 2002. The new Hydrocarbons Law required that a minimum of 51% of PDVSA be owned by the Venezuelan government, and increased royalties paid by foreign corporations from 16.6% to 30% in an attempt to repatriate more <b>petroleum</b> <b>funds</b> to Venezuela.|$|R
