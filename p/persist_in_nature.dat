Here, we investigate the effect of large-scale climate variability on the dynamics of human plague in the western United States using a 56 -year time series of plague reports (1950 - 2005). We found that El Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in combination affect the dynamics of human plague over the western United States. The underlying mechanism could involve changes in precipitation and temperatures that impact both hosts and vectors.

In our laboratory, special attention has been given to addressing the molecular strategies that B. burgdorferi employs for effective colonization, migration and transmission through ticks. Studies have shown that B. burgdorferi expresses a select set of genes in distinct phases of its life cycle – and in specific tissue locations. For example, B. burgdorferi outer surface protein (Osp) A is downregulated within a mammalian host and turned on as soon as the spirochete enters and resides within the arthropod vector. OspA acts as an adhesion, which binds a receptor in the tick gut, and OspA is required for spirochetes to successfully colonize the tick gut. B. burgdorferi lacking OspA cannot survive in the tick. To further understand the mechanism of OspA-based adherence, we have recently identified and characterized the Tick Receptor for OspA, named TROSPA.

40|$|Summary: Anaplasma phagocytophilum <b>persists</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> {{by cycling}} between mammals and ticks. Human {{infection}} by {{the bite of}} an infected tick leads to a potentially fatal emerging disease called human granulocytic anaplasmosis. A. phagocytophilum is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that replicates inside mammalian granulocytes and the salivary gland and midgut cells of ticks. A. phagocytophilum evolved the remarkable ability to hijack the regulatory system of host cells. A. phagocytophilum alters vesicular traffic to create an intracellular membrane-bound compartment that allows replication in seclusion from lysosomes. The bacterium downregulates or actively inhibits a number of innate immune responses of mammalian host cells, and it upregulates cellular cholesterol uptake to acquire cholesterol for survival. It also upregulates several genes critical for the infection of ticks, and it prolongs tick survival at freezing temperatures. Several host factors that exacerbate infection have been identified, including interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and cholesterol. Host factors that overcome infection include IL- 12 and gamma interferon (IFN-γ). Two bacterial type IV secretion effectors and several bacterial proteins that associate with inclusion membranes have been identified. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying A. phagocytophilum infection will foster the development of creative ideas to prevent or treat this emerging tick-borne disease...|$|R

In this study, we demonstrate that the amount of IL- 21, but not IL- 2, correlated with T 1 D incidence. During our analyses of the IL- 2 /IL- 21 interval, we found that mice segregate into one of two distinct expression profiles. In the first group, which includes the C 57 BL/ 6 strain, both Il 2 and Il 21 were expressed at low levels.

However, because NOD IL- 2 mRNA was relatively unstable, IL- 2 production was remarkably similar between strains. The increased production of IL- 21 in NOD mice was found to result from two single nucleotide polymorphisms within the distal promoter region that conferred increased binding affinity for the transcription factor Sp 1.

We address this issue using shredder invertebrate communities and organic matter decomposition rates in 24 high-altitude (3200 - 3900 m) Neotropical streams as a study model. We first assessed the effects of stream characteristics and shredder diversity and abundance on organic matter decomposition rates in coarse-and fine-mesh bags. We found the interaction term shredder richness x shredder abundance had the most significant impact on decomposition rates in the field, although water discharge may {{also play a role}} locally. We also examined the relative contribution of the three most abundant shredders on decomposition rates by manipulating shredder richness and community composition in a field experiment. Transgressive overyielding was detected among the three shredder species, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation. By integrating survey and experimental data in surface response analyses we found that observed B-EF patterns fit those predicted by a linear model that described litter decomposition rates as a function of increasing shredder richness and the relative abundance of the most efficient shredders. Finally, the validity of our approach was tested in a broader context by using two independent but comparable data sets from 49 French and Swedish streams showing more complex shredder community structure. Results revealed that richness and identity effects on decomposition rates were lost with increasing shredder community complexity. Our approach of combining experimental and empirical data with modeling in species-poor ecosystems may serve as an impetus for new B-EF studies. If theory can explain B-EF in low-diversity ecosystems, it may also have credibility in more complex ones...|$|R

Another one says, that viable L. minor biomass removed 85-90% of Pb(NO3)2 with an initial concentration of 5 mg/l. Higher lead concentrations though lead to a decrease in relative growth rate of L. minor. Because L. minor is temperature tolerant, shows rapid growth and is easy to harvest, it bears high potential for the cost-efficient use in wastewater treatments. The Devils Lake wastewater treatment, located in North Dakota, USA, utilizes these beneficial properties of L. minor and other aquatic plants in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater. After a certain growing period, the plants are harvested and used as soil amendment, compost material or protein source for livestock. In industrial affected regions, where heavy metals accumulate in waters, soils and sediments due to anthropogenic activities like mining and burning of fossil fuels, the harvested L. minor should not be reused, but disposed accordingly.

We then test our predictions concerning public goods cooperation using strains of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce variable levels of a public good-iron-scavenging siderophore molecules. As predicted, we found that the relative fitness of cheats (under-producers) was greatest at higher population densities.

Despite this, numerous genome-duplicated (polyploid) species <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature,</b> indicating early problems can be overcome [1, 2]. Little is known about which genes are involved—only one has been molecularly characterized [5]. To gain new insights into the molecular basis of adaptation to polyploidy, we investigated genome-wide patterns of differentiation between natural diploids and tetraploids of Arabidopsis arenosa, an outcrossing relative of A.  thaliana [6, 7]. We first show that diploids are not preadapted to polyploid meiosis. We then use a genome scanning approach to show that although polymorphism is extensively shared across ploidy levels, there is strong ploidy-specific differentiation in 39 regions spanning 44 genes. These are discrete, mostly single-gene peaks of sharply elevated differentiation. Among these peaks are eight meiosis genes whose encoded proteins coordinate a specific subset of early meiotic functions, suggesting these genes comprise a polygenic solution to WGD-associated chromosome segregation challenges.

However, current theories treat post-infection dispersal propensities as a fixed trait, and the plastic nature of host's responses to parasite infection has long been underappreciated. Here, we present a mark-recapture experiment in a single host-parasite system (larval parasites of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera laevis and its salmonid fish host Oncorhynchus masou masou) and provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that parasite infection induces size-dependent host dispersal in the field. In response to parasite infection, large fish become more dispersive, whereas small fish tend {{to stay at the}} home patch. The observed plasticity in dispersal is interpretable from the viewpoint of host fitness: expected benefits (release from further infection) may exceed dispersal-associated costs for individuals with high dispersal ability (i. e. large fish) but are marginal for individuals with limited dispersal ability (i. e. small fish). Indeed, our growth analysis revealed that only small fish hosts incurred dispersal costs (reduced growth). Strikingly, our simulation study revealed that this plastic dispersal response of infected hosts substantially enhanced parasite persistence and occupancy in a spatially structured system. These results suggest that dispersal plasticity in host species is critical for understanding how parasites emerge, spatially spread, and <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature.</b> Our findings provide a novel starting point for building a reliable, predictive model for parasite/disease management...|$|E

Measures of physical distance have become increasingly standardized, but anomalous practices <b>persist.</b> Straight-line distance <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> has less applicability to human geography than route distance on a transport network. Even circuitous distance measures may be less useful measures of the separation of places than the time, expense and effort of traversing distances. Cognitive and compound distance also measure relative distance. In human geography distance is treated mainly as an organizing principle in location decision making and travel behavior, as a deterrent to spatial interaction and diffusion, and as a differentiator. Advances in rapid, long-range transport and communication have mediated sheer physical distance and rendered it less significant. Yet even while the world shrinks metaphorically, distances measured in relative terms are being reconfigured unevenly and imaginatively. Even where distance has ceased to be a material concern, the idea and discourse of distance survives...|$|R
