No writer's <b>published</b> <b>work</b> provided the basis for more films noir of the classic period than Woolrich's: thirteen in all, including Black Angel (1946), Deadline at Dawn (1946), and Fear in the Night (1947).|$|E

Writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts, although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication.|$|E

25|$|Chaix d'Est-Ange {{and other}} early genealogists and authors not only complained about {{problems}} with each others' <b>published</b> <b>works</b> regarding the Forcade family, they also published erroneous, incomplete and unsourced information {{in their own}} works in trying to substantiate the family's nobility and disprove each other. Although {{they were supposed to}} cite concrete, if not irrefutable, proof of lineage and ancestry in their <b>published</b> <b>works,</b> it was neither they nor their <b>published</b> <b>works</b> that determined the Forcade family's nobility. They simply reported it.|$|R

5|$|Baker's last <b>published</b> <b>work,</b> Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent}} a stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first <b>published</b> <b>work</b> was the short story collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|Calvin's first <b>published</b> <b>work</b> was a {{commentary}} of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
