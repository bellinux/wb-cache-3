40|$|There are {{two ways}} in which {{responses}} to successive unexpected stimuli are attenuated, namely through habituation and conditioning. For the latter, it suffices that the unexpected stimulus is preceded by another just perceivable stimulus. In spinal cord reflexes this is termed conditioning, while in brainstem reflexes this is usually referred to as prepulse inhibition. Cutaneous reflexes in Tibialis Anterior (TA) are particularly strong during gait and they are thought to involve a transcortical loop. Can these reflexes be suppressed by giving a brief pulse prior to a reflex-evoking pulse given to the same nerve? To examine this question, electromyographic signals were recorded in healthy humans during walking. Sural nerve stimulation (train of five pulses (1 ms duration)) at 200 Hz were applied at two times perception threshold during different phases of the step cycle. The <b>preceding</b> <b>pulse</b> (single pulse of 1 ms at same intensity) {{was applied to the}} same nerve 150 ms before the reflex-evoking pulse train.

First, we addressed the stability of one memory pattern as a propagating spike volley. We showed that memory patterns propagate as pulse packets. Second, we investigated the activity when we activated two different memory patterns.

40|$|ABSTRACT Voltage-gated delayed {{potassium}} {{current in}} molluscan neurons {{is characterized by}} a marked inactivation. Inactivation can accumulate between repetitive pulses, giving rise to current patterns in which the maximum current during a second voltage pulse is less than the current {{at the end of the}} <b>preceding</b> <b>pulse</b> (cumulative inactivation). Other features of inactivation of this current include an onset time-course that can be characterized by the sum of two exponential processes and an early minimum in the recovery-vs. -time curye. A simple four-state model is developed that can, when supplied with rate constants derived from voltage-clamp experiments, reproduce these features of inactivation. The model incorporates state-dependent inactivation rates. Upon depolarization, both open and closed channels can be inactivated, although inactivation of closed channels is much faster. Upon repolarization, recovery from inactivated states is sufficiently slow that little recovery occurs during a short interpulse interval. Cumulative inactivation comes about as a result of fast inactivation during the second pulse, further limiting the peak current from the level at the end of the previous pulse...|$|E

METHODS [...] A short wave telemetry system was used to record heart rates during a class in a group of 12 healthy women aged 26 (SD 6) years. Subjects palpated their pulses for 10 s following high and low intensity exercise [78 (8) % and 69 (9) % of mean predicted maximum heart rate respectively]. Recorded exercising heart rates, averaged over 60 s <b>preceding</b> <b>pulse</b> palpation [ExHR(rec) ], were compared with the recorded postexercise heart rates averaged over the 10 s palpation period [PostExHR(rec) ] and with the palpated counts (PalpHR). Differences were assessed using Student's t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS [...] Differences between ExHR(rec) and PostExHR(rec) following high and low intensity exercise [3 (6) beats. min- 1 and 5 (7) beats. min- 1 respectively] were not significant. However, the wide variation between subjects means that a postexercise heart rate is unreliable as a measure of individual exercise intensity. PalpHR was significantly lower than ExHR(rec) (P < 0. 01). Every individually palpated count underestimated the exercising heart rate (range 9 to 95 beats. min- 1). CONCLUSIONS [...] While postexercise heart rate adequately represents the exercise heart rate for a group, the individual variation is too wide for this to be a useful measurement...|$|E
40|$|Fiber lasers offer several clear {{advantages}} over solid-state systems: compact design, thermal management, minimal alignment, spatial beam quality and low cost. Consequently, fiber systems {{have become a}} valued option for applications requiring continuous-wave or long-pulse operation. However, for pulsed operation the benefits of fiber come {{at the cost of}} tighter confinement of the light, leading to the accumulation of nonlinear optical effects which can rapidly degrade the pulse. For this reason, the performance of mode-locked fiber lasers has until recently lagged behind that of their solid-state counterparts. Nonetheless, recent developments in managing nonlinearity have led to mode-locked fiber systems with performance that directly competes with solid-state systems. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the ultrashort pulse propagation physics which helps to render the nonlinear limitations of fiber systems obsolete. From the development of dissipative soliton mode-locking, which allows for an order of magnitude increase in pulse energies, to mode-locking based on self-similar pulse evolution which allows for the shortest pulses from a fiber laser to date, this thesis covers recent significant developments in laser mode-locking in systems featuring normal group-velocity dispersion.

We observed marked changes in the measured time-resolved secondary electrons depending on the induced alterations in the electronic structure. The enhancement of secondary electrons at positive times, when the electron pulse follows the optical pulse, is primarily due to an energy gain involving the photoexcited charge carriers that are transiently populated in the conduction band and further promoted by the electron pulse, consistent with a band structure that is dependent on chemical doping and carrier concentration. When electrons undergo sufficient energy loss on their journey to the surface, dark contrast becomes dominant in the image. At negative times, however, when the electron <b>pulse</b> <b>precedes</b> the optical <b>pulse</b> (electron impact), the dynamical behavior of carriers manifests itself in a dark contrast which indicates the suppression of secondary electrons upon {{the arrival of the}} optical pulse.

This has {{led to the development of}} different theories surrounding the generation and persistence of optical filaments propagating over many Rayleigh lengths in air. These theories include wave-guiding model, moving focus model, dynamic spatial replenishment model and conical wave model. However, these models fail to capture the gas dynamics that arise from optical filaments interacting with air. 	In this work, we demonstrate that initial conditions are critical to the formation of optical filaments through the use of an aerodynamic window. Filament characteristics in air, such as spectral broadening, electrical conductivity and fluorescence, are measured and presented. Using these as diagnostic tools, we also show that the optical filamentation of ultrashort laser pulses can be enhanced at high repetition rates because of the thermal response of air, resulting from the interaction of each laser pulse with the modified atmospheric density distribution left behind by the <b>preceding</b> <b>pulse.</b> This is explained by the sudden deposition of energy by a filament in the air which generates a cylindrical shock wave, leaving behind a column of rarefied air. This low-density region persists for an extended period and can materially affect {{the propagation}} dynamics of an ensuing pulse that follows before the low-density region has relaxed sufficiently to ambient conditions. By further increasing the repetition rate, the onset of ionization is shifted downstream and the spectral continuum displays a stronger broadening on both sides of the original pulse spectrum. This gas dynamic interaction regime of filamentation can be utilized to enhance the length and spectral width of filaments for remote sensing and long range laser-induced high voltage discharges.

A technique to assess and compensate for fueling errors and variability in the injected fuel quantity estimation is of great interest. The current study is intended to identify the critical parameters that cause variability in the injected pulse quantity and devise suitable control strategies to control those parameters to enhance the accuracy of the fuel delivered in every shot during injection. The focus here is on the Cummins Inc. Heavy Duty XPI injector configured to run a small pilot and a large main pulse. The work involves using an injector model in the Gamma Technologies suite (GT Fuel). The model was validated for single pulse injection. ^ Since multiple pulse injection has timing issues very different from the single pulse injection, this work involves generating a new critical parameter tree for multiple pulse injection. From the Critical Parameter Flow Down, body pressure dynamics were identified as the primary cause of the variability in fueling. There is a pressure wave set up inside the injector body due to the first injection pulse. When the second pulse is fired, the pressure in the injector body is fluctuating. The condition at which the second pulse is fired depends upon the spacing between pulses and the quantity injected in the first pulse. Since body pressure is critical, a simple model to estimate the body pressure trace across an injection event has been developed. The simple model results are compared with the results from GT Fuel. Good agreement is found between the simple model results and the GT Fuel Model. ^ To pinpoint the focus of the fueling error, the injection rate shapes for the multipulse cases were analyzed in comparison with the single pulse case with matching conditions. The opening portion of the injection rate shape was identified as the major contributor to the fueling error. The start of the second pulse shifts owing to the <b>preceding</b> <b>pulse</b> and the opening slope of the rate shape changes as well. An approximation to quantify this error using rate shape parameters has been devised. This approximation captures about 70 % of the total fueling error. To use this approximation, the rate shape parameters need to be estimated. Since these parameters depend upon the system dynamics, correlation with the body pressure parameters was sought. Regression models were used to estimate the dominant rate shape parameters influencing fueling. The predictor variables in the regression models are the body pressure parameters. The opening slope is estimated within an error of 5 % while the shift in the start of injection is estimated within 15 %. Thus, the body pressure is initially estimated, and using the parameters of the body pressure in the regression equations, the rate shape parameters are estimated. This results in the estimation of the fueling error. ^ A simple technique to correct for the error in fueling is to alter the on-time of the injector. A scheme for correcting the on-time is also described. This scheme is specific for the injector and the information to correct for the on-time is obtained from the Fueling-On-time Curve drawn up for a particular injector. This estimation-correction scheme can reduce the fueling variation by about 40 % on average. ^ This thesis provides insight into the functioning and the underlying aspects of multipulse injection in solenoid operated diesel fuel injectors. A scheme to correct this error is described which is proposed to work satisfactorily in steady state engine operating conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} of an ultraintense, 30 -fs laser pulse with a preformed plasma was investigated {{as a method}} of producing a beam of high-energy electrons. We used thin foil targets that are exploded by the laser amplified spontaneous emission <b>preceding</b> the main <b>pulse.</b> Optical diagnostics show that the main pulse interacts with a plasma whose density is well below the critical density. By varying the foil thickness, we were able to obtain a substantial emission of electrons in a narrow cone along the laser direction with a typical energy well above the laser ponderomotive potential. These results are explained in terms of wake-field acceleration...|$|R

40|$|We report signal {{enhancement}} schemes using fast amplitude modulated pulses for the one-dimensional (I D) nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) of spin- 5 / 2 nuclei under magic-angle spinning. Signal enhancement {{by a factor of}} around 2. 5 is observed when amplitude modulated <b>pulses</b> <b>precede</b> selective excitation of the central transition. This enhancement {{is a result of the}} redistribution of energy level populations through partial saturation of the satellite transitions. Results are shown for Al- 27 and O- 17. The gain in signal intensity is very useful for the observation of weak signals from low abundance quadrupolar nuclei. The scheme works for wide ranges of quadrupole interactions and rf powers.
