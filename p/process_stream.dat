40|$|Pinch Analysis, in the {{broadest}} sense, {{is concerned with the}} optimal use of resources (material or energy) in a multi-process system. Pinch Analysis based techniques have emerged for water systems over the past decade. A major assumption that has been made in applying these techniques is that a process system can be segregated into a set of <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> and a set of water streams. With this distinction in place, only the water streams are considered in the Pinch Analysis with the <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> represented implicitly. This approach has obvious limitations in situations where a clear distinction between <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> and water streams cannot be made. The chlor-alkali process {{is an example of a}} system in which the clear distinction between <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> and water streams cannot be made. Water is intrinsically involved in the process, serving as a carrier medium for raw materials and eventually becoming part of the products produced by the complex. Hydrochloric acid and caustic soda are reagents which are both used within and produced by the complex. These reagents are required by the process at a range of concentrations and the concentrated reagent is diluted to the required concentration...|$|R

40|$|Some {{independent}} plants {{making up}} a chemical or petrochemical site are linked by <b>process</b> <b>streams.</b> Linking <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> are, in general, cooled in up-plants and reheated in down-plants to satisfy <b>process</b> requirements. These <b>streams,</b> even more, travel from up-plants to storage tanks and, then, to down-plants, which results in low energy-use efficiency. Up-plants with multiple hot discharges and down-plants with multiple hot feeds are proposed in this paper, and a T-Q graphic method is presented to target the temperature of multiple hot discharges/feeds between plants. The T-Q diagram is composed of a grand composite curve (GCC) and a composite curve that only involves <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> employed for hot discharge/feed. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to minimize the total hot and cold utilities of up- and down-plants and to solve the temperature of hot discharge/feed and the heat transfer between plants.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 An {{evaporation}} {{system is}} a network of evaporators and heat exchangers which integrates an evaporation task with existing hot and cold <b>process</b> <b>streams.</b> This paper presents a systematic procedure for synthesizing evaporation systems which feature minimum utility use. A first result in this paper shows that if a minimum utility N + 1 - effect system does not contain the minimum utility N-effect system, it can be only marginally better. Given the feed and product temperatures, {{as well as the}} temperatures of the <b>process</b> <b>streams,</b> we use this insight to select the effect temperatures sequentially using a simple graphical procedure. A second set of results aids in the selection of the two most energy-efficient flowpatterns from among the N! possible in an N-effect system. A third set of results shows where to introduce evaporator bypass. An algorithm is also presented which results in an evaporation system with equal effect areas. We apply the proposed procedure to the design of a triple-effect evaporation system integrated with two <b>process</b> <b>streams.</b> The resulting minimum utility flowsheet requires 17 percent less steam than a more conventional triple-effect system design. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design of}} water based heat collection system for recovery of industrial excess heat. The focus in {{on the problem of}} finding the optimal combinations of excess heat sources minimizing heat exchanger network capital costs for different amounts of total recovered heat. A cost targeting approach based on vertical heat transfer between hot <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> and the heat collection medium in Pinch Analysis diagrams is used. The set of <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> where heat shall be recovered is found by solving an optimization problem where heat recovery is maximized while minimizing the capital costs simultaneously. A genetic algorithm based optimization tool is used. The analysis is conducted for three plants belonging to a chemical cluster. The results are compared with results from previous investigations in which the process excess heat sources were chosen based on their incremental heat contribution. The new approach presented in this work allows identifying a much larger set of solutions as well as considerably lower capital costs for similar amount of recovered heat in cases when <b>process</b> <b>streams</b> largely differ in terms of temperature levels and heat transfer properties...|$|R
