5|$|The Republic of Croatia is {{a unitary}} state using a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system</b> of governance. With the {{collapse}} of the ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia, Croatia organized its first multi-party elections and adopted its present constitution in 1990. It declared independence on 8 October 1991 which led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and countries international recognition by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system.</b> Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers.|$|E

40|$|We assume all <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> have {{political}} control over bureaucracy exercised {{in a similar}} manner. But the hierarchical chain of delegation we found in majoritarian democracies is not always common {{to the rest of}} parliamentary democracies (consensual ones). There are some important characteristics – such as the type of party systems, the number and strength of political parties, electoral system, and executive legislative relationships – that shape political control. The article explains why there is a stronger political control in majoritarian, bipartite <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> due to cabinet stability and somehow divided, and thus weaker, control in consensual <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
5|$|Nauru is a {{republic}} with a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system</b> of government. The president is both {{head of state}} and head of government. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years. The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.|$|E
5|$|South Africa has a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system</b> of government; the National Assembly {{consists}} of 400 members elected by proportional representation with a closed list approach.

The President of South Africa was chosen by the National Assembly after the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Council has been characterised by the rise in power of the Parliament, with which the Council has had to share its legislative powers. The Parliament has often provided opposition to the Council's wishes. This has in some cases led to clashes between both bodies with the Council's system of intergovernmentalism contradicting the developing <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system</b> and supranational principles.|$|E

40|$|Bipartisan {{bills are}} {{frequent}} in presidential systems, but they exist {{in virtually all}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems.</b> In fact, despite the predominance of governments in legislative agenda-setting in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> considerable shares of both introduced and successful bills are (co-) sponsored by individuals or party groups that belong to both {{the government and the}} opposition camp in parliament. Given the government–opposition divide in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> this requires explanation. In this paper, we seek to address the reasons for the introduction and passage of bipartisan bills in parliamentary democracies – bills that originate with government and opposition party actors. To answer this question in a comparative framework, we develop a simple model that links institutional and policy-related characteristics to the likelihood of a bipartisan sponsorship of bills. More specifically, we look at the effect of divided and minority government, heterogeneity of government coalitions, polarization of parliament and issue salience. Our statistical analysis uses original data for about 11, 000 bills in two <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> Belgium and Germany, 1986 – 2003...|$|R

40|$|The postwar deficit {{experiences}} of nine industrialized democracies are analyzed. The {{relative importance of}} three of the primary influences on a country's deficit which have been suggested in the literature: (1) the state of the country's economy, (2) the 'left - right' ideology of the party in power, and (3) the strength of the party in power (as advanced by Roubini and Sachs) are examined. The author also introduces and tests the importance of an additional potential influence based on institutional structure in which presidential, 'stable' parliamentary, and 'unstable' <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> are seen to provide different incentives regarding the deficit for key political actors. The arguments are tested on a pooled time-series cross-sectional data set involving two presidential systems (France and the United States), four relatively stable <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom), and three relatively unstable <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> (Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands). The findings include: (a) strong effects of the state of a nation's economy on its deficit; (b) little systematic relationship between the ideology of the party in power and its deficit; and (c) the observation that increased control of the government leads to lower deficits in unstable <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> but larger deficits in presidential <b>systems,</b> with stable <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> serving as an intermediate case. The findings are compared both with the author's theoretical refinement and with recent theoretical and empirical work by Roubini and Sachs. ...|$|R

Though they were opposed to such divisions, many Katangese leaders from the secession joined the new provincial governments.

5|$|One of Piłsudski's main goals was to {{transform}} the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system</b> into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of totalitarianism. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications — providing for a strong presidency — came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its Government in Exile {{through to the end}} of the war and beyond.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical examination {{of economic and}} institutional development. Utilizing a novel data set on American Indian tribal nations, we investigate how constitutional design affects economic development, while holding the broader legal and political environment fixed. Instrumental variables regressions, using {{the party of the}} US President {{at the time of the}} initial adoption of tribal constitutions as an instrument for constitutional design, indicate that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> (versus presidential) have a strong positive effect on economic development, while ordinary least squares regressions of current economic outcomes on <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> of government show no effects. Robustness checks suggest that the results are not explained by differences in other institutions or geographic characteristics. Additional results provide some suggestive evidence that the effects may operate through channels that are typically associated with <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems,</b> such as larger public employment, and more equitable income distribution...|$|R

5|$|A second Legislative Council {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 {{with the number of}} elected seats increased to nine. This {{election was}} again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>system.</b> The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E
50|$|In {{other states}} the {{legislature}} is dominant {{and the presidential}} role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany and India.

In <b>parliamentary</b> <b>systems</b> the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers.|$|R

The result holds for policy spaces of arbitrary finite dimension and a general class of preferences over the government agreements space.
