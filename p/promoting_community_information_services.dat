40|$|Abstract Public {{libraries}} {{are primarily}} established {{to meet the}} information needs of citizen at all levels. Obviously, one of such needs is health information. However, information poverty is so rampant in Nigeria consequent upon which people awareness about their health is low. This study therefore investigated health information literacy {{as a predictor of}} <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> utilization in public and national libraries in south western Nigeria. The descriptive research design was adopted. Simple random technique was used to distribute questionnaires to 40 respondents in each of 6 public and 4 national libraries in south western Nigeria. The total sample size was therefore 400. One questionnaire namely: Health <b>Information</b> Literacy and <b>Community</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> Utilization Questionnaire (HILCISUQ) (r = 0. 88) was used. Findings revealed that health information literacy (r = 0. 078) positively, and jointly predicted <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>service</b> utilization in public and national libraries of south western Nigeria. Besides, health information literacy was low (= 1. 57). It was recommended that citizens should be educated on the need to be literate in respect of health information...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} study {{undertaken}} into {{the way in which}} voluntary workers, untrained in information skills and working in <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> collect, organise and use the information they provide to assist clients needing it for their day-to-day survival. The study is placed in perspective through a survey of the literature relating to <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> This is supplemented by a study of documents relating to the Pretoria Citizens' Advice Bureau. Data was collected by means of participant observation at the Pretoria Citizens' Advice Bureau and interviews with voluntary workers in the Bureau. Analysis of the data was carried out according to the grounded theory approach. It was found that untrained volunteers creating information storage and retrieval tools for use by their fellow volunteers, work without a knowledge of information storage and retrieval theory. They tend to make ad hoc decisions and create tools that are not as user-friendly as they could be with some background in the theory of information science. On the other hand, volunteers searching for information make the same kind of demands of the information storage and retrieval system they use as do professional and scientific information users, in that they want direct access to as much relevant information as possible in one place. They want the information repackaged in a manner to suit their purpose. When under pressure, they are reluctant to consult multiple information storage and retrieval tools not within easy reach. The study culminates in a number of recommendations for the improvement of the service of the Pretoria Citizens' Advice Bureau in particular. Recommendations are also put forward for a centralised computerised database providing processed <b>information</b> to <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in South Africa.

Specifically, we suggest that people-centered smart territories can enhance community awareness by reminding people of placed-based history, heritage, current issues and discussions, and plans for the future in the community through a smart social grid of <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
