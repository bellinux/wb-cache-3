5000|$|Ajayan is {{a pioneer}} in the field of nanotechnology. His PhD work (1989) {{involved}} the characterisation of gold nanoparticles on oxide substrates and their phase instabilities. He was involved in the early development of carbon nanotubes. From 1991 onwards, at the NEC Fundamental Research Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan, he worked with Sumio Iijima and Thomas Ebbesen and published some of the early works in carbon nanotubes. During the past two decades he has published more than 400 papers on various aspects of carbon nanostructures, mostly on nanotubes and recently on graphene [...] and other layered materials such as boron nitride. Ajayanâ€™s research interests are broad, focusing on nanomaterials development for a variety of applications such as energy storage, composites, electronics and sensors. His publications have earned more than 68,000 citations on Google Scholar and a h-index of 120 until September 2015. He has to his credit, two Guinness World Records for creating the smallest brush and the darkest material. Ajayan's team created the darkest known material, a carpet of carbon nanotubes, that reflects only 0.045% of light. In August 2007, he was in the news for creating an energy storage device on a piece of paper, called the paper battery. In a brief interview with Discover Magazine, Ajayan stated he believes the paper battery will have many important future applications in industry and medicine. In 2012, Ajayan's group announced a <b>paint-on</b> battery design, which eventually can eliminate restrictions on the surfaces used for energy storage [...] More recently, Ajayan's group developed a green battery consists of environmentally friendly lithium-ion cathode, which can leads to the development of completely bio-friendly batteries Ajayan's research group is also focusing on the development of various materials for environmental applications and, last year the group developed a hybrid material capable of effectively removing contaminants from water by coating the sand with carbon. In 2012, Ajayan's group developed a macro-scale carbon nanotube sponge, in which nanotubes are covalently connected each other, and demonstrated its selective absorption of oil from oil-water mixture.|$|E
50|$|This {{installation}} {{method is}} by far the most labor-intensive. In addition, material cost is a function of the width of the grate used in the trench.There are three main reasons why this is labor-intensive: the outlet pipe position in the floor, the levelling of the trench grate in the floor, and integration of the waterproofing. If the outlet is not exactly in the centre, then the channel must be customized, increasing cost and time to construct.This can be overcome by the use of modular trench drain systems. These allow the drain pipe to be connected anywhere along the trench, giving the builder and plumber more freedom to place the services, reducing construction time and costs, particularly in high-rise situations where moving plumbing services can be nearly impossible. Achieving a curbless or hobless entrance for special needs access is more readily achieved with a modular system, as the levelling of the shower floor to the bathroom floor is inherently problematic with non-modular systems as they have no on-site adjustment.Waterproofing is possibly the most critical aspect of the bathroom when integrating a channel/trench drain. There are two ways to approach the waterproofing issue. First is to develop a proprietary method where the waterproofing and trench drain are a kit. Second is to separate the waterproofing and trench drain.The first method has the benefit of an 'all-in-one' solution, but the downside is cost and limitation of the system in varying applications, i.e. limited generally to bathroom application. The second method is generally safest as the waterproofing is completed using established proven methods that most building contractors are familiar with. A second benefit is when the waterproofing is a separate item all methods of waterproofing (cementeous, bitumized, fibreglassed, <b>paint-on,</b> sweat-on, lead-lined, copper pan etc.) can be utilized. This will allow a modular system to be used in many applications such as pools, balconies, thresholds, pedestrian areas, public areas, essentially most wet areas where a waterproofing system is required, be it on ground or above (suspended slab).Stainless steel trench drains can also be installed in a home's shower and in commercial locations like hospital rooms, changing rooms and operating rooms.|$|E

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} a facile "paint-on" approach to fabricate highly stretchable and highly sensitive strain sensors by combining one-dimensional copper nanowire networks with two-dimensional graphite microflakes. This <b>paint-on</b> approach {{allows for the}} fabrication of electronic skin (e-skin) patches which can directly replicate with high fidelity the human skin surface they are on, regardless of the topological complexity. This leads to high accuracy for detecting biometric signals for applications in personalised wearable sensors. The copper nanowires contribute to high stretchability and the graphite flakes offer high sensitivity, and their hybrid coating offers the advantages of both. To understand the topological effects on the sensing performance, we utilized fractal shaped elastomeric substrates and systematically compared their stretchability and sensitivity. We could achieve a high stretchability of up to 600 % and a maximum gauge factor of 3000. Our simple yet efficient <b>paint-on</b> approach enabled facile fine-tuning of sensitivity/stretchability simply by adjusting ratios of 1 D vs. 2 D materials in the hybrid coating, and the topological structural designs.

The good results obtained with this technique stimulated the flourishing of new products and techniques. Over-the-counter (OTC) bleaching products appeared as a low-cost alternative to bleach discolored teeth without dentist supervision. Different OTC products are available in supermarkets, drug stores or on the Internet, including rinses, <b>paint-on</b> brushes, toothpastes, chewing guns, dental floss, and whitening strips. There is lack of clinical evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these products, being most of the studies supported by the manufacturers'. Basically, toothpastes, chewing gums, and dental floss are removal agents of superficial stains. Rinses and <b>paint-on</b> brushes with low levels of hydrogen peroxide have some whitening effect, but without clinical relevance.

Studies of multi-layer microgel thin films were conducted primarily using atomic force microscopy (AFM), quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), each of which probed different aspects the film architecture {{as a function of}} pH of the environment around the film. Binary thin films were constructed by changing the ratios and composition of the microgels in solution to create multi-functional thin films for surface modification applications and were studied using AFM. The basic understanding of how these components create films at surfaces gives us insight into how the films perform and will allow for greater diversity without the guesswork.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of annual topical application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution, semi-annual topical application of SDF solution, and annual application of a flowable high fluoride-releasing glass ionomer in arresting active dentine caries in primary teeth. METHODS: A total of 212 children, aged 3 - 4 years, were randomly allocated {{to one of three}} groups for treatment of carious dentine cavities in their primary teeth: Gp 1 -annual application of SDF, Gp 2 -semi-annual application of SDF, and Gp 3 -annual application of glass ionomer. Follow-up examinations were carried out every six months to assess whether the treated caries lesions had become arrested. RESULTS: After 24 months, 181 (85 %) children remained in the study. The caries arrest rates were 79 %, 91 % and 82 % for Gp 1, Gp 2 and Gp 3, respectively (p= 0. 007). In the logistic regression model using GEE to adjust for clustering effect, higher caries arrest rates were found in lesions treated in Gp 2 (OR= 2. 98, p= 0. 007), those in anterior teeth (OR= 5. 55, p< 0. 001), and those in buccal/lingual smooth surfaces (OR= 15. 6, p= 0. 004). CONCLUSION: Annual application of either SDF solution or high fluoride-releasing glass ionomer can arrest active dentine caries. Increasing the frequency of application to every 6 months can increase the caries arrest rate of SDF application. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Arrest of active dentine caries in primary teeth by topical application of SDF solution can be enhanced by increasing the frequency of application from annually to every 6 months, whereas annual <b>paint-on</b> of a flowable glass ionomer can also arrest active dentine caries and may provide a more aesthetic outcome. postprin...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} a desensitizing agent (VivaSens) on efficacy of a <b>paint-on</b> bleaching agent (VivaStyle Paint On Plus). METHODS: Bleaching was performed for 7 days with VivaStyle Paint On Plus. The varnish was applied twice a day for 10 minutes each. 80 subjects were included in the study and randomly distributed in two groups (n = 40) according to exposed cervical dentin and perceived hypersensitivities. Group A used VivaStyle without VivaSens while Group B used VivaStyle Paint On Plus after a single application of VivaSens. Tooth color was assessed on facial surfaces of first upper incisors with Vita shade guide at baseline and 10 days after bleaching therapy. Sensitivity, with intensity graded from 0 (no sensitivity) to 10 (high sensitivity), was assessed chair-side using a blow of air at baseline, at the end of therapy (7 days) and 10 days after bleaching therapy. Statistical evaluation was performed with non parametric ANOVA. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects dropped out of the study; six due to gingival burning sensation (A: 3; B: 3) related to the bleaching regimen and seven due to lack of compliance. Directly after completion of bleaching therapy, tooth color had changed significantly compared to baseline in both treatment groups without difference among the groups. Color changes (Delta) according to Vita shade guide were as follows (mean +/- standard deviation) : Group A: Delta 2. 7 +/- 1. 0, Group B: Delta 2. 8 +/- 0. 9.

40|$|BACKGROUND: For many years, {{topical use}} of {{fluorides}} has gained greater popularity than systemic use of fluorides. A possible adverse effect {{associated with the}} use of topical fluoride is the development of dental fluorosis due to the ingestion of excessive fluoride by young children with developing teeth. OBJECTIVES: To describe the relationship between the use of topical fluorides in young children and the risk of developing dental fluorosis. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic search of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Dissertation Abstracts and LILACS/BBO. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched. Date of the most recent searches: 9 th March 09. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional surveys, in which fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels, foams, <b>paint-on</b> solutions, and varnishes were compared to an alternative fluoride treatment, placebo or no intervention group. Children under the age of 6 years at the time topical fluorides were used. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from all included studies were extracted by two review authors. Risk ratios for controlled, prospective studies and odds ratios for case-control studies or cross-sectional surveys were extracted or calculated. Where both adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios or odds ratios were presented, the adjusted value was included in the meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: 25 studies were included: 2 RCTs, 1 cohort study, 6 case-control studies and 16 cross-sectional surveys. Only one RCT was judged to be at low risk of bias. The other RCT and all observational studies were judged to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Studies were included in four intervention/exposure comparisons. A statistically significant reduction in fluorosis was found if brushing of a child's teeth with fluoride toothpaste commenced after the age of 12 months odds ratio 0. 70 (random-effects: 95 % confidence interval 0. 57 to 0. 88) (data from observational studies). Inconsistent statistically significant associations were found between starting using fluoride toothpaste/toothbrushing before or after the age of 24 months and fluorosis (data from observational studies). From the RCTs, use of higher level of fluoride was associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. No significant association between the frequency of toothbrushing or the amount of fluoride toothpaste used and fluorosis was found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. Most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. There is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. The evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. If the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm). More evidence with low risk of bias is needed. Future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. As it is unethical to propose RCTs to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. However, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies...|$|E
