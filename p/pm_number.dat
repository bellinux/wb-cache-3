40|$|In this study, the {{positive}} matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model (version  5. 0) {{was used to}} identify and quantify major sources contributing to particulate matter (<b>PM)</b> <b>number</b> concentrations, using <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> size distributions {{in the range of}} 13  nm to 10  µm combined with several auxiliary variables, including black carbon (BC), elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), PM mass concentrations, gaseous pollutants, meteorological, and traffic counts data, collected for about 9  months between August  2014 and 2015 in central Los Angeles, CA. Several parameters, including particle number and volume size distribution profiles, profiles of auxiliary variables, contributions of different factors in different seasons to the total number concentrations, diurnal variations of each of the resolved factors in the cold and warm phases, weekday/weekend analysis for each of the resolved factors, and correlation between auxiliary variables and the relative contribution of each of the resolved factors, were used to identify PM sources. A six-factor solution was identified as the optimum for the aforementioned input data. The resolved factors comprised nucleation, traffic  1, traffic 2 (with a larger mode diameter than traffic 1 factor), urban background aerosol, secondary aerosol, and soil/road dust. Traffic sources (1 and 2) were the major contributor to <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentrations, collectively making up to above 60  % (60. 8 – 68. 4  %) of the total number concentrations during the study period. Their contribution was also significantly higher in the cold phase compared to the warm phase. Nucleation was another major factor significantly contributing to the total number concentrations (an overall contribution of 17  %, ranging from 11. 7 to 24  %), with a larger contribution during the warm phase than in the cold phase. The other identified factors were urban background aerosol, secondary aerosol, and soil/road dust, with relative contributions of approximately 12  % (7. 4 – 17. 1), 2. 1  % (1. 5 – 2. 5  %), and 1. 1  % (0. 2 – 6. 3  %), respectively, overall accounting for about 15  % (15. 2 – 19. 8  %) of <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentrations. As expected, <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentrations were dominated by factors with smaller mode diameters, such as traffic and nucleation. On the other hand, PM volume and mass concentrations in the study area were mostly affected by sources with larger mode diameters, including secondary aerosols and soil/road dust.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the exhaust gas turbocharger on nano-scale Particulate Matter (<b>PM)</b> <b>number</b> emissions from a Gasoline Direct Injected (GDI) engine is investigated at fixed exhaust gas dilution ratio for a matrix of three engine speeds and four engine load operating points. Experimental repeatability is assessed {{by means of the}} Coefficient of Variation (CoV) from three independent measurements for every test point. A hypothesis test on the difference between total number count before and after the turbine shows that there are statistically relevant variations for most operating points. A reduction in PM total number count at low load is observed, and an increment at high load. It is conjectured that as fuel injection pressure and duration increase with load, a larger share of volatile particulate matter is produced, which then undergoes nucleation as the exhaust gas expands through the turbine. At the same time, the centrifugal action within the turbocharger is believed to promote particle agglomeration and growth, and fragmentation of micro-scale particles. Experiments with variable dilution ratio at a fixed engine test point show that changes in dilution ratio affect repeatability of the emissions measurements only marginally. Yet, a hypothesis test on the variation of total number count with dilution shows that <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> counts are systematically affected by changes in dilution ratio. Furthermore, a hypothesis test also shows that the impact of the turbocharger on total number emissions is statistically relevant regardless of the dilution ratio adopted...|$|E

DISI engines, however, produce more particulate matter (PM) emissions than Port Fuel Injected (PFI) engines. Forthcoming European exhaust emissions legislation is addressing concerns over {{health effects of}} PM emissions. Accordingly, research into PM emission formation has increased. A model developed by Aikawa et al. (2010) for PFI engines correlated <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> emissions with the vapour pressure and the double bond equivalent (DBE) {{of the components of}} the fuel. However there was no independent control of these parameters. This study investigates a particulate emissions index for DISI engines. A single-cylinder optical access Spray Guided DISI engine was used to develop a Particulate Matter Number emissions Index (PN index) - modified from the PM index using industry standard measurements - through the use of model and commercially available fuels. Model fuels were designed using Raoult's law and UNIFAC such that the DBE and vapour pressure of the fuel mix could be varied. Engine tests were conducted, independently varying the DBE and the vapour pressure of the fuel. <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> emissions were measured using a Cambustion DMS 500, the results were analysed alongside observations of the fuel spray to investigate the PN index.

40|$|Particulate Matter (PM) {{legislation}} for gasoline engines {{and the introduction}} of gasoline/ethanol blends, make it important to know the effect of fuel composition on PM emissions. Tests have been conducted with fuels of known composition in both a single cylinder engine and V 8 engine with a three-way catalyst. The V 8 engine used an unleaded gasoline (PURA) with known composition and distillation characteristics as a base fuel and with 10 % by volume ethanol. The single cylinder engine used a 65 % iso-octane - 35 % toluene mixture as its base fuel. The engines had essentially the same combustion system, with a centrally mounted 6 -hole spray-guided direct injection system. Particle size distributions were recorded and these have also been converted to mass distributions. Filter samples were taken for thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) to give composition information. Both engines were operated at 1500 rpm under part load. The tests with the single cylinder engine used lambda of 0. 9, 1. 0 and 1. 1 with an ignition timing sweep of 15 - 45 °bTDC. The trends with the stoichiometric and weak mixtures were less clear (the PM emissions being at low levels), but with lambda of 0. 9 the trends were clear. For the rich mixture, advancing the ignition timing increased both <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> and mass emissions, and the use of E 10 reduced the number emissions by a factor of 25 - 65 and the mass emissions by a factor of 2 - 10. The V 8 tests were at stoichiometric with injection timing sweeps during induction (120 to 360 °bTDC), with a reduction in both <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> and mass due to reactions in the catalyst. The earlier injection gave lower PM emissions and this was attributed to there being more time for mixture preparation, leading to a more homogeneous mixture. The addition of 10 % ethanol led to an increase in PM emissions (both in terms of mass and number). Copyright © 2010 SAE International...|$|E

The use of renewable fuels (biodiesel and butanol blend) and aftertreatment systems in diesel engines are the main requirements for reducing and controlling the pollutant emissions. To understand the effect of alternative fuels on PM characteristics and a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) biodiesel and an alcohol blend (butanol-diesel blend) were used for various engine operating conditions.

40|$|With the {{depletion}} of hydrocarbon fuels, the hydrogen-hydrocarbon combustion system provides a good solution for the transition period from a hydrocarbon-based energy sys- tem to a hydrogen-based energy system because of its desirable combustion characteristics and {{the low level of}} modification to current combustion systems. Though extensive re- search has been carried out to investigate the combustion process of hydrogen-hydrocarbon fuels, no experiments have been reported to study the Particulate Matter (PM) formations in hydrogen-hydrocarbon combustion systems. To measure the PM concentrations in a laminar diffusion flame, a new optical diagnostic technique, called Cone-Beam Tomographic Three Colour Spectrometry (CBT-TCS) has been developed to measure the spatially distributed temperature, soot diameter and soot volume fraction. This technique is based on the principle of three colour pyrometry, but uses a more rigorous light scattering model to calculate the soot diameter and soot volume fraction. The cone beam tomography technique has also been used to reconstruct the 3 D property fields from the 2 D flame images. The detailed theoretical principles, the exper- imental setup, the optical considerations, the reconstruction algorithm and the sensitivity analysis are all introduced. The CBT- TCS technique has been successfully applied to several laminar diffusion flames to study the PM formation. The temperature and soot volume fracction profiles measured by CBT- TCS for a ethylene laminar diffusion flame are consistent with the data reported by Snelling et al. [77]. The helium-ethylene-air flame tests show that adding helium reduces the PM formation (due to the dilution effect). The hydrogen-ethylene-air flame tests show that adding hydrogen is more effective in reducing the PM formation due to the combined effect of dilution and direct chemical reaction. A PM sampling system has also been de- veloped to verify the PM size distributions measured by CBT-TCS. The comparison results show that the CBT- TCS tends to overestimate the particle size. ' Several optical engine experiments have also been undertaken to investigate the effect of adding hydrogen on the PM emissions from a Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine. The hydrogen-ethylene engine tests show that adding hydrogen can reduce the PM emissions without sacrificing the power output. The hydrogen-base fuel (65 % isooctane and 35 % toluene) tests show that adding hydrogen can improve the combustion stability and reduce the PM emissions, especially at low load. Adding 5 % stoichiometric of hydrogen can reduce the total <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentration by 90 % for a stoichiometric mixture and 97 % for richer mixture at low load. At high load, adding 10 % stoichiometric of hydrogen can also reduce the total <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentration by 85 % for richer mixture but has little effect upon the stoichiometric mixture.

The effects of these parameters were studied for the filtration of different particle size ranges (10 – 30 nm, 30 – 200 nm and 200 – 400 nm).

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Determining {{particulate}} matter (PM) concentrations in ambient air is of major importance in applications of aerosol research; personal exposure assessments, industrial particle monitoring, and air quality studies. Optical particle counters (OPCs) measure the elastic light scattering of individual particles and provide time and size-resolved <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentrations. They are common {{due to their}} simplicity and low-cost. However, many of them suffer from non-monotonic size dependence of scattered light intensity and its variability with changing the complex refractive index (CRI) of particles. This weakness is particularly common in portable low-cost OPCs. This contribution describes the process of designing, validating, and testing an OPC for size measurements of aerosols. The proposed device is characterized by four main principles; low sensitivity to variations in the CRI of particles, accurate sizing, compactness, and low-cost. The design utilizes small form factor low-cost components (total cost < $ 100) and measures less than 45 x 25 x 15 mm (L, W, H) in size. An optimization methodology is defined and {{used to determine the}} optimal angular range for collection of scattered light. An adjustable experimental setup was used to validate the numerical findings and to test the performance of the optimized angular range in comparison to two equally sized angular ranges, commonly employed in OPCs. The experiments used six different spherical monodisperse particles of known size and CRI; PSL (n = 1. 61), alumina (n = 1. 78), and silica (n = 1. 53); 2 and 4 μm in diameter. The PSL particles were used for calibration before the device was exposed to particles with different CRIs. The experimental response was in good agreement with the numerical calculations overall. The average sizing error was 6. 87 % for the optimal angular range, compared to 32. 21 % and 25. 45 % for the alternatives. The results show clearly that the optimal angular range is effective in eliminating the ambiguity that is commonly present when OPCs are used in the field. The findings were consistent across the two sizes and all CRIs...|$|E
40|$|Direct fuel {{injection}} technology is increasingly being {{applied to the}} spark ignition internal combustion engine {{as one of the}} many actions required to reduce the CO 2 emissions from road transport. Whilst the potential for CO 2 reductions is compelling, the technology is not without disadvantages. Early examples typically emitted over an order of magnitude more Particulate Matter (PM) than vehicles with conventional spark ignition engines. Consequently, future revisions to European and North American exhaust emissions legislation are likely to regulate the particulate emissions from vehicles with direct injection gasoline engines. This thesis undertakes to investigate a) instrumentation capable of simultaneously resolving the number concentration and size distribution of particles in the 5 - 1000 nm size range and b) the factors affecting the PM emissions from spark ignition engines with direct {{fuel injection}}. The first objective is achieved by evaluation and comparison of a differential mobility spectrometer; photo-acoustic soot sensor; condensation particle counter and electrical low pressure impactor. To address the second question, a differential mobility spectrometer is applied to quantify the PM emissions from a number of direct injection gasoline engines, together with investigation of their dependence on various calibratable parameters, operating temperature and fuel composition. The differential mobility spectrometer showed good agreement with the other more established instruments tested. Moreover, it exhibited a faster time response and finer resolution in particle size. The number weighted size distribution of the PM emitted was typically lognormal with either one or two modes located between 20 and 100 nm. Chemical analysis of PM samples showed the presence of elemental carbon, volatile organic material and sulphates. Transient PM measurements enabled short time-scale events such as mode switching between homogeneous and stratified mixture preparation to be identified. <b>PM</b> <b>number</b> concentrations in stratified mode exceeded those in homogeneous mode by a factor of 10 - 100. Dynamometer based experiments showed that PM emissions increase for rich air fuel ratios, retarded fuel injection and advanced ignition events. They also demonstrated a strong dependence on fuel composition: the highest PM emissions were measured with an aromatic fuel, whereas blending alcohols such as methanol or ethanol tended to suppress PM emissions, particularly in the accumulation mode size range. These measurements are amongst the first of their kind and demonstrate the applicability of the differential mobility spectrometer to the measurement of ultra-fine particulate emissions from engines with direct fuel injection systems. Numerous explanations are put forward to describe the data obtained, together with suggestions for future work on PM control and abatement.
