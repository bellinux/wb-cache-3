Samples were taken with simple random sampling including 15 elderly people were in the control group and 16 elderly were on zinc supplementation group that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. A number of three elderly control taken group dropped out during the two-month study. Zinc supplementation of 40 mg was once daily after the morning meal. Statistical course analysis techniques used was Shapiro Wilk test followed by paired T test. Result: Zinc group hemoglobin levels increased significantly p = 0. 002 (p < 0. 005) but not in the control group p = 0667 (p≥ 0. 005). Conclusion: Zinc supplementation increases of hemoglobin levels significantly in the elderly. Keywords Elderly, zinc, hemoglobi...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to test the effectiveness of rational emotive behavioral counseling in reducing adolescent egocentrism. It uses a quantitative-qualitative (mix methods) approach with a quasi experimental research non equivalent pretest – <b>post</b> <b>test</b> <b>control</b> group design. (There are two groups of pretest – post test). The research is implemented in SMP N 3 Cimahi and {{the research}} subject are students of the second grade non randomized using purpose sampling technique. Assessment instruments in use are scale adolescent egocentrism. Based on data of the research the conclusion are: (1) Adolescent egocentrism profile in general is in the low level, but some of them is in the high level. (2) Intervention program formulation of rational emotive behavioral counseling group focused on reducing both aspects of egocentrism namely imaginary audience and personal fable. (3) The result of the test showed that intervention of rational emotive behavioral counseling group effectively reduces adolescent egocentrism. The research is as preventive measures that can be used by school counselor to be integrated into program of guidance and counseling and for the writer/the researcher, it {{can be used as a}} source to make the research related with REB counseling and also another appropriate intervension form in reducing adolescent egocentrism.

40|$|Some studies {{reported}} {{that many students}} faced serious difficulties on constructing mathematical proof. A <b>post</b> <b>test</b> <b>control</b> group design experiment was conducted to improve students’ mathematical proving abilities by using modified APOS (M-APOS) teaching method. The study involved 124 students of Real Analysis classes of a state university in Padang. Instruments of the study were: a proof ability test, and a Likert model self regulated learning scale. The data were analyzed by using two path ANOVA. The study found that: 1) attainment and gain on students’ reading proof ability and students’ proving ability of modified APOS class were classified as mediocre and better than students’ abilities of conventional class which classified as low; 2) students’ self regulated learning of M-APOS class was better than students’ self regulated learning of conventional class, {{and both of them}} were classified as medium. However ther was no difference between students’ gain on self regulated learning of both classess and they were classified as very low. There were not interaction between learning approach and department (mathematics and mathematics education) and between learning approach and mathematics prior knowledge on proof reading and proof construction abilities. There was association between proof reading ability and proof construction ability...|$|R
