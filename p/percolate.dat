5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to <b>percolate</b> down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

25|$|Impervious {{surfaces}} (roads, {{parking lots}} and sidewalks) are constructed during land development. During rain storms and other precipitation events, these surfaces (built from materials such as asphalt and concrete), along with rooftops, carry polluted stormwater to storm drains, instead of allowing the water to <b>percolate</b> through soil. This causes lowering of the water table (because groundwater recharge is lessened) and flooding since {{the amount of water}} that remains on the surface is greater. Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers and bays. This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.|$|E

25|$|In early October 1878, Tagore {{traveled}} to England {{with the intent}} of becoming a barrister. He first stayed for some months at a house that the Tagore family owned near Brighton and Hove, in Medina Villas; there, he attended a Brighton school (not, as has been claimed, Brighton College — his name does not appear in its admissions register). In 1877, his nephew and niece — Suren and Indira, the children of Tagore's brother Satyendranath — were sent together with their mother (Tagore's sister-in-law) to live with him. Later, after spending Christmas of 1878 with his family, Tagore was escorted by a friend of his elder brother to London; there, Tagore's relatives hoped that he would focus more on his studies. He enrolled at University College London. However, he never completed his degree, leaving England after staying just over a year. This exposure to English culture and language would later <b>percolate</b> into his earlier acquaintance with Bengali musical tradition, allowing him to create new modes of music, poetry, and drama. However, Tagore neither fully embraced English strictures nor his family's traditionally strict Hindu religious observances either in his life or his art, choosing instead to pick the best from both realms of experience.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{winemaking}} decisions where a producer's style {{can come}} through is {{the decision of}} whether or not to destem the grapes prior to crushing and fermentation. The presence of stems provide channels for the juice to <b>percolate</b> through the mass of grape skins that will form the cap during fermentation. This cap needs to be managed well and kept in constant contact with the juice in order to extract the color and phenolic compounds that will affect the flavor and aroma of the wine. While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine. The degree of tannin extraction desired will be up to the winemaker with some tannins adding to the mouthfeel and aging potential of the wine while too much can make the wine seem harsh, bitter and out of the balance. The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols. The temperature of fermentation will also affect the volatilizing of the compounds that contribute to the aroma of the wine.|$|E
25|$|The various geyser basins {{are located}} where {{rainwater}} and snowmelt can <b>percolate</b> into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt {{at the surface}} as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are {{where most of the}} large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199°F (93°C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204°F (95.5°C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls into hot springs.|$|E

Since consumption remains stable, most fluctuations in aggregate demand stem from investment, which is driven by many factors including expectations, [...] "animal spirits", and interest rates. Keynes argued that fiscal policy could compensate for this volatility. During downturns, government could increase spending to purchase excess goods and employ idle labor.

For this purpose, the antinociceptive effects of <b>percolated</b> and soxhlet extracts were evaluated in mice subjected to acute thermal (hot-plate) and persistent chemical (formalin) pain stimuli. Intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of the <b>percolated</b> extract evoked significant antinociceptive effects at a dose of 100 mg/kg {{in the second phase}} of formalin test. The maximum antinociceptive effect was induced by the dose of 300 mg/kg that was significant in both phases of formalin test. Dose of 400 mg/kg of the <b>percolated</b> extract induced acute adverse effects such as diarrhea, polyurea, malasia and hyperventilation in mice. Soxhlet extract of F. parviflora (300 mg/kg, i. p.) also showed significant effects in the both phases of formalin test.

Strong correlations between trimethyllead concentrations in throughfall and forest floor <b>percolates</b> suggested that trimethyllead in forest floor <b>percolates</b> originates largely from throughfall. The partition coefficients of trimethyllead and Pbtotal, estimated as ratios of concentrations in <b>percolates</b> to those in forest floors, ranged from 54 to 560 and 870 to 26, 400 L kg− 1, respectively, indicating that the mobility of trimethyllead was greater than Pbtotal The Pbtotal concentrations were low in throughfall and often the highest in Oa horizon <b>percolates</b> (15. 2 − 57. 5 μg L− 1).
