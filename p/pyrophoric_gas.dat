40|$|The use of {{hazardous}} gases on the University of Michigan campus has increased with growing research, {{especially in the}} areas of high-energy laser technology and other laboratory work. Individuals working with toxic, flammable or <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>gases</b> must be aware of potential hazards associated with them, and must be trained and proficient in methods to work with the gases in a safe manner. This is essential to safeguard both the individual as well as surrounding facility areas. A release of the gas can easily impact an entire facility as it is carried through the ventilation systems. SCOPE: This Guideline applies to all UM researchers and employees who use a hazardous production material (HPM) gas that is toxic, flammable or pyrophoric. This Guideline does not apply to the use of liquefied (cryogenic) gases. OSEH management may grant exemptions to smallscale operations or low concentrations of HPM gas. Contact OSEH for an evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|Reactivity hazards are {{assessed}} using the OSHA criterion of physical hazard. Seven such hazard classes are recognized:Water Reactives, Organic Peroxides, Explosives, Compressed <b>gases,</b> <b>Pyrophoric</b> materials, Oxidizers, and Unstable Reactives.|$|R
50|$|A gorbel {{appears as}} a red globe of transulcent, thin rubbery material, with six tiny red eyes on short, {{retractable}} eyestalks equally spaced {{around the top of}} its spherical body, and two short, clawed legs on its underside. When its hide is pierced or slashed, its balloon-like body bursts, releasing a cloud of <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>gas</b> which explodes. A gorbel can also explode if damaged by magic spells, or if it is within the blast range of another exploding gorbel.|$|E
5000|$|Silane, SiH4, is a <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>gas</b> with {{a similar}} {{tetrahedral}} structure to methane, CH4. When pure, it does not react with pure water or dilute acids; however, even small amounts of alkali impurities from the laboratory glass {{can result in a}} rapid hydrolysis. There is a range of catenated silicon hydrides that form a homologous series of compounds, [...] where n = 2-8 (analogous to the alkanes). These are all readily hydrolyzed and are thermally unstable, particularly the heavier members.|$|E
40|$|The Microelectronics Development Laboratory (MDL) {{contains}} 3, 000 m{sup 2 }, Which includes 1, 000 m{sup 2 }of Class I {{clean room}} space. There are 20 laminar flow Class I clean room bays. The MDL supplies several, full-flow process technologies which produce complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) integrated circuits using 150 nun diameter silicon wafers. All gases, chemicals and physical hazards used in the fabrication processes are controlled to levels well below regulatory requirements. Facility engineering controls in the MDL include toxic and <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>gas</b> monitoring, interlocks, ventilation, substitution and chemical segregation. Toxic and pyrophoric gases are monitored continuously inside processing tools as well as through the exhaust lines, gas cabinets, the valve boxes, and in general work areas. The toxic gas monitoring systems are interlocked to gas shutoff valves and have both low and high level alarms. In-use process gases are stored in exhausted cabinets. All chemicals and gases are segregated by chemical type. The processes are organized into eight sector areas that consist of photolithography, wet processes, dry etch, ion implant, metals, diffusion, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical mechanical polishing (CW). Each morning, engineering, safety and facilities personnel meet to review the equipment and wafer lot status and discuss processing issues. Hazards are assessed in the MDL with periodic walkthroughs, continuous toxic and <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>gas</b> monitoring and personal monitoring. All chemicals and gases proposed for use in the MDL are reviewed by the industrial hygienist and must be approved by a manager before they are purchased. All new equipment and processes are reviewed by a hazard and barrier committee and cannot be used in the MDL without the committee`s approval and an IH hazard assessment. Overall risk of operating the MDL has been reduced to a level that is as low as reasonable achievable for this research facility...|$|E
50|$|The {{other group}} 14 {{elements}} {{have a lower}} tendency to catenate. Silanes SinH2n+2 are known for n = 1-8 (thermal stability decreasing as n increases), as are cyclosilanes Si5H10 and Si6H12. They are very reactive, <b>pyrophoric</b> colourless <b>gases</b> or volatile liquids. Their volatility is intermediate between the alkanes and the germanes. Unsaturated silanes, the silenes and silynes, have been characterized spectroscopically. The first members of each respectively are disilene and disilyne, the silicon analogues of ethylene and acetylene). The first five germanes GenH2n+2 are known and are fairly similar to the silanes. Stannane, a strong reducing agent slowly decomposes at room temperature to tin and hydrogen gas, and is decomposed by concentrated aqueous acids or alkalis; distannane, Sn2H6 is still more unstable, and longer stannanes are unknown. Plumbane is very poorly characterised and is only known in trace amounts: even at low temperatures, synthesis methods that yield the other MH4 compounds fail to give PbH4. No other plumbanes are known.|$|R
40|$|Pyrophoric {{reagents}} {{represent an}} important class of reactants {{because they can}} participate in {{many different types of}} reactions. They are very useful in organic synthesis and in industrial applications. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) define Pyrophorics as substances that will self-ignite in air at temperatures of 130 F (54. 4 C) or less. However, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses criteria different from the auto-ignition temperature criterion. The DOT defines a pyrophoric material as a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency has adopted the DOT definition. Regardless of which definition is used, oxidation of the pyrophoric reagents by oxygen or exothermic reactions with moisture in the air (resulting in the generation of a flammable gas such as hydrogen) is so rapid that ignition occurs spontaneously. Due to the inherent nature of pyrophoric substances to ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, special precautions must be taken to ensure their safe handling and use. <b>Pyrophoric</b> <b>gases</b> (such as diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, etc.) are typically the easiest class of pyrophoric substances to handle since the gas can be plumbed directly to the application and used remotely. Pyrophoric solids and liquids, however, require the user to physically manipulate them when transferring them from one container to another. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could result in serious injury or unintended consequences to laboratory personnel. Because of this danger, pyrophorics should be handled only by experienced personnel. Users with limited experience must be trained on how to handle pyrophoric reagents and consult with a knowledgeable staff member prior to performing the experimental task. The {{purpose of this article is}} three fold: (1) to provide guidelines and general safety precautions to avoid accidents, (2) describe proper techniques on how to successfully handle, store, and dispose of pyrophoric liquids and solids, and (3) illustrate best practices for working with this class of reactants in a laboratory environment...|$|R
