He also cites Andrew Baterina from SoReal Cru; Movement Lifestyle's members Keone Madrid, Lyle Beniga, and Shaun Evaristo; Ian Eastwood; and Twitch. Park is also inspired by Taiwanese-American NBA player Jeremy Lin, saying that Lin [...] "was off the radar and now he’s {{playing with the}} best of the best. People can’t hate on him even though they want to because he’s so good. That’s how a K-pop star has to be over in America if they want to succeed.

500|$|Rosas {{failed to}} realize that discontent was {{steadily}} growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at {{his right hand and}} became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: [...] "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> him; he goes in constant fear and always has one eye on the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the door of his office day and night".|$|E

What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> him, some people love him, but I do think he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{components}} of Hazlitt's style begin to take shape in these Round Table essays. Some of his [...] "paradoxes" [...] are so hyperbolic as to shock when encountered out of context: [...] "All country <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> each other", for example, from the second part of [...] "On Mr. Wordsworth's Excursion". He interweaves quotations from literature old and new, helping drive his points home with concentrated allusiveness and wielded extraordinarily efficiently as a critical instrument. Yet, although his use of quotations is (as many critics have felt) as fine as any author's has ever been, all too often he gets the quotes wrong. In one of his essays on Wordsworth he misquotes Wordsworth himself: ...|$|E
2500|$|Commercially, {{the band}} {{was one of the}} most [...] {{successful}} rock bands of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their first three studio albums, My Own Prison, Human Clay, and Weathered, have all gone multi-platinum in the United States, selling 6 million, 11 million, and 6 million copies respectively. The band also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song [...] "With Arms Wide Open" [...] in 2001. However, in spite of this enormous commercial success, Creed was poorly received by professional critics, such as Robert Christgau, among others. [...] Jonah Weiner of Slate has tried to make the case that {{the band was}} [...] "seriously underrated," [...] "most <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> Creed’s combination of overwrought power-balladry and Christian-infused testosterone."

2500|$|Beatles guitarist George Harrison {{described}} {{the song in}} 1969 as [...] "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some <b>people</b> <b>hate,</b> and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." [...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out {{at that time in}} my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens." ...|$|E

In Spain it is different, some <b>people</b> <b>hate</b> me, many of you in this [...] room." [...] Mourinho's fraught relationships with Sergio Ramos and club captain Iker Casillas (a popular player whom Mourinho sidelined in 2013) caused divisions between fans in the [...] "Mourinhistas" [...] and [...] "Madridistas" [...] (the more traditional Real Madrid fans) camps. His relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo became difficult because, according to Mourinho, the player [...] "maybe thinks that he knows everything and that the coach cannot improve him anymore", so was unwilling to accept constructive criticism. Mourinho was also criticised for controversial incidents, including poking Tito Vilanova (then assistant coach at Barcelona) in the eye during a brawl, continual complaints about refereeing bias, clashes with journalists and Real officials, and frequent hints that Barça received favourable treatment from UEFA.|$|E
