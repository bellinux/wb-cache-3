25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Moran first won {{election}} to the United States House of Representatives, defeating five-term Republican incumbent Stan Parris. During the campaign, Parris, referring {{to the issue of}} the Gulf War, said, [...] "The only three <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who support Saddam Hussein's position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat, and Jim Moran." [...] Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was [...] "a deceitful, fatuous jerk", and that he wanted [...] "to break his nose". Moran's well-financed campaign also focused on Parris' opposition to abortion. Moran upset Parris, winning by 7.1 percent. He was sworn into office in January 1991.|$|E

500|$|He {{played a}} {{publicist}} in <b>People</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know,</b> a small film that received little attention despite Pacino's well-received performance. Rarely taking {{a supporting role}} since his commercial breakthrough, he accepted a small part in the box office flop Gigli, in 2003, {{as a favor to}} director Martin Brest. The Recruit, released in 2003, featured Pacino as a CIA recruiter and co-stars Colin Farrell. The film received mixed reviews, and has been described by Pacino as something he [...] "personally couldn't follow". Pacino next starred as lawyer Roy Cohn in the 2003 HBO miniseries Angels in America, an adaptation of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name. For this performance, Pacino won his third Golden Globe, for Best Performance by an Actor, in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{versions}} of The Sumer Game were created. Jerry Pournelle recalled in 1989 that [...] "half the <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> wrote a Hammurabi program {{back in the}} 1970s; for many, {{it was the first}} program they'd ever written in their lives". The 1973 DECUS catalog additionally lists a French-language version by Belgians J. F. Champarnaud and F. H. Bostem for the FOCAL-69 version of the language, and a 1978 catalog adds Ruben by James R. B. Howard II and Jimmie B. Fletcher, [...] "a modification of the [...] "King of Sumeria" [...] game" [...] with additional features. The French version of the game, however, despite being listed as [...] "Sumer (French)", described itself not as a translation of the original game, but as a translation of [...] "Hamurabi (The Sumer Game)", due to another version of the game which was already released by then.|$|E
500|$|Zach Gilford {{said about}} his {{character}} Matt Saracen that [...] "there are {{different parts of}} it from <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> growing up or people I'm tight with now". He credited Peter Berg with {{coming up with the}} Saracen character, and said he was grateful to [...] "have some of the most realistic and heartfelt storylines." [...] When asked which of the actors would have been drafted highest by the NFL, he replied [...] "Probably Taylor [...] He's a good athlete, but Scott will kill me for saying that. Scott played football growing up and he has a good arm, but Taylor is faster and I think that would help his draft status." [...] Gaius Charles, who plays [...] "Smash" [...] Williams, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005, determined to find a job within a year, which he did with Friday Night Lights. He describes himself as [...] "all right" [...] at football, but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months or so. He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> so much more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than I was three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E
500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. [...] For instance, in the episode [...] "House Fancy", television personality Alton Brown guest starred as the character of Nicholas Whithers, the host and judge of a show of the same name. In an interview, Brown described the work as [...] "a blast." [...] He said [...] "I {{came up with this}} voice that didn't sound anything like me. I channeled this very strange person. Only three <b>people</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> figured out it was even me when they saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show. The episode was also guest starred by musician and The Monkees' Davy Jones who starred in the episode as himself, appearing {{at the bottom of the}} sea with his locker, and Bruce Brown providing vocal cameo as the episode's narrator. Brian Doyle-Murray also reprised his role as the Flying Dutchman for the episode. In [...] "The Card", Ernest Borgnine returned, reprising his role as Mermaid Man. Borgnine later reappeared in the episodes [...] "Ditchin'" [...] and [...] "Shuffleboarding", voicing his recurring role, with Tim Conway as Barnacle Boy. In [...] "Dear Vikings", English actor Ian McShane voiced Gordon, the leader of the large group of Vikings outside of Bikini Bottom. Dennis Quaid also appeared in the [...] "Grandpappy the Pirate" [...] as Grandpa Redbeard, Mr. Krabs' grandfather. Furthermore, Dee Snider, the frontman of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, guest starred in [...] "Shell Shocked" [...] as Angry Jack. Snider said [...] "I knew they must be fans [...] because in the SpongeBob movie, they took my song 'I Wanna Rock' and changed it to 'Goofy Goober Rock.' I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, and looked forward to watching the episode with her. Beckham recorded the voice-over in late-2008 in a day, and claimed that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to provide the vocal cameo. Other guests in the episode included Seinfeld actor John O'Hurley as King Neptune and Skid Row heavy metal vocalist Sebastian Bach as the voice of Triton.|$|E
