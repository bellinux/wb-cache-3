500|$|... he Liberty Bell is {{the most}} venerated object in the park, a {{national}} icon. It is not as beautiful as some other things that were in Independence Hall in those momentous days two hundred years ago, and it is irreparably damaged. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of its almost mystical appeal. Like our democracy it is fragile and imperfect, but it has weathered threats, and it has endured.|$|E
2500|$|If its {{interest}} is linked only to amnesty and compensation, {{then it will}} have chosen not truth, but justice. If it sees truth as the widest possible compilation of people's perceptions, stories, myths and experiences, it will have chosen to restore memory and foster a new humanity, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> justice in its deepest sense.|$|E
60|$|ALICE (with an archness {{for which}} the cake <b>is</b> responsible). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the lady's fault.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{invented by}} man {{to appeal to}} man's superstition and weakness. Of the remainder--who can say?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilks smiled; then, feeling <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{not quite}} {{the right thing to}} do, looked serious again.|$|R
2500|$|... "Y is almighty" [...] {{means that}} Y {{is not just}} more {{powerful}} than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully. In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, Anselm of Canterbury {{seems to think that}} almightiness {{is one of the things}} that make God count as omnipotent.|$|E
2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... Sometimes when you just take animals and do nothing else, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not as strong a message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{certainly}} not been paying me compliments. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the reason that}} I don't believe anything he has told me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> God's mercy to him; God's way {{of remembering}} him again, and {{bringing}} {{him back to}} him. <b>Perhaps</b> too <b>that</b> same <b>is</b> God's way of bringing back many a man in our own days who has wandered from him in success and prosperity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too old an' tough, Fox," [...] {{explained}} the hunter to the anxious dog. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not all Wade's motive in sparing him.|$|R
6000|$|Leland laughed softly. [...] "Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the reason, though I would sooner {{believe it}} was because I {{recognised}} what I owed the State." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{your own}} breakfast," [...] he said. [...] "No, I {{have had enough}} without payment. A {{thousand}} thanks, my gentle one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that is how}} he whom we call Cat {{escaped from}} the Fung; or <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> how he {{communicates}} with them as a spy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The poet {{has given}} a satiric meaning to the last word but one in [...] those lines; <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why they flashed so readily to the mind.|$|E
60|$|It {{came into}} Melville's {{head for a}} moment that this girl had {{something}} in her, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just a little beyond his former judgments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; I {{paved the}} way <b>perhaps.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> only justice. Did she think <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> going to hit me and that she wasn't to be hit in return?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to his {{obituary}} in The Independent, his [...] "relentless machismo {{seemed out}} of place in a man who was actually quite small – though <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> where the aggression originated".|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] {{said his}} father, leaning toward a candle and {{lighting}} his cigar, [...] "although <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hardly {{the way to}} speak of a married woman." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why I {{never saw}} the old beech {{partridge}} drink from the brook. Nature has a fresher draught, of her own distilling, that is more to his tasting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Afterwards, <b>perhaps.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> if one struggles through. There is, however, one learns by experience, {{really very}} little {{satisfaction}} at the time, especially if one scarcely gets beyond the start at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marcus?" [...] she answered; [...] "is he here? I did {{not know}} it. Well, I saw a man run from the tower, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> he. Be swift and you may catch him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I'm in bed, reading. Good night, Uncle," [...] {{instantly}} replied Sally, so {{calmly and}} naturally that I {{marveled at the}} difference between man and woman. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the difference between love and hate.|$|R
60|$|I am {{not enough}} read in Puritan divinity {{to know the}} {{particular}} objections to the surplice, {{over and above the}} general prejudice against the retenta of Popery. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the only ground,--a foolish one enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there {{anything}} you can do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Anything useful, I mean? But <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a foolish question, seeing that women--especially those who are well-favoured--do not learn a trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is my dream. The {{very thing}} I wished and managed so vilely. If Lovedy were alive! Though <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not {{the thing to}} wish. But I can't bear taking your--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Van Teyl," [...] he declared, [...] "you {{are quite}} a {{wonderful}} person. I have never believed very much in women before. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the reason why I have never married." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it. Mr. Brumley {{could not}} tell, {{and he spent}} some days in that state of perplexity which, like the weariness that heralds a cold, marks so often the onset of {{a new series of}} ideas....|$|R
6000|$|It is to <b>be</b> feared <b>that</b> John Milton <b>was</b> {{following}} the animated lips and {{eyes of the}} fair speaker rather than her story. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the reason why he said, [...] "May he {{not have been a}} disappointed man?" ...|$|R
5000|$|George Bryan Elizabethan actor {{with the}} Lord Chamberlain's Men, {{who seems to}} have become a regular Groom of the Chamber on his {{retirement}} from the stage - or <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just a way of giving him a pension.|$|R
60|$|THE RETIARIUS. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why I did it, Caesar. He bet me ten sesterces that {{he would}} vanquish me. If I had had to kill him I should {{not have had the}} money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I wish I did not?" [...] {{she said}} helplessly. [...] "I don't know. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what I do wish. Ah, {{but what are}} wishes! I know now that they don't matter at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To some extent, <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so," [...] Stannard agreed. [...] "That {{somebody}} must pull Jimmy {{against the}} rock was obvious. All the same, I knew the stones wouldn't bother us after it got cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{considerable}} indeed," [...] said Poppins. [...] "He {{seems to}} me to nobble everything. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the old school. The young school ain't so very different in <b>that</b> respect;--only, <b>perhaps,</b> there isn't so much for them to nobble." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her cheerfulness was {{a continual}} {{surprise}} to him. [...] "You bear up wonderfully well yourself," [...] he sometimes said to her, almost reproachfully, {{and she never}} replied <b>that,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> one of her ways of trying to help him.|$|R
60|$|Tessa set up her {{shoulders}} and bit her lip, looking at Baldassarre as if this betrayal of secrets must have an exciting effect on him too. But he seemed not to care much; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{in the nature of}} strangers.|$|R
