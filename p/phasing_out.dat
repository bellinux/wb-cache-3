5|$|Consequently, {{questions}} of dissolving the organization arose. Pakistan withdrew in 1972, after East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh on 26 March 1971. France withdrew financial support in 1975, and the SEATO council {{agreed to the}} <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> of the organization. After a final exercise on 20 February 1976, the organization was formally dissolved on 30 June 1977.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals {{are superior to}} lead {{in some of these}} aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> for some uses.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and did not serve in France until after the November 11 armistice ended the fighting, when he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between {{the two world wars}} he was a staunch advocate of mechanization {{at a time when the}} idea of <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|In February {{following}} the reassertion {{of the central}} government's authority in Katanga, the UN began <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> its peacekeeping force, {{with the goal of}} completing a total withdrawal {{by the end of the}} year. At the government's request, the UN authorised a six-month extension to ONUC's deployment, albeit with a reduced number of personnel. The last troops left the Congo on 30 June 1964. The civilian aid mission remained longer to provide technical assistance to the government.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harriers {{operated}} from INS Viraat for {{the last}} time on 6 March 2016. On 11 May 2016, a ceremony was held at INS Hansa, Dabolim, Goa to commemorate the <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> of Sea Harriers from INAS 300 ("White Tigers"). Sea Harriers and MiG 29Ks performed an air display at the ceremony, marking the final flight of the Sea Harriers in the Indian Navy. INAS 300 subsequently introduced MiG 29K/Kub fighters to replace the retired Sea Harrier fleet.|$|E

5|$|Among Jones' other accomplishments {{were the}} passage of a {{mandatory}} seat belt law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state's largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} at West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked with was Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> of two-stroke engines.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} began <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> the Mirage in July 1986, {{and took}} delivery {{of its first}} Hornet on 29June 1987. It had come {{under the control of}} a newly re-formed No.81 Wing that February. No.77 Squadron's last Mirage departed Williamtown on 27November 1987. Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No.481 Wing, which had evolved from No.481 Squadron. One of No.77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near Rockhampton, Queensland, on 19May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a defence scientist. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over Halifax Bay in Far North Queensland, when four of its Hornets—refuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a Boeing 707 tanker—became the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop aerial mines. No.481 Wing was reorganised as No.402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its functions to No.81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.|$|E
5|$|When {{facilities}} {{reached their}} maximum capacity, {{the need for}} upgrades became necessary for the airport to continue to grow. A proposal for runway expansion as well as facilities upgrades was developed in 1975, but was subsequently put on hold while a new regional airport was being studied to serve both Roanoke and all of Southwest Virginia. During this time airline deregulation was put in place, and combined with the airport's aging facilities and the <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> of turbo prop aircraft in favor of jet aircraft by the airlines, the airport's outdated infrastructure and deteriorating condition resulted in a decline {{of service to the}} airport. In order to allow for larger, jet aircraft to land, a runway expansion began in the early 1980s. With the runway extension underway, the airport officially changed its name from Roanoke Municipal Airport to Roanoke Regional Airport in 1983. The runway expansion project was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the Eurocheque {{system was}} <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> and {{replaced}} with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. At that time, {{a number of countries}} took the opportunity to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.|$|R

50|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an {{international}} agreement that seeks to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> chemicals that damage the ozone layer. The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992. The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to phase-out chlorofluorocarbons by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> this chemical. Other chemicals that it wanted to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> were halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and methyl bromide.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of Brittany, Francis I of France secured the Union of Brittany and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1536, the Duchy of Brittany passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the Breton Estates and Parlement of Brittany continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. Breton nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional Breton folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of Breton nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate to distort the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic Breton social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> minority languages. Early Breton nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused on issues such as the preservation of the Breton language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the Breton language had embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E
