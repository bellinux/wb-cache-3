Therefore the present study was designed to assess the antioxidant status of HIV infected <b>participants</b> with or without tuberculosis co-infections and in HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> infected with tuberculosis. 193 <b>participants</b> were randomly recruited for the study and grouped into: (i) Symptomatic HIV infected <b>participants</b> with tuberculosis co-infections (n = 67) (ii) symptomatic HIV infected <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis (n = 45) (iii) HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> with Tuberculosis (n = 52) and (IV) HIV seronegative control <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis (n = 29). Blood samples collected from the <b>participants</b> were used for HIV screening, CD 4 +T cell count, glutathione reductase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, Total Antioxidant Status and albumin estimations. The results showed that glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and Total Antioxidant Status were significantly lowered in both HIV infected <b>participants</b> with or without tuberculosis and HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> with tuberculosis (P< 0. 01), compared (in each case) with HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis. The CD 4 +T cell count were significantly low in HIV infected <b>participants</b> with tuberculosis co-infections and HIV infected group without tuberculosis when compared with HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> with or without tuberculosis. However the CD 4 +T cell count in HIV infected <b>participants</b> with tuberculosis was not significantly different when compared with HIV infected <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis. The serum albumin were lowered in HIV infected <b>participants</b> with tuberculosis and tuberculosis infected <b>participants</b> (P< 0. 01 in each case). Correlation studies amongst groups showed significant correlation between CD 4 +T cell count and antioxidants in both HIV and tuberculosis co-infected <b>participants</b> and in HIV infected <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis (P< 0. 01 in each case). Serum albumin correlated positively with the antioxidants in both HIV infected <b>participants</b> and those co-infected with tuberculosis. There was no significant correlation between CD 4 +T cell count and the antioxidants in HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> with or without tuberculosis. The study observed alterations in the levels of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant status and albumin in tuberculosis infected <b>participants</b> and in HIV infected <b>participants</b> with and without tuberculosis. This could be as a result of greater utilization of antioxidants subsequent to increased oxidative stress. These findings also further support a link between oxidative stress, tuberculosis and HIV infection...|$|R
