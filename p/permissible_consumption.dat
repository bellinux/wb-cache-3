The requirement to invoke Allah's name is a must. In other words, the word ṭaʻām refers to [...] meat; i.e., the meat prepared after the slaughter of an animal by cutting the throat (i.e., the jugular vein, the carotid arteries, and the trachea) and during slaughter Allâh's name is invoked (Ibn ʻAbbās, Mujāhid, ʻIkrimahall quoted by Ṭabarī, Ibn Kathīr).|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of irrigation water use in HayraboluIrrigation Scheme, established in 1987 and transferred to irrigation cooperative. The study was completed intwo years in order to minimize the meteorological and environmental effects on evapotranspiration andirrigation water requirement. Irrigation application efficiency and sufficiency of farmer irrigation applicationwere investigated at 20 different farmers’ fields. Pressurized irrigation was prevailed (51 %) and irrigation efficiency for sprinkler and surfaceirrigation methods were 61 and 62 %, respectively. Irrigation water losses on the scheme basis was 11, 91 %. It was further determined that farmers irrigated their crops according to the phonological observation, did nottake the <b>permissible</b> <b>consumption</b> level of water content and applied insufficient water to satisfy the fieldcapacity. Among the predominantly grown crops, wheat and sunflower were not irrigated assuming that theprecipitation was sufficient to meet their demand while onion and corn were under-supplied. Generally, aneffective irrigation programme was not realised...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{leading cause}} of death for young people in {{developed}} countries is road traffic crashes, a large proportion of which are attributable to drink-driving. The aims of the study were to estimate the prevalence of drink-driving and drink-riding in a sample of New Zealand university students, and to identify potential risk factors, in particular, students' perceptions of legally <b>permissible</b> <b>consumption</b> before driving. Methods. Participants were 1, 564 survey respondents (82 % response, mean age = 20. 5 years) who were asked to indicate whether they had driven after having "perhaps too much to drink to be able to drive safely," if they had been a passenger in a vehicle "where the driver had perhaps too much to drink to be able to drive safely," and how many standard drinks they could consume in one hour and legally drive a car. An estimated blood alcohol concentration was computed and compared with legal limits. Results. Drink-driving (past four weeks) was reported by 3. 4 % of women and 8. 4 % of men. Drink-riding (past four weeks) was reported by 7. 0 % of women and 11. 5 % of men. Estimated blood alcohol concentrations from students' reports of how much they could drink in one hour and be below the legal limit of 0. 08 g/ml, showed that most respondents dramatically underestimated permissible consumption; only 5. 8 % overestimated it. Conclusions. This may be a case where misperception of a public health message serves the public good. Further reductions in drink-driving/riding will require attention to transport needs, more visible enforcement of existing legislation, and modification of youth drinking behavior...|$|E

Some have extended menus where local breakfast, lunch and dinner meals are served. To tap into the sizeable Muslim market, these kopitiams usually serve food that is halal (<b>permissible</b> for <b>consumption</b> by Muslims) unlike the traditional shophouse kopitiams.|$|R
50|$|The Talmud, Pesachim 35a, {{states that}} liquid food {{extracts}} do not cause flour to leaven {{the way that}} water does. According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would {{not need to be}} treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The Tosafot (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour if they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely <b>permissible</b> for <b>consumption</b> during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.|$|R

40|$|This paper shows a {{mathematical}} model, which assists {{in finding a}} notion representing interactions between {{the elements of the}} cable system. This approach allows to find influence of the load-bearing element stiffness on any of the optimized parameters – the allowable deflection, <b>permissible</b> stress, <b>consumption</b> of materials, structural reliability index. The proposed analytical method gives reasonable initial assumptions about the optimal cable stayed bridge geometry, as well as predictions about the influence of the individual element stiffness on the overall structural behavior. Method presented in this paper shows mathematical and graphical correlation between tension forces in cables and fluctuations of stresses in stiffening girder due to variable loads. Study of uncertainties of variable loads allows to find the influence of stiffness and geometry of cables on structural reliability of stiffening girder, cables and whole construction of the bridge. The optimal lifespan of main elements can be find...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the holiday}} of Passover, Jews are {{forbidden}} to eat any of five grains specified in the Talmud — wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye — {{if they have been}} [...] "leavened." [...] Leavening (חמוץ, chimutz) is defined as flour of one of these grains combined with water and allowed to sit for more than 18 minutes before being baked. Once flour has been reacted with water and rapidly baked into matzo, it is no longer subject to leavening. According to this argument, matzo and its derivatives are neither [...] "leavened" [...] nor [...] "leavenable" [...] and therefore are <b>permissible</b> for <b>consumption</b> during Passover. A reading of the tractate Pesahim from the Babylonian Talmud (c. 500) makes it clear that in Talmudic times, matzo soaked in water was permitted during Passover; the Ashkenazi rabbi and exegete, Rashi (c. 1100), also indicates that this was unobjectionable (Berachot 38b).|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the levels of some heavy metals [Lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), Nickel (Ni), Mercury (Hg), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd), Aluminium (Al) and Chromium (Cr) ] and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in six brands of instant noodles (CFN, GFC, NGP, GAA, CUN and FCS) commonly consumed in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Risks of consumption of contaminated noodles were also assessed. Heavy metals content and PAHs were determined using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and Gas Chromatography (GC), respectively. Concentration of heavy metals as Pb, Ni, Cu, Al and Cr were detected while As, Hg and Cd were not detected in noodles. High average concentration (mean ± SD mg/kg) of Pb were observed in brands CFN (3. 163 ± 0. 21) and GFC (1. 022 ± 0. 08) which were significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) than in NGP (0. 043 ± 0. 15) and GAA (0. 276 ± 0. 18), although all were above WHO permissible limits (0. 025 mg/kg). Target Hazard Quotient and Hazard Index for Pb were > 1 in brands CFN and GFC indicating unacceptable risk. Results of PAHs showed brands had total PAHs (mg/kg) in the order: CFN >CUN >GAA >NGP >FCS > GFC. Although Carcinogenic Risks associated with these noodles are within <b>permissible</b> range, <b>consumption</b> of CFN and GFC could pose greater health risk to consumers. Long term consumption of brands CUN, CFN and GAA may have higher probability of carcinogenesis among consumers. We therefore recommend more diligent regulatory policies and monitoring by relevant Government agencies (WHO, NAFDAC, CPC and SON) to ensure wholesome noodles get to consumers...|$|R

If a node initiates snapshot collection, local snapshots of only those nodes that have directly or transitively a ected the initiator since their last snapshots need to be taken. We prove that the global snapshot collection terminates within a nite time of its invocation and the collected global snapshot is consistent. We also propose a minimal rollback/recovery algorithm in which the computation at a node is rolled back only if it depends on operations that have been undone due to the failure of node(s). Both the algorithms have low communication and storage overheads and meet the low energy consumption and low bandwidth constraints of mobile computing systems.

40|$|As {{this paper}} study how a brand can {{differentiate}} itself {{to stand out}} among the competitions for better growth opportunities, focus is given to two emerging trends in the market, the halal skincare and also functional skincare brand. Halal skincare stands for the skincare product that is <b>permissible</b> for Muslim <b>consumption</b> from the religious perspective. This trend is growing tremendously as Muslim is the second biggest religion {{in the world with}} high fertility rate. In skincare, the concept of halal would exclude the use of alcohol and pig-derives material in the product. This market amount to $ 46 billion in 2013 and is growing at 8 % annually. This undercapitalised halal skincare market with few competition provides good opportunities for a brand to grow and develop. The functional skincare on the other hand, is a trend emerged over time where products provide additional benefits on top of basic function. This skincare trend is basically driven by modern technology that leads to many innovations of these multi-featured products. Example of the additional benefits that will be the focus in this study are the anti-aging and the sun care protection. Both trends gained enough attention by demonstrating a strong growth in the respective segments. This study will provide a snapshot of the current growing trends in the market and provide the key steps to position and differentiate a brand in order to stand out against the competitors with reference to the halal and functional skincare. The key objective here is to understand the determination of the brand positioning through the analysis of competitors, the target consumer and formulation of own brand differentiations. As every brand will be given a variety of judgements by the consumers, it is essential that a brand is position properly {{in the mind of the}} consumer in order to be successful in the market...|$|R
