5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>shifting</b> {{interferometry}} overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. <b>Phase</b> <b>shifting</b> technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered phase comparison as a solution, {{but could not}} find a suitable <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> circuit.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> methods.|$|E

Firstly, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on axial superresolution. It proves theoretically that axial superresolution can not be obtained by two-zone phase filter with <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> pi, and it gets the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> with which axial superresolution can be brought by two-zone phase filter. Secondly, it studies the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on transverse superresolution. It finds that the three-zone phase filter with arbitrary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> has an almost equal optimal transverse gain to that of commonly used three-zone phase filter, but can produce a much higher axial superresolution gain. Thirdly, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on three-dimensional superresolution. Three-dimensional superresolution capability and design margin of three-zone complex filter with arbitrary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> are obtained, which presents the theoretical basis for three-dimensional superresolution design. Finally, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on focal shift. To obtain desired focal shifts, it designs a series of three-zone phase filters with different <b>phase</b> <b>shifts.</b> A spatial light modulator (SLM) is used to implement the designed filters. By regulating the voltage imposed on the SLM, an accurate focal shift control is obtained...|$|R
5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>Shifting</b> Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E

By stepping the reference mirror and recording successive en face images a three-dimensional representation can be reconstructed. Three-dimensional OCT using a CCD camera was demonstrated in a phase-stepped technique, using geometric <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> with a Linnik interferometer, utilising a pair of CCDs and heterodyne detection, and in a Linnik interferometer with an oscillating reference mirror and axial translation stage.

40|$|In phase-shifting {{interferometry}} spatial nonuniformity of the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> gives {{a significant}} {{error in the}} evaluated phase when the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> is nonlinear.

500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include <b>Phase</b> <b>Shifting</b> Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E
50|$|A phase {{correcting}} reflective array {{consists of an}} array of <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> elements illuminated by a feed placed at the focal point.

The <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> elements can be passive or active. Each <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> element can be designed to either produce a phase shift which is equal to that required at the element centre, or provide some quantised <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> values.
