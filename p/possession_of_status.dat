40|$|In {{adopting}} Bill 89, the National Assembly, {{while retaining}} {{most of the}} wording of the rules proposed by the Civil Code Revision Office, has changed their order and arrangement. This may entail substantive alterations. The first part of this paper shows that, on a first reading at least, the new provisions display some consistency. The terms « legitimacy » and « legitimate » are no longer used; children are treated alike, especially as regards the manner of proof whether they be born from wedlock or not. Maternity and paternity may now be proved by similar means. The various modes of proof are now hierarchically listed : first come acts of birth, followed in sequence of subsidiarity by <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>status,</b> presumption as to the husband's paternity, and recognition. The traditional presumption is therefore significantly downgraded. In litigated cases, the action to disavow paternity is now open not only to the mother's husband, but also to the mother herself. Status may be challenged and a different one may be sought whenever the act of birth and <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> are not congruent. Biological truth is given precedence over the protection of legitimacy In {{the second part of the}} paper, however, some inconsistencies in the new provisions are brought out. They relate mainly to two issues. The new provisions purportedly make no distinction between the proof of maternity and that of paternity. Yet, while maternity may be proved directly, the proof of paternity must remain somewhat uncertain, hence the use of presumptions. Most useful among these is the presumption as to the husband's paternity : yet the new provisions confine it to a very subsidiary role. According to the new scheme of rules, it is questionable whether anyone other than the mother's husband may rely on them to disavow paternity when his name appears on the act of birth. The new provisions also purport to abandon the concept of legitimacy. This, it might be claimed, entails the abandonment of marriage itself. Yet, not only does the new Code preserve marriage, but it also denies recognition to the union de fait. Neither have the presumption as to the husband's paternity, or the disavowal of children, been eradicated from the new provisions. The paper concludes by foreseeing many difficulties in the application of the new rules as to the proof of paternal filiation...|$|E

The text encompasses description of the legal context of naturalisation in Poland, statistical data about long-term residents from various diasporas and number of citizenship acquisitions. The article focuses on four case studies of migrants from the United Kingdom, Lithuania, Vietnam and India in order to examine and interpret the declared reasons of the lack of naturalisation. In general, three types of reasons are distinguished: psychological (lack of sufficient sense of belonging), bureaucratic (costs, length and complicated character of the procedure) and legal-political (prohibition of dual citizenship in the country <b>of</b> origin, <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> a <b>status</b> <b>of</b> a permanent resident) ...|$|R

40|$|Historically, the {{distinctive}} core of citizenship {{has been the}} <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the formal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> membership of a political and legal entity and having particular sorts of rights and obligations within it.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose {{and develop a}} social account of global autonomy. On this view, a person is {{autonomous}} simply {{to the extent to}} which it is difficult for others to subject her to their wills. I argue that many properties commonly thought necessary for autonomy are in fact properties that tend to increase an agent’s immunity to such interpersonal subjection, and that the proposed account is therefore capable of providing theoretical unity to many of the otherwise heterogeneous requirements of autonomy familiar from recent discussions. Specifically, I discuss three such requirements: (i) <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> legally protected <b>status,</b> (ii) a sense of one’s own self- worth, and (iii) a capacity for critical reflection. I argue that the proposed account is not only theoretically satisfying but also yields a rich and attractive conception of autonomy...|$|R

The IMI Working Papers Series This working paper has been developed from the author's Masters Dissertation. Students in the MSc in Migration Studies at the University of Oxford receiving a distinction for their thesis are invited to publish a modified version as an IMI and COMPAS joint working paper. The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority group in Arakan State, Burma, are among the most vulnerable and persecuted populations across the globe. Despite their significant historical presence in the country, the Government of Burma does not recognise the Rohingya as citizens, thus rendering the population stateless. Many observers argue that the root cause of the crisis is the group’s denial <b>of</b> legal <b>status,</b> suggesting that granting them citizenship would offer a lasting solution. While the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>status</b> is fundamental to an inclusive notion of citizenship, consideration of other non-formal dimensions of citizenship are just as necessary in expanding the boundaries of inclusion. Drawing on the case of the Rohingya, I will conduct a genealogy of exclusion to illustrate that their status is not merely a product of lacking citizenship, but rather embedded in more elaborate processes of nation building...|$|R

It has been observed in infants five months and older.Some claim that jealousy is seen in every culture;however, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific phenomenon.|$|R

500|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation {{seeks to}} {{decouple}} animal rights from animal liberation. For Cochrane, of central importance {{is the question}} of sentience, understood as [...] "the capacity for phenomenal consciousness". No position is taken on precisely how many animals are sentient, but, Cochrane argues, it is clear that at least some nonhuman animals are. Sentience alone does not afford moral status, but sentience implies the capacity for well-being; sentient beings have lives that can go better or worse for them. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that personhood is required for moral value, but Cochrane observes that there may be nonhuman animals who could be considered persons. In any case, it is argued that there are good reasons not to agree with Kant, and Cochrane concludes that {{there is no reason to}} limit the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>status</b> to humans. What needs to be considered is not whether anything is owed to animals, but what is owed to them. Following a paper on animal rights by political philosopher Joel Feinberg, Cochrane suggests that animals possess rights on account of their interests. Cochrane then deals with four possible objections. Interest rights are defended against the claim that moral agency is a prerequisite of rights-possession, against the demand that rights be derived from social relations, against the suggestion, from R. G. Frey, that animals do not possess interests, and against the idea that inanimate entities and plants may possess interests.|$|R

In November 1863 Frederick of Augustenburg claimed the twin-duchies in succession after King Frederick.

This resulted in the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and a Prussian/Austrian alliance in 1864. The Peace Conference broke up without having arrived at any conclusion; {{the outcome of the}} war was unfavorable to Denmark and led to the incorporation of Schleswig into Prussia in 1865.

40|$|Firstly, I analyse the European {{legislation}} on asylum, the so-called “Dublin System”, finding three main issues affecting it a) {{the allocation of}} refugees between Member States; b) the differences between Member States {{in the treatment of}} asylum seekers and asylum applications; and c) the differences in the rights granted to the refugee status across Member States. I also show that these issues have serious consequences for both asylum seekers and refugees. Secondly, we examine the European Agenda on Migration that represents the official response of the EU to the present crisis. Finally, I present some proposal aimed to improve the European managing of refugees and asylum seekers. Following a moderated cosmopolitan approach, I propose the establishment of a limited citizenship for refugees that might be thought as a temporary citizenship conditioned to the <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the refugee <b>status.</b> At this particular citizenship, one may apply different rights, but to face the issues encountered, it may be sufficient to connect to it only the freedom of movement and residence throughout the EU. I argue that such a policy would have several advantages and could at least partially solve the issues present in the European asylum policy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Trust {{management}} systems provide a flexible way for performing decentralized security management. However, most trust {{management systems}} only support monotonic policies. Compared with nonmonotonic policies, monotonic ones are less flexible and cannot express policies such as “Chinese wall policies ” and “separation of duties”. To support non-monotonic policies, trust management systems {{must be able}} to correctly identify the credentials which a subject has that are required by the policies. Previous efforts address the problem by letting the system query the issuers directly to verify the <b>possession</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the credentials. But this approach can violate the subject’s privacy. The main contribution of this paper is a cryptographic credential verification scheme for non-monotonic trust management systems that can correctly identify the credentials that a subject has while also protecting the subject’s privacy. We also analyze the security of the scheme and prove that with correct construction and certain cryptographic assumptions, the scheme is secure...|$|R

Secondly, I examine the European proposals drawn up by the EC in order to fill these gaps.
