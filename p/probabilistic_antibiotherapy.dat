30|$|Conclusion The goal of {{our study}} is to improve local {{standard}} of care by offering a formalization of community-acquired IAI management procedure. C-group rate {{seems to be a}} good follow-up indicator of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>antibiotherapy</b> inadequacy to microbial sensitivity, allowing an optimization of our protocol in real-time.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are {{disseminating}} worldwide. ESBL-E fecal carriage {{is known}} to {{increase the risk of}} ESBL-E infections and so untailored empirical <b>probabilistic</b> <b>antibiotherapy</b> and mortality. The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms of dissemination of ESBL-E fecal carriage in an intensive care unit (ICU).|$|E
30|$|Introduction French {{guidelines}} for community-acquired IAI {{underline the importance}} of establishing antibiotherapy protocols based on regular analysis of microbiological data; and of systematic site infection cultures to determine microbial sensitivity to antibiotics. Our study describes microbial population involved in our community-acquired IAI and defines an annual follow-up indicator of <b>probabilistic</b> <b>antibiotherapy</b> inadequacy to microbial sensitivity.|$|E
30|$|Discussion Our {{microbial}} population in community-acquired IAI {{is similar to}} national studies with a lowest resistance rate (C-group under 10 %). <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>antibiotherapy</b> proposed by French guidelines is appropriated to our microbial ecology. Antibiotherapy duration is unconformed with guidelines in 67 % cases. Peroperative swabs are frequently missing (35 %). Non-compliance with French guidelines highlights the importance to formalize our local procedure. This formalization at any stage (surgical, medical and biological cares) seems essential to improve our standard of care. C-group rate {{could be used as}} a real-time feedback to adapt our protocol continuously.|$|E
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} We {{conducted}} a retrospective, monocentric, observational study from January the 1 st 2014 to December the 31 st 2015. All community-acquired IAI in adults were included. Exclusion criteria were: cirrhosis and peritoneal dialysis. Initial <b>probabilistic</b> <b>antibiotherapy</b> and total antibiotherapy duration {{were left to}} {{the discretion of the}} physician in charge. Results of intra-abdominal cultures (IAC) were analyzed. Three microbial groups were defined: (A) A-group: wild-type bacteria strains treated with adequat antibiotherapy; (B) B-group: antibiotic resistant bacteria treated with adequat antibiotherapy; (C) C-group: multi-drug resistant bacteria treated with inadequat antibiotherapy. A Chi square analysis was performed on SPSS software (IBM).|$|E
