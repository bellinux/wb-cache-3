40|$|Abstract:- Constitutive {{models of}} {{partially}} saturated soils {{have been widely}} used in geotechnical engineering. Most of these models depend on complicated parameters; among them, soil suction is the most important one. However, the equipment and level of expertise required for determination of this parameter during a test procedure is beyond the capabilities of most of geotechnical laboratories. Thus, a behaviour model independent of soil suction may be very interested instead of such complicated laboratory measurements. In this research, a new behaviour model of partly saturated soils is presented. This model is constructed based on a series of collected data from different authors and validated with their experimental results. Employing a dramatic and continuous transition of soil strengths from a fully saturated to fully dry condition is the base of this model. Soil parameters which were used in this approach are moisture content, <b>plasticity</b> <b>indices,</b> saturated-drained internal friction angle and unconfined compressive strength of soil in dry and hardened states. Based on presented equation in this research and introduced effective parameters, it is possible to determine partially saturated soils shear strengths without any measurement of soil suction...|$|R

Four consolidation tests with different loading rates were performed on three types of remolded clay soils with various <b>plasticity</b> <b>indices</b> to evaluate loading rate effects on the consolidation settlement. After explicitly performing the falling head permeability test at various stages during the conventional consolidation tests, the variation of coefficient of consolidation with external pressure was established and converted to the relationship between the coefficient of consolidation and the time of the corresponding pressure applied on the specimens for each loading rate test. The hereditary integral of viscoelastic theory was then applied to predict the settlement curve with time for each loading rate test. The findings indicate that the theoretical predictions using the loading-dependent coefficients of consolidation and experimental results in term of consolidation settlement are in good agreement...|$|R
