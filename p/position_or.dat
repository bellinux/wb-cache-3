5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined.

5|$|A gun {{emplacement}} is a <b>position</b> <b>or</b> platform specially {{prepared to}} support large heavy guns and artillery. The first type of gun put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7-inch Rifled Muzzle-Loading (R.M.L.). Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 {{so as to}} provide a temporary defence for the fort.

5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.

5|$|Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled {{over the}} {{question}} of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities.

5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie Olivier. The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's ground game.

5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme <b>position</b> <b>or</b> opposed northern interests.|$|E

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to <b>position</b> <b>or</b> hide.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their <b>position</b> <b>or</b> retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled <b>position,</b> <b>or</b> a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior judges are all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court.|$|E

Paintings of him usually depict legendary events of his life. Some of these include his marriage, and Indra performing a ritual known as abhisheka (consecration). He is sometimes shown presenting a bowl to his followers and teaching them the art of pottery, painting a house, or weaving textiles. The visit of his mother Marudevi is also shown extensively in painting. He is also associated with his Bull emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party's first {{congress}} {{was held in}} Damascus in 1947. Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of Amid, sometimes translated as 'doyen' or as 'leader'; and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution adopted at the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected Secretary General of the National Command. Zaki al-Arsuzi, {{the leader of the}} Arab Ba'ath, was not given any <b>position,</b> <b>or</b> membership in the party. Aflaq as Amid was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party's mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party's day-to-day management. The merger would prove problematic, several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba'ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq's tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.|$|E
