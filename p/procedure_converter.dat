40|$|Steuerverfahren für Stromrichter basieren heute fast ausschließlich auf dem Prinzip der Raumzeigermodulation. Durch die Transformation des Dreiphasensystems in die Zwei-Komponenten-Ebene geht der Anteil verloren, der auf den drei Leitern gleichzeitig liegt. Daher weisen diese Steuerverfahren immer eine Gleichkomponente auf, deren Wert ständig wechselt. Bei dem hier vorgestellten Verfahren der Raumvektormodulation wird das Drehstrom­system nicht wie im Zeigermodell durch drei ebene 120 °-Komponenten gebildet, sondern als räumliche Anordnung betrachtet. Dabei stehen die drei Achsen {{orthogonal}} aufeinander. Der durch Addition aller Komponenten entstehende Raumvektor bewegt sich in diesem Raumkoordinatensystem, wobei die Ausdehnung in z-Richtung der zu minimierenden Gleichkomponente entspricht.

Außerdem ist eine völlig fehlerfreie Erfassung der Führungs­größe an den Sektorgrenzen nicht möglich. Mit dem neuen Verfahren können diese kritischen Bereiche gefahrlos um jeweils 30 ° überschritten werden. Today, control <b>procedures</b> for <b>converters</b> {{are almost}} exclusively {{based on the}} principle of space-vector-modulation. Through the transformation of the three-phase system into the two-component-plane, the portion of information, that lies on all three wires at the same time is lost.

With the procedure of the cubic-vector-modulation, the three-phase system is not formed by three plane 120 °-components as in the usual model, instead it is regarded as a three-dimensional arrangement. The three-dimensional space is formed by three axes standing orthogonally on each other. The cubic-vector, resulting from the addition of all components, is moving in this cubic- coordinate-system, where the expansion in the z-direction corresponds to the common-component, which has to be minimized. Commutation conditions are more complicated in the matrix-converter than in the link-converter.

40|$|Thermal {{converters}} are {{the most}} accurate devices used by National Metrology Institutes for the transfer of ac voltage and current to equivalent dc quantities. Today, thin-film or planar multijunction thermal converters are employed in the frequency range from 10 Hz up to 1 MHz with uncertainties between 1 #mu#V/V to 13 #mu#V/V. For frequencies above 100 kHz the ac-dc transfer difference of the standard thin-film or planar multijunction thermal converter (PMJTC) developed at the PTB and fabricated on a silicon chip show an increase towards negative values for high heater resistances. A model that explains the behaviour of the thin-film converter on a silicon chip at high frequencies was developed. This model shows that an improvement in performance in this frequency range is possible by the change of the geometry of the bonding pads of the heater. To improve the standards for the measurement of the ac-dc transfer difference {{in the range from}} 100 kHz up to 100 MHz, a new thin-film multijunction thermal converter on a quartz membrane and a quartz chip has been developed. The window with the membrane for the converter was anisotropically etched into the quartz crystal chip and the structure of the bifilar heater and the thermocouples was fabricated using standard photolithographic <b>procedures.</b> The <b>converters</b> fabricated show ac-dc transfer differences below 5 #mu#V/V in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. This is a reduction of more than one order of magnitude of the ac-dc voltage transfer difference in comparison to the PMJTC with an Si_ 3 N_ 4 /SiO_ 2 /Si_ 3 N_ 4 sandwich membrane on a silicon chip. An electrical model taking all sources of ac-dc transfer differences at high frequencies into account was developed. A comparison of the results of simulations with those of measurements for converters with different heater resistances show good agreement. Therefore, the model can be used for the optimisation of the converter at high frequencies. The uncertainty of this model was calculated. A further improvement of the frequency response of the new thermal converter in the range of 10 MHz to 100 MHz has been achieved. By using a built-in Tee structure the ac-dc transfer difference in the range from 10 MHz to 100 MHz decrease by a factor of 10. The decrease of the ac-dc difference allows to decrease the uncertainty of the PTB ac-dc transfer standards, using the developed model for the uncertainty analysis. (orig.)

40|$|The {{development}} of high power density power converters {{has become an}} important topic in power electronics because of increasing demand in transportation applications including marine, aviation and vehicle system. The possibility for greater power densities due to absence of a DC link is made matrix converter topologies more attractive for these applications. Additionally, with the emerging SiC device technology, the operating switching frequency and temperature of the converter can be potentially increased. The extended switching frequency and temperature range provide opportunities to further improve the power density of the power converters. The aim of this thesis is to understand how SiC devices {{are different from the}} conventional Si devices and the effect these differences have on the design and performance of a matrix converter. Specific gate drive circuits are designed and implemented to fully utilize the high speed switching capabilities of these emerging semiconductor devices. A method to evaluate the conduction and switching losses and performance of Si and SiC power devices in the matrix converter circuit is developed. The developed method is used to compare power losses of matrix converters designed with different Si and SiC devices for a range of operating temperatures and switching frequencies. A design <b>procedure</b> for matrix <b>converter</b> input filters is proposed to fulfil power quality standard requirements and maximize the filter power density. The impact of the switching frequency on the input filter volume has also been considered in this work.

Finally the influence of parasitic inductance on the behaviour of SiC power MOSFET matrix converters is investigated to highlight the challenges of high speed power devices...|$|R
40|$|A novel systematical {{synthesis}} {{method of}} PWM dc-to-dc converters is established in this thesis. The new method can generate converters in an efficient way, with clear circuit insight. The family of PWM dc-to-dc converters is defined to include converters with multiple-input and/or multiple-output; converters with arbitrary switched networks in each switching period; and converters with loops consisting only of capacitors {{and possibly a}} voltage source or cut-sets consisting only of inductors and possibly a current source in the individual switched networks. This method {{is based on the}} equivalent ac and dc circuits of a PWM dc-to-dc converter, which consist only of switches in the converter. The first part of the synthesis procedure is carried out without the participation of reactive elements. For a given number of switches and other requirements, the ac topology and its control sequence can be decided. Basic properties of ac and dc circuits are derived. Moreover, the topological relation between an ac circuit and its associated dc circuits is discovered. Based on the volt-second and ampere-second balance equations of the ac circuit and the matrix representation of dc circuits, a formalized dc model in terms of average switch voltages and currents is first developed. Consequently, the dc conversion ratio and switch implementation can be derived for each pair of ac and dc circuits. The associated dc circuits of the given ac circuit can be formally generated and sorted out according to the required dc conversion ratio, the types of switches, the order of the dc circuit, and other properties. The insertion procedure for reactive elements is also formalized. The basic <b>procedure</b> generates the <b>converters</b> with the minimum number of inductors and capacitors. A modification of the basic procedure is given to generate converters with continuous input and output currents. Different classes of converters are generated by the new synthesis approach. A class of three-switch converters are discovered, each of which has a loop of capacitors and possibly the voltage source. Some of these three-switch converters are of special practical interests. Also, a class of three-switch, and two-output converters are discovered that can provide opposite polarity output voltages without using a transformer. Most importantly, this systematic synthesis method provides an analytic and circuit-oriented approach to develop new converter topologies in order to meet new requirements introduced by ever growing number of applications...|$|R
