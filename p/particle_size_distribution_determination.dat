40|$|AbstractLike {{most things}} in life one gets out what one puts in and this is no truer than in modern {{instrumental}} particle size distribution techniques. The mantra of ‘garbage in = garbage out’ is meant to convey that the apparently complicated laser diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy techniques measure faithfully what they are given, but what they are given may not {{be representative of the}} entire product or material on which significant economic decisions will be made. Tiny samples down to pg in size on electron microscopes are somehow meant to be able to generate information on what may be many tonnes of heterogeneous sample. The bad news is that distribution and heterogeneity imply that statistical methods must be employed in order to obtain accurate and reproducible information. The good news is that representative sampling is amenable to simple statistical evaluation and 2 major predictions can be made:•Based on a required or specified precision or standard error (SE), the point at the top end of the distribution to be specified to this degree of precision, and the density of the sample, then a simple prediction of the minimum mass, required to meet this required level of precision, can be calculated•Similarly, if the mass utilized in the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>determination</b> is known and the point in the distribution to be specified (plus the density of the sample again), then we can calculate a theoretical best achievable precision based solely on the heterogeneity of the sampleThis paper will illustrate the 2 points above with practical examples...|$|E
40|$|Soils {{formed in}} Quaternary age silts are {{widespread}} on the Delmarva Peninsula in Maryland. The origin, {{mode of transportation}} and deposition, and age of the sediments in which these soils formed have long been debated and are important to understanding climate change and to investigations of the prehistory of the Delmarva. This study was undertaken {{in an effort to}} resolve the issue of the origin of parent sediments, to examine the pedogenic history of the soils, and to gain insight into the paleoclimate of the region. Thirty nine profiles were described and sampled in two north-south transects on the upland and the broad terrace along the Chesapeake Bay on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Laboratory analyses included determination of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution,</b> <b>determination</b> of Zr, Ti, Ca, and K contents of coarse silts, mineralogical analysis, and the examination of biogenic opal. The silty mantle overlying sands ranged in thickness from 150 cm to less than 50 cm, with considerable variation across the study area. Textures of this mantle were silt loam and silty clay loam with 53 to 94 percent clay-free silt and a mean clay-free particle size of 41 mm. The Zr content of the silts was uniform within profiles and across the study area while that of Ti, Ca, and K varied. Mineralogy of the silts was homogeneous across the study area. There were no features diagnostic of either fluvial/estuarine or eolian processes in the silt deposit. Minimal coarse fragments and no stratification were observed. Low chroma matrix colors of soils reflected modern drainage conditions rather than a reducing depositional environment. Pedological development argued for relatively young soils (< 30, 000 years) and archaeological materials from surface horizons buried by the silts dated the onset of deposition {{to the end of the}} Pleistocene (approximately 10, 500 14 C years BP). The youthfulness of the silts precluded them from having been deposited during the Sangamon transgression, which occurred no more recently than 82, 000 years BP, and proved unequivocally that the silts are loess. Buried paleosols were indicative of the landscape stability prior to loess deposition while phytoliths reflected a climate shift...|$|E

Leafy fillers improve anticorrosive properties (they participate in barrier mechanism), stability in atmospheric influences and adhesion to base plate.

40|$|Most {{renewable}} energy sources suffer from intermittency {{and have to be}} coupled with sophisticated energy conversion and storage technologies. An elegant solution is offered by photoelectrochemical water splitting, where solar energy is directly converted into chemical energy by splitting water into oxygen and the energy carrier hydrogen. Photoelectrochemical water splitting requires two photoelectrodes which are immersed in an aqueous electrolyte. These photoelectrodes are semiconductors with valence and conduction bands straddling the redox potential of water. Upon illumination, electrons and holes are produced, separated and transferred to the electrolyte, leading to the evolution of oxygen at the photoanode and the evolution of hydrogen at the photocathode. The resulting hydrogen can be stored, transported and then either burnt in fuel cells to regain electrical energy or used for industrial applications like the Haber-Bosch process. The photoelectrodes are often nanostructured to increase the surface area, at which the reaction takes place. This strategy has been realized with several morphologies such as nanotubes, inverse opals, etc. and has often lead to performance increases of several hundred percent. Therefore, detailed knowledge of the morphology is important and can be obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM is a powerful technique that allows imaging samples with a resolution down to the sub-Ångstrom scale. In addition, TEM can be combined with spectroscopic methods such as electron energyloss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) to quantify the chemical composition. In this thesis, three different materials systems were studied by TEM: noble metal nanoparticles on TiO 2 for hydrogen evolution with the sacrificial agent MeOH, Fe 2 O 3 /WO 3 dual absorber photoanodes and photocathodes out of the novel material FeCrAl oxide. Titania {{is one of the most}} researched photoanode materials. However, it only absorbs UV light. Au and Au/Ag core-shell nanoparticles were deposited by the project partners Michael Karnahl and Sandra Peglow of the LIKAT and the INP Greifswald, respectively, on anatase thin films by photodeposition and radio frequency magnetron sputtering. These noble metal nanoparticles absorb visible light by surface plasmon resonance and also act as co-catalysts for electrons excited in the titania and injected into them. Cross-section were prepared for a detailed TEM investigation of the microstructure. The distribution of the nanoparticles varied greatly with the synthesis method, as photodeposited particles grew in and on top of the titania, whereas the plasma-deposited nanoparticles only grew on top. Different growth and coarsening mechanisms could be identified and correlated to the synthesis conditions by careful <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>determination.</b> In addition to defect-free nanoparticles, several defects such as five-fold twinning, grain boundaries and stacking faults were found. The TEM analysis was complemented by optical absorption and photocatalysis measurements, and the synthesis as well as the properties could be correlated to microstructural features. Due to its narrow band gap, hematite is a popular photoanode material. However, it also has several disadvantages, which were addressed by several studies. Tin-doping increased the transfer efficiency and therefore the photocurrent, with the tin being enriched at the surface of the hematite nanoparticles and hinting at a structure-function relationship. Deposition of a Co 3 O 4 co-catalyst and the introduction of a conductive scaffold all further increased the photocurrent. Another performance-increasing approach, combining multiple photocatalytically active materials, was tested with Fe 2 O 3 /WO 3 dual absorbers prepared by Ilina Kondofersky of the group of Prof. Thomas Bein. WO 3 was systematically applied as a scaffold and/or as a surface treatment. The arrangement of the different materials and the interfaces between them was studied in detail by TEM. Both the host-guest approach and the surface treatment strongly increased the performance compared to the pure materials and several beneficial interactions could be identified. For example, WO 3 strongly scatters visible light, resulting in increased absorption by Fe 2 O 3 and higher current densities. We also determined a cathodic shift in the onset potential to 0. 8 V and, compared to pure Fe 2 O 3, increased transfer rates of up to 88...|$|E

Previous results strongly suggest that SRT is an important parameter affecting <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in activated sludge process.

Various approaches have been used to measure <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> For solid-liquid systems, the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> is highly demanded. The investigation of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and the floating <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in Stokes region and in Allen region.

In the present work, we apply a detailed kinetic soot {{model with a}} sectional method, and study {{the evolution of the}} <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> Detailed information on the evolution of the soot <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> function is acquired. It is found that the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> function is bimodal throughout the flame. The transition from the small to large <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> is strongly influenced by surface growth and oxidation reactions. We find that large particles {{are most likely to be}} emitted from the flame. (c) 2006 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} {{and mechanical}} performance of cement paste {{is closely related}} to its packing density, which may be optimized by improving the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in the paste mix. In this study, the authors propose modifications to the existing mathematical equations of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> The new equation of optimal <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> so formulated is verified experimentally. A series of cement paste having different water/cementitious materials (W/CM) ratios were produced by blending ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with varying contents of superfine cement (SFC). The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of the blended paste mixes were compared with the proposed equation. The packing density of paste mixes was measured using the wet packing test method, and the flowability, rheological properties, and compressive strength of the paste mixes were tested. It is found, that the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in cement paste can be improved by blending with SFC, which can lead to enhancement in packing density, flowability, rheology and strength. The authors opine that the proposed equation of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> may be applied for mix design optimization of cementitious paste, including cementitious grout and the paste phase in mortar and concrete...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{method by which}} the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> functions of the product in each stage of a gradual reduction milling process can be introduced. The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> functions were introduced by which the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> data of the product in each stage on several milling tests at three levels of grain conditioning were fitted to the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> function model using each milling condition as parameters by applying a least squares method. They represent {{the relation between the}} fluctuation of each milling condition in milling process and the fluctuation of organization of the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of the product in each stage. The purpose of the introduction of them is the establishment of the interchangeable calculating method of intermediate products amount on the actual industrial processes. テスト製粉用製粉機を用いて行なった挽砕・篩分試験により, 段階式製粉工程における各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数を導出した. 以下, その結果を列挙する. 1) 段階式製粉工程における中間産物の粒度分布関数に適応する関数モデルを検討した結果, 係数がパラメータに関して線形である, 粒度に関する 3 次多項式が最適であることを明確にした. 2) 工程入力産物の各性状要素をパラメータとした, 工程出力産物の粒度分布を表わす式構造を定義した. 3) テスト製粉用製粉機を用いた挽砕・篩分試験により, 工程入力産物の各性状要素及び工程出力産物の粒度分布を測定した. 4) ガウス法を用いた最小二乗近似により, 計測データを粒度分布モデルにあてはめ, 各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数を決定した. その適合性は良好であった. 以上, 段階式小麦製粉工程の流量変動シミュレーション手法を考える上で有用となる, 各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数の導出手法について述べた...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the measurement of}} <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of TiO 2 nano-particles in non-aquesous solvent by interactive force apparatus (IFA) under electric field in order to suggest {{the application of the}} apparatus to the measurement of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> The results were compared with results obtained from size measurement by SEM. The results show that the distribution measured by IFA at 0. 03 and 0. 06 V was larger (D 50 = 430 - 480 nm) and at 0. 12 - 0. 48 V was smaller (D 50 = 200 - 270 nm) than the one measured by SEM (D 50 = 340 nm). The difference is mainly because small size fraction increased with increasing supply voltage. The results indicate that breakage of coagulated particles possibly occur due to electric breakdown. The electric breakdown was explained by curve fitting of two different <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> functions with <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> functions with <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> obtained from IFA measurement. ...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Several {{methods for}} the <b>determination</b> of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of {{aerosols}} have been reviewed. The Cascade Impactor was investigated and found suitable for classi-fying the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of aerosols between 0. 5 and 32. 0 u. Various sampling chambers were evaluated {{and the design}} of the chamber was found to be an ixnportant factor for <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> A modified distilling flask proved to be most suitable for this purpose. The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of two aerosol hair spray formulations was deter-nilned using this technique. Particles between 0. 5 and 32 u were classified with special attention given to those particles below 10 u in diameter. Several valve combinations were studied and evaluated {{on the basis of the}} proportion of particles below 10 u. The Cascade Impactor has been shown to be satisfactory for evaluating the toxicological potential of these aerosols based upon <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> and upon other considerations...|$|R
