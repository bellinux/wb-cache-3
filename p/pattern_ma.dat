The sample consisted of 191 MA-using mothers who participated in a large-scale multi-site study of prenatal <b>MA</b> exposure. <b>Patterns</b> of substance use were assessed by maternal self-report via the Substance Use Inventory (SUI), which included detailed information about MA use, including frequency, quantity, and maximum use during each trimester of pregnancy. The study demostrated that on average, the prevalence of MA use decreased over the three trimesters of pregnancy (84. 3 % vs. 56. 0 % vs. 42. 4 %), and decreased frequency was observed among users from the first trimester to the third (3. 1 vs. 2. 4 vs. 1. 5  days/week). Closer examination of the individual patterns revealed that 29. 3 % of women maintained consistently high frequency, 9. 4 % increased frequency, 25. 7 % had a stable low/moderate pattern, and 35. 6 % decreased their frequency of MA over the course of pregnancy. These four groups did not differ in sociodemographic characteristics; women who decreased their use of MA had significantly more prenatal visits compared to the consistently high-use group, but were the most likely to use alcohol during their pregnancy. In conclusion, this article elucidated the different <b>patterns</b> of <b>MA</b> use in this community sample. Approximately, one third of MA-using mothers could be classified as consistently high users with a profile of use with the greatest risk to themselves and potentially to their infants including high levels of MA use throughout pregnancy and fewer prenatal care visits.

40|$|Qualitative {{urinalysis}} can verify abstinence of {{drug misuse}} but cannot detect changes in drug intake. For drugs with slow elimination, such as methamphetamine (MA), a single episode of abuse {{can result in}} up to 5 days of positive urine drug screens. Thus, interventions that produce substantial decreases in drug use but do not achieve almost complete abstinence are classified as ineffective. Using nonpharmacologic doses of deuterium-labeled l-methamphetamine (l-MA-d 3) we have developed a simple, robust method that reliably estimates changes in MA intake. Twelve subjects were dosed with 5 mg of l-MA-d 3 daily and challenged with 15, 30, and 45 mg of nonlabeled d-MA (d-MA-d 0) after reaching plasma steady status of l-MA-d 3. Urinary concentration ratios of d-MA-d 0 to l-MA-d 3 provided clear separation of the administered doses with as little as 15 -mg dose increments. Administered doses could not be resolved using d-MA-d 0 concentrations alone. In conclusion, the urinary [d-MA-d 0]:[l-MA-d 3] provides a quantitative, continuous measure of illicit MA exposure.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{secondary}} effects of recent welfare reform on a subpopulation of welfare recipients who are treated for substance abuse disorders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In recent years, welfare recipients with substance abuse problems have been directly targeted by welfare legislation or otherwise indirectly impacted by these measures. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to changes in eligibility for welfare benefits, as they often possess a host of {{health and mental health}} problems that make {{it difficult for them to}} escape dependency on welfare. Specifically, many welfare recipients with substance abuse problems are dependent on Medicaid (MA) for access to needed behavioral health services and are unlikely to receive alternative health insurance coverage upon loss of MA. Therefore, if welfare reform measures result in MA eligibility loss (permanent or temporary) for these individuals, they are also likely to limit access to and utilization of substance abuse treatment services. ^ The main proposition of the current study is that recent welfare reform measures altered welfare dynamics for substance abusers and, subsequently, introduced increased instability into <b>patterns</b> of <b>MA</b> receipt within this population. Consequently, these individuals 2 ̆ 7 access to behavioral health services decreased. This proposition is tested by examining the impact of three separate welfare legislation measures—the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, and a Pennsylvania state General Assistance (GA) initiative for a cohort of welfare recipients in Philadelphia who were receiving substance abuse treatment services in 1995 (N = 12, 573). Monthly Medicaid administrative data are utilized to follow patterns of welfare and MA eligibility for these individuals between 1994 and 1999 (i. e., two years prior and two years post welfare reform of 1996 – 1997). ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s hypotheses are examined in three steps. First, the impact of welfare reform on welfare dynamics (e. g., number and length of individual welfare spells) is explored utilizing longitudinal data analysis techniques. Results indicate that the introduction of recent measures increased the likelihood of welfare eligibility loss, decreased the likelihood of return to welfare, and resulted in shorter than usual stays on welfare for the majority of individuals in the cohort, particularly for individuals eligible under GA. Next, similar methods were used to test the proposition that changes in welfare dynamics contributed to changing <b>patterns</b> of <b>MA</b> eligibility among substance abusers. The results of this analysis demonstrate a significant impact of welfare reform on increased number of interruptions in substance abusers 2 ̆ 7 MA eligibility. Finally, findings concerning the association between welfare reform and substance abusers 2 ̆ 7 access to behavioral health services suggest an independent contribution of welfare reform to decreased access to care within this population. The theoretical and practical implications of the study 2 ̆ 7 s findings are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The mas {{proto-oncogene}} encodes {{a protein}} with a predicted structure similar {{to members of}} the family of seven transmembrane domain spanning receptors. These receptors are thought to transduce extracellular signals to G-proteins. Angiotensin II and III have been reported to be the functional ligands for the mas oncogene-encoded receptor (Jackson et al., 1988). We show here using in situ hybridization histochemistry and RNase protection assays that mas mRNA is expressed in a subpopulation of neurons in both the adult and developing rat CNS. In the adult CNS, mas mRNA is most abundant in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells; mas transcripts are also present at low levels in the cortex and thalamus. mas is first expressed in the developing rat CNS at postnatal day 1 (P 1). Even at this early stage in CNS development the <b>pattern</b> of <b>mas</b> expression is similar to that seen in the adult. Although at P 1 most neurons of the dentate gyros are not yet generated and cells of the hippocampal CA fields are undergoing migration and synaptogenesis (Bayer 1980; Altman and Bayer, 1990 a, 1990 b, 1990 c), mas is specifically expressed in these cell populations. This extremely restricted pattern of expression suggests that mas may function in determining the morphology and connections of specific cell types in the hippocampus. This function may in part be carried out by the ability of mas to link external cues to intracellular processes...|$|R

In this study, strain MA 342 was tagged with the gfp gene (encoding the green fluorescent protein) in order to study the fate of cells after seed inoculation. The gfp-tagged strain, MA 342 G 2, had the same biocontrol efficacy as the wild type when it was applied at high cell concentrations to seeds but was less effective at lower cell concentrations. By comparing cell counts determined by microscopy to the number of CFU, we found that the number of culturable cells was significantly lower than the total number of bacteria on seeds which were inoculated and dried for 20 h. Confocal microscopy and epifluorescence stereomicroscopy were used to determine the <b>pattern</b> of <b>MA</b> 342 G 2 colonization and cell aggregation on barley seeds. Immediately after inoculation of seeds, bacteria were found mainly under the seed glume, and there was no particular aggregation pattern.

There was a trend towards bacterial aggregation near the embryo but never within the embryo. Bacterial aggregates were regularly found in the groove of each seed formed by the base of the coleoptile and the scutellum.

However, the underlying mechanisms of miR- 383 involved in the pathogenesis of MA remain unknown. In this study, we showed that downregulation of miR- 383 was associated with hyperactive proliferation of germ cells in patients with mixed <b>patterns</b> of <b>MA.</b> Overexpression of miR- 383 in NT 2 (testicular embryonal carcinoma) cells resulted in suppression of proliferation, G 1 -phase arrest and induction of apoptosis, whereas silencing of miR- 383 reversed these effects. The effects of miR- 383 were mediated through targeting a tumor suppressor, interferon regulatory factor- 1 (IRF 1), and miR- 383 was negatively correlated with IRF 1 protein expression in vivo. miR- 383 inhibited IRF 1 by affecting its mRNA stability, which subsequently reduced the levels of the targets of IRF 1, namely cyclin D 1, CDK 2 and p 21. Downregulation of IRF 1 or cyclin D 1, but not that of CDK 2, enhanced miR- 383 -mediated effects, whereas silencing of p 21 partially inhibited the effects of miR- 383. Moreover, miR- 383 downregulated CDK 4 by increasing proteasome-dependent degradation of CDK 4, which in turn resulted in an inhibition of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation. These results suggest that miR- 383 functions as a negative regulator of proliferation by targeting IRF 1, in part, through inactivation of the pRb pathway.

Our results suggest that the long-term standing diversity pattern and the interplay between origination and extinction rates displayed by this group do not correspond to the first three models, but can be more readily explained by the fourth scenario. Consequently, these patterns are likely controlled by a combination of planktic foraminiferal interspecific competition as well as various environmental changes such as marine global temperatures that could impacted the niches within the upper mixed layer within the oceans.

The egg-transfer technique has been used extensively to assess the effects of various experimental manipulations on their fertilizability and developmental potential (Adams & Abbott, 1971). For the most part, these experiments have involved the transfer of control eggs to another recipient or to the contralateral oviduct of the same recipient.

Ma 4 CL genes responded differently to a series of stresses. Ma 4 CL 3 expression was higher than that of the other Ma 4 CL genes following wounding, salicylic acid, and ultraviolet treatments.

Result: Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values for the whole HBV coding sequence were studied by Principal component analysis (PCA). The {{characteristics of}} the synonymous codon usage patterns, nucleotide contents and the comparison between ENC values of the whole HBV coding sequence indicated that the interaction between virus mutation pressure and host translation selection exists in the processes of HBV evolution. The synonymous codon usage pattern of HBV is a mixture of coincidence and antagonism to that of host cell. But the difference of genetic characteristic of HBV failed to be observed to its different epidemic areas or subtypes, suggesting that geographic factor is limited to influence the evolution of this virus, while genetic characteristic based on HBV genotypes could be divided into three groups, namely (i) genotyps A and E, (ii) genotype B, (iii) genotypes C, D and G. Conclusion: Codon usage patterns from PCA for identification of evolutionary trends in HBV provide an alternative approach to understand the evolution of HBV. Further more, a combined selection of mutation pressure with translation selection on codon usage might shed a light on understanding the evolutionary trends of HBV genotypes...|$|R
40|$|While researching {{integration}} {{aspects of}} cloud Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) with on-premises applications, authors have identified various scenarios that cannot be effectively addressed using existing integration solutions and <b>patterns.</b> Mobile Agents (<b>MAs)</b> were proposed as the technology addressing these integration challenges [30]. During the research, existing MA platforms were analyzed {{what led to}} conclusion {{that none of them}} is fully addressing specificē requirements of end-users in BPM scenarios. The main concern was related to agent development experience – in existing platforms it is required that user creating an agent has at least some understanding of programming concepts. In addition, authors have identified that there is no standard approach for packaging agents that is used across platforms. To address these issues new approach for designing and executing mobile agents is proposed. This approach is based on workflows and enables endusers having no programming skills to design MAs what is critical in BPM scenarios. In addition, a new approach for packaging mobile agents is proposed. It is based on industry used standards and open specifications. Proposed approach is extendable and may be reused for designing and/or packaging MAs in other domains as well...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Mandibular osteotomies and {{resection}} of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis are {{the mostly}} performed surgical {{procedures in the}} infratemporal fossa, which is in close proximity with the main trunk of the maxillary artery (MA). It is imperative to avoid the trunk or branches of the maxillary artery, otherwise, massive intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage may develop. The goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the position of the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa and the lingula of the mandible. Methods: Significant landmarks were selected on the mandibles of formalin fixed cadavers, and the distances were measured between the maxillary artery and the bony landmarks with a digital caliper. Results: The average distances between the MA and the articular eminence, the medial cortex of the mandibular ramus, the inferior border of the pterygoid fovea and the mandibular notch were 1. 67 ± 0. 48 mm, 5. 38 ± 2. 47 mm, 16. 84 ± 1. 74 mm, 2. 94 ± 0. 52 mm, respectively. Course <b>pattern</b> of the <b>MA</b> at the subcondylar level was also mapped. In order to determine the position of the lingula, the average distances between the tip of the lingula and the mandibular notch, the inferior border of the ramus...|$|R

In addition existing researches cover different scenarios of how intelligent agents can be used in BPM space, however these do not address specific aspects of MA integration with cloud BPMS, what is critical for proposed solution. During analysis of this subject, authors have identified required integration components, and are proposing an algorithm that allows to determine how these components should be implemented based on technical specification of cloud BPMS. AgentWF prototype provides a sample implementation of all components, and demonstrates how MA system should be integrated with cloud BPMS using proposed approach.

40|$|Background : Despite {{the recent}} {{attention}} in the literature and the media regarding methamphetamine (MA) abuse, particularly among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), there still exists a paucity of MA studies among heterosexual populations. From general drug use populations and among MSM, MA has been found to be associated with greater HIV-risk through drug use and sex behaviors. This study aims to contribute key areas of research to the existing literature on heterosexual MA- using populations regarding differences in sociodemographic characteristics, drug use and sex behaviors, and motivations for initiation and current use of MA use by (1) binge MA use, (2) gender, and (3) injection drug use. Methods: Between 2001 and 2005, data were collected on 452 HIV-negative MA users aged 18 and older in San Diego, CA, who had used MA at least twice and had engaged in unprotected sex in the previous 2 months. Separate logistic regression models identified significant factors associated with binge MA use, gender, or injection drug use. Results: Of 452 participants, mean age was 36. 6 years; 68 % were male; ethnicity was 49. 4 % Caucasian, 26. 8 % African-American, and 12. 8 % Hispanic; 55 % were never married; and 58 % never attended college. Binge MA use was associated with greater frequency of MA use, ever treated for MA use, injection drug use, higher Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score, initiating MA "to experiment", and engaging in sex marathons while high on MA. Men were more likely to engage in sex marathons and to use MA "to enhance sexual pleasure," whereas females were younger, and more likely to be married, report a recent sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis, introduced to MA by a sex partner, higher BDI scores, and to use MA "to lose weight. " Use of MA by injection was associated with being Caucasian, homeless, more years and quantity of MA use, history of felony conviction, and a recent STI. Conclusions : HIV-negative heterosexual MA users are not a homogeneous group. Differences in gender, route of <b>MA</b> administration and <b>pattern</b> of <b>MA</b> use should be considered in the design and implementation of interventions for decreasing HIV risks associated with MA use...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInter-site {{technological}} {{variation in}} the archaeological record {{is one of the}} richest potential sources of information about Plio-Pleistocene hominid behavior and evolution. However, appropriate methods for describing and comparing Oldowan assemblages have yet to be agreed upon, and interpretation of the early record remains highly controversial. Particularly salient is disagreement over whether the Oldowan is a single technological phenomenon or is more accurately divided into multiple regional and/or chronological traditions, perhaps including a less developed Pre-Oldowan phase in the late Pliocene. Some of this disagreement reflects theoretical and methodological differences between research traditions and some is more directly evidential. Here we present a framework for describing and interpreting Oldowan variation and apply it to three Pliocene assemblages (EG- 10, EG- 12, and OGS- 7) from Gona, all dated to c. 2. 6 million years (Ma). Results indicate proficient knapping and a full range of Oldowan reduction strategies in these earliest known occurrences, consistent with the idea of an Oldowan "technological stasis" from 2. 6 - 1. 6 <b>Ma.</b> <b>Patterns</b> of variation in raw material selection and predominant reduction strategy at each site clearly indicate the importance of cultural transmission in the Oldowan, but confounding ecological and economic variation continue to render interpretation in terms of multiple tool making traditions or species inappropriate. We propose that cultural transmission and ecological adaptation should be recognized as complementary, rather than mutually exclusive, mechanisms in future attempts to explain Oldowan technological variation...|$|R
40|$|The Raspas Metamorphic Complex {{of southwestern}} Ecuador is {{regarded}} as the southernmost remnant of oceanic and continental terranes accreted in the latest Jurassic–Early Cretaceous. It consists of variably metamorphosed rock types. (1) Mafic and ultramafic rocks metamorphosed under high-pressure (HP) conditions (eclogite facies) show oceanic plateau affinities with flat REE chondrite-normalized <b>patterns,</b> eNd 150 <b>Ma</b> ranging from + 4. 6 to 9. 8 and initial Pb isotopic ratios intermediate between MORB and OIB. (2) Sedimentary rocks metamorphosed under eclogitic conditions exhibit LREE enriched patterns, strong negative Eu anomalies, Rb, Nb, U, Th, Pb enrichments, low eNd 150 Ma values (from 6. 4 to 9. 5), and high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 206, 207, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb isotopic ratios suggesting they were originally sediments derived from the erosion of an old continental crust. (3) Epidote-bearing amphibolites show N-MORB affinities with LREE depleted patterns, LILE, Zr, Hf and Th depletion, high eNd 150 Ma (> + 10) and low initial Pb isotopic ratios. The present-day well defined internal structure of the Raspas Metamorphic Complex seems to be inconsistent with the formerly proposed interpretation of a ‘‘tectonic mélange’’. The association of oceanic plateau rocks and continent-derived sediments both metamorphosed in HP conditions suggests that the thin edge of the oceanic plateau first entered the subduction zone and dragged sediments downward of the accretionary wedge along the Wadatti–Benioff zone. Subsequently, when its thickes...|$|R
