5|$|A {{centre of}} capitalism, Manchester {{was once the}} scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater <b>political</b> <b>recognition</b> by the city's working and non-titled classes.

The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there, and Manchester was {{the centre of the}} Anti-Corn Law League from 1838 onward.|$|E
5|$|Following Galerius' {{recognition}} of Constantine as caesar, Constantine's portrait {{was brought to}} Rome, as was customary. Maxentius mocked the portrait's subject {{as the son of}} a harlot, and lamented his own powerlessness. Maxentius, envious of Constantine's authority, seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306AD. Galerius refused to recognize him, but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent Severus against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned. Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307AD. He offered to marry his daughter Fausta to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307AD. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius <b>political</b> <b>recognition.</b>|$|E

25|$|Moreover, its <b>political</b> <b>recognition</b> {{is still}} limited {{as it is}} only {{recognized}} in France as a minority language part of Maghrebi Arabic according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of May 1999.

About 3,500 fresh, veteran troops traveled through Arizona and New Mexico and arrived in the town in early October, bringing {{the total number of}} defenders to 6,500.

25|$|As late as 1964 Sivatte {{tried to}} {{maintain}} correct relations with Don Carlos Hugo, but the attempt backfired as {{significant number of}} Sivattistas, including Carles Feliu de Travy, left RENACE and re-integrated within Javierismo. The conversion was a serious blow to Sivatte, who made sure that the prince was a subversive leftist traitor and vehemently opposed his bid {{to take control of}} Carlism; this stand produced even sort of rapprochement between Sivatte and Fal Conde. Over time RENACE was getting more and more marginalized. Entirely failing to attract young activists, it was turning into a group of rapidly aging if not already senile dissenters. In 1970 it seemed reinvigorated when representatives of Juntas de Defensa and envoys of RENACE met in Estella to co-ordinate their activities; the meeting produced nothing but a few documents, eclipsed by what looked like impressive dynamics of the socialist-controlled Partido Carlista. In 1973, during the key annual Sivattista event, Aplec de Montserrat, only 150 participants did show up. During the same event next year Sivatte was detained and fined, perhaps the last sign of <b>political</b> <b>recognition</b> he has received in his life.|$|E

500|$|Maxentius' {{rule was}} {{nevertheless}} insecure.

By 312AD, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported, even among Christian Italians. In the summer of 311AD, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East. He declared war on Constantine, vowing to avenge his father's [...] "murder". To prevent Maxentius from forming an alliance against him with Licinius, Constantine forged his own alliance with Licinius over the winter of 311–312AD, and offered him his sister Constantia in marriage. Maximinus considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering <b>political</b> <b>recognition</b> to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted.

The detailed introductory discussion {{of the relation between}} the civil and the <b>political,</b> between <b>recognition</b> and redistribution, gives a comprehensive vocabulary for understanding recent and on-going debates. Using the work of T. H.

2500|$|One unanticipated {{consequence}} {{of the rise of}} Pullman cars in the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was their effect on civil rights and African-American culture. Each Pullman car was staffed by a uniformed porter. The majority of Pullman Porters were African Americans. While still a menial job in many respects, Pullman offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, in addition to a chance for travel, and it was a well regarded job in the African-American community of the time. The pullman attendants, regardless of their true name, were traditionally referred to as [...] "George" [...] by the travelers, the name of the company's founder, George Pullman. The Pullman company was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States. Subsequently, railway porters fought for <b>political</b> <b>recognition</b> and were eventually unionized. Their union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, became an important source of strength for the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement in the early 20th century, notably under the leadership of A. Philip Randolph. Because they moved about the country, Pullman porters also became an important means of communication for news and cultural information of all kinds. The African-American newspaper, the Chicago Defender, gained a national circulation in this way. Porters also used to re-sell phonograph records bought in the great metropolitan centres, greatly adding to the distribution of jazz and blues and the popularity of the artists.|$|E
2500|$|The Democrats won easy {{landslide}} {{victories in}} 1932 and 1934, {{and an even}} bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed. The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholic, Jewish, and black people. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of <b>political</b> <b>recognition,</b> labor union membership, and relief jobs. The cities' political machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilized their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief. FDR won the vote of practically every demographic in 1936, including [...] taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However, the Protestant middle class voters turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system. However, for Roosevelt {{to win the presidency}} in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm rural voters. The machines came through for him. [...] The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, Tammany Hall in Manhattan. There he supported the complicated coalition built around the nominal Republican Fiorello La Guardia, [...] and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.|$|E
