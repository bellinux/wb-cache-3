Fremantle Prison was partially used as a military gaol during both world wars. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942, which remained opened after the war. Pardelup Prison Farm was another prison outstation established in 1927 to reduce overcrowding at Fremantle. Both facilities were part of reforms made to the prison system, but significant changes to the operation of Fremantle Prison did not begin until the 1960s. Comptroller General Colin Campbell introduced expedient prisoner assessments, officer training, work release programs, and social workers and welfare officers.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} initial impact {{assessment}} regarding {{the introduction of}} new legislative responsibilities at the Land level in a case study of <b>prisons</b> <b>policy</b> (Strafvollzug). Combining an analysis of new legislation produced across the 16 Länder since the responsibility for <b>prisons</b> <b>policy</b> was transferred to the Land level, and insights into the mechanics of policy development obtained through a series of interviews with senior politicians and officials, this article finds that the desire among Länder to legislative independently has varied, with substantial backing for co-ordination in the development of new legislation. This has helped to confound expectations of a ‘competition of harshness’ which many expected to result from decentralisation. However, even before the 2006 reforms, there were substantial variations between the Länder when it came to implementing <b>prisons</b> <b>policy,</b> so consideration of the sub-national level in this area remains essential...|$|R

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: October 26, 2017 "Since prison life {{is out of}} common people’s sight, the media have a particularly important role in legitimating or, conversely, de-legitimating public discourses and policies about punishment, incarceration and rehabilitation. In the present study, our analysis was grounded in 83 news, 55 of these about men prisons, 24 about women prisons and 4 news about public policies in general, although having specificities about men’s and women’s prisons published in a Portuguese national newspaper between 2005 and 2014. The analysis suggests that, with very few exceptions, gender {{is an important issue}} in the media construction for men’s and women’s prisons and male and female inmates; gender norms of masculinity and femininity are essentialized, justifying different practices of control in <b>prison</b> <b>policies.</b> Dangerous, violent, resistant and manipulative male inmates call for <b>prison</b> <b>policies</b> based on risk control and managerialism, whereas docile and reliable female inmates call for policies grounded on rehabilitation but also security. Apart from this representation, our analysis also shows that the news, in general, tends to align with a reformist approach, failing to interrogate the wider role of imprisonment in social control or to discuss its alternatives. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

At the time, McVeigh had already been {{convicted and sentenced to}} death for the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death row inmates. A federal inmate challenged the policy in Hammer v.

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with {{key players in the}} policy process and an analysis of documentary materials, this article explores the historical shifts within <b>prison</b> drugs <b>policy,</b> locates these changes within a wider policy context, and assesses the role and influence of policy networks in this development. Since 1980, <b>prison</b> drugs <b>policy</b> can be divided into four main phases of development which have hinged upon complex patterns of conflict, contradiction and convergence between 'treatment' and 'punishment'. Throughout the phases, particular 'policy networks' have evolved around drug-related issues within prisons, expanding and becoming more complex in their structure and operation over time. The role of these networks in relation to setting the policy agenda and responding to it has shifted over the various phases. Their power lies in their attempts to contain, balance and negotiate the key contradiction between 'treatment' and 'punishment' within <b>prison</b> drugs <b>policy...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soon {{after the}} close of {{military}} operations in the American Civil War, another war began over {{how it would be}} remembered by future generations. The prisoner-of-war issue has figured prominently in Northern and Southern writing about the conflict. Northerners used tales of Andersonville to demonize the Confederacy, while Southerners vilified Northern <b>prison</b> <b>policies</b> to show the depths to which Yankees had sunk to attain victory. Over the years the postwar Northern portrayal of Andersonville as fiendishly designed to kill prisoners in mass quantities has largely been dismissed. The Lost Cause characterization of Union <b>prison</b> <b>policies</b> as criminally negligent and inhumane, however, has shown remarkable durability. Northern officials have been portrayed as turning their military prisons into concentration camps where Southern prisoners were poorly fed, clothed, and sheltered, resulting in inexcusably high numbers of deaths. Andersonvilles of the North, by James M. Gillispie, represents the first broad study to argue that the image of Union prison officials as negligent and cruel to Confederate prisoners is severely flawed. This study is not an attempt to “whitewash” Union <b>prison</b> <b>policies</b> or make light of Confederate prisoner mortality. But once the careful reader disregards unreliable postwar polemics, and focuses exclusively on the more reliable wartime records and documents from both Northern and Southern sources, then a much different, less negative, picture of Northern prison life emerges. While life in Northern prisons was difficult and potentially deadly, no evidence exists of a conspiracy to neglect or mistreat Southern captives. Confederate prisoners’ suffering and death were due to a number of factors, but it would seem that Yankee apathy and malice were rarely among them. In fact, likely the most significant single factor in Confederate (and all) prisoner mortality during the Civil War was the halting of the prisoner exchange cartel in the late spring of 1863. Though Northern officials have long been condemned for coldly calculating that doing so aided their war effort, the evidence convincingly suggests that the South’s staunch refusal to exchange black Union prisoners was actually the key sticking point in negotiations to resume exchanges from mid- 1863 to 1865. Ultimately Gillispie concludes that Northern prisoner-of-war policies were far more humane and reasonable than generally depicted. His careful analysis will be welcomed by historians of the Civil War, the South, and of American history...|$|R
