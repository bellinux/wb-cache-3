5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a <b>personalty</b> of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|In many jurisdictions (including many American states), {{there is}} a general tax levied {{periodically}} on residents who own personal property (<b>personalty)</b> within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in that state as well.|$|E
500|$|Halliday and his wife, Eliza W. Halliday, {{separated}} {{from each other}} and had a legally binding separation agreement in force {{at the time of his}} death. [...] His wife dissented from the terms of his will and instead took her dower rights under Illinois law, which at that time amounted to one third of all property and <b>personalty</b> in his estate. [...] Soon after his wife was granted her dower rights, his wife and six children created the W. P. Halliday trust and funded it in 1900 with $1,062,921.88 from Halliday's estate. [...] In 1939 the estate was held to be an association, and tax deficiencies were levied against the trust beneficiaries for unpaid taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service. [...] Over the course of time the trust was in existence the beneficiaries expanded the trust holdings through the purchase of stock, real estate, and businesses and the majority of these investments were very profitable.|$|E

The only thing certain about us is that we are too many." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this Thesis {{is to give}} a picture of Lady Gregory's {{contribution}} to the Irish dramatic and literary movement. In the First Chapter {{the story of her}} life is outlined. Not until she had reached middle age, did she take part in the artistic and intellectual life of her country. Under the influence of W. B. Yeats' personality the slumbering spark of her creative and organising powers was kindled and she and her home at Coole became the centre of a revival of Irish culture. The Second Chapter describes her manifold activities as managing director, producer and playwright for the Irish theatre; her great success in the American tour, and her close connection with the Abbey until 1928. The Third and Fourth Chapters give a detailed account of Lady Gregory's dramatic work. Letters, notes, and remarks made at random in "Our Irish Theatre" have been examined in order to trace her artistic process. Lady Gregory's dramatic technique is then discussed and the plays themselves are dealt with in four groups: Comedies of Mythmaking, Tragedies, Tragi-Comedies, and Wonder Plays. The Fifth Chapter shows Lady Gregory's share in the revival and popularisation of the old sagas and her unwearying activities as a collector of folk-lore. The Sixth Chapter is devoted to the relation between Lady Gregory and W. B, Yeats: the <b>personalties,</b> the plays written in collaboration, and the stimulus W. B, Yeats' dramatic work received from Lady Gregory's epics. The Seventh Chapter examines the special use Lady Gregory made of the Anglo-Irish dialect as a medium both for stage purposes and for her narrative prose. In the Concluding Remarks the various aspects of her activities and achievements are summed up. <p...|$|R

60|$|The Senior Episcop {{opened and}} read the last will and {{testament}} of Arthur Murgess, attorney-at-law. It provided in a few words that all his estate, real and personal, should pass unreservedly to his friend, Paul Owen, of Christchurch, Oxford. It was whispered about that, besides the house and grounds, the <b>personalty</b> might be sworn at £8000, a vast sum to those simple people.|$|E

6000|$|... "The will {{of which}} the latter claimed probate was one dated 1891, and {{had been made by}} Mr. Brooks during a severe illness which {{threatened}} to end his days. This will had been deposited in the hands of Messrs. Wethered and Hibbert, solicitors to the deceased, and by it Mr. Brooks left his <b>personalty</b> equally divided between his two sons, but had left his business entirely to his youngest son, with a charge of £2000 a year upon it, payable to Percival. You see that Murray Brooks therefore had a very deep interest in that second will being found null and void.|$|E

Millionaire Brooks {{had been buried}} with due pomp and magnificence, and his will had been proved (his business and <b>personalty</b> being estimated at £2,500,000) by Percival Gordon Brooks, his eldest son and sole executor. The younger son, Murray, who had devoted {{the best years of}} his life to being a friend and companion to his father, while Percival ran after ballet-dancers and music-hall stars--Murray, who had avowedly been the apple of his father's eye in consequence--was left with a miserly pittance of £300 a year, and no share whatever in the gigantic business of Brooks & Sons, bacon curers, of Dublin.|$|E
60|$|When my old {{and true}} friend, Stephen Strong, {{died on the}} night of my election, it was found that he was even richer than had been supposed, indeed his <b>personalty</b> was sworn at 191,000 pounds, besides which he left real estate in shops, houses and land to the value of about 23,000 pounds. Almost all of this was devised to his widow absolutely, so that she could dispose of it in {{whatever}} fashion pleased her. Indeed, there was but one other bequest, that of the balance of the 10,000 pounds which the testator had deposited {{in the hands of a}} trustee for my benefit. This was now left to me absolutely. I learned the fact from Mrs. Strong herself as we returned from the funeral.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{take the}} death duties. One would suppose from what one hears in London {{and from the}} outcry that is raised, that {{the whole of the}} death duties were {{collected}} from the peers and from the county families. Again I say, look at the facts. The Inland Revenue report for last year shows that £313,000,000 of property passing on death became subject to death duties, and of that sum £228,000,000 was <b>personalty</b> and not real estate, leaving only £85,000,000 real estate, and of that £85,000,000 only £22,000,000 was agricultural land. These death duties are represented as being levied entirely upon a small class of landed gentry and nobility, but, as a matter of fact, there is collected from that class in respect of agricultural land only seven per cent. of the whole amount of money which the Exchequer derives from death duties.[19] ...|$|E
60|$|And {{so on the}} {{following}} day Angela and Pigott returned to the Abbey House, but they both felt that it was a sad home-coming. Indeed, if there had been no other cause for melancholy, the sight of Philip's face was enough to excite it in the most happy-minded person. Not that Angela saw much of him, however, for they still kept to their old habit of not living together. All day her father was shut up in his room transacting business that had reference to the accession of his property and the settlement of George's affairs; for his cousin had died intestate, so he took his <b>personalty</b> and wound up the estate as heir-at-law. At night, however, he would go out and walk for miles, and in all weathers--he seemed to dread spending the dark hours at home.|$|E
60|$|Of all our {{tremendous}} journey {{across the}} desert until we had passed the forest and reached the plains which surrounded the mountains of Mur, there are, I think, but few incidents with which the reader need be troubled. The first of these was at Assouan, where a letter and various telegrams overtook Captain Orme, which, as by this time we had become intimate, he showed to me. They informed him that the clandestine infant whom his uncle left behind him had suddenly sickened and died of some childish ailment, {{so that he was}} once again heir to the large property which he thought he had lost, since the widow only took a life interest in some of the <b>personalty.</b> I congratulated him and said I supposed this meant that we should not have the pleasure of his company to Mur.|$|E
6000|$|... "To turn {{to another}} subject. I {{am glad to}} be able to inform you--you will please accept this as an {{official}} notice of the fact--that on reading a copy of your uncle's will, which by his directions was handed to me after his death, I find that he has died much better off even than I expected. The net <b>personalty</b> will amount to quite 100,000 pounds, and there is large realty, of which at present I do not know the value. All this is left to Mary with the fullest possible powers of disposal. You and I are appointed executors with a complimentary legacy of 500 pounds to you, and but 100 pounds to me. However, the testator 'in consideration of the forthcoming marriage between his son Morris and my daughter Mary, remits all debts and obligations that may be due to his estate by the said Richard Monk, Lieutenant-Colonel, Companion of the Bath, and an executor of this will.' This amounts to something, of course, but I will not trouble you with details at the moment.|$|E

6000|$|The {{document}} {{began by}} stating that the testator's former will was declared null and void {{on account of the}} [...] "treacherous and dishonourable conduct of his son Philip." [...] It then, in brief but sweeping terms, bequeathed and devised to trustees, of whom Philip was not one, the unentailed property and <b>personalty</b> to be held by them: firstly, for the benefit of any son that might be born to the said disinherited Philip by his wife Hilda--the question of daughters being, probably by accident, passed over in silence--and failing such issue, then to the testator's nephew, George Caresfoot, absolutely, subject, however, to the following curious condition: Should the said George Caresfoot, either by deed of gift or will, attempt to convey the estate to his cousin Philip, or to descendants of the said Philip, then the gift over to the said George was to be of none effect, and the whole was to pass to some distant cousins of the testator's who lived in Scotland. Then followed several legacies and one charge on the estate to the extent of 1000 pounds a year payable to the separate use of the aforesaid Hilda Caresfoot for life, and reverting at death to the holder of the estate.|$|E

His <b>personalty</b> was swallowed up in paying his debts, and the Welland estate was so heavily charged with annuities to his distant relatives that only a mere pittance was left for her. She was reducing the establishment to the narrowest compass compatible with decent gentility. The horses were sold one by one; the carriages also; the greater part of the house was shut up, and she resided in the smallest rooms. All that was allowed to remain of her former contingent of male servants were an odd man and a boy. Instead of using a carriage she now drove about in a donkey-chair, the said boy walking in front to clear the way and keep the animal in motion; while she wore, so his informants reported, not an ordinary widow's cap or bonnet, but something even plainer, the black material being drawn tightly round her face, giving her features a small, demure, devout cast, very pleasing to the eye.|$|E
