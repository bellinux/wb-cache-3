5|$|In the mid-1970s, Kneale {{made his}} only attempt at writing a stage play. Called Crow, {{it was based}} upon the memoirs of real-life Manx slaver Captain Hugh Crow. Kneale {{was unable to find}} backing to produce the play for the stage, but sold the script to ATV who <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> {{pre-production}} for television. However, shortly before filming it was cancelled by order of ATV's managing director, Lew Grade—Kneale was never told why.|$|E
5|$|Bill Nighy as Davy Jones: Captain of the Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones {{was once}} a human being who was unable to bear the pain of losing his true love. He carved out his heart and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Dead Man's Chest, then buried it in a secret location. He has become a bizarre {{creature}} – part octopus, part lobster, part man. Jones collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the fabric varnish had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, {{at which point the}} wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|E

5|$|Though {{production}} of hammered coinage ceased in France in 1645, edge lettering wasn't immediately reintroduced to that nation's milled coinage. At some point prior to 1679, Jean Castaing, a French engineer, invented a machine to apply edge lettering to coins, and in 1685, {{he approached the}} French government with a proposal to use his machine in that nation's mints. King Louis XIV favoured the invention, but his financial minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, believed {{that it would not}} be economically viable to pay the expenses required to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> use. In 1686, over Colbert's objection, the French Council of State entered a contract with Castaing wherein all of the nation's gold and silver coinage would include edge lettering created by his machine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, {{the head}} {{executives}} of Nacional, Roberto Espil y José Usera Bermúdez, idealized a {{competition between the}} national champions of each Conmebol member. After analyzing the geographical distributions and distances, Espil devised a project in 1946 which also included the runners-up of every national league. However, it was Colo-Colo's head executive, Don Robinson Alvarez Marín, that first <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> practice and hatched the idea in the late 1930s. In 1948, Don Luis Valenzuela, {{as president of the}} confederation, finally set into motion the antecedent of the Copa Libertadores: the Copa de Campeones.|$|E
25|$|John Connolly gave Shapiro {{from his}} most recent output, and Patrick Connolly {{said they had been}} able to make three pounds of meth since May of that year. Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P. While he mostly watched as the trio made their meth, at one point, according to later court testimony, he and Russell helped pick up some pieces of dropped aluminum foil and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a flask. Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the radio}} {{stations}} loved the single and began to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> regular rotation because after it was played, the phones would ring constantly with inquisitive listeners wondering where the song came from. Jars of Clay had now played a few festivals {{in the summer of}} 1995 and decided to sign up for another tour opening for PFR and Brent Bourgeois. Following this tour, they learned that they had been invited to open for Michael W. Smith on his national tour in early 1996 and accepted the invitation with gratitude. A concert at The Foundry in Nashville was held {{to raise money for the}} Child Abuse Center of Middle Tennessee and the Drummer Boy Christmas EP was released to raise money for this agency as well. Special guests at the concert included Phil Keaggy and Cindy Morgan.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Dennis {{also built}} one 12-metre Enviro500 {{demonstrator}} for long-term loan. It was first loaned to Community Transit between 2007 and 2009 which <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> service on 1 August 2007, {{the bus was}} used on commuter routes between Seattle and various points in Snohomish County during its first year in operation. From September 2010, it was loaned to Strathcona County Transit on a one-year lease for the operator's one-year-long double-decker pilot project. The pilot {{is part of an}} exploration of different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on the high-demand commuter routes, which are between Strathcona County and Edmonton; an articulated bus is also being evaluated as an alternative and there is no commitment to put any Alexander Dennis model or any double-decker design into permanent service. This bus becomes the first double-decker to be used for regular transit service in Alberta.|$|E

25|$|According to Indian {{military}} sources, the Pakistani Army {{prepared a}} plan called Operation Gulmarg and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> action {{as early as}} 20 August, {{a few days after}} Pakistan's independence. The plan got accidentally revealed to an Indian officer, Major O. S. Kalkat serving with the Bannu Brigade. According to the plan, 20 lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of Abbottabad on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. Ten lashkars were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and another ten lashkars were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Bhimber and Rawalakot with a view to advance to Jammu. Detailed arrangements for the military leadership and armaments were described in the plan.|$|E
