5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake.

Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had <b>passed</b> <b>away</b> shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation.
