Whether induced T 2 DM and T 1 DM differently affect the gastric GLP- 1 R expression is not known. This study assessed extrapancreatic GLP- 1 R system in glandular stomach of rodents with {{different types of}} experimental diabetes. T 2 DM and T 1 DM were induced in Psammomys obesus (PO) by high-energy (HE) diet and by streptozotocin (STZ) in Sprague Dawly (SD) rats, respectively. GLP- 1 R expression was determined in glandular stomach by RT PCR and immunohistomorphological analysis. The mRNA expression and cellular association of the GLP- 1 R in <b>principal</b> <b>glands</b> were similar in control PO and SD rats. However, nutrient and chemical induced diabetes resulted in opposite alterations of glandular GLP- 1 R expression. Diabetic PO demonstrated increased GLP- 1 R mRNA expression, intensity of cellular GLP- 1 R immunostaining, and frequency of GLP- 1 R positive cells in the neck area of <b>principal</b> <b>glands</b> compared with controls. In contrast, SD diabetic rats demonstrated decreased GLP- 1 mRNA, cellular GLP- 1 R immunoreactivity, and frequency of GLP- 1 R immunoreactive cells in the neck area compared with controls. In conclusion, nutrient and chemical induced experimental diabetes result in distinct opposite alterations of GLP- 1 R expression in glandular stomach. These results suggest that induced T 1 DM and T 2 DM may differently modulate GLP- 1 R system in enteropancreatic axis...|$|E
40|$|The western chinch bug, Blissus occiduus Barber, is {{a serious}} pest of buffalograss, Buchloe dactyloides (Nuttall) due to {{physical}} and chemical damage caused during the feeding process. Although previous work has investigated the feeding behaviors of chinch bugs in the Blissus complex, no study to date has explored salivary gland morphology and the associated salivary complex of this insect. Whole and sectioned B. occiduus salivary glands were visualized using light and scanning electron microscopy to determine overall structure and cell types of the salivary glands and their individual lobes.

To link structure with function, the salivary gland proteome was characterized using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The salivary proteome analysis resulted in B. occiduus sequences matching 228 nonhomologous protein sequences of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), with many specific to the proteins present in the salivary proteome of A. pisum. A number of sequences were assigned the molecular function of hydrolase and oxido-reductase activity, with one specific protein sequence revealing a peroxidase-like function.

Basal levels of all four transcripts were consistently higher in the tolerant buffalograss {{when compared with the}} susceptible genotype. The four defense-related transcripts also exhibited differential expression between infested and control plants for both the tolerant and susceptible buffalograsses. Differences in total peroxidase activity were detected between control and infested plants, and basal peroxidase activity was higher in the tolerant genotype. ^ Next generation sequencing examined the transcriptomes of tolerant and susceptible buffalograsses in response to chinch bug feeding. Sequence descriptions and gene ontology terms were assigned to over 1, 600 differentially expressed genes. Several specific defense-related transcripts were differentially expressed and were described within the tolerant and susceptible buffalograsses. Seven peroxidase transcripts had higher basal expression levels in tolerant plants than in their susceptible counterparts. Comparison of control and infested transcriptomic data and subsequent comparisons of tolerant and susceptible genotypes revealed genes with significant levels of change, but observed only in the tolerant genotype. ^ Finally, the salivary glands of B. occiduus were investigated to determine the overall structure and their potential functions. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed a pair of tri-lobed <b>principal</b> <b>glands</b> and a pair of tubular accessory glands of differing cellular types.

Here, we describe the ultrastructure of the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, which is a major component of the pentatomid pest complex on soybeans, Glycine max, in the neotropics. Our results revealed a salivary gland complex consisting of two lobes (i. e., anterior and posterior), with a constriction between them (i. e., the hilum), in which the salivary and accessory gland ducts are inserted. The <b>principal</b> <b>gland</b> epithelium has a single layer of cells lining an enlarged lumen filled with saliva, and these cells are cuboidal, rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum and secretory vesicles, with well-developed nuclei, all of which are typical features of protein-secreting cells. We report, {{for the first time in}} insects, the presence of a layer of muscle cells surrounding the columnar hilum epithelium. The accessory salivary gland cells are cuboidal with nuclei containing condensed chromatin and cytoplasm rich in vacuoles and rough endoplasmic reticulum, indicating the potential involvement of these glands in water transport/secretion. The lumen content of each lobe of the <b>principal</b> <b>gland</b> suggests that the lobes produce different compounds.

40|$|A assincronia entre a dinâmica populacional de pragas e de seus inimigos naturais pode resultar em surtos populacionais de pragas. Isto se deve, dentre outros fatores, à ausência de predadores para a colonização das lavouras e, posteriormente, à falta de alimento para a sustentação desses insetos. O estabelecimento de inimigos naturais é, normalmente, mais lento e, atingem populações expressivas após os picos populacionais das pragas. A compreensão do papel das plantas na dinâmica populacional pode permitir a manipulação de predadores onívoros em sistemas agrícolas e melhorar a eficiência desses inimigos naturais. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) apresenta potencial para o controle biológico de pragas e, por isto, a morfologia das glândulas salivares, as características reprodutivas e os parâmetros das tabelas de fertilidade e esperança de vida desse predador foram estudadas com diferentes plantas e pupas de Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) em laboratório. Os tratamentos foram: T 1 - folhas de eucalipto + pupas de T. molitor + água, T 2 - folhas de soja + T. molitor + água, T 3 - folhas de feijão + T. molitor + água, T 4 - folhas de algodoeiro + T. molitor + água, T 5 - folhas de tomateiro + T. molitor + água e T 6 - T. molitor + água (testemunha). Os casais de S. cincticeps receberam água, diariamente, e duas pupas de T. molitor três a quatro vezes por semana. Morfologicamente, o sistema salivar de S. cincticeps é constituído por um par de glândulas salivares principais e outro de glândulas acessórias, no protórax. As principais são bilobadas com lóbulo {{anterior}} esférico, menor que o posterior que apresenta forma de saco alongado e as acessórias, longas e tubulares originando-se na porção terminal do ducto acessório, que sofre um abaulamento. Quanto aos parâmetros reprodutivos, o número de ovos por fêmea de S. cincticeps foi menor sem planta que nos demais tratamentos e o de ninfas por fêmea, maior em folhas de eucalipto, soja, feijão ou algodoeiro que com tomateiro ou sem planta. As taxas líquidas de reprodução (Ro) de fêmeas de S. cincticeps foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (68, 39), soja (57, 28) ou feijão (58, 69) e menor sem planta com 15, 06 fêmeas produzidas por fêmea. As taxas intrínsecas de crescimento (rm) foram maiores com folhas de eucalipto (0, 10) ou de soja (0, 10) e menor sem planta com 0, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. A razão finita de aumento populacional (&# 955;) foi maior com folhas de soja (1, 11), eucalipto (1, 11) ou feijão (1, 10) e menor sem planta com 1, 07 fêmeas/fêmea de S. cincticeps acrescentadas à população por dia. Plantas de eucalipto, soja ou feijão melhoraram as características biológicas de S. cincticeps, o que é importante para esse predador no controle biológico de pragas nessas culturas. No entanto, o impacto negativo de plantas de tomateiro indica que o controle biológico de pragas nessa cultura com S. cincticeps pode ter baixa eficiência. The asynchrony between {{population dynamics}} of pests and their natural enemies {{may lead to}} population outbreaks of pests. This is due, among other factors {{to the absence of}} predators for the colonization of crops and, subsequently, the lack of food to sustain these natural enemies. The establishment of natural enemies is usually slower and reaches significant populations after peak of pests. Understanding the role of plants in population dynamics may allow for the manipulation of omnivorous predators in agricultural systems and improve the efficiency of natural enemies. Supputius cincticeps (Stal) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) has potential for biological pest controls. The objective of this research was to study the morphology of salivary glands, reproductive characteristics and parameters of fertility and life expectancy tables of the predator S. cincticeps with different plants and Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) pupae in the laboratory. The treatments were: T 1 - eucalyptus leaves + T. molitor pupae + water, T 2 - soybean leaves + T. molitor pupae + water, T 3 - bean leaves + T. molitor pupae + water, T 4 - cotton leaves + T. molitor pupae + water, T 5 - tomato leaves + T. molitor pupae + water and T 6 - T molitor pupae + water (control). The pairs of S. cincticeps received water daily, and two pupae of T. molitor three to four times a week. The salivary system of S. cincticeps is formed by a pair of <b>principal</b> <b>glands</b> and another pair of accessory glands in the prothorax. The <b>principal</b> <b>glands</b> are bilobed with a spherical anterior lobe, which is smaller than the posterior lobe that presents a prolonged sack form. The accessory glands present a long and tubular form that arises from the terminal portion of the accessory duct that suffers a camber. The number of eggs per female of S. cincticeps was lowest without plants. The number of nymphs per female was higher in eucalyptus, soybean, bean and cotton leaves than in tomato leaves and without plants. The net reproductive rates (Ro) of females S. cincticeps were highest on eucalyptus (68. 39), soybean (57. 28) and bean (58. 69) leaves, and lowest without plants with 15. 06 females added per female of this predator. The intrinsic rates of increase (rm) were highest with eucalyptus (0. 10) and soybean (0. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 0. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. The finite rate of increase (&# 955;) was highest with soybean (1. 11), eucalyptus (1. 11) and bean (1. 10) leaves, and lowest without plants with 1. 07 females/female of S. cincticeps added to the population per day. Eucalyptus, soybean and bean plants improved the biological characteristics of S. cincticeps which is important for this predator in the biological control of pests in these crops. However, the negative impact of tomato plants indicates that the biological control of pests in this culture with S. cincticeps may have low efficiency...|$|E

Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), a plant DNA {{virus in}} the family Nanoviridae, is {{transmitted}} by the banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa, in a circulative nonpropagative manner. Information available on the interactions between BBTV and its vector is very limited. The goal of this work is to foster {{a basic understanding of}} BBTV-aphid interaction that will allow the generation of new options for the management of the disease. I have developed an immunofluorescence assay that allowed us to specifically localize BBTV into the anterior midgut (stomach) and into specific cells forming the <b>principal</b> salivary <b>glands</b> within the aphid vector. In order to examine the translocation and retention of BBTV into the aphid vector, I used timecourse experiments and transmission assays coupled with real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays on dissected aphid tissues. These results indicate that BBTV is internalized into the anterior midgut in which it accumulates and is retained at concentrations higher than either in the haemolymph or in the <b>principal</b> salivary <b>glands.</b> I document that the anterior midgut and <b>principal</b> salivary <b>glands</b> can have direct contact within the aphid body, suggesting a possible haemolymph-independent translocation path. Through additional experiments, I have analyzed the interaction between GroEL proteins produced by the endosymbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, harbored within the aphid, and BBTV viral particles. Interaction assays were performed using immunocapture PCR, dot-blot, and far-western blot assays. However, I failed to obtain evidence of BBTV-GroEL interaction. Furthermore, I have used transmission assays, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence to analyze the localization, accumulation, and transmission efficiency of BBTV across 4 different lineages of Pentalonia, including Pentalonia caladii, a species colonizing heliconias, ginger and taro. Immunofluorescence assays showed similar BBTV translocation pattern among the 4 Pentalonia lineages. The results obtained showed {{for the first time that}} P. caladii is a competent vector of BBTV. Finally, I used fluorescent markers to study the process of cellular internalization in guts and salivary glands of P. nigronervosa. The data obtained suggests that BBTV does not use receptor-mediated endocytosis as described for aphid-trasnmitted luteoviruses. Therefore, I discuss the possible alternative mechanisms of virus internalization...|$|R
40|$|Little cicadas are homopteran {{insect pests}} of {{sugarcane}} plantations. As these insects suck out the sap from the leaf parenchyma, they inoculate a toxic saliva that damages the plant vessels, thus promoting {{the loss of}} glucose by the affected plant. The morphological and histological analyses of the salivary glands of the little cicada Mahanarva posticata, revealed that these glands are formed by 2 portions: one portion comprises a group of acini and has been denominated as the principal gland; the second portion is filamentous in nature and has been denominated as the accessory gland; it is formed by very long and fine filaments. The acinous portion of the gland can be subdivided into 2 lobes: an anterior lobe formed by 3 lobules (I, II, III), and a posterior lobe formed by lobule IV and the excretory duct. Histologically, the salivary glands showed that the filaments are empty sutructures composed by several internal channels with secretion granules being observed in the cytoplasm of {{the cells of the}} secretory filaments. Lobules I and II of the <b>principal</b> <b>gland</b> are characterized by being highly basophilic and for accumulating a large amount of secretion in both the cytoplasm of the cells and inside secretion vesicles.

40|$|BGPI : équipe 2 Nanoviruses are {{multipartite}} ssDNA viruses {{transmitted by}} aphid vectors. Their {{mode of transmission}} {{is believed to be}} of the circulative non-propagative type [1, 2], but a recent analysis of the relative frequency of the distinct genome segments in aphids versus in plants indicated a more complex relationship [3]. Previous microscopy studies using immunofluorescence against the coat protein of Banana bunshy top virus (BBTV) confirmed that the virus is detected solely in gut and <b>principal</b> salivary <b>gland</b> cells of its aphid vector Pentalonia nigronervosa [4]. However, the subcellular localization and the cell compartment(s) with which the virus associates during transcytosis could not be determined [5]. Another unresolved question is whether, as demonstrated in monopartite viruses, nanoviruses are submitted to strong bottleneck during aphid transmission (see the abstract by Romain Gallet). In that case, when the virus particles traverse cellular barrier, different particles containing different segments may be separated, increasing the chance of loosing genomic information (loosing segments) and thus aborting transmission. We have revisited the cycle of a nanovirus, the Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, within the body of its aphid vector, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a combination of FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization), immunolabelling, confocal and electron microscopy. FISH labeling of viral DNA indicates that the virus massively accumulates in all cells of the midgut but is virtually absent in all other regions of the gut. At the salivary glands, the virus is very much restricted not only to the <b>principal</b> salivary <b>glands</b> but also to a single cell type within these glands. No signal could ever be detected in any other organ. When using DNA-FISH probes specific to distinct segments, we could demonstrate that all segments are always colocalized within the midgut, {{and to a lesser extent}} also within the salivary gland cells. This observation contrasts with the situation in infected plant cells (see abstract from Anne Sicard), and indicate that the size of the viral population traversing cellular barriers within the aphid is often sufficiently large to prevent the loss of rare genome segments. Finally, we have indication that the genome segment N controls internalization of the virus within aphid gut cells. We currently investigate the subcellular compartment with which the virus associates, and the mode of action of the NSP protein (product of gene N...|$|R

The virus is transmitted in a circulative non-propagative manner by the banana aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel. In this work, we examined the localization, accumulation, and transmission efficiency of BBTV in four laboratory-established lineages of Pentalonia aphids derived from four different host plants: taro (Colocasia esculenta), heliconia (Heliconia spp.), red ginger (Alpinia purpurata), and banana (Musa sp.). Mitochondrial sequencing identified three and one lineages as Pentalonia caladii van der Goot, a recently proposed species, and P. nigronervosa, respectively. Microsatellite analysis separated the aphid lineages into four distinct genotypes. The transmission of BBTV was tested using leaf disk and whole-plant assays, both of which showed that all four lineages are competent vectors of BBTV, although the P. caladii from heliconia transmitted BBTV to the leaf disks at a significantly lower rate than did P. nigronervosa. The concentration of BBTV in dissected guts, haemolymph, and salivary glands was quantified by real-time PCR. The BBTV titer reached similar concentrations in the guts, haemolymph, and salivary glands of aphids from all four lineages tested.

By using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the transcript and the protein were localized to a subset of secretory cells in <b>principal</b> salivary <b>glands.</b> Protein C 002, whose sequence contains an N-terminal secretion signal, is injected into the host plant during aphid feeding. By using the electrical penetration graph method on c 002 -knockdown aphids, we find that the knockdown affects several aspects of foraging and feeding, with the result that the c 002 -knockdown aphids spend very little time in contact with phloem sap in sieve elements.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyGerald R. ReeckJohn C. ReeseSalivary {{secretions}} are a {{key component}} of aphid-plant interactions. Aphids’ salivary proteins interact with plant tissues, gaining access to phloem sap and eliciting responses which may benefit the insect. In an effort to isolate and identify key components in salivary secretions, we created a salivary gland cDNA library. Several thousand randomly selected cDNA clones were sequenced. We grouped these sequences into 1769 sets of essentially identical sequences, or clusters. About 22 % of the clusters matched clearly to (non-aphid) proteins of known function. Among our cDNAs, we have identified putative oxido-reductases and hydrolases that may be involved in the insect's attack on plant tissue. C 002 represents an abundant transcript among the genes expressed in the salivary glands. This cDNA encodes a novel protein that fails to match to proteins outside of aphids and is of unknown function. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized C 002 in the same sub-set of cells within the <b>principal</b> salivary <b>gland.</b> C 002 protein was detected in fava beans that were exposed to aphids, verifying that C 002 protein is a secreted protein. Injection of siC 002 -RNA caused depletion of C 002 transcript levels dramatically over a 3 day period after injection. With a lag of 1 – 2 days, the siC 002 -RNA injected insects died, on average 8 days before the death of control insects injected with siRNA for green fluorescent protein. It appears, therefore, that siRNA injections of adults will be a useful tool in studying the roles of individual transcripts in aphid salivary glands...|$|R

Protein identification was performed by searching MS data against the official protein set from the current pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genome assembly and revealed 12 and 7 proteins in the saliva of S. avenae and M. dirhodum, respectively. When combined with a comparable dataset from A. pisum, only three individual proteins were common to all the aphid species; two paralogues of the GMC oxidoreductase family (glucose dehydrogenase; GLD) and ACYPI 009881, an aphid specific protein previously identified as a putative component of the salivary sheath. Antibodies were designed from translated protein sequences obtained from partial cDNA sequences for ACYPI 009881 and both saliva associated GLDs. The antibodies detected all parent proteins in secreted saliva from the three aphid species, but could only detect ACYPI 009881, and not saliva associated GLDs, in protein extractions from the salivary glands.

40|$|In this paper, {{the mouth}} parts, their {{accessory}} organs, the penetration of stylets of aphids into {{the plants and}} the formation of galls and fading of plant leaves by aphids have been studied on about 40 species of aphids. The aphids feeding on the host plants were quickly paralyzed with ethyl ehter, and the plant portions with aphids were fixed in BOUIN'S or CARNOY'S or formalin solution for morphological and histological examinations. Paraffin sections, 15 μ thick, were stained with DELAFIELD'S hematoxyline and safranin T or acid fuchsin. The main results were summarized as follows: (1) Sucking pump, pharynx and hypopharynx are covered with epithelium. The cross section of sucking pump is polygonal in shape and pharynx is nearly semicircular, their posterior side much sclerotized, but anterior side membranous, and the dilator muscles arising from clypeus attach at center of anterior side in some aphids, but the muscles attach at sclerotized thin plate on the center of anterior side in Myzus persicae SULZER. Hypopharynx is thickened, sclerotized and bound with maxillary stylets on each side of anterior parts, at this part food canal of stylets is connected with food meatus, and salivary canal is with salivary meatus. (2) Salivary glands are in four pairs, namely principal, accessory, mandibular and maxillary glands. According to MILES (1955), Aphis craccivora KOCH secretes two types of saliva, highly viscous and watery liquid. The former is used for sheath formation, and is secreted from the mandibular and maxillary glands while the latter from the <b>principal</b> and accessory <b>glands</b> in Lachnus tropicalis VAN DER GOOT and Myzus persicae SULZER, and also it has been shown by NISHI (1962) that the inhibitor for activity of Tobacco mosaic virus is found in the salivary sheath formed in the plant tissues in Myzus persicae SULZER. It seems that the inhibitor is contained in the saliva of mandibular and maxillary glands. (3) Salivary sheaths are usually developed more distinctly within cells than between the cell walls and formed even in the air between the tip of rostrum and the surface of plant epidermis or between leaf sheath and stem when aphids feed on the stem through the sheath, and the stylet tracks are usually branched in the plant tissues especially in the phloem. (4) The stylets turn to right on the distal part of hypopharynx and have been turned about 90 degrees in the basal part of the labial groove. Such fact is observed in 8 species of aphids and seems to be useful for the reinforcement of stylets when inserted into the host plants. (5) Rostrum is shortened when stylets are inserted into the plant tissues. The first segment of rostrum is pale, very thin, and flexible. The second segment is longer but smaller in diameter than the first, and much more thickly chitinized, making a telescope within the first segment. The base of the second segment reaches the oesophageal ganglion in many species of aphids belonging to subfamily Aphidinae, and {{a large portion of the}} segment lie within the abdomen in some species belonging to sub family Lachninae especially in genus Stomaphis when the stylets are inserted deeply into plant tissues and almost all the second segment of rostrum is drawn in the first segment. (6) In most species the stylets are inserted into epidermis intercellularly, intracellularly or sometimes through stomata, but Ceratovacuna lanigera ZEHNTNER on Miscanthus sinensis, Schizolachnus orientalis TAKAHASHI on pine leaves and Melanaphis bambusae Fullaway on bamboo insert the stylets into the hosts always only through the stomata of the leaves. (7) In many species the stylets inserted in plant tissues pass usually intercellularly, and also frequently intracellularly even through cells, but Nipponaphis monzeni TAKAHASHI on Quercus glauca, Mindarus japonicus TAKAHASHI on twigs of Abies firma, Schizolachnus orientalis TAKAHASHI on pine leaves, Nippolachnus piri MATSUMURA on pear leaves and Greenidea nipponica SUENAGA on twigs of Quercus phylliraeoides insert the stylets only intracellularly. The stylets usually take a roundabout way to mechanical tissues, but Rhopalosiphum padi L. on rice plant, Chaitophorus chinensis TAKAHASHI on Salix babylonica and Nipponaphis monzeni TAKAHASHI on Quercus glauca pass intercellularly or intracellularly through the tissue. (8) The stylets usually reach phloem, especially sieve tube, but in a few cases reach xylem, bundle sheaths and palisade parenchyma. In the first instar larvae of fundatrices of Neothoracaphis yanonis MATSUMURA in the galls on Distylium racemosum insert the stylets into epidermis or mesophyll cells, but cannot reach them to the phloem, while in the following instar larvae, the adults of fundatrices and the second generation insert the stylets into the phloem. (9) Fundatrices of Myzus persicae SULZER cause the formation of roll galls along the main midrib of the young leaves of Prunus Persica. The galled leaves are about 0. 16 mm. thick, and their adaxial epidermis, mesophyll cells and intercellular space of spongy parenchyma are well developed but their cells are not increased in number, while normal leaves are about 0. 09 mm. thick in average. In the galls on the leaves of Distylium racemosum produced by Neothoracaphis yanonis MATSUMURA and those on Prunus Grayana by Myzus sp. the mesophyll of galled tissue can not be readily differentiated into various components of normal mesophyll, and the cells of galled tissues generally increase in number and enlarge inshape. (10) Aulacorthum kerriae SHINJI on Kerria japonica var. typica and Shinjia pteridifoliae SHINJI on Pteridium aquilium give rise to the fading in the leaves of host plants, and the chloroplasts in the cells of faded tissues become small in size and decrease in number...|$|R
