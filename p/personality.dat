5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline <b>personality</b> disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis.

Schizotypal <b>personality</b> disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Sports <b>Personality</b> of the Year is an awards {{ceremony}} {{that takes place}} annually in December. Devised by Paul Fox in 1954, it originally consisted of just one, the BBC Sports <b>Personality</b> of the Year Award. Several new awards have been introduced, and currently eight awards are presented. The first awards to be added were the Team of the Year and Overseas <b>Personality</b> awards, which were introduced in 1960. A Lifetime Achievement Award was first given in 1995 and again in 1996, and has been presented annually since 2001. In 1999, three more awards were introduced: the Helen Rollason Award, the Coach Award, and the Newcomer Award, which was renamed to Young Sports <b>Personality</b> of the Year in 2001. The newest is the Unsung Hero Award, first presented in 2003. In 2003, the 50th anniversary of the show was marked by a five-part series on BBC One called Simply The Best – Sports <b>Personality.</b> It was presented by Gary Lineker and formed part of a public vote to determine a special Golden Sports <b>Personality</b> of the Year. That year Steve Rider and Martyn Smith wrote a book reflecting on the 50-year history of the award and the programme. The event was held outside London {{for the first time}} in 2006, when tickets were made available to the public.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} explain such distortions of Black <b>personalities,</b> Kambon coins the terms African self-extension {{orientation}} and African self-consciousness. The African self-extension orientation {{is defined by}} Kambon as the biogenetic basis for African <b>personalities,</b> which Kambon argues to be innately distinct from European <b>personalities.</b> The ultimate expression of the African self-extension orientation is mediated by what Kambon terms African self-consciousness, which is under conscious regulation and is therefore sensitive to environmental context. This {{is to say that}} the full expression of African <b>personalities</b> is contingent on the alignment of the African self-extension orientation with an appropriate African culture, or “African cosmology”. Any other reality structure, under Kambon’s model, will inevitably prevent African <b>personalities</b> from developing naturally.|$|R
