5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the <b>President</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E

Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E

5|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} 27 April. Menem won the first round with 24.5 percent of the vote, followed by Kirchner with 22.2 percent. The conservative Ricardo López Murphy finished third, substantially behind the two main candidates. Since Menem was well short of the threshold required to win, a runoff election was scheduled for 18 May. He had a negative public image, and polls showed Kirchner receiving 60 to 70 percent of the vote. To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem {{pulled out of the}} runoff in a move criticized by the other candidates. The judiciary declined requests for a new election and refused to sanction a runoff election between Kirchner and López Murphy, although López Murphy said he would not participate. The election was validated by the Congress, and Kirchner became president on 25 May 2003. Kirchner's 22.2 percent is the lowest vote percentage ever recorded for an Argentine <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> free election.|$|E
5|$|Frog Fractions {{begins with}} a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player {{controls}} the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including lock-on targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, they can buy a warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for <b>president</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes. The game takes about one hour to complete.|$|E
