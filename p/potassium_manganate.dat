40|$|The {{effect of}} several saline {{solutions}} (as given by six salts) and salt stress (as given by 0. 1 - 2 m sodium chloride solutions) on the germination of seeds of six selected tropical forest tree species was investigated. Saline solutions (0. 2 m) {{of the six}} salts used had highly significant effects on seed germination {{in most of the}} tree species. Sodium sulphate (Na 2 So 4) permitted germination in the seeds of Ceiba pentandra and Tectona grandis presoaked in its 0. 2 m solution for 36 and 48 h respectively. The Zinc sulphate (ZnSO 4) solution enhanced the germination of seeds of Terminalia ivorensis and Terminalia superba. Solution of <b>Potassium</b> per <b>Manganate</b> favoured the germination of seeds of T. grandis, T. ivorensis and T. superba. In general, increase in molar concentration of NaCl adversely affected the germination rate of seeds. Sees of the two Terminalia species could withstand NaCl salt stress. Seeds of T. grandis have high ability to withstand salt stress comparatively...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study Aeromonas hydrophila {{outbreaks}} occurred for 3 months (July, September and October) in 1996 about 15 - 20 days after flooding in juvenile cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) were investigated. Sensitivities of four isolates of A. hydrophila against 16 chemotherapeutants were determined. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of formalin to the isolates were between 6. 4 - 8 g/ml. 23 g/ml dose of <b>potassium</b> per <b>manganate</b> (KmnO 4) and 15 g/ml dose of Chloramine-T were effective to inhibit one of the isolates {{but not to the}} other isolates. Oral applications of ofloxacin or flumequine following bath disinfections with formalin controlled the natural infections. Pathogenicity of three isolates of A. hydrophila was tested by intramuscular injection into healthy 1 -year-old rainbow trout. The lethal dosages of 50 % end point (LD 50) for the isolates were calculated as 4 x 104, 2 x 105 and 5 x 105, respectively. Natural and experimental infections caused dross clinical abnormalities such as abnormal movements, anorexia, darkening skin, pale and swollen gills, cherry-red coloured spleen, necrosis in liver, haemorrhage in kidney and serous exudates in intestine. Histopathological examination demonstrated pathological changes in gill, brain, heart, kidney, liver and intestinal tissues of naturally infected juvenile rainbow trout. Glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT) enzyme and bilirubin (BIL) levels in blood serum of naturally infected rainbow trout were significantly higher than in healthy fish. No significant increases were observed in the serum L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CRE) levels of diseased fish group. There was no significant a decrease in the mean concentration of glucose (GLC) of the naturally infected fish group...|$|R

50|$|Glauber {{reported}} the first {{description of the}} production of potassium permanganate when he noted that manganese dioxide (as the mineral pyrolusite) could be reacted at high temperatures with alkali to obtain a material that dissolved in water to give a green solution which slowly shifted to a violet-red.

50|$|In 1659, Johann Rudolf Glauber fused {{a mixture}} of the mineral {{pyrolusite}} (manganese dioxide, MnO2) and potassium carbonate to obtain a material that, when dissolved in water, gave a green solution (<b>potassium</b> <b>manganate)</b> which slowly shifted to violet and then finally red. This report represents the first description of the production of potassium permanganate. Just under 200 years later, London chemist Henry Bollmann Condy {{had an interest in}} disinfectants; he found that fusing pyrolusite with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and dissolving it in water produced a solution with disinfectant properties. He patented this solution, and marketed it as 'Condy's Fluid'. Although effective, the solution was not very stable. This was overcome by using potassium hydroxide (KOH) rather than NaOH. This was more stable, and had the advantage of easy conversion to the equally effective potassium permanganate crystals. This crystalline material was known as 'Condy's crystals' or 'Condy's powder'. Potassium permanganate was comparatively easy to manufacture, so Condy was subsequently forced to spend considerable time in litigation to stop competitors from marketing similar products.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} with iron removal from groundwater is organic matter. The article presents the experiments involved groundwater samples with a high concentration of total iron - amounting to 7. 20 mgFe/dm 3 and an increased amount of organic substances (TOC from 5. 50 to 7. 50 mgC/dm 3). The water samples examined differed in terms {{of the value of the}} ratio of the TOC concentration and the concentration of total iron (D). It was concluded that with increase in the coexistence ratio of organic substances and total iron in water (D = [TOC]/[Fetot]), efficiency of Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxidization with dissolved oxygen decreased, while the oxidation time was increasing. This rule was not demonstrated for <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> (VII) when used as an oxidizing agent. The application of <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> (VII) for oxidation of Fe(II) ions produced the better results in terms of total iron concentration reduction in the sedimentation process than the oxidation with dissolved oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Alumina-supported {{manganese}} catalysts with cryptomelane and/or birnessite structure {{have been}} prepared using a simple method based on the thermal decomposition of potassium permanganate. The samples have been characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, DSC, N 2 adsorption at − 196 °C, SEM, H 2 -TPR and XPS, and their catalytic activity for soot combustion has been tested and {{compared to that of}} a reference Pt/alumina catalyst. The thermal decomposition of alumina-supported KMnO 4 yields a mixture of supported birnessite and <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> which is the most effective, among those prepared, to lower the soot combustion temperature. However, this material is not useful for soot combustion because the accelerating effect is not based on a catalytic process but on the oxidation of soot by <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate.</b> A suitable soot combustion catalyst is obtained after <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> is removed by water washing, yielding only the birnessite phase on the γ-Al 2 O 3 support. This birnessite phase can be transformed into cryptomelane by calcination at 600 °C. These two samples, γ-Al 2 O 3 -supported birnessite and cryptomelane are suitable catalysts for soot combustion in NOx/O 2 mixtures, as their catalytic activity is based on the NO 2 -assited mechanism, that is, both catalysts accelerate the oxidation of NO to NO 2 and NO 2 promotes soot oxidation. The soot combustion temperatures obtained with these birnessite/cryptomelane alumina-supported catalysts are similar to that obtained with the reference Pt/alumina catalyst.

40|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} {{is produced}} by the electro-oxidation of alkaline <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> in a divided electrolytic cell. A filter press type flow electrolyzer has been designed, fabricated, and operated with perfluoro sulfonic acid based cation exchange membrane Nafion 417, precious metal/precious metal oxide coated titanium anode, and stainless steel cathode. Optimum process parameters are evaluated and reported. Performance characteristics of coated titanium anodes are compared with conventional nickel anodes, to fix the most suitable one for the job on hand. Anode materials have been electrochemically characterized by potentiodynamic studies in alkaline <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> solution. Transport properties of the membrane Nafion 417 for K+ ions and water molecules are studied using a small membrane cell operating on batch mode.

30|$|Lignite, i.e. low rank coal, {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a valuable source of humics (Kučerík et al. 2003). The content of humics can be increased by regeneration processes with nitric acid, <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> (VII), sulfuric acid, or hydrogen peroxide (Berkowitz 1985, Rausa et al. 1994;Kučerík et al. 2003;Vlčková et al. 2009). However, understanding the influence of lignite regeneration on the physicochemical and biological behavior is still incomplete. The {{same holds true for}} optimization of the regeneration processes (e.g. regeneration agent, type and concentration, and regeneration time). Since regeneration is most effective in suspension with nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide (Kučerík et al. 2008 a, b), the focus of the study is on these two oxidizing agents.|$|E
30|$|The {{method of}} {{exfoliation}} in a pressurized batch ultrasonic reactor {{allows for the}} preparation of few- and monolayered colloidal dispersions of IAG particles without intercalation. The {{quality and quantity of}} the exfoliation depends upon appropriate selection of the reaction conditions (intensity of ultrasound, the reaction time, the pressure in the reactor, etc.). Strong aprotic solvents (NMP, DMF, DMSO, etc.) are used for the preparation of monolayered IAGs in a hydrophobic environment. The method of exfoliation of IAGs that is based on the intercalation of <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate</b> in an alkaline environment in the presence of high-intensity ultrasound is suitable for hydrophilic applications with a good dispersibility of the IAGs in water. This non-oxidative method allows for the preparation of exfoliated IAGs of high purity with a minimum content of undesirable functional groups.|$|E
40|$|A {{spectrophotometric}} method for the simultaneous {{determination of the}} important pharmaceuticals, pefloxacin and its structurally similar metabolite, norfloxacin, is described for the first time. The analysis {{is based on the}} monitoring of a kinetic spectrophotometric reaction of the two analytes with potassium permanganate as the oxidant. The measurement of the reaction process followed the absorbance decrease of potassium permanganate at 526 nm, and the accompanying increase of the product, <b>potassium</b> <b>manganate,</b> at 608 nm. It was essential to use multivariate calibrations to overcome severe spectral overlaps and similarities in reaction kinetics. Calibration curves for the individual analytes showed linear relationships over the concentration ranges of 1. 0 – 11. 5 mg L− 1 at 526 and 608 nm for pefloxacin, and 0. 15 – 1. 8 mg L− 1 at 526 and 608 nm for norfloxacin. Various multivariate calibration models were applied, at the two analytical wavelengths, for the simultaneous prediction of the two analytes including classical least squares (CLS), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), radial basis function-artificial neural network (RBF-ANN) and principal component-radial basis function-artificial neural network (PC-RBF-ANN). PLS and PC-RBF-ANN calibrations with the data collected at 526 nm, were the preferred methods—%RPET not, vert, similar 5, and LODs for pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 0. 36 and 0. 06 mg L− 1, respectively. Then, the proposed method was applied successfully for the simultaneous determination of pefloxacin and norfloxacin present in pharmaceutical and human plasma samples. The results compared well with those from the alternative analysis by HPLC...|$|E
