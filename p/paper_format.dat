25|$|Bath was {{the first}} rugby club {{to have its own}} supporters' fanzine, Everytime Ref, Everytime! (ERE), and this was then {{followed}} by similar magazines compiled by supporters at Gloucester and Leicester. The Leicester magazine folded within its first season but Gloucester's Shedhead is still going strong. ERE was launched in 1991 and continued until 1999 when its <b>paper</b> <b>format</b> was replaced by an online fanzine.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is slightly more complex if electronic formatting {{is to be}} used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, {{there is no reason}} to treat this form differently from a <b>paper</b> <b>format,</b> and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read French.|$|E

500|$|Kaishi, or futokorogami, were {{sheets of}} paper carried by {{high-ranking}} people folded in their kimonos at the breast. They were used for writing letters, or waka; similar sheets were employed during the tea ceremony. Papers came {{in a variety of}} sizes and colours, depending on the rank and sex of those using them. At court men wrote on white paper, while women wrote only on red kaishi paper. Eventually the <b>paper</b> <b>format</b> was standardized with sizes ranging from about [...] to [...] The folding style, labelling, and other stylistic features, differed from school to school. Four items from the Heian and Kamakura periods have been designated as National Treasures in the kaishi category. They are single sheets or sets of sheets mounted on hanging scrolls or bound in an album and contain poetry by Japanese rulers and famous poets.|$|E
500|$|The {{scope of}} the {{archives}} is defined by a university regulation. It includes charters, title deeds, copies of university statutes and regulations, records maintained by the university's Registrar and minutes of meetings, {{as well as any}} other official material from the university or its departments that is not in current use and whose preservation is [...] "desirable" [...] in the opinion of the Committee for the Archives. The university archives do not contain material from the colleges of the university, which hold their material separately. The earliest document held, dating from 1214, is a decision of a Papal legate in a dispute between the town of Oxford and the university. The majority of the archives date from the 19th and 20th centuries, and are mainly in <b>paper</b> <b>format,</b> with only a few photographs and no sound or video recordings. The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010, and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director. The present holder, Simon Bailey, works with an Assistant Keeper (a role split between two people each working part-time) and an Archives Assistant. Bailey is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives: he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor, David Vaisey, but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000. Some of the holders of the position have been appointed to a Fellowship of one of the colleges; unlike some of the professorships at Oxford, it is not linked to a particular college.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electronic}} spreadsheet organizes data information into computerized software defined columns and rows. Primarily used {{for business and}} accounting purposes, the data can then be [...] "added up" [...] by a formula to give a total or sum. The spreadsheet program summarizes information from many paper sources {{in one place and}} presents the information in a format to help a decision maker see the financial [...] "big picture" [...] of a company. Spreadsheets in <b>paper</b> <b>format</b> have been used by accountants for hundreds of years. However, computerized, {{electronic spreadsheet}}s are of much more recent origin. In 1961, Richard Mattessich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting. In the autumn of 1978, Harvard Business School student, Dan Bricklin, {{came up with the idea}} for an interactive visible calculator. Bricklin and Bob Frankston then co-invented the software program VisiCalc, the world's first [...] "killer application" [...] and electronic spreadsheet for use on personal computers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{debate has}} become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 {{recession}} shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become {{an important source of}} revenue. At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional <b>paper</b> <b>format.</b> As of 2017, an increasing percentage of Millennials (young adults) get their news from social media websites such as Facebook. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering [...] "digital editions", which can be accessed via desktop computer, laptops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. Online newspapers may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as online advertising enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as Baby boomers and Millennials can be sent different advertisements.|$|E
2500|$|The ACT ( [...] ; {{originally}} an abbreviation of American College Testing) college readiness {{assessment is}} a standardized test {{for high school}} achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the same name. It was first administered in November 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT. The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989 however, the Social Studies test was changed into a Reading section (which included a Social Studies subsection) and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with more emphasis on problem solving skills. In February 2005, an optional Writing test {{was added to the}} ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. In 2013, ACT announced that students would be able to take the ACT by computer starting in the spring of 2015. The test will continue to be offered in the <b>paper</b> <b>format</b> for schools that are not ready to transition to computer testing.|$|E
