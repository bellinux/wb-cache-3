5|$|Five {{deaths were}} {{attributed}} to Cindy, none of them near the storm's landfall. Two {{people were killed in}} Georgia, one in Alabama, and two in Maryland. Approximately 300,000homes and businesses in southeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Gulf Coast lost electrical <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> storm surge of 4–6feet (1.2-1.8m) affected the same area, causing some beach erosion near Grand Isle, Louisiana. Hurricane Cindy's total damage was estimated to be US$320million.|$|E
5|$|Hindus regard Kanchipuram {{to be one}} of {{the seven}} holiest cities in India, the Sapta Puri. According to Hinduism, a kṣetra is a sacred ground, a field of active <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> place where final attainment, or moksha, can be obtained.

5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> battery charging capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system {{would be capable of}} integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance produced days of prolonged {{rainfall and}} gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and rough sea conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During {{the passage of}} the storm, numerous residents were left without water and <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and some government offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22million (2010USD). In addition, Otto was widely {{regarded as one of the}} wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Bathys Ryax signalled {{the end of}} the Paulicians as a {{military}} <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> threat to Byzantium.

The remaining Paulicians were resettled in the Balkans, while a large contingent was shipped off to Southern Italy to fight for the Empire under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder.|$|E

25|$|The Syro–Hittite {{states may}} {{be divided into two}} groups: a {{northern}} group where Hittite rulers remained in <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> southern group where Aramaeans came to rule from about 1000 BC. These states were highly decentralised structures; some appear to have been only loose confederations of sub-kingdoms.|$|E
