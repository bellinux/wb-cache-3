2500|$|Guernsey {{together}} with the other Channel Islands has Channel Television, an ITV regional franchise. A lot {{of the content of}} Channel TV is from/based on Jersey. It produces a daily news <b>programme</b> <b>Channel</b> Report. From {{the point of view of}} television coverage, the BBC has always treated the islands as an extension of their South West England region, relaying programmes from Plymouth to the islands. (The BBC does now broadcast an opt-out of the regional news bulletin, Spotlight, for the Channel Islands.) This posed a problem to the Independent Television Authority as, constitutionally, the Television Act 1954 did not apply to the islands, so the ITA's ability to operate there had to be permitted by means of extending the Act to the islands by means of an Order in Council. Due to a technicality that prevented the Channel Islands from receiving colour television, Channel could only broadcast in black and white until 1976. However, Channel TV does not use a Channel Island website - [...] Due to the proximity to France, French television is fairly easily received as well.|$|E
