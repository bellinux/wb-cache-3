Klawitter had been barred from membership in the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the <b>Pulpit</b> Law, a remnant of the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the <b>pulpit.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1547, {{opposition}} to Calvin and other French refugee ministers {{had grown to}} constitute {{the majority of the}} syndics, the civil magistrates of Geneva. On 27 June an unsigned threatening letter in Genevan dialect was found at the <b>pulpit</b> of St. Pierre Cathedral where Calvin preached. Suspecting a plot against both the church and the state, the council appointed a commission to investigate. Jacques Gruet, a Genevan member of Favre's group, was arrested and incriminating evidence was found when his house was searched. Under torture, he confessed to several crimes including writing the letter left in the <b>pulpit</b> which threatened the church leaders. A civil court condemned Gruet to death and he was beheaded on 26 July. Calvin was not opposed to the civil court's decision.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the <b>pulpit</b> on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the <b>pulpit</b> of the Epistle side had {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the antiquity of the font – probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses – the <b>pulpit</b> dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St David’s (the scholarly Basil Jones, bishop 1874–1897), in memory of his mother. It is in Beer stone ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints John and Paul by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in spandrels flanking, and a Gothic column with a large capital for a book rest. Opposite this is the usual brass eagle lectern. Both <b>pulpit</b> and lectern are placed in the archway between crossing and nave.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{from the}} south of the undercroft is the abbot's passage which dates from around 1150 and {{consists}} of two bays with rib-vaulting. Above the abbot's passage, approached by a stairway from the west cloister, is StAnselm's Chapel which also dates from the 12thcentury. It is in three bays and has a 19thcentury Gothic-style plaster vault. The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17thcentury. The screen, altar rails, holy table and plaster ceiling of the chancel date from the 17thcentury. The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory, built by Simon deWhitchurch in the 13thcentury. It contains an Early English <b>pulpit,</b> approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade. The only other similar <b>pulpit</b> in England is in Beaulieu Abbey.|$|E

5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised <b>pulpit</b> from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave <b>pulpit.</b> In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E

50|$|At the East and West ends of {{the hall}} were two sets of similar <b>pulpits.</b> Resembling the <b>pulpits</b> used in the Kirtland Temple, and {{repeated}} in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting {{of a group of}} three semi-circular stands.

5|$|The Baroque wooden reredos of 1679, {{probably}} by local man Thomas Sabin, {{has been compared}} favourably {{with the work of}} Christopher Wren and Grinling Gibbons, and the metal screen also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of CharlesII high on the west wall of the nave. The alabaster <b>pulpit</b> and octagonal font were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a Portland stone base. The <b>pulpit</b> is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.|$|E
