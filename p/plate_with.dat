5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America.

At another deeply eroded caldera complex called Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt merges with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a northwest-trending belt of volcanic cones and fields extending from near the Canada–United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast. The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca <b>Plate.</b> <b>With</b> the notable exception of King Island, all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E

5|$|Any {{model of}} the origin of Siletzia must account for {{interactions}} with plate boundaries that were being subducted under North America through the Eocene. Early studies were plagued by indeterminate locations for these boundaries, particularly of the Kula-Farallon (K-F) spreading ridge: basalts {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Alaska (along the Alaska panhandle) have ages and compositions corresponding to the Siletz volcanics, suggesting that the K-F ridge was offshore of the Yukon at the same time it was offshore of Washington. This can be resolved by assuming that by about 56 Ma the eastern part of the Kula plate had broken away to form the Resurrection <b>plate,</b> <b>with</b> the new Kula-Resurrection (K-R) spreading ridge running up the Gulf of Alaska towards Kodiak Island, and the former K-F (now R-F) ridge reaching Washington. Subduction of this plate under western Canada was rapid, and it disappeared entirely with subduction of the K-R ridge about 50 Ma.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon <b>Plate</b> <b>with</b> the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E

5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the non-contact buckling response of long rectangular plates subjected to compressive or shearing loadings is {{solely dependent on}} material and section properties, as well as boundary conditions along the two unloaded side edges. In addition, the boundary conditions at the loaded ends do not influence the critical load. The above rule was also applied to the analysis and design of plates in unilateral contact with elastic or rigid mediums although without any reasonable verification. The results contained in this paper reveal that the boundary condition at the loaded edges (end conditions) significantly affects the contact buckling performance. To investigate the end condition effect, a transfer function method is employed herein to study the initial buckling behaviour of thin <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> different boundary conditions resting on tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. For very long <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> both ends clamped, the buckling mode {{can be considered as}} a series of periodically repeating buckling waves and an infinite <b>plate</b> model <b>with</b> only one buckle wave being effective to predict the buckling behaviour. However, for long <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> simply supported loaded ends, local effects dominate the buckling mode and the buckling loads can be reduced by up to 18 % compared to long <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> clamped loaded ends. Experimental tests and ABAQUS modelling also verify that the critical stresses for <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> simply supported loaded ends are lower than those for <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> clamped loaded ended plates...|$|R
