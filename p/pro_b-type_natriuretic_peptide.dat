50|$|Existing {{cardiovascular}} disease or a previous cardiovascular event, {{such as a}} heart attack or stroke, is the strongest predictor of a future cardiovascular event. Age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes are important predictors of future {{cardiovascular disease}} in people who are not known to have cardiovascular disease. These measures, and sometimes others, may be combined into composite risk scores to estimate an individual's future risk of cardiovascular disease. Numerous risk scores exist although their respective merits are debated. Other diagnostic tests and biomarkers remain under evaluation but currently these lack clear-cut evidence to support their routine use. They include family history, coronary artery calcification score, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ankle-brachial pressure index, lipoprotein subclasses and particle concentration, lipoprotein(a), apolipoproteins A-I and B, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, homocysteine, N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (NT-proBNP), and markers of kidney function. High blood phosphorus is also linked to an increased risk.|$|E
40|$|Background—Heart failure with {{preserved}} {{ejection fraction}} is a clinical syndrome {{that has been}} associated with changes in the extracellular matrix. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether profibrotic biomarkers accurately reflect the presence and severity of disease and underlying pathophysiology and modify response to therapy in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Methods and Results—Four biomarkers, soluble form of ST 2 (an interleukin- 1 receptor family member), galectin- 3, matrix metalloproteinase- 2, and collagen III N-terminal propeptide were measured in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB on Management of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (PARAMOUNT) trial at baseline, 12 and 36 weeks after randomization to valsartan or LCZ 696. We examined the relationship between baseline biomarkers, demographic and echocardiographic characteristics, change in primary (change in N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide)</b> and secondary (change in left atrial volume) end points. The median (interquartile range) value for soluble form of ST 2 (33 [24. 6 – 48. 1] ng/mL) and galectin 3 (17. 8 [14. 1 – 22. 8] ng/mL) were higher, and for matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (188 [155. 5 – 230. 6] ng/mL) lower, than in previously published referent controls; collagen III N-terminal propeptide (5. 6 [4. 3 – 6. 9] ng/mL) was similar to referent control values. All 4 biomarkers correlated with severity of disease as indicated by N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide,</b> E/E′, and left atrial volume. Baseline biomarkers did not modify the response to LCZ 696 for lowering N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; however, left atrial volume reduction varied by baseline level of soluble form of ST 2 and galectin 3; patients with values less than the observed median (< 33 ng/mL soluble form of ST 2 and < 17. 8 ng/mL galectin 3) had reduction in left atrial volume, those above median did not. Although LCZ 696 reduced N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide,</b> levels of the other 4 biomarkers were not affected over time.

MethodsThirty-eight children aged 1 to 36 months undergoing surgical repair of cardiac lesions with left ventricular volume overload were studied. Plasma N-terminal <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels were measured preoperatively and at 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgical intervention and were assessed for their predictive value of postoperative outcomes.

ResultsPatient preoperative N-terminal <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels were significantly higher than those of healthy control subjects (3085 ± 4046 vs 105 ± 78 pg/mL). Preoperative N-terminal <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels correlated with the complexity of surgical repair, as measured by cardiopulmonary bypass time (r = 0. 529, P <. 001), and with postoperative measures, including fractional inhaled oxygen requirements registered at 12 hours (r = 0. 443, P =. 005) and duration of mechanical ventilation (r = 0. 445, P =. 005). Plasma N-terminal <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels increased 5 -fold within 12 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (14, 685 ± 14, 317 pg/mL).

However, its use in infants with congenital heart disease has been limited, particularly in the perioperative period. Our objective was to determine the alterations in perioperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels and their predictive value on postoperative outcomes, in infants undergoing congenital heart surgery. MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 115 patients: 24 with univentricular heart disease undergoing a modified Norwood procedure, 11 with d-transposition of the great arteries, 55 with hemodynamically important left-to-right shunt, and 25 with tetralogy of Fallot undergoing primary repair. Clinical data and <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> samples were collected before and 2, 12, and 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. ResultsThe perioperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels were lesion specific. Patients with d-transposition of the great arteries and univentricular heart disease had high preoperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels that decreased postoperatively, and those with hemodynamically important left-to-right shunts and tetralogy of Fallot had lower preoperative levels that increased during the first 12 hours postoperatively. The patients with univentricular heart disease with an adverse outcome had a significantly greater 24 -hour <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> level than those without (P < . 05). Those with hemodynamically important left to right shunts and an adverse outcome had a greater 12 -hour <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> level than those without (P < . 05). A 12 -hour postoperative/preoperative ratio greater than 45 was 100 % sensitive and 82 % specific for an adverse outcome in the patients with tetralogy of Fallot. ConclusionsThe perioperative changes in <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels and their ability to predict outcomes are lesion-specific.

Subjects and Methods：The NT-proBNP concentration was analyzed in 50 patients with non-ST elevation ACS. We compared plasma NT-proBNP levels and treatment method (medical treatment vs. percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]). Results：In patients with non-ST elevation ACS, NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the PCI (n= 37) group than in the medical treatment (n= 13) group (296. 6 vs. 76. 3 pg/mL; p 125. 9 pg/mL had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 75. 7 %, 92. 3 %, 96. 6 % and 57. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (NT-proBNP) is {{a product}} of {{cleavage}} of the cardiac prohormone <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> into its active form. It {{has proven to be a}} useful biomarker in left heart failure. However, studies examining the utility of serial measurements of NT-proBNP in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients have shown mixed results. We compared three methods of predicting adverse clinical outcomes in PAH patients: the change in 6 minute walk distance (6 MWD), the change in absolute levels of NT-proBNP and the change in log-transformed levels of NT-proBNP. All PAH patients presenting from March-June 2007 were screened. Patients who were clinically unstable, had abnormal renal function or hemoglobin levels or lacked a prior NT-proBNP were excluded. 63 patients were followed up for adverse clinical outcomes (defined as death, transplantation, hospitalisation for right heart failure, or need for increased therapy). Three methods were used to predict adverse events, i. e. : (a) comparing a 6 MWD performed in March-June 2007 and a previous 6 MWD. A decrease in 6 MWD of ≥ 30 m was used to predict clinical deterioration; (b) comparing a NT-proBNP value measured in March-June 2007 and a previous NT-proBNP. An increase in NT-proBNP of ≥ 250 pg/ml was used to predict clinical deterioration (250 pg/ml represented approximately 30 % change from the baseline median value of NT-proBNP for this cohort); and (c) comparing the loge equivalents of two consecutive NT-proBNP values. We used the formula: loge(current NT-proBNP) - loge(previous NT-proBNP) =x. A value of x≥+ 0. 26 was used to predict adverse events. This is equivalent to a 30 % change from baseline, and hence is comparable to the chosen cut-off for absolute levels of NT-proBNP. A loge difference of ≥+ 0. 26 identifies patients at risk of adverse events with a specificity of 98 %, a sensitivity of 60 %, a positive predictive value of 89 %, and a negative predictive value of 90 %. A drop in 6 MWD of ≥ 30 m has a specificity of 29 %, a sensitivity of 73 %, a positive predictive value of 24 % and a negative predictive value of 24 %. It seems possible to risk-stratify apparently stable PAH patients by following the changes in their serial log-transformed NT-proBNP values. In this small pilot study, this method was better than relying on changes in the actual levels of NT-proBNP or changes in 6 MWD. This needs to be validated prospectively in a larger cohort...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Endostatin is a {{circulating}} endogenous {{angiogenesis inhibitor}} preventing neovascularization. Previous studies demonstrated the prognostic value of Endostatin among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, {{the role of}} Endostatin among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unclear. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between serum Endostatin levels, natriuretic peptide levels and the severity of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and the diagnosis of HFpEF. Methods: Endostatin serum concentrations were measured in 301 patients comprising 77 HFpEF patients, 169 patients with asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (ALVDD), and 55 controls with normal cardiac function. Results: Endostatin serum levels were significantly elevated in patients with HFpEF (median/interquartile range 179. 0 [159 - 220]) and ALVDD (163. 8 [145. 4 - 191. 3]) compared to controls (149. 1 [130. 6 - 176. 9]), p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively) and significant correlated with N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (NT-proBNP). Conclusions: This hypothesis-generating pilot study gives first evidence that Endostatin correlates with the severity of diastolic dysfunction and may become a novel biomarker for HFpEF.

Methods: Two hundred and twenty-one patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were evaluated prospectively during a 30 -day postoperative follow-up period. Serum <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration was measured without a 24 -hour period prior to the surgical procedure and the value obtained was correlated with a short-term all-cause mortality. Results: Data analysis showed that all-cause mortality rates were equal to 9. 5 % in 30 days. Accuracy analysis by the receiver operating characteristic curve found an ideal cut-off value of <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> equal to 150 pg/mL in relation to mortality (AUC= 0. 82, 95 % CI= 0. 71 - 0. 87, P< 0. 001).

Methods. This was a prospective observational study. Four hundred eighty-eight consecutive subjects evaluated for dyspnea in a metropolitan 600 beds hospital ED, entered into the final data analysis. According to a clinical and radiological score, the patients enrolled were divided in three groups: low (A-group), intermediate (B-group), and high (C-group) probability of heart failure. Results. NT-proBNP median value was 2445 ng/L (Inter Quartile Range 631 - 5847 ng/L), and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) was 0. 854 for NT-proBNP, 0. 921 for clinical/radiological score and 0. 936 for the two in combination (logistic model). In the B-group (intermediate) NT-proBNP test added correct diagnostic information in 126 subjects with HF and in 53 subjects without a final diagnosis of HF. In A- and C-group NT-proBNP test added correct diagnostic information in 1 patient. Conclusions.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) {{is a major}} cardiovascular complication and {{an important}} predictor of mortality in patients with end stage renal disease. Some {{studies have shown that}} the serum aldosterone levels are correlated with LVH in non-diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis. The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationships between serum biomarkers, including aldosterone, and echocardiographic findings, such as LVH, in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Subjects and Methods: Thirty patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for> 12 months at Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital were included. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated using the Devereux formula. Serum biomarkers {N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (NT-proBNP), troponin T, C-reactive protein, renin, and aldosterone} were measured. Results: Sixteen of 30 patients had LVH on the basis of the LVMI. The mean serum aldosterone level was 62. 53 ± 60. 73 pg/mL (range, 5. 03 - 250. 68 pg/mL). LVH, on the basis of the LVMI, was not correlated with the serum aldosterone level. The serum aldosterone levels were not associated with echocardiographic findings, even with co-existing diabetes mellitus. The LVMI had a negative correlation with the hemoglobin (r=- 0. 405, p= 0. 029) and hematocrit (r=- 0. 374, p= 0. 042), and a positive correlation with NT-proBNP (r= 0. 560, p= 0. 002).

40|$|Background: Recently, {{case reports}} of {{patients}} treated with imatinib (imatinib mesylate; Gleevec (R); Glvec (R)) {{indicated that this}} tyrosine kinase inhibitor may induce cardiomyopathy. Consequently, careful cardiac monitoring was advocated for clinical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to prospectively evaluate whether imatinib (Gleevec) induces early, subclinical, cardiac toxicity. Patients and methods: History and physical examination were carried out with special attention for symptoms of heart failure. Additionally, assessments of serial plasma N-terminal <b>pro</b> <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> (NT-proBNP) and serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) measurement before and 1 and 3 months after the start of imatinib treatment (400 - 800 mg daily) were done in patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Results: A total of 55 GIST patients were enrolled. Only one patient, with a normal pretreatment NT-proBNP, showed an increase in NT-proBNP to above age-specific normal values during imatinib treatment and developed symptomatic heart failure due to pre-existent cardiac valvular disease. cTnT levels remained stable. Conclusions: in our study population, imatinib treatment for GIST was not associated with an increase in plasma NT-proBNP levels, indicating that the risk of subclinical cardiac toxicity is limited with the use of this agent. These results do not support the current strategy to standard cardiac monitoring in all patients. This may be restricted to GIST patients with a history of cardiac disease...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} association between preoperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels and outcome after total cavopulmonary connection. Surgical palliation of univentricular cardiac defects requires a series of staged operations, ending in a total cavopulmonary connection. Although outcomes have improved, there remains an unpredictable risk of early total cavopulmonary connection takedown. The prediction of adverse postoperative outcomes is imprecise, despite an extensive preoperative evaluation. MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 50 patients undergoing total cavopulmonary connection. We collected preoperative clinical data, preoperative plasma <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels, and postoperative outcomes, including the incidence of an adverse outcome within 1 year of surgery (defined as death, total cavopulmonary connection takedown, or the need for cardiac transplantation). ResultsThe mean age of patients was 4. 7 years (standard deviation, 2. 1 years). The median (interquartile range) preoperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels were higher in patients who required total cavopulmonary connection takedown and early postoperative mechanical cardiac support (n =  3; median, 55; interquartile range, 42 - 121) compared with those with a good outcome (n =  47; median, 11; interquartile range, 5 - 17) (P < . 05). A preoperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> level of 40 pg/mL or greater was highly associated with the need for total cavopulmonary connection takedown (sensitivity, 100 %; specificity, 93 %; P <. 05), yielding a positive predictive value of 50 % and a negative predictive value of 100 %. Higher preoperative <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> levels also were associated with longer intensive care unit length of stay, longer hospital length of stay, and increased incidence of low cardiac output syndrome (P < . 05).

40|$|Background: Myocardial {{dysfunction}} is a complication {{associated with}} a poor prognosis in septic patients. A biomarker of cardiac function providing prognostic information is of paramount interest. Objective: We sought to determine the value of <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Methods: We performed a prospective study in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock in a medical intensive care unit. <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> level was determined within 24 hours after the diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock. We also analyzed mortality, and presence of association between <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> and clinical, hemodynamic and respiratory variables. Results: 23 (9 women; 14 men) patients with ages ranging from 20 - 79 (mean 51. 3 ± 18. 6) years old and APACHE score of 22. 6 ± 11. 8 were included; 15 (65. 2 %) patients received pulmonary artery catheters, and 20 (87 %) were mechanically ventilated. Multivariate analysis disclosed inverse association between <b>B-type</b> <b>natriuretic</b> <b>peptide</b> values with positive end-expiratory pressure values, and direct association with creatinine (beta 0. 548 and 0. 377, p 0. 02 and 0. 002, respectively), but not with mortality, clinical and hemodynamic parameters.
