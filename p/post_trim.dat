40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of the photosensitive properties of a narrow bandpass filter based on a Ge(15) Sb(20) S(65) spacer fabricated by electron beam deposition. For a single layer, near the optical bandgap of this chalcogenide material, {{the efficiency of the}} photo-bleaching increases as the central wavelength of the light source for exposure decreases. The maximum relative photo-induced change of the optical thickness reaches about 1 %. By using controlled light exposure around 480 nm of a photosensitive narrow bandpass filter centered at 1550 nm, we obtained a spatially localized shift of its peak wavelength up to 5. 4 nm. This property is used to perform, {{for the first time at}} our knowledge, the <b>post</b> <b>trimming</b> of a narrow bandpass filter with a light beam. A 5 x 5 mm(2) ultra uniform area in which the relative spatial variation of its peak wavelength remains below 0. 004 % is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Flash memory {{technology}} is widely common in modern microelectronics, and is essentially affecting our daily life. Considering the recent progress in photonic circuitry, {{and in particular}} silicon photonics circuitry, there is now an opportunity to embed the flash memory technology in photonic applications. A particularly promising candidate that can benefit from such integration is the photonic resonator. As of today, chip scale resonators are essential building blocks in modern silicon photonic platform. However, their properties, and in particular their resonance frequencies deviate from their designed values due to unavoidable fabrication imperfections, imposing a stringent limitation on the applicability of such devices. Here we present a solution for this major obstacle and demonstrate electrical approach for <b>post</b> <b>trimming</b> of such resonators. This is achieved by integrating the well-established flash memory technology into the photonic circuitry. More specifically, we use the nanoscale Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) structure in order to trap charges in the thin silicon nitride layer, which is located {{in close proximity to}} the silicon device layer. This enables the accumulation of charges in the silicon, modifying the effective index of the optical mode and consequently the resonance frequency. By doing so, we provide a robust and elegant CMOS compatible memory solution, which can be easily manufactured and commercialized. We expect such an approach {{to pave the way for}} even more efficient utilization of resonators and interferometers in chip scale photonic and electro optic systems, with wide range of applications such as filters, modulators, sensors, and lasers, to name a few...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{activities of}} the Advanced Composite Aileron (ACA) program are discussed. These activities included detail fabrication, manufacturing development, assembly, repair and quality assurance. Five ship sets of ailerons were manufactured. The detail fabrication effort of ribs, spar and covers was accomplished on male tools to a common cure cycle. Graphite epoxy tape and fabric and syntactic epoxy materials were utilized in the fabrication. The ribs and spar were net cured and required no <b>post</b> cure <b>trim.</b> Material inconsistencies resulted in manufacturing development of the front spar during the production effort. The assembly effort was accomplished in subassembly and assembly fixtures. The manual drilling system utilized a dagger type drill in a hydraulic feed control hand drill. Coupon testing for each detail was done...|$|R
40|$|Many {{vehicle design}} studies focus on {{optimizing}} Hypersonic Accelerating Airbreathing vehicles for maximum performance but typically trim {{is not a}} primary concern. Vehicle longitudinal trim is often obtained by using trim elevons resulting in unwanted trim drag. As {{it is difficult to}} obtain high thrust from scramjet engines at high Mach numbers, trim drag reduction is important for accelerating vehicles. This study is based around maximizing the performance of an airbreathing 2 nd stage Winged Cone Vehicle, as part of a three-stage rocket-scramjet-rocket launch system for payload masses of the order of 100 kg. The concept of a minimum trim vehicle is introduced, where it is desired to alter the vehicle planform {{to reduce the amount of}} elevon trim required along the trajectory. It is shown that by including the trajectory and the requirement for the vehicle to be longitudinally trimmed into a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization study the performance of the vehicle can be improved over a conventionally optimized design with <b>post</b> optimization <b>trim...</b>|$|R

Slaughter processes have very important role in increase or decrease of microbial contamination. In this study, neck, posterior side of the foreleg, flank and rump sites of 10 beef carcasses were sampled with indirect swabbing method at <b>post</b> skinning, before <b>trimming</b> and <b>post</b> final washing, to evaluation of these operational steps effect on bacterial population. Bacteriological examination (aerobic plate counts at 37 °C, Escherichia coli enumeration and Salmonella identification) {{were obtained from the}} samples.

40|$|Developments of {{advanced}} electronic products and {{the exploitation of}} new application fields for microelectronic systems are increasingly accompanied by challenging physical requirements on the system. Examples are light weight {{for any kind of}} mobile system, as high as possible degree of miniaturization and robustness against chemicals and body liquids for medical implant systems, possible conformity with bend surfaces for applications in aerospace and automotive. Generally the trend towards further increase of function and component density in future electronic systems is from being saturated. On the other hand there is a considerable pressure to keep lower electronic systems prices. Embedding of active and passive components into build up layers of printed wiring boards has on the long term the potential to comply with both requirements at the same time. The European Union is funding two multinational technology development projects focussing on the embedding of chips and passive components into multilayer printed wiring boards. As examples for embedding of passive components electro less Ni(P) resistors and lamination and structuring of capacitors will be presented. For the passive components deposition control, sheet handling, trimming, lamination into build up layers and <b>post</b> lamination <b>trimming</b> options will be discussed. A technology for the embedding of active chips will be presented. The active chip is therefore thinned down to a thickness of 20 - 30 µm. The chip is then flip chip bonded onto the board wiring using ultra thin solder contacts and subsequently embedded into the laminate layer. The process flow, resulting interconnections and reliability of the systems under different loading conditions will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Wine {{grape must}} deal with serious {{problems}} due to the unfavorable climatic conditions resulted from global warming. High temperatures result in oxidative damages to grape vines. The excessive elevated temperatures are critical for grapevine productivity and survival and contribute to degradation of grape and wine quality and yield. Elevated temperature can negatively affect anthocyanin accumulation in red grape. Particularly, cv. Sangiovese was identified to be very sensitive to such condition. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that flavonoid biosynthetic genes were slightly repressed by high temperature. Also, the heat stress repressed {{the expression of the}} transcription factor “VvMYBA 1 ” that activates the expression of UFGT. Moreover, high temperatures had repressing effects on the activity of the flavonoids biosynthetic enzymes “PAL” and “UFGT”. Anthocyanin accumulation in berry skin is due to the balance between its synthesis and oxidation. In grape cv. Sangiovese, the gene transcription and activity of peroxidases enzyme was elevated by heat stress as a defensive mechanism of ROS-scavenging. Among many isoforms of peroxidases genes, one gene (POD 1) was induced in Sangiovese under thermal stress condition. This gene was isolated and evaluated via the technique of genes transformation from grape to Petunia. Reduction in anthocyanins concentration and higher enzymatic activity of peroxidase was observed in POD 1 transformed Petunia after heat shock compared to untrasformed control. Moreover, in wine producing regions, it is inevitable for the grape growers to adopt some adaptive strategies to alleviate grape damages to abiotic stresses. Therefore, in this thesis, the technique of <b>post</b> veraison <b>trimming</b> was done to improve the coupling of phenolic and sugar ripening in Vitis vinifera L. cultivar Sangiovese. Trimming after veraison showed to be executable to slow down the rate of sugar accumulation in grape (to decrease the alcohol potential in wines) without evolution of the main berry flavonoids compounds...|$|R
40|$|Thomas Day (1801 to ca. 1861) is {{considered}} one of the greatest furniture makers of the antebellum period. He made a variety of furniture from cradles to coffins and also made mantels, stair railings, newel <b>posts,</b> and decorative <b>trim</b> for the interiors of many grand homes and buildings in the North Carolina Piedmont and southern Virginia. By the mid- 19 th century, his furniture-making shop in Milton, North Carolina, was the largest in the state. It employed white, as well as enslaved and free blacks. His accomplishments would be impressive for any man, but because Day was a free African American who lived during the slavery era in a racist society, his achievements are especially noteworthy. Thomas Day was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. His parents, John and Mourning Stewart Day, were born with free status in 1766. According to law, since his mother was free, Thomas inherited her free status. John Day was a skilled cabinetmaker, who apprenticed both Thomas and his older brother, John Jr. in the cabinetmaking craft. The brothers received an education from Baptist tutors when the family was living in southern Virginia in the early 19 th century, in an area heavily populated by Baptists and sympathetic Quakers. By the early 1820 s, the family was living in North Carolina, and by 1827 Thomas Day had opened a furniture shop in Milton, a tobacco market town on the Dan River bordering Virginia. John Jr. studied to become a Baptist preacher in Milton but after a few years emigrated t...|$|R
