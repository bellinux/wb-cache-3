50|$|Daily inflation-indexed bonds (also {{known as}} inflation-linked bonds or colloquially as linkers) are bonds where the {{principal}} is indexed to inflation or deflation {{on a daily}} basis in terms of the official Daily CPI or monetized daily indexed unit of account like the Unidad de Fomento in Chile and the Real Value unit of Colombia. They are thus designed to hedge the inflation risk of a bond. The first known inflation-indexed <b>bond</b> was <b>issued</b> by the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1780. The market has grown dramatically since the British government began issuing inflation-linked Gilts in 1981. As of 2008, government-issued inflation-linked bonds comprise over $1.5 trillion of the international debt market. The inflation-linked market primarily consists of sovereign <b>bonds,</b> with <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> inflation-linked <b>bonds</b> constituting {{a small portion of the}} market.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple {{theory of the}} supply of index bonds by a firm, and uses that model to examine in some detail possible reasons for the non-existence of <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> index <b>bonds</b> in the United States. The major elements of the theory involve the trade-off between the tax advantages of using debt finance and the increasing risk of bankruptcy debt finance involves. The theory is first {{used to examine the}} supply of nominal bonds [...] it is thus a theory of the debt-equity ratio. Then the firm's optimal supply of index bonds is examined, and the values of the firm using the alternative debt instruments is compared. In general, {{there is no reason to}} think that nominal bonds dominate index bonds [...] i. e. the theory cannot explain why firms have not <b>issued</b> index <b>bonds.</b> The paper then turns to a number of other reasons that have been advanced for the non-issue of indexed bonds in the United States, such as the tax treatment of such instruments and the argument that their issue would saddle the firm with open-ended obligations. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the bond issuance choice between private placement and public placement among 148 Canadian {{firms in the}} mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector over a sample period of 2006 – 2015. Firms that <b>issued</b> <b>bonds</b> during the sample period under analysis {{can be divided into}} three groups. Group 1 firms only <b>issue</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>privately.</b> Group 2 firms only <b>issue</b> <b>bonds</b> publicly and Group 3 firms <b>issue</b> <b>bonds</b> both publicly and privately. Overall, for Canadian mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction corporations, this paper shows that most of their characteristics cannot explain their borrowing preferences between privately and publicly offered bonds. In other words, firms from these sectors may consider other factors such as disclosure requirements to be the main determinants when making a borrowing choice...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} version of the search {{theoretical}} model of money that captures two phenomena that have characterized several episodes of monetary history: currency shortages and the circulation of <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> notes. As usual in these models, the media of exchange are determined as part of the equilibrium. We characterize all the different equilibria and specify the conditions under which there is a currency shortage and/or <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> notes are used as means of payment. There always exists an equilibrium in which notes circulate, either alone or together with coins and, hence, credit is a self-fulfilling phenomenon. Copyright � 2009 The Author.

We hypothesize that the provision of a choice in funds led to risk-sorting among the banks, with the relatively conservative institutions opting for the comparatively rigorous bond security system. Employing a probit model with heteroskedasticity, the evidence we obtain from balance sheet data recorded {{at the time the}} banks were required to enlist in an insurance plan indicates that such was the case, as the alternative plan relying on <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> insurance was widely unpopular except among relatively conservative and well-managed institutions.

40|$|The commodity-linked bond {{offers a}} {{potential}} means for producers of primary goods both to raise capital and to hedge against output price risk. Commodity bonds are distinguished from conventional bonds in that their return structure is denominated in quantities {{of the underlying}} commodity. Optimal levels of <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> and commodity production are derived, first for producers whose only source of capital is the revenue raised by <b>issuing</b> <b>bonds,</b> and then for producers who can raise capital either by <b>issuing</b> <b>bonds</b> or by borrowing commercially. The models used are extensions of the standard models of futures market hedging. Relatively less risk averse producers {{are found to be}} unwilling to pay the premium for transferring the risk implicit in bond sales, and finance production exclusively through commercials loans. More risk averse producers, however, choose to <b>issue</b> <b>bonds.</b> For such producers, the possibility of <b>issuing</b> commodity <b>bonds</b> leads to levels of output and of producer welfare higher than if conventional loans are the sole source of financing available.
