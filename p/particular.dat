5|$|A <b>particular</b> {{viewpoint}} {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a <b>particular</b> perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E

Each gene specifies a <b>particular</b> trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

50|$|Relationalism in {{a broader}} sense applies to any system of thought that gives {{importance}} to the relational nature of reality. But in its narrower and philosophically restricted sense as propounded by the Indian philosopher Joseph Kaipayil and others, relationalism refers {{to the theory of}} reality that interprets the existence, nature, and meaning of things in terms of their relationality or relatedness. On the relationalist view, things are neither self-standing entities nor vague events but relational <b>particulars.</b> <b>Particulars</b> are inherently relational, as they are ontologically open to other <b>particulars</b> in their constitution and action. <b>Particulars,</b> as relational <b>particulars,</b> are the ultimate constituents of reality. <b>Particulars</b> interact and make the very fabric of reality.|$|R
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate <b>particular</b> signs to <b>particular</b> meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E

50|$|An accused may {{request the}} {{prosecution}} to supply <b>particulars</b> or further <b>particulars</b> of any matter alleged in the charge. Further <b>particulars</b> {{may only be}} requested before the commencement of evidence. It can be after the plea, in other words, so long as no evidence has been led yet. The {{reason for this is}} that before 1977, the procedure was carried out in such a way that the accused had to plead as early as possible. If <b>particulars</b> are only requested after the plea, the accused has no right to have the charge quashed if he is dissatisfied with the <b>particulars.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{is clear}} that {{psychology}} is concerned essentially with actual <b>particulars,</b> not merely with systems of <b>particulars.</b> In this it differs from physics, which, broadly speaking, {{is concerned with the}} cases in which all the <b>particulars</b> which make up one physical object can be treated as a single causal unit, or rather the <b>particulars</b> which are sufficiently near to the object of which they are appearances can be so treated. The laws which physics seeks can, broadly speaking, be stated by treating such systems of <b>particulars</b> as causal units. The laws which psychology seeks cannot be so stated, since the <b>particulars</b> themselves are what interests the psychologist. This is one of the fundamental differences between physics and psychology; and to make it clear has been the main purpose of this lecture.|$|R

5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to <b>particular</b> genes, while the two {{remaining}} have currently only been associated with a <b>particular</b> locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in <b>particular</b> populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to <b>particular</b> symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a <b>particular</b> problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E

30|$|If {{values are}} universals, then {{a number of}} ontological presuppositions are {{virtually}} accepted and the related problems necessarily appear. First of all, {{the idea that there}} are universals entails that there are <b>particulars,</b> and the problem of how the two entities are related ensues. The instantiation of universals {{is one of the greatest}} problems of realist ontology. In simple words, those who accept the distinction between <b>particulars</b> and universals, need to explain how the latter get instantiated by the former entities. Most realists today reject the Platonic view that ideas (universals) may exist separately from <b>particulars.</b> Their typical view is that only instantiated universals exist. All we can know about <b>particulars</b> are expressed by universals, <b>particulars</b> themselves (in a ‘bare’ state) are inaccessible. Still, they must be presupposed, otherwise the plurality of things would collapse into a single entity. But then it is a problem of how universals get instantiated by <b>particulars.</b>|$|R
