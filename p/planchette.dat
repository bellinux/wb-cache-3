There is an academic and social distinction between martial forms of mediumship (such as tongji) and the spirit-writing that is typically practiced through <b>planchette</b> writing.|$|E

25|$|The <b>planchette</b> {{is guided}} by {{unconscious}} muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or <b>planchette)</b> is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince many people that spirits are truly at work... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state {{is one in which}} consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual's normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} Canadian {{banknote}} series to include <b>planchettes,</b> small green dots on the paper bills introduced in the 1935 Series (banknotes). These dots fluoresce blue under ultraviolet light and were used as a security feature. Some <b>planchettes</b> could be removed from legitimate bills, leaving a perfect bluish circle on the bill. <b>Planchettes</b> occurred with random position on both the obverse and reverse of banknotes, either on the surface or within the note.|$|R
5000|$|Though <b>planchettes</b> {{experienced}} great surges {{of popularity}} in Victorian times, in modern usage {{the term is}} most commonly associated with the heart-shaped pointers for Ouija or [...] "talking boards." [...] Rather than writing, these devices [...] "dictate" [...] messages by pointing to the board's printed letters and numbers. As writing <b>planchettes</b> were popularized during {{the beginning of the}} Spiritualism movement of the mid-19th century, <b>planchettes</b> predate the popularization of talking boards by nearly four decades.|$|R
50|$|The series also {{excluded}} former security features, {{such as the}} <b>planchettes,</b> green dots randomly occurring on {{the surface}} of the banknotes. <b>Planchettes</b> were replaced by coloured fibres embedded in the paper that fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light.|$|R

The content included webisodes, concert footage, limited edition wallpaper, b-sides and unreleased tracks.|$|E
500|$|Through an {{advertisement}} in The Times on 25 May 1937 and subsequent personal interviews, Price recruited a corps of 48 [...] "official observers", mostly students, who spent periods, mainly during weekends, at the rectory with instructions to report any phenomena that occurred. In March 1938 Helen Glanville (the daughter of S. J. Glanville, one of Price's helpers) conducted a <b>planchette</b> séance in Streatham in south London. Price {{reported that she}} made contact with two spirits, {{the first of which}} was that of a young nun who identified herself as Marie Lairre. According to the <b>planchette</b> story Marie was a French nun who left her religious order and travelled to England to marry a member of the Waldegrave family, the owners of Borley's 17th-century manor house, Borley Hall. She was said to have been murdered in an older building {{on the site of the}} rectory, and her body either buried in the cellar or thrown into a disused well. The wall writings were alleged to be her pleas for help; one read [...] "Marianne, please help me get out".|$|E

The angry mob goes to see the doctor, who claims the bag was sold. The bones end up belonging to [...] "Mr. Tippy", a dog that belonged to Terri. Scully gets upset over a joke Mulder makes and tells him she's returning to Washington. Margi and Terri celebrate their birthday and Brenda uses a Ouija board to know who she will marry; everyone thinks it's Scott before the <b>planchette</b> veers away from the C and spells out Satan. Upset, Brenda rushes to the bathroom where Margi and Terri are chanting [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] and is locked in, killed by glass from a shattered mirror. Detective White heads to Mulder's hotel room because she found a box which inside had her cat's collar, and then she attempts to seduce Mulder but they are interrupted by Scully who informs them about Brenda's death. Terri and Margi try to console Scott, who tells them off. Turned down, Terri is mad at him but Margi still likes him and leaves.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{introduction of the}} Ouija board by Charles Kennard's Kennard Novelty Company and acquisition of the talking board patent by his partner Elijah Bond on 1 July 1890, automatic-writing <b>planchettes</b> took a secondary role to the suddenly popular Ouija board and the many imitators its success spawned. Though early press articles had dubbed the Ouija the [...] "new planchette," [...] the patentees were initially quick to differentiate their devices from classic automatic writers by pairing them with paddle-shaped, pencil-less pointers far different in shape from other <b>planchettes</b> of the period. The design changes {{and focus on the}} elegantly varnished boards and their clearly stenciled letters arching across their fronts seem to have had the intended effect, and the items were enthusiastically welcomed by the public {{in much the same way}} <b>planchettes</b> had experienced their own craze some 23 years previously. From this point on, the pencil-equipped <b>planchettes</b> that had facilitated often-garbled spirit writing for nearly four decades were quickly shoved aside in favor of the cleaner, faster communications of these new [...] "talking boards." [...] Though writing <b>planchettes</b> would enjoy brief revivals in subsequent years as the Ouija's popularity similarly waxed and waned, by the 1930s only British toy companies such as Glevum Games continued to produce true writing <b>planchettes</b> in any worthwhile numbers. By the Ouija revival that followed the Second World War, true writing <b>planchettes</b> were no longer being manufactured in any significant numbers anywhere, having been finally completely taken over by the more popular Ouija as they faded into obscurity.|$|R

50|$|<b>Planchettes</b> came to America in 1858 when Spiritualist {{and social}} {{reformer}} Robert Dale Owen {{and his friend}} Dr. H.F. Gardner observed the devices in use at séances in Paris, and returned with several of them. Their friend, the Boston bookseller G.W. Cottrell, became the first to manufacture <b>planchettes</b> {{on a large scale}} the following year.|$|R
2500|$|The ouija ( [...] or [...] ), {{also known}} as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words [...] "yes", [...] "no", [...] "hello" [...] (occasionally), and [...] "goodbye", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small {{heart-shaped}} piece of wood or plastic called a <b>planchette.</b> Participants place their fingers on the <b>planchette,</b> and it is moved about the board to spell out words. [...] "Ouija" [...] is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc., but is often used generically to refer to any talking board. According to Hasbro, players take turns asking questions and then [...] "wait to see what the <b>Planchette</b> spells out" [...] for them.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of the automatic writing method used in the Ouija board is found in China around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the Song Dynasty. The method was known as fuji (扶乩), [...] "planchette writing". The use of <b>planchette</b> writing as an ostensible means of necromancy and communion with the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the Quanzhen School, until it was forbidden by the Qing Dynasty. Several entire scriptures of the Daozang are supposedly works of automatic <b>planchette</b> writing. According to one author, similar methods of mediumistic spirit writing have been practiced in ancient India, Greece, Rome, and medieval Europe.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Planchettes</b> took on {{a variety}} of forms during the height of their popularity. American <b>planchettes</b> were {{traditionally}} heart- or shield-shaped, but manufacturers produced a wide range of shapes and sizes hoping to distinguish themselves in the highly competitive and profitable market of the devices' late-1860s heyday. Manufacturers espoused the wonders and benefits of different materials (including various hardwoods, India rubber, and even glass), insulated castors, and various attachments meant to [...] "charge" [...] the devices or insulate the user from malevolent spirits. In Great Britain, <b>planchettes</b> took on the classical shapes popularized in early illustrations and newspaper depictions, with round, blunt noses and flat backs. Regardless of their shape or country of origin, almost all <b>planchettes</b> were equipped with brass castors and small wheels of bone or plastic, and their sometimes lavishly illustrated boxes were often packed with blank parchment, pencils, ouija-like folding letter sheets, and esoteric instructions espousing the mysterious communicative powers of the items.|$|R

2500|$|Businessman Elijah Bond had {{the idea}} to patent a <b>planchette</b> sold with a board on which the {{alphabet}} was printed, much like the previously existing talking boards. The patentees filed on May 28, 1890 for patent protection and thus are credited with {{the invention of the}} Ouija board. Issue date on the patent was February 10, 1891. They received [...] Bond was an attorney and was an inventor of other objects in addition to this device.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{studies have}} been produced, recreating {{the effects of the}} Ouija board in the lab and showing that, under {{laboratory}} conditions, the subjects were moving the <b>planchette</b> involuntarily. A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind. Skeptics have described Ouija board users as 'operators'. Some critics noted that the messages ostensibly spelled out by spirits were similar to whatever was going through the minds of the subjects. According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines in his book Pseudoscience and the Paranormal (2003): ...|$|E
2500|$|Micah {{brings home}} a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When {{they leave the}} house, the camera records an unseen force moving the <b>planchette</b> to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah {{sprinkles}} baby powder {{in the hallway and}} bedroom. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>planchettes</b> in Europe {{became popular}} enough {{to attract the}} {{attention}} of the Bishop of Viviers, who railed against their use in a pastoral letter in 1853. Despite their respected status in the growing religion of Spiritualism, <b>planchettes</b> remained a specialized novelty for adherents for the next 15 years, produced only within a small cottage industry or on special request by scientific instrument manufacturers. During this period, they remained popular only among devout séance circles and enthusiastic Spiritualists, who at the time still largely relied on the services of celebrity mediums (such as the Fox Sisters and D.D. Home) to lead spirit communications, rather than using <b>planchettes</b> and other [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] devices. Mediums, seeing their monopoly threatened, often rallied against the devices and warned of the dangers of amateur experimentation.|$|R
