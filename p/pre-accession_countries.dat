40|$|In an era {{of rapid}} {{technological}} change, information exchange, and emergence of knowledge-intensive industries {{it is critical to}} be able to identify the future skill needs of the labour market. Growing unemployment in EU member states and <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> in Eastern Europe combined with technological changes which make the skills of a significant number of workers obsolescent each year demand adequate knowledge of medium- and long-term demand for specific skills. Some EU members states have developed employment forecasting methods to identify future skill requirements which take account of the sectoral, occupational, and educational and training factors which influence supply and demand in the labour market for skills. A number of countries in Eastern Europe which are preparing to join the EU are interested in developing employment forecasting models that would provide them with similar information relating to skills. Taking account of the requirements of the Single European Market and increasing international mobility, it is desirable that the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> should develop models which, if possible, are comparable with existing methods of forecasting training and qualification needs in existing member states of the EU. This task requires regular medium-term forecasts which will extend the time horizon of decision makers beyond the current economic cycle, be applicable to the whole economy, allow speedy adjustment to changing circumstances, and which will take account of relevant factors such as investment plans, output and labour productivity forecasts, and technological change. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a summary of existing methods and data sets used to forecast education and training needs in four members of the European Union, in order to motivate similar work in three <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> We first provide a detailed account of the different approaches to forecast education and training needs in France, Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands. For each of these countries, we consider the labour market data on which employment forecasts are based and the current methods in use, examine how data reliability and accuracy of forecasts are dealt with, and discuss the dissemination and usage of forecast information generated by those systems. We then look at the same range of issues for three pre-accession Central European countries (Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia.) The paper concludes by suggesting a number of needed actions in preparation for developing an approach to forecasting education and training needs in the three <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> employment forecasting, education and training needs forecasting, labor market, transition...|$|E

From the five components of IPA (2007 - 2013) Serbia could have utilised only the first two components in the pre-accession process: building of EU institutions (EXCHANGE I-IV, Regional Socio-Economic Development Programme) and enhancing cross-border cooperation As a conclusion we can say that although substantial sums were invested from the above mentioned resources into the economy of Vojvodina for its development, the main indicator – the GDP – has been increasing only slightly, while these projects have no effects on decreasing unemployment. In the overall economic situation, unemployment is primarily decreased by emigration, in which Vojvodina Hungarians take part at a rate above the average compared to their headcount, thus decreasing the economic power of the community through emigration...|$|R

Two projects focused on the implementation of the WFD in an EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>country,</b> namely Romania. The other project was located in non-EU accession countries of the former Soviet Union where the approximation of EU directives or the drafting of new water laws along WFD principles was used as an instrument to help protect the Black Sea from pollution. The paper concludes that from project experience the use of local level pilot projects is very valuable at engaging stakeholders and that the use of highly prescribed public consultation schemes were not practical in the Black Sea basin but more flexible and ad hoc approaches had a very positive effect on the social learning process...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the experiences of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEs) in transition, which became EU members in the historical 2004 (and 2007) enlargement, evidences the importance of timing and targeting policy intervention for a balanced growth (Monasterolo et. al, 2008). In fact, even if the Countries, till the last financial and economic crisis, showed a clear path of convergence (EC, 2008; EC, 2009) with EU average levels of development thanks to a sustained growth in GDP, {{at the same time}} they had to face a notable increase in regional inequality (Brasili, 2005), mainly driven by the persisting backwardness of agricultural and rural areas. The European pre-accession funds had limited effect in preventing the spread in internal divergence because of the lack of ex ante and in itinere monitoring and evaluation (Monasterolo, 2008). Moreover, they failed in addressing specific problems and needs of so variegated areas due to the deficiencies in identifying and defining the characteristics of rural areas (Csáki, 2009). This paper will introduce a new map of Serbia, a current EU <b>pre-accession</b> <b>Country,</b> where a clear identification of rural areas is still lacking (Bogdanov, 2007). We identified the dynamic characteristics of urban and rural areas as well as their strengths and weaknesses, computing a principal components analysis on a group of 37 socio-economic, agricultural and structural variables, which are available periodically at a municipality level. Then, we delineated homogeneous regions through the cluster analysis. This disaggregated mapping at the local level represents the fundamental starting point for developing integrated and diversified rural policies, enriched by a bottom up approach, following a neo-endogenous vision (Hubbard, 2009). mapping rural areas, policy targeting, RD policy evaluation, EU enlargement, Community/Rural/Urban Development, O 18, P 25, R 58,...|$|R
40|$|Are there {{indications}} of {{real exchange rate misalignment}} {{in the case}} of the five <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries?</b> Will stable real exchange rates, required by two of the Maastricht criteria, be in line with economic fundamentals in the pre-EMU period in these countries? In order to address these questions, we employ the concept of the fundamental real exchange rate (FRER), taking into account the specific features of countries in the advanced stage of transition. The FRER model approximates the integration gain with the impact of foreign direct investment on trade and allows for larger current account deficits if external debt is below a safety limit. The model coefficients are calibrated according to our previous econometric work. Sensitivity tests are used to deal with uncertainty about the baseline assumptions. According to the FRERs, there were signs of overvaluation for all the pre-accession economies, with the exception of Slovenia, at the end of 2001. The second main finding relates to the feasibility of stable real exchange rates in the pre-EMU period. Stability of real exchange rates will not automatically be in line with economic fundamentals in the forthcoming period and, moreover, the FRERs do not move in one direction in all the <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> This finding suggests that some flexibility of exchange rates will be needed in the forthcoming period.

The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis of variance of co-financing rate, to which extent variability of rates is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance of co-financing rate across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

OECD indicators of overall regulation in product markets indicate that Croatias policies in 2007 were generally more restrictive of competition than were the policies in OECD countries. This {{is especially true for}} policies concerned with the degree of state control of the economy and with barriers to entrepreneurship. Regulatory obstacles to trade and foreign direct investment, by contrast, are in line with those of <b>pre-accession</b> European Union <b>countries</b> (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, and Poland in 2003, as well as Bulgaria and Romania in 2006), albeit well above the OECD average.

40|$|In March 2000, the European Council in Lisbon set out {{a ten-year}} {{strategy}} to make the EU the world's most dynamic and competitive economy. 2 One of the main priority areas in the Lisbon strategy or Lisbon agenda (as it is sometimes known) is to increase investments in knowledge, research, and education, both by governments and by enterprises. Increasing such investment has remained {{one of the most}} important areas for action in subsequent Commission communications on the progress of the Lisbon strategy. In 2002, the Commission named one of three priority areas as “Increasing investment in knowledge to ensure future competitiveness and jobs. The European Union must step up the effort in the areas of research, innovation, education and training, and increase its impact by pursuing a more integrated approach and place these policies under a common banner: a European area of knowledge… ” (European Commission 2002). And in 2004, the goal had hardly changed: “Improving investments in knowledge and networks, by implementing the ‘Growth Initiative’, all the while giving greater priority to the level and quality of investments in research, education and training; ” (European Commission 2004). These goals have been widely interpreted as calling for increased R&D spending in Europe, in order to attain a target of in the neighborhood of 3 per cent of GDP overall. From Figure 1, which shows the composition of the R&D/GDP ratio for three maJor EU regions (the 27 member <b>countries,</b> the 15 <b>pre-accession</b> member <b>countries,</b> and the 15 countries in the euro zone) along with the US and Japan, we can draw two conclusions: first, the 3 per cent target lies somewhere between the performance of the US and Japan, and second, the shortfall is entirely in business R&D. 3 1 This draft is incomplete and possibly incorrect in places.

First, we compare these estimates {{with a wide range}} of estimates in respect of the rest of the United Kingdom and the (<b>pre-accession)</b> <b>countries</b> of the European Union.

Although time spent in hospital does not give a satisfactory measure of HE, the linkage presents a rare opportunity for statistical analysis of survey respondents ’ mortality and morbidity. We show the results of survival analyses, quantifying the effectiveness of various definitions of ‘unhealthy’ as predictors of future mortality and morbidity.

The research {{focus is on the}} empirical analysis of the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co-financing mechanism. We investigate to what extent the variability of expected returns and of EU co-financing rates is due to structural project characteristics (sectors, countries) or to other unexplained factors, including errors in the appraisal. We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU co-financing rate depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability of economic rate of returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU co-financing of infrastructure supported by the EU funds. We suggest possible improvements, based on the idea to offer an incentive to projects with high-expected economic␣rates of return relative to a benchmark and showing ex-post the realism of the initial analysis.

40|$|At {{their meeting}} in February, the EU Council of Ministers {{acknowledged}} the deficiencies in BSE testing {{which had been}} found in Germany. Following discussion of this issue, Commissioner Byrne (Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection) urged ministers to review their own national procedures for BSE testing. In his briefing to the Agriculture Council, Commissioner Byrne noted that the total number of BSE cases in mainland Europe had almost doubled in 2001 to 957 cases. It was felt that this {{is more likely to be}} a consequence of increased testing and detection, rather than any increased incidence of the disease. However concerns were expressed over the age profile of the infected animals, with animals born as recently as 1998 testing positive for BSE. This is a clear indication that cattle were still being exposed to infection at that date, probably through contaminated meat and bone meal. The view was expressed that many of the mistakes which had been made in EU member countries were now being repeated in <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries.</b> Commissioner Byrne warned that the massive accumulation of stocks of meat and bone meal must be destroyed quickly, otherwise it would be only a matter of time before an accident or fraud led to a serious incident. Comment: It was recognised some time ago that the introduction of compulsory testing would overstretch the capacity of member states' laboratories to undertake the task. Against this background there may be some grounds for concern that EU meat which has not been effectively tested for BSE may be slipping through the net and be available for export to third countries. This is potentially a source of concern to ACP countries not only from a public health perspective but also from a production and export perspective. Should any of this suspect EU beef find its way into the markets of beef exporting ACP countries, these countries could find their BSE free status compromised, with serious consequences for their exports.

40|$|While EU beef {{production}} fell by 1. 8 % in 2001 (to 7. 26 million tonnes) {{from the}} already {{low levels of}} 2000, beef consumption was down 12 % compared to 1999 (to 6. 7 million tonnes). This exerted strong downward pressure on EU beef prices, which dropped below intervention-price levels and even in some countries below the safety-net level. Consequently intervention-stock levels grew rapidly to around 259, 000 tonnes by mid-December 2001. Prices only slowly recovered but were still below the intervention level by year end. Production {{is expected to increase}} in 2002 - 2003 as purchase for destruction schemes are discontinued, to reach 7. 7 million tonnes by 2004. It will then fall back slightly before rising to 7. 75 million tonnes by 2009. While consumption is recovering from the BSE-related consumer scares, there remains a downward trend in per capita beef consumption in the EU. Beef imports are set to grow slightly over the period as 'double zero' agreements with <b>pre-accession</b> <b>countries</b> come into effect. The re-opening of major export markets following the FMD crisis is leading to a recovery in EU beef exports (to 500, 000 tonnes in 2001). Exports are projected to grow to 740, 000 tonnes in 2003 - 2004, after which they may fall back slightly. Comment: Total EU beef exports are heavily dependent on the Russian market. Any changes in the Russian import regime or any economic problems in Russia can leave tens of thousands of tonnes of beef each month looking for temporary export markets. ACP beef producers will have to stay alert to these temporary fluctuations in the destination of EU beef exports and try to establish the capacity to effectively protect their markets when sudden import surges from the EU might undermine the functioning of national and regional markets important to ACP beef producers.
