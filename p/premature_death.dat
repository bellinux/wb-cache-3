40|$|The antismoking {{campaign}} has encouraged {{millions of people}} to quit smoking cigarettes and millions of others not to initiate the habit. Because quitting smoking, or deciding not to start, reduces one's mortality risks relative to the continuing smoker, we estimate that these consumption impacts resulted in the avoidance of more than 200, 000 <b>premature</b> smoking-related <b>deaths</b> during 1964 - 1978. On average, each of these <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> averted translates into 23 additional years of life. Furthermore, campaign-related smoking cessation and non-initiation during the 1964 - 1978 period {{will result in the}} avoidance of many more <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> in the coming decades. Although these figures suggest that the antismoking {{campaign has}} been successful, tens of millions of Americans continue to smoke and the <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> avoided constitute {{only a small fraction of}} the 4 million deaths attributable to smoking that occurred during the same years...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of his birth, Louis Stanislas was fourth in line to the throne of France, behind his father and his two elder brothers: Louis Joseph Xavier, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry. The former died in 1761, leaving Louis Auguste as heir to their father until the Dauphin's own <b>premature</b> <b>death</b> in 1765.

5|$|Minnesotans {{have low}} rates of <b>premature</b> <b>death,</b> infant mortality, {{cardiovascular}} disease, and occupational fatalities.

5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} or left unfinished is disputed among experts.

5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose <b>premature</b> <b>death</b> was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his <b>premature</b> <b>death</b> in 43 or 44.|$|E

Elizabeth and the still-married Robert go on holiday to Dorset, where she goes into labour and has a son, naming him John (after Jack Firebrace's late son).

40|$|Americans are {{increasingly}} overweight, {{with the number}} of obese adults and overweight children doubling between the late 1970 s and early 2000 s. Several studies of the health consequences of Americans’ weight gain indicate that health care costs and the number of <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> associated with obesity and overweight are high. A recent (lower) estimate of the number of <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> published in the Journal of the American Medical Associationreveals the uncertainty researchers face in associating weight status with mortality. Of course, scientific uncertainty does not mute demands for public action...|$|R
50|$|In his 1877 book On the Theory of Mass Phenomena in Human Society (Freiburg: Wagnersche Buchhandlung), Lexis {{proposed}} that all human deaths could be classified {{into one of}} three types: (i) normal deaths, (ii) infant <b>deaths</b> and (iii) <b>premature</b> adult <b>deaths.</b> He also {{proposed that}} the normal deaths were subject to random forces such that, if all infant and other <b>premature</b> <b>deaths</b> were eliminated, the ages at which people died would exhibit a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution. Furthermore, the average of those ages would be equal to {{the age at which}} most adults are actually observed to die (i.e., the modal age at death), even though the actual observations are taking place in the presence of infant and other <b>premature</b> <b>deaths.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shepseskare's {{relations}} to his predecessor and successor {{are not known}} for certain.

Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve publishes data on <b>premature</b> <b>death</b> {{rates by}} county, {{defined as those}} dying below age 74. According to the Kaiser Foundation, {{expanding}} Medicaid in the remaining 19 states would cover up to 4.5 million persons. Since expanding Medicaid expands coverage and expanding coverage reduces mortality, therefore expanding Medicaid reduces mortality by syllogism. Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Missouri and South Carolina, indicated on the map at right as having many counties with high premature mortality rates could therefore reduce mortality by expanding Medicaid, other things equal.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the pyramid}} and {{mortuary}} temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was {{stopped in the}} tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing {{the majority of the}} construction. The motivation for this might have been to legitimise his rule following the <b>premature</b> <b>death</b> of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not <b>premature</b> <b>death,</b> was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for <b>premature</b> <b>death,</b> similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
