30|$|The slots {{allocation}} {{activities to}} BMSs in MAC Superframe structure of IEEE 802.15. 4 {{are carried out}} {{with the support of}} different multiple access (MA) scheduling schemes. The scheduling access schemes can reduce collision, delay, avoids retransmission of the lost packets and energy consumption. Thus, the existing MA schemes in MAC protocols classifies the scheduling access schemes into three main categories; namely, reservation-based, contention-based and hybrid [12, 14]. These three scheduling access schemes assist to allocate slots to heterogeneous nature of a <b>patient’s</b> <b>data.</b> The nature of <b>patient’s</b> <b>data</b> is divided into three classes as aforementioned. However, the classifications of a <b>patient’s</b> <b>data</b> into three classes are not justifiable because these classifications do not discuss low and high threshold values of vital signs and delay-sensitive data. In fact, the existing literature classifies the <b>patient’s</b> <b>data</b> into four to five classes [25, 30]. The <b>patient’s</b> <b>data</b> are transmitted to the BANC using various scheduling access schemes as discussed in the following sub-sections.|$|R

25|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the various American states' rural health offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical {{facilities}} varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals. Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared {{to the spread of}} the basic technologies involved (internet access, audio/video compression algorithms, microphones and video cameras), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy. As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings. For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to protect patient medical information in compliance with HIPAA and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.|$|E
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} be adopted by healthcare professionals {{as a means to}} manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E

He argued that Goldacre had gone [...] "over the top" [...] in devoting a whole chapter (chapter five) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> from general practitioners, without fully pointing out how problematic these can be; such trials raise issues, for example, about informed consent and regulatory oversight.

500|$|In healthcare, Watson's natural language, {{hypothesis}} generation, and evidence-based learning {{capabilities are}} being investigated {{to see how}} Watson may contribute to clinical decision support systems for use by medical professionals. To aid physicians {{in the treatment of}} their patients, once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors, Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information; then mines <b>patient</b> <b>data</b> to find facts relevant to the patient's medical and hereditary history; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses; and finally provides a list of individualized, confidence-scored recommendations. The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data, notes from physicians and nurses, research materials, clinical studies, journal articles, and patient information. Despite being developed and marketed as a [...] "diagnosis and treatment advisor", Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process, only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed.|$|E

30|$|The Fuzzy Control Medium Access (FCMA) [49] {{implements}} acquisition, {{fuzzy logic}} control, and implementation phases for handling the non-real time data, normal real-time data, abnormal data, and emergency <b>data</b> of a <b>patient</b> body.

When a body coordinator receives the <b>patient’s</b> <b>data</b> then it uses the fuzzy rules {{to decide whether to}} assign CAP or CFP slots.
