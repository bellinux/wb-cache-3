25|$|In March 2011 Europol, the European Police, in {{a mission}} called Operation Rescue, arrested 184 alleged members out of 670 identified, of an online <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> and rescued 230 {{children}} {{which is considered}} as the biggest case of its kind.|$|E
25|$|On 10 October 2017, Proctor criticised Mike Veale, the Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, for {{allegedly}} “trashing” his reputation {{a second time}} by reviving claims of an establishment <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring.</b> Veale had called for a fresh inquiry into claims of cover-up and conspiracy in Westminster.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, {{a report}} {{appeared}} in the Daily Star Sunday claiming that Dando had investigated a <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> at the BBC during the mid-1990s and had handed a dossier on it to BBC management. It was implied that this may have prompted a revenge attack. The BBC said it had seen {{no evidence to support}} the claim.|$|E
50|$|Paton was openly gay. In 1982 he {{was convicted}} of gross indecency with two teenage boys aged 16 and 17, below the then-legal age of consent of 21, and served one year of a three-year prison sentence. Immediately {{following}} his death, numerous allegations of Paton drugging young boys, rape and his involvement in organised <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> came to light.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, {{for over}} £500,000 for six months. (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, {{was arrested in}} 2009 in {{connection}} with an unrelated fraud allegation.) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer {{who had worked for}} MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> and the Roma community.|$|R
50|$|Chris Beckett {{writes that}} while Webster accepts that abuse occurs, he {{considers}} many convictions against former residential workerers miscarriages {{of justice and}} sees them as similar to witch-hunts. Beckett sees Webster's case against the widespread belief that the residential care system was infiltrated by <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> as well-argued. According to Beckett, Webster argues that police procedures in North Wales dangerously reverse normal police methods, by starting with suspects and then interviewing {{large numbers of people}} to find out whether a crime was committed; this process is flawed since former residents of residential homes may have motives to make false accusations.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 October 2012, Entwistle {{appeared}} before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to answer questions following revelations that Savile had abused children on BBC property while working for the BBC. When asked by Committee chairman John Whittingdale if the BBC's reputation for trust and integrity was in jeopardy, Entwistle stated that allegations of child abuse at the BBC were a [...] "very, very grave matter". A Panorama investigation reported on what they considered {{to have been a}} <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> that might have operated for at least twenty years, and possibly as long as forty years, and BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson described it as the BBC's [...] "biggest crisis for over 50 years".|$|E

5000|$|Labour MP John Mann gave Scotland Yard detectives {{evidence}} in December 2014 relating to 22 political figures suspected {{of involvement in}} Westminster <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings,</b> including three serving MPs and {{three members of the}} House of Lords. The list of those alleged to have been involved in child sex abuse included fourteen Conservative politicians, five Labour politicians and three from other parties. Thirteen former ministers were among the list, of whom at least two were alleged to have assaulted young boys at [...] "abuse parties" [...] held at the Dolphin Square apartment block in central London. Mann said that some of his sources were highly placed officials within institutions, and that he believed the complexity of child abuse networks at the heart of government in the 1970s and 1980s had been seriously underestimated.|$|R
50|$|His second book, Psychopathic Cultures and Toxic Empires, {{examines}} the influence powerful psychopaths have on societies. Examples given of what Black terms psychopathic and toxic cultures include those within <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings,</b> politics, finance, gangs, security services, religious organisations and the media. He suggests {{that not only}} are high-functioning psychopaths drawn to positions of power, {{but they also have}} considerable influence in shaping human cultures and institutions of all sizes, to the extent that compliant non-psychopaths may continue conforming to a 'psychopathic culture' even after a psychopath that dominated it has moved on. Within the book and during a 2015 interview with academic and author Guy Mankowski Black uses examples from finance, the mass media and abuse rings to point out that ordinary citizens in many countries have a greater capacity than ever to expose wrongdoing and overcome abuses of power.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a close {{analysis of a}} scandal that broke in Mexico following publication of a book that accused businessmen and politicians of involvement in child trafficking and paedophilia. The book’s author, Lydia Cacho, was abducted, imprisoned, threatened with violence and charged with defamation. As further evidence of complicity in the protection of <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> surfaced, a firestorm of public anger and media scrutiny focussed on the plight of Cacho and key political figures including a state governor. A rare political space was thus opened for a debate on child rights. Yet it was a space that csos and child rights networks failed to exploit. This paper examines how child rights discourse had limited salience in circumstances where csos were compromised, uncommitted and disunited. Developing {{the concept of a}} ‘rights effect’, we argue that advocacy for child rights must not assume a natural fellowship with discourses of human rights generally, or with women’s rights, press freedoms and rule of law...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> was {{reported}} as having lured young boys into prostitution. Reports {{at the time}} of Peters' 1989 trial said the ring [...] "was used by highly placed civil servants and well-known public figures", but that the police did not have [...] "the evidence or manpower to pursue them in court". Also in 1989, The Glasgow Herald reported that the <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> resembled the Mafia in its organisation and strength and included [...] "well-placed and influential professional people linked to Westminster and Whitehall".|$|E
50|$|On 10 January 2011, Blanchard {{was given}} an {{indeterminate}} sentence of at least nine years, and two {{other members of the}} <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring,</b> Tracy Dawber and Tracy Lyons, were sentenced to four and seven years respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2015, it was {{reported}} that Brittan and Sir Peter Hayman were among the suspects who were involved in an alleged Westminster <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> operating in the 1980s, according to an investigation by the Australian current affairs programme 60 Minutes entitled Spies, Lords and Predators. One alleged victim accused Brittan of regularly abusing children at the Dolphin Square apartment block in Pimlico. The alleged victim told 60 Minutes that Brittan liked boys to dress in women's underwear before abusing them. The allegations of a <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> involving politicians, the police, and other high-profile names, were described by 60 Minutes as [...] "Britain's biggest ever scandal".|$|E
5000|$|The Jillings Report {{stated that}} {{allegations}} involving famous names and <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> were beyond its remit, and something best addressed at a potential later public inquiry. It found a child {{care system in}} which physical and sexual violence were common, from beatings and bullying, to indecent assault and rape. Children who complained of abuse were not believed, or were punished for making false allegations. The report stated {{that the number of}} children who were abused is not clear, but estimates range up to 200; in the early 1990s, around 150 had sought compensation. At least 12 former residents were found to have died from unnatural causes. The report states that some staff linked to abuse may have been allowed to resign or retire early. The report concludes that its panel members had considered quitting before publication, due to: [...] "...the considerable constraints placed upon us." [...] The final report's appendices included limited copies of the key witness statements taken by North Wales Police during their earlier investigation.|$|R
5000|$|Keaney {{was born}} on 5 October 1888, at Corralskin, Kiltyclogher, County Leitrim, Ireland, son of Terance Keaney, farmer, and his wife Mary, née McGowan. In 1911 he {{migrated}} to Australia and in 1916 he became a Christian Brother. In 1924 he became headmaster at Clontarf Orphanage, and he later taught at Christian Brothers College, Perth, and Christian Brothers College, Fremantle. In later life he supervised the building and running of child slave labour camps & <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> at Tardun and Bindoon using children forcibly deported from the UK. He died at Subiaco on 26 February 1954, aged 65. A statue was erected to his memory at Bindoon (that should be removed like that of Saddam Hussain in Baghdad). In an obituary he {{was referred to as}} 'The Orphan's Friend' whereas in reality this sadist routinely inflicted savage attacks and sexual abuse on his wards and as having given 'a life of devotion to the underprivileged boys…' ...|$|R
40|$|What are {{the risks}} {{associated}} with child sexual abuse? Who is at risk? From whom? For professionals working in the field of child abuse, the main answers to such questions are straightforward. There is a broad consensus that children are at risk from adults (and young people), often from men (and sometimes women) that they know. Fathers, step-fathers, uncles and brothers are often implicated. This is not, however, the focus of news coverage. Abductions, <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings</b> and abuse in children's homes attract intermittent but occasionally intense media attention. In contrast, sexual abuse of children within their own families is rarely front page news—except, that is, where the accusations are contested. Almost as soon as the existence of widespread abuse within ‘ordinary’ homes became public knowledge, this was over-shadowed by a series of high-profiled ‘scandals’, such as Cleveland, Rochdale and Orkney. The focus turned to questions of misdiagnosis, inappropriate intervention and the supposed coaching of children to make false accusations. More recently ‘false memory syndrome’ has hit the headlines suggesting that some adults' accounts of abuse can also be discredited. The news coverage often gives the impression that the main risks are not tochildren, but to parents, particularly fathers. How has this come to be the focus of public debate? Why is it that these risks have proved so much more ‘newsworthy’? This paper examines the media profile of {{the risks associated}} with sexual abuse and draws on interviews with journalists to seek to explain the shape of the coverage...|$|R

50|$|Retired child {{protection}} team manager Peter McKelvie, whose claims formed {{part of the}} Operation Fernbridge investigation, said in July 2014 that more than ten current and former politicians were {{on a list of}} alleged child abusers held by police investigating claims of a Westminster <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring.</b> Several, including Cyril Smith and Peter Morrison, were no longer alive, but other alleged abusers were reportedly still active in Parliament. McKelvie believes there are sufficient grounds to arrest at least one senior politician. McKelvie said that evidence of a powerful <b>paedophile</b> <b>ring</b> had been covered up in 1991. He told Labour MP Tom Watson that the police had discovered letters implicating powerful individuals in a paedophile network.|$|E
40|$|WARNING: The social topics {{dealt with}} in this paper are disturbing, being uncomfortably {{close to the surface}} of our {{everyday}} society; child abduction, <b>paedophile</b> <b>rings,</b> the child sex trade and child prostitution. These topics are portrayed through two creative artworks; a short story and a pictorial image. In combination they illustrate with shocking clarity how easily abuse can start and where it can end. The endeavour is to impart a message about the vulnerability of children through accessible forms of data representations, given that social research should have the capacity to make these kinds of statement about the world we live in. Both creative works are underpinned by extensive research into the realities of the situations they describe and may consequently be regarded as ethnographic, through fiction and quite literally, through an [ethno]graphic artwork. The social topics of the artworks; child abuse in these extreme forms, are aspects of reality in society which the education system from 0 - 18 years (ECM, 2003) and National Governing Bodies of sport in the UK are committed to combatting. Under Child Protection legislation (Children Act, revised in 2004) Sport England set up the Child Protection in Sport Unit (Sport England, 2001) which requires all NGBs to establish courses and reporting procedures to protect the young people they encourage in to their domains, such as the Safeguarding and Protecting Young Children course (Sports Coach UK, 2013). Thus, the ‘mediums and iconic / symbolic modes of communication’ (Gross, 1974 : 63) brought together in Crealivity become a means to educate about the social topics under the microscope. An outcome from this paper is to inform sports’ people about facets of our broader society, however unsavoury… a society we all take a part in, help to create, protect and enjoy...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, John Piggott (Mark Addy), a {{solicitor}} {{and the son}} of {{a notorious}} WYC officer, decides to explore the Atkins case himself. His inquiries lead him to Leonard Cole (Gerard Kearns), the young man who found the swan-stitched victim in 1974 and who is now being framed for Atkins' disappearance. Cole is tortured and murdered by the police, his death disguised as a suicide. Using information given by Myshkin, Piggott finds a mine shaft hidden in a pigeon shed near Laws' home, where it is revealed that a <b>paedophile</b> and child-murdering <b>ring</b> was run in West Yorkshire by Reverend Laws, and that clients of this ring included significant figures of society, among them businessmen such as Dawson and policemen such as Piggott's own father.|$|R
