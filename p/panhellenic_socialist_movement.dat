25|$|Themistoklis Sofoulis was, {{from the}} 1920s, the {{successor}} of Venizelos {{as leader of}} the Liberal Party, which survived policy failures, exile and ultimately death of the historical founder. In 1950, the son of Venizelos, Sophoklis Venizelos, succeeded as head of the Liberal Party at a time when an agreement was formed with the populists (name of the royalist party) against the communists during the civil war. The Center Union (Enosis Kendrou), founded in 1961 by Georgios Papandreou, became the ideological descendant of the Liberal Party. The Center Union eventually fade in the late 1970s and was replaced by a party further to the left, <b>Panhellenic</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> of Andreas Papandreou.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Andreas Papandreou, George Papandreou's son, {{founded the}} <b>Panhellenic</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement</b> (PASOK) in {{response}} to Karamanlis's conservative New Democracy party, with the two political formations dominating in government {{over the next four}} decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980. Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities (subsequently subsumed by the European Union) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained relations with neighbouring Turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's bid for EU membership.|$|E

50|$|The Hellenic Parliament was {{expected}} {{to vote on the}} proposed austerity measures on 6 May. New Democracy, the conservative minority party, vowed to vote against the bill, but the bill {{was expected}} to pass because of the <b>Panhellenic</b> <b>Socialist</b> <b>Movement's</b> large 160-seat advantage in Parliament. The government has pleaded with demoralised staff not to retire, fearing that a surge in benefits requests could further drain the public treasury.|$|R
50|$|The bill {{is to be}} {{submitted}} to the Greek Parliament {{in the first week}} of November 2009 and provides for the creation of a special state agency which will demolish illegally built homes on burned forest land and fine offenders.
