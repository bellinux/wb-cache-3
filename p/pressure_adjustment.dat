When using the top roller, the user can adjust {{it so that the}} thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or scraper bar in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays.

A practical alternative is titration without polysomnography during an afternoon nap (Nap-titration). The {{aim of the}} present study was to assess whether Nap-titration is appropriate for effective titration of CPAP. Following Nap-titration 24 eligible OSAHS patients started conventional CPAP therapy. The outcome of Nap-titration was verified after 2 weeks with CPAP <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustments</b> being performed in case of persisting OSAHS symptomatology. Polysomnography and a questionnaire evaluation were performed at baseline and 8 weeks after Nap-titration. Following Nap-titration 15 patients did not require pressure changes while in 9 patients' CPAP pressure was raised due to persisting OSAHS symptomatology. Control polysomnography after 8 weeks showed successful CPAP titration (Apnea-Hypopnea Index < 5) in 23 out of 24 patients. A pressure raise following polysomnography was indicated in 1 patient only. In addition, significant improvements were found in OSAHS symptomatology and quality of life. This study shows that in 96 % of OSAHS patients' successful CPAP titration is attained following Nap-titration whether or not supplemented by <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Therefore, Nap-titration with an adequate follow-up appears an appropriate procedure for the effective titration of CPAP.

Johnson reclaimed the lead from Burton on the 166th lap. Seven laps later, Bowyer had oversteer in the third turn which caused him to heavy contact with the wall and spun while attempting {{to get ahead of}} Riggs, triggering the ninth caution. Most of the leaders, including Johnson, chose to make pit stops. Johnson had an air <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> after reporting his car had oversteer, and Kyle Busch had four tires fitted and an chassis adjustment to increase the grip available. Edwards elected to install two tires and took over the lead for the lap-177 restart, followed by Stewart. Kyle Busch temporarily moved in front of Stewart for second, but Stewart retook the position because Kyle Busch slid up the track. He took second from Stewart on the following lap with assistance from teammate Johnson. On lap 180, Johnson moved back into the first position after he passed Kyle Busch and Edwards. Newman spun in turn two on lap 181 but avoided damage to his car, prompting the tenth caution.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{acting on}} near-surface winds over the Gulf Stream are diagnosed using 5 -yr outputs {{of a regional}} atmospheric model. The diagnostics for the surface-layer momentum vector, its curl, and its convergence are developed with a clear separation of <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> from downward momentum inputs from aloft in the surface-layer system. The {{results suggest that the}} downward momentum mixing mechanism plays a dominant role in contributing to the annual-mean climatological momentum curl, whereas the <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism plays a minor role. In contrast, the wind convergence is mainly due to the <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism. This {{can be explained by the}} orientation of background wind to the sea surface temperature front. The diagnostics also explain the relatively strong seasonal variation in surface-layer momentum convergence and the small seasonal variation in curl.

40|$|Abstract. Flexible and {{reliable}} gripping {{is a fundamental}} task in various micromanipulation and microassembly fields. Shape-controllable menisci based on <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> were proposed to pick up microobjects. Lifting force is provided by a controllable liquid bridge which is formed between the capillary tube and the microobject. The volume and {{the shape of the}} meniscus could be regulated dynamically by changing the pressure at the capillary nozzle orifice, thus the capillary force alters correspondingly. The <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> was realized by adjusting the height of the reservoir device precisely. Fluent software was used to simulate the fluid meniscus under different pressures. Experiments were performed to achieve controllable meniscus with different height difference of liquid level between the reservoir device and the capillary nozzle orifice, and microobjects griping operations were executed to verify the method...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{proposes to}} use changes in intra-industry {{specialization}} indicators {{over the period}} 1996 - 2008 to assess the potential for factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> that may arise in the USA if the proposed USA-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) is implemented. Results {{show that there is}} considerable scope for intra-industry specialization between Colombia and the USA. The TPA should result in a larger increase in US exports to Colombia than US imports from Colombia, because Colombian exporters face much lower tariffs in the USA market than do US exporters in the Colombian market. Given the tariff asymmetry, scope for intra-industry specialization, the relatively large size of the US market, and the small number of US industries that are likely to encounter factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures,</b> the USA should ratify the agreement immediately. Design/methodology/approach – Changes in intra-industry specialization indicators are used to identify US industries that may face factor <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> {{as a result of the}} proposed USA-Colombia TPA.

30|$|For {{simplicity}} of calculations, the mechanical volume change in domains is neglected as its value {{is very small}} and will not make a noticeable change in results. On the other hand, domain volumes will be updated in every time step. The solution to fluid flow alternates between flow through pipes and <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustments</b> between domains. This means, in each time step, the fluid flow through pipes is calculated and the total net flow to or from each domain will cause pressure change in domains. For stability analysis, a critical time step needs to be calculated. The procedure is to first calculate the critical time step for each domain and then take the minimum time step of all critical time steps as the global time step (Itasca 2008 b).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the signatures of atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism for surface wind convergence/divergence over major sea surface temperature (SST) frontal regions using global observations of satellite sounding and scatterometer. Lower tropospheric air thickness, {{which includes a}} sea-level pressure component modified by air temperature in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, is analyzed, and {{the relation between the}} Laplacian of the thickness and wind convergence are examined. Among four SST frontal regions in mid-latitudes, correlation between the thickness Laplacian and wind convergence is the largest over the Gulf Stream followed by those for the Agulhas Return Current and for the Brazil/Malvinas Current, and relatively small but still significant over the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension. These correlations strongly suggest that the <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism ubiquitously {{plays an important role in}} air-sea interaction over the global SST frontal regions.

40|$|The OPEC Cartel's {{spectacular}} {{success in}} raising real world oil prices {{over the past}} decade has brought about substantial net resource transfers from energy poor to energy rich countries within the world economy. In accomodating these resource transfers both energy exporting and importing economies have been confronted with <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures.</b> Of course the intensity and nature of these <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> has differed substantially between countries according to amongst other things a country's resource endowment, its net trade position with respect to oil and other energy based products and the degree of openness of its economy to world trade. Our concern in this paper is with quantifying the short and medium term <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> imposed on the South Korean economy assuming continued increases in real world oil prices. The results are derived from a multisectoral general equilibrium model. A feature of the model is its design flexibility and simple solution algorithm. We exploit this in the present study by comparing results for a range of experiments to accommodate differing assumptions about the Korean macroeconomic environment, labour market behaviour and Korean export demand. While the numerical results refer specifically to Korea, it is to be hoped that by rationalising them in terms of the underlying structural features inherent in the Korean economy the paper provides some guidance on the sorts of <b>adjustment</b> <b>pressures</b> likely to confront energy poor open economies assuming a continued movement in the world terms of trade towards oil. ...|$|R
40|$|The model {{discussed}} here {{is described in}} the study by Han et al. (1982) and is based on the shallow-water equations. It is noted that the mixed layer is another name for the earth's turbulent boundary layer when the latter is well stirred vertically, as under typical daytime conditions over land. The model abbreviates the vertical resolution by using only one and one-half layers; in this way, the computer power can be concentrated on the horizontal resolution of topographic effects. It is found that a steady flow pattern evolves over terrain when steady forcing occurs in the absence of surface heating or mixed-layer entrainment and that this simplification is removed when surface heating and entrainment do occur. While these findings are regarded as interesting, it is believed that they may be model dependent. The <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustments</b> upon the mixed layer caused by air movements above the mixed layer may be sufficient to preclude the evolution of a steady state on the mesoscale, even under the most ideal conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{friction}} of {{a stationary}} moving skate on smooth ice is investigated, {{in particular in}} relation to the formation of a thin layer of water between skate and ice. It is found that the combination of ploughing and sliding gives a friction force that is rather insensitive for parameters such as velocity and temperature. The weak dependence originates from the <b>pressure</b> <b>adjustment</b> inside the water layer. For instance, high velocities, which would give rise to high friction, also lead to large pressures, which, in turn, decrease the contact zone and so lower the friction. The theory is a combination and completion of two existing but conflicting theories on the formation of the water layer. Comment: 26 pages, 8 figures Posted at SciPos...|$|E
