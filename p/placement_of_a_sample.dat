We show that the standardway of setting up Bayes factor tests of themonophyly of a group, or the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> sequence in a known reference tree, can be misleading. The {{reason for this is}} related to the well-known dependency of Bayes factors on model-specific priors. Specifically, when testing tree hypotheses it is important that each hypothesis is associated with an appropriate tree space in the prior. This can be achieved by using appropriately constrained searches or by filtering trees in the posterior sample, but in a more elaborate way than typically implemented. If it is difficult to find the appropriate tree sets to be contrasted, then the posterior model odds may be more informative than the Bayes factor. We illustrate the recommended techniques using an empirical test case addressing the issue of whether two genera of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Suphrodytes and Hydroporus, should be synonymized.

Our refined Bayes factor tests, in contrast to standard analyses, show that there is strong support for Suphrodytes nesting inside Hydroporus, and the genera are therefore synonymized...|$|E
40|$|According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC; 2014), the {{prevalence}} rate of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is now 1 in 68. Among children with ASD, 50 - 80 % meet criteria for ADHD (van der Meer, 2014) and about 40 - 50 % experience clinical {{levels of anxiety}} (White et al., 2009). This study examined {{the prevalence}} of ADHD and anxiety, {{the ways in which}} ADHD and anxiety manifest (as reported by parents and teachers), and the special education <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of young children on the spectrum transition to school. Participants in this study included 180 children with ASD ages 4 to 7 years old and their parents and teachers. Behavior problems were measured using parent and teacher report on the Child Behavior Checklist – Parent Report and the Teacher Report Form (CBCL and C-TRF; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). Clinically significant symptoms of anxiety were reported by parents for 31 % for preschool children (ages 4 - 5) and 50 % for school-aged children (ages 6 - 7). Clinically significant symptoms of ADHD were reported by parents for 22 % for preschool children and 45 % for school-aged children. There was a disparity between parent- and teacher-reported anxiety and ADHD problems, with teachers reporting fewer problem behaviors overall. Specific behaviors endorsed more and less frequently by parents and teachers are discussed. Finally, this study found that children whose teachers reported clinically elevated ADHD symptoms {{were less likely to be}} placed in general education settings. Implications of these findings in the schools are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Superhydrophobic surfaces, {{both natural}} and artificial, cause aqueous drops to bead on them. The most {{water-repellent}} surfaces produce nearly perfect spheres with very little contact between water, solutes, and surface due to the roughness of the surface ^ 1 ^. However, a related phenomenon {{that has not been}} well appreciated until recently, is that colloidal particles in the aqueous drop remain highly mobile, and smaller-sized colloids migrate to the drop surface due to both the driving force of evaporation and the expanded liquid/air interface ^ 2 - 3 ^. A newly identified, third useful optical property resulting from the suspension <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aqueous drop by the superhydrophobic surface is that a spheroidal lens is created. Without any additional energy or instrumentation, the simple <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aqueous <b>sample</b> on <b>a</b> superhydrophobic surface followed by the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reagent drop results in very rapid mixing and a means to detect and monitor antigens via agglutination...|$|R

The HV-S 1, HV-S 2, and IHLW-S 1 exhaust stacks were tested together as a group (Test Group 3 - 4) because they share a geometric attribute: the common factor in their design is that the last significant flow disturbance upstream of the air <b>sampling</b> probe is <b>a</b> jog (i. e., two conjoined bends of equal and opposite curvature resulting in a change in elevation of the duct). Federal regulations require that <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> probe be located in the exhaust stack according to criteria established by the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities.

30|$|To {{identify}} the clusters, the algorithm described hereafter was applied. Each step of this identification comprises the <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sphere (<b>sampling</b> volume) over one atom {{of the volume}} investigated and the estimation of the local composition of the selected elements by counting atoms within this sphere. If the composition exceeds a given threshold, the atom {{at the center of}} the sphere is associated to a cluster. If the composition is lower than the threshold, the atom {{at the center of the}} sphere belongs to the matrix. The sphere is then moved to the next atom, and this procedure is applied again to estimate the composition and to compare it with the threshold value. This approach was used for all the atoms of the volume to identify those belonging either to the clusters or to the matrix. In this paper, <b>a</b> threshold <b>of</b> 75 % of Si and 5 % of Er was used to identify pure Si nanoclusters and Er-rich regions with <b>a</b> sphere radius <b>of</b> 1 nm.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} the control, navigation, and mapping capabilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hovering autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to explore flooded cenotes in Mexico as part of the DEPTHX project. The vehicle is equipped with <b>a</b> suite <b>of</b> navigation sensors that allow it to localize itself and and create maps of the complex 3 D environments in which it operates. It is passively stabilized in the roll and pitch directions and equipped with six thrusters that allow it to directly actuate each of the remaining degrees of freedom (x, y, z, and heading). We describe the control system of the vehicle, which provides open-water and near-wall manuevering capabilities. Near-wall behaviors are used in support of science operations such as visual wall survey and precise <b>placement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> core <b>sampling</b> tool. We also present the vehicle’s navigation system, which combines dead-reckoning, sonar-based localization, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the performance of these systems using experimental results from multiple test environments, including a test tank, a flooded limestone quarry, and the La Pilita cenote. Trajectory plots comparing desired and actual motions will be used to demonstrate the various vehicle controllers. Data from repeated localization experiments will be used to provide statistically meaningful measures of the accuracy of the dead-reckoning, localization, and SLAM filters...|$|R

Federal regulations require that <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> probe be located in the exhaust stack according to the criteria of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. These criteria address the capability of the sampling probe to extract <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> that is representative of the effluent stream. The tests conducted by PNNL during July 2010 on the HFEF system are described in this report. The sampling probe location is approximately 20 feet {{from the base of the}} stack. The stack base is in the second floor of the HFEF, and has a building ventilation stream (limited potential radioactive effluent) as well as a process stream (potential radioactive effluent, but HEPA-filtered) that feeds into it. The tests conducted on the duct indicate that the process stream is insufficiently mixed with the building ventilation stream. As a result, the air sampling probe location does not meet the criteria of the N 13. 1 - 1999 standard. The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over <b>a</b> grid <b>of</b> points in the duct cross section at the proposed sampling-probe location. The results of the test series on the HFEF exhaust duct as it relates to the criteria from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 are desribed in this report. Based on these tests, the location of the air sampling probe does not meet the requirements of the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 standard, and modifications must be made to either the HVAC system or the air sampling probe for compliance. The recommended approaches are discussed and vary from sampling probe modifications to modifying the junction of the two air exhaust streams...|$|R

The LB-C 2, LV-S 1, and LB S 2 exhaust stacks were tested together as a group (Test Group 5 - 6) because the common factor in their design is that the last significant flow disturbance upstream of the air <b>sampling</b> probe is <b>a</b> reduction in duct diameter. Federal regulations() require that <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> probe be located in the exhaust stack according to the criteria of the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. These criteria address the capability of the sampling probe to extract <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> that represents the effluent stream. The testing on scale models of the stacks conducted for this project was part of the River Protection Project—Waste Treatment Plant Support Program under Contract No. DE-AC 05 - 76 RL 01830 according to the statement of work issued by Bechtel National Inc. (BNI, 24590 -QL-SRA-W 000 - 00101, N 13. 1 - 1999 Stack Monitor Scale Model Testing and Qualification, Revision 1, 9 / 12 / 2007) and Work Authorization 09 of Memorandum of Agreement 24590 -QL-HC 9 -WA 49 - 00001. The internal Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) project for this task is 53024, Work for Hanford Contractors Stack Monitoring. The testing described in this document was further guided by the Test Plan Scale Model Testing the Waste Treatment Plant LB-C 2, LB-S 2, and LV-S 1 (Test Group 5 - 6) Stack Air Sampling Positions (TP-RPP-WTP- 594). The tests conducted by PNNL during 2009 and 2010 on the Group 5 - 6 scale model systems are described in this report. The series of tests consists of various measurements taken over <b>a</b> grid <b>of</b> points in the duct cross-section at the designed sampling probe locations and at five duct diameters up and downstream from the design location to accommodate potential construction variability. The tests were done only at the design sampling probe location on the scale model of LB-S 2 because that ductwork was already constructed. The ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999 criteria and the corresponding results of the test series on the scale models are summarized in this report...|$|R
40|$|Although long-term-care (LTC) {{placement}} may {{shorten the}} survival of persons with Alzheimer’s disease, studies have not examined whether the timing <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> matters. <b>A</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 258 persons with Alzheimer’s disease and their family caregivers was used in a Cox survival model that included care-recipient impairments, caregiver characteristics, and LTC placement as covariates. Placement was associated with shortened survival, but the later the placement, the smaller the impact <b>of</b> <b>placement</b> on survival time. In an elaboration on prior work, the increased risk of death associated with wishfulness–intrapsychic caregiver coping was found to occur independently <b>of</b> LTC <b>placement.</b> This is the first study to link delayed LTC with <b>a</b> reduced risk <b>of</b> death in Alzheimer’s disease. Interventions to assist family caregivers in the home are indeed appropriate; nevertheless, these findings may help long-term caregivers accept eventual institutionalization for their care recipients when care at home threatens their own health. D ESPITE extensive research into the etiology of Alz-heimer’s disease (AD), available treatments provide only limited symptomatic relief, and {{they are unable to}} prevent, stop, or cure the disease (National Institute on Aging, 2004).

Efforts to understand the variation in survival among persons with AD have focused on the characteristics of the diagnosed person.
