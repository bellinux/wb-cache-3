30|$|The {{signs are}} {{consistent}} using different subsets of the data, with the regression {{using data from}} mall A showing the highest goodness of fit (the adjusted R squared is 0.295). The estimated coefficient of size_worker is significant and positive, showing that larger is the quantity of goods handled per worker, longer the PD. A larger number of workers will instead reduce the parking duration, given a constant volume of goods transported. Also, the estimated coefficient for vehicle_loading is significant and positive. This variable can take only four possible integer values ranging from 1 (0 to 25 % of the vehicle is filled with goods) to 4 (75 to 100 % of the vehicle is full). Perhaps, when the vehicle is filled more, the loading/unloading of the specific goods takes longer time, as goods inside the vehicle must be sorted. Another possibility {{is that if the}} vehicle is fuller might indicate that the driver is at the beginning of its tour and therefore is less in hurry. The estimated coefficient for pickup is also significant and positive: whenever the task performed include returning with some goods <b>picked-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loaded in the vehicle, the PD is longer. The coefficient for qtime is negative for two of the three subsets, possibly indicating that longer waiting times in queue are related with lower PD. However, we cannot trust this result as the p-values are very large, hence the estimates are not statistically significant. Lastly, the estimated coefficient for the binary variable van is negative, indicating that the PD for vans are shorter than for trucks. However, only combining data from both malls we obtained a slightly significant estimate, while using data from mall A and B individually the estimates are not statistically significant.|$|E

40|$|The ECGs I micro-fabricate <b>are</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flexible, stretchable {{and wireless}} circuits that can <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> the skin directly. The device is {{encased in a}} conformal, silicon-like substrate, that allows the ECG <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attached with the electrodes. Each electrode has been previously measured and verified {{that it will be}} correctly placed for an accurate reading. Prototyping this ECG/electrode device allows the user to mount the prototype directly to the patient without having to attach and wire ten other electrodes. This prototype solves the issue that comes about when a doctor, nurse or emergency medical technician must attach a traditional 12 -lead ECG that requires sufficient knowledge and experience to place each electrode accurately and precisely in order to achieve an accurate reading. In my fabricated device, the ECG <b>is</b> wired directly <b>to</b> the three most crucial electrodes placed at V 2, V 3 and V 4 based on the traditional precordial electrode placement for a 12 -lead ECG. By covering these three positions, my research team and I can ensure we achieve an accurate reading, and will find the correct placement due to the compact design with pre-placed electrodes. Another benefit of this prototype is its flexibility. This allows the circuit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more durable when being <b>picked-up,</b> transferred <b>to</b> the patient, and then removed; this may also allow for multiple applications whereas conventional electrodes can only be used once. This prototype is currently in the preliminary stages of testing and will hopefully be implemented into medical practice in the future. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an adaptive time-frequency denoising algorithm. Other denoising methods use a very general probability-based noise model and as general-purpose algorithms rarely consider the a priori {{knowledge about the}} signal. Main novelty of the proposed algorithm is the running quasi-continuous scalo-temporal model of background activity built and subtracted from the ECG in order to yield a rectified representation of cardiac action. Our algorithm {{is based on the}} P, QRS and T wave borders automatically detected in the ECG and adapts the general information on expected local signal bandwidth to each particular heartbeat. This leads to determine timefrequency regions containing cardiac representation. The complement <b>is</b> assumed <b>to</b> contain only the background activity representation and thus these values can <b>be</b> <b>picked-up</b> directly <b>to</b> the timescale model of noise. For the remaining part of scalo-temporal surface the noise is interpolated with cubic splines in each scale independently and than extrapolated to lower scales. The numerical tests performed with use of artificially noise-affected test signals reveal highly discriminative properties of the method. The amount of removed noise varies from 65 % to 90 % (SNR increased by 6. 5 dB and 11. 6 dB respectively) depending on input noise level. The timefrequency noise model is quasi-continuous and adapts to the physiological changes of muscular activity using maximum available real data points. The use of the standard bandwidth function is arbitrary for the ECG, but allows the user to adapt the method to other signals of variable information density...|$|R
30|$|In the {{simulation}} studies above {{we tried to}} annotate the delivery activities with as realistic cost and time values as possible, mostly {{on the basis of}} observations from a real-world dataset. For those parameters that we needed to estimate and that showed to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall result, such as the average congestion in the city or the capacity of a cargo bike, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate how changes in these parameters would affect the outcome. A cost that we only considered in a sensitivity analysis is the cost for those parcels that are stored and picked-up from a DP. The extent of this cost depends on the infrastructure of the considered LSP. Smaller LSPs usually collaborate with shops from where customers can pick up their parcel, while larger LSP have their own service points which also offer other services. While in the first case the cost per <b>picked-up</b> parcel amounts <b>to</b> about € 1, in the latter case the costs are almost negligible, since the infrastructure is there anyway (and which we assumed in the analysis).|$|R
6000|$|Aug. 12th. I wrote {{you last}} from Rome, I think--didn't I? {{but it was}} after that that I heard of your having had at the last awful delays and complications, awful strike-botherations, over your sailing. I knew nothing {{of them at the}} time.... I can only hope that the horrid memory of it has been brushed and blown away for you by the wind of your American kilometres. I {{remained}} in Rome--for myself--a goodish while after last writing you, and there were charming moments, faint reverberations of the old-time refrains--with a happy tendency of the superfluous, the incongruous crew to take its departure as the summer came on; yet I feel that I shouldn't care if I never saw the perverted place again, {{were it not for the}} memory of four or five adorable occasions--charming chances--enjoyed by the bounty of the Filippis.... My point is that they carried me in their wondrous car (he drove it himself all the way from Paris via Macerata, and with four or five more <b>picked-up</b> inmates!) first <b>to</b> two or three adorable Roman excursions--to Fiumicino, e.g., where we crossed the Tiber on a medieval raft and then had tea--out of a Piccadilly tea-basket--on the cool sea-sand, and for a divine day to Subiaco, the unutterable, where I had never been; and then, second down to Naples (where we spent two days) and back; going by the mountains (the valleys really) and Monte Cassino, and returning by the sea--i.e. by Gaeta, Terracina, the Pontine Marshes and the Castelli--quite an ineffable experience. This brought home to me with an intimacy and a penetration unprecedented how incomparably the old coquine of an Italy is the most beautiful country in the world--of a beauty (and an interest and complexity of beauty) so far beyond any other that none other is worth talking about. The day we came down from Posilipo in the early June morning (getting out of Naples and round about by that end--the road from Capua on, coming, is archi-damnable) is a memory of splendour and style and heroic elegance I never shall lose--and never shall renew! No--you will come in for it and Cook will picture it up, bless him, repeatedly--but I have drunk and turned the glass upside down--or rather I have placed it under my heel and smashed it--and the Gipsy life with it!--for ever. (Apropos of smashes, two or three days after we had crossed the level crossing of Caianello, near Caserta, seven Neapolitan [...] "smarts" [...] were all killed dead--and this by no coming of the train, but simply by furious reckless driving and a deviation, a slip, that dashed them against a rock and made an instant end. The Italian driving is crapulous, and the roads mostly not good enough.) But I mustn't expatiate. I wish I were younger.

How is Gross, dear woman, and how are Mitou and Nicette--whom I missed so at Monte Cassino? I spent four days--out from Florence--at Ned Boit's wondrous--really quite divine [...] "eyrie" [...] of Cernitoio, over against Vallombrosa, a dream of Tuscan loveliness and a really admirable séjour.... I spent at the last two divine weeks in Venice--at the Barbaro. I don't care, frankly, if I never see the vulgarized Rome or Florence again, but Venice never seemed to me more loveable--though the vaporetto rages.
