40|$|Effective {{material}} handling {{plays a key}} role in cutting costs. Well-organized {{material handling}} can cut production cost by optimizing product transfer paths, decreasing the damage rate and by increasing the utilization of storage space. This report presents the development of an analysis system for StoraEnso Hylte’s <b>paper</b> <b>reel</b> database. The system extracts and classifies key points from the database which are related to material handling; like attributes related to the product (<b>paper</b> <b>reel),</b> forklift truck information and storage cell utilization. The analysis based on <b>paper</b> <b>reels</b> includes the damage rate and transfer paths of <b>paper</b> <b>reels.</b> A mathematical model is also presented, which tells us that the probability of damage per transport is more important than the number of transports for <b>paper</b> <b>reels</b> handling.

40|$|Abstract. In paper {{industry}} {{there is a}} strong need for an identification system that would carry on the identification code of a specific reel throughout its life cycle. Application of passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) systems in {{paper industry}} requires novel tag antenna designs for identification of <b>paper</b> <b>reels.</b> By attaching the tag antenna to the reel core between the core and the wrapped paper the identification data of a particular reel can be stored throughout its whole life cycle. However, paper attenuates the electromagnetic wave, and therefore energy harvesting for the tag’s microchip and backscattering of the identification data back to the reader is challenging. In addition, the wavelength of electromagnetic wave decreases when it propagates through paper, which affects the electrical dimensions of the tag antennas. In this paper we analyze the challenges in identification of <b>paper</b> <b>reels</b> with passive UHF RFID technology, and present an evolutionary tag antenna design for passive UHF RFID of <b>paper</b> <b>reels.</b> This C-tag antenna can be identified omnidirectionally around an industrial <b>paper</b> <b>reel.</b> ...|$|R

THE PAPER TRIM PROBLEM. C. D. Johanson, Operations Research Analyst, N. Z. Forest Products Limited. The problem of fitting orders for <b>paper</b> <b>reels</b> across the parent <b>reel</b> from a <b>paper</b> machine to minimise waste is a well known application of linear programming. N. Z. Forest Products Limited now minimise trim loss on certain grades of <b>reeled</b> <b>paper</b> using two package programs on the IBM 1130 computer. One uses linear programming and the Gilmore-Gomory knapsack algorithm. The other uses heuristic methods {{similar to those of}} a human scheduler.

40|$|Abstract: This work aims {{to solve}} a {{real-world}} industrial problem of trim loss minimization that a paper mill in Peshawar encounters on regular basis. The mill produces master <b>paper</b> <b>reels</b> of a standard width. The orders received are for smaller widths called auxiliary widths. The objective is to meet the order using minimum possible number of master reels. The study begins with determination of the width combinations of auxiliary reels of different widths. The width combination process determines the quantity and cutting patterns of reels of required sizes {{in a manner that}} minimizes trim losses while satisfying production orders. The problem is solved in two phases. The first phase is based on Simplex Method that generally leads to non-integer solution. The second phase uses binary programming in order to determine an integer solution. The program is coded in MATLAB.

Continuing research under the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) addresses thermal characteristics of reeled trailing cable under dynamic test conditions more representative of field conditions, where operators constantly reel in and pay out cable.

40|$|Web breaks are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most significant runnability problems in a pressroom. This work concerns the analysis of relation between various parameters (variables) characterizing the paper, printing press, the printing process and the web break occurrence. A large number of variables, 61 in total, obtained off-line as well as measured online during the printing process are used in the investigation. Each <b>paper</b> <b>reel</b> is characterized by a vector x of 61 components. Two main approaches are explored. The first one treats the problem as a data classification task into "break" and "non break" classes. The procedures of classifier training, the selection of relevant input variables and the selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier are aggregated into one process based on genetic search. The second approach combines procedures of genetic search based variable selection and data mapping into a low dimensional space. The genetic search process results into a variable set providing the best mapping according to some quality function. The empirical study was performed using data collected at a pressroom in Sweden. The total number of data points available for the experiments was equal to 309. Amongst those, only 37 data points represent the web break cases. The results of the investigations have shown that the linear relations between the independent variables and the web break frequency are not strong. Three important groups of variables were identified, namely Lab data (variables characterizing paper properties and measured off-line in a paper mill lab), Ink registry (variables characterizing operator actions aimed to adjust ink registry) and Web tension. We found that the most important variables are: Ink registry Y LS MD (adjustments of yellow ink registry in machine direction on the lower paper side), Air permeability (character- izes paper porosity), Paper grammage, Elongation MD, and four variables characterizing web tension: Moment mean, Min sliding Mean, Web tension variance, and Web tension mean. The proposed methods were helpful in finding the variables influencing the occurrence of web breaks and can also be used for solving other industrial problems...|$|R
