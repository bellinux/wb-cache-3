5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> from its shell.|$|E

40|$|The spiral galaxies, {{including}} our galaxy, {{are created by}} the gravito-radiative forces generated by colliding black holes {{at the center of}} quasars. The gravito-radiative force is predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. A quasar is assumed to have a circular disk of highly compressed neutrons (ylem) orbiting around black holes. The collision of two black holes at the center generates the gravito-radiative force, exerted on the ylem disk, producing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> bars of stars with 180 ◦ rotational symmetry. This <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> bars develop into a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> spiral <b>arms,</b> keeping the 180 ◦ rotational symmetry. Therefore, the number <b>of</b> spiral <b>arms</b> must be even. Our Milky Way galaxy has two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> and has the 180 ◦ rotational symmetry, indicating that we have had two galactic nuclear explosions.
