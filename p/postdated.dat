She added that in 2007, the couple borrowed ₱1.4 million from her. The following year, Oliver issued several checks as payment for their debt. Some of the checks, however, bounced, she said. She further stated that in July 2008, she entered into a compromise agreement with the couple under which Evangeline immediately paid her ₱300,000 in cash. The couple also agreed {{to settle the balance}} of ₱1.1 million in monthly installments—from August 20, 2008 to February 20, 2010.

500|$|Eckfeldt {{set aside}} [...] "master coins"—coins struck with extra care using new dies and {{polished}} planchets. He also put aside interesting foreign coins {{sent to the}} mint as bullion. [...] These pieces became the Mint's Cabinet, or coin collection. To fill gaps in this collection, he used old dies to strike <b>postdated</b> coins. [...] Specialists have discovered that some dies he chose for this purpose [...] had not been used together to strike coins for commerce, thus creating unique specimens. Among the pieces acquired for the Mint was a Brasher doubloon, of which only six are known today. Eckfeldt often spent from his own funds to acquire the coins for the Mint. The collection eventually evolved into the Smithsonian Institution's National Numismatic Collection.|$|E

The specific epithet is the Latin word lanceolata, meaning [...] "spear-shaped", and refers to the shape of the leaves. Lance-leaf geebung is the common name. The term geebung is derived from the Dharug language word geebung.

500|$|Before Kościuszko {{left for}} France, he {{collected}} his back pay, wrote a will, and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor. Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded {{for twenty years}} {{in a spirit of}} mutual admiration. Jefferson wrote that [...] "He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." [...] In the will, Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black slaves, including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work. Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest, which was tied up in the courts until 1856. Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest. [...] The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court. He had made four wills, three of which <b>postdated</b> the American one. None of the money that Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African Americans in the United States was ever used for that purpose. Though the American will was never carried out, its legacy went to found an educational institute for African Americans in the United States—at Newark, New Jersey, in 1826, bearing Kościuszko's name.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, German {{botanist}} Karl Friedrich von Gaertner had {{coined the}} name Pentadactylon angustifolium in 1807 from a specimen {{in the collection}} of Joseph Banks to describe {{what turned out to be}} the same species. The genus name derived from the Greek penta- [...] "five" [...] and dactyl [...] "fingers", and refers to the five-lobed cotyledons. The horticulturist Joseph Knight described this species as the narrow-leaved persoonia (Persoonia angustifolia) in his controversial 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, but the binomial name is illegitimate as it <b>postdated</b> Andrews' description and name. | id = 58148 |accessdate=10 February 2013 }} Carl Meissner described a population from the Tambo River in Victoria as a separate variety, Persoonia linearis var. latior in 1856, but no varieties or subspecies are recognised. German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name Linkia linearis in 1891, from Cavanilles' original description of the genus Linkia but the name was eventually rejected in favour of Persoonia. In 1919, French botanist Michel Gandoger described three species all since reallocated to P.linearis; [...] P. phyllostachys from material collected at Mount Wilson sent to him by the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and P.walteri and P.breviuscula from Melbourne-based plant collector Charles Walter, whose records have been questioned. The short-leaved material of [...] P.breviuscula was noted to have been collected in Queensland but this is now thought to have been incorrectly recorded. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of which turned out to be species already described.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} delivery {{outcome in}} women undergoing induction of labor for <b>postdate</b> pregnancy {{in relation to}} fetal gender. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 365 nulliparous and 127 multiparous women carrying singleton <b>postdate</b> pregnancies with unfavorable cervix were enrolled.

RESULTS: Women carrying male fetuses showed higher rate of caesarean section than those carrying females, in both nulliparous and multiparous women. Moreover, women carrying male fetuses presented more frequently with (i) interval between induction of labor and delivery > 24 hours (P <. 0002); (ii) augmentation of labor after cervical ripening (P <. 0391); (iii) meconium-stained liquor (P<. 0126); and (iv) higher neonatal weight (P <. 0011) than those carrying females.
