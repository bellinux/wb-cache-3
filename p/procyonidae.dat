500|$|The taxonomic {{classification}} {{of the red}} panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist Frédéric Cuvier initially described the red panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the raccoon (<b>Procyonidae),</b> though he gave it the genus name Ailurus, (from Ancient Greek αἴλουρος, [...] "cat"), based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective fulgens, [...] "shining". At various times, it has been placed in the <b>Procyonidae,</b> Ursidae, with Ailuropoda (giant panda) in the Ailuropodinae (until this family was moved into the Ursidae), and into its own family, the Ailuridae. This uncertainty comes from difficulty in determining whether certain characteristics of Ailurus are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.|$|E
500|$|The family Ursidae {{is one of}} nine {{families}} in the suborder Caniformia, or [...] "doglike" [...] carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers {{can be explained by}} the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in <b>Procyonidae,</b> where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.|$|E

60|$|Among {{the fossils}} of Pikermi, Gaudry found the {{successive}} stages {{by which the}} ancient civets passed into the more modern hyænas; through the Tertiary deposits of Western America, Marsh tracked the successive forms by which the ancient stock of the horse has passed into its present form; and innumerable less complete indications of the mode of evolution of other groups of the higher mammalia have been obtained. In the remarkable memoir on the phosphorites of Quercy, to which I have referred, M. Filhol describes no fewer than seventeen varieties of the genus Cynodictis, which fill up all the interval between the viverine animals and the bear-like dog Amphicyon; nor do I know any solid ground of objection to the supposition that, in this Cynodictis-Amphicyon group, we have the stock whence all the Viveridæ, Felidæ, Hyænidæ, Canidæ, and perhaps the <b>Procyonidæ</b> and Ursidæ, of the present fauna have been evolved.

Within the Cacomistle species there are 5 subspecies (Bassariscus sumichrasti variabilis, Bassariscus sumichrasti sumichrasti, Bassariscus sumichrasti oaxacensis, Bassariscus sumichrasti notinus, and Bassariscus sumichrasti latrans).|$|E

5000|$|The olinguito [...] (Spanish for [...] "little olingo", Bassaricyon neblina, colloquially {{known as}} the [...] "kitty bear") is a mammal of the raccoon family <b>Procyonidae</b> that lives in montane forests in the Andes of western Colombia and Ecuador.

50|$|Members of Family <b>Procyonidae</b> (raccoons, coatis) are smallish animals, with {{generally}} slender {{bodies and}} long tails. Nineteen extant species in six genera are currently recognized. Except for the kinkajou, all procyonids have banded tails and distinct facial markings, and like bears, are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} soles of their feet. Most species have nonretractile claws. Early procyonids {{may have been an}} offshoot of the canids that adapted to more omnivorous diets.|$|E

50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), <b>Procyonidae</b> (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), Ailuridae (red panda), Otariidae (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and Phocidae (earless seals) (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and <b>Procyonidae</b> have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|E
50|$|Bassariscus is a genus in {{the family}} <b>Procyonidae.</b> There are two species in the genus: the ring-tailed cat or {{ringtail}} (B. astutus) and the cacomistle (B. sumichrasti). Genetic {{studies have indicated that}} the closest relatives of Bassariscus are raccoons, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago. The two lineages of Bassariscus are thought to have separated after only another two million years, making it the extant procyonid genus with the earliest diversification.|$|E
5000|$|Ever {{since the}} giant panda was first {{described}} to science {{they have been}} a source of taxonomic confusion, having been variously classified as a member of <b>Procyonidae,</b> Ursidae, Ailuridae, or even their own family Ailuropodidae [...] This in part of their similarities with the red panda in particular the presence of a [...] "thumb" [...] and five fingers; the [...] "thumb" [...] - actually a modified sesamoid bone - helps it to hold bamboo while eating.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{of their}} general build, the <b>Procyonidae</b> are often popularly viewed as smaller cousins {{of the bear}} family. This is {{apparent}} in their German names: a raccoon is called a Waschbär (washing bear, as he [...] "washes" [...] his food before eating), a coati is a Nasenbär (nose-bear), while a kinkajou is a Honigbär (honey-bear). Dutch follows suit, calling the animals wasbeer, neusbeer and rolstaartbeer respectively. However, it is now believed that procyonids are {{more closely related to}} mustelids than to bears.|$|E
5000|$|Procyon is a genus of nocturnal mammals, {{comprising}} {{three species}} {{commonly known as}} raccoons, in the family <b>Procyonidae.</b> The most familiar species, the common raccoon (P. lotor), is often known simply as [...] "the" [...] raccoon, as the two other raccoon species in the genus are native only to the tropics and less well known. Genetic {{studies have shown that}} the closest relatives of raccoons are the ring-tailed cats and cacomistles of genus Bassariscus, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|The {{white-nosed coati}} (Nasua narica), {{also known as}} the coatimundi (...) , is a species of coati {{and a member of the}} family <b>Procyonidae</b> (raccoons and relatives). Local names include pizote, antoon, and tejón. It weighs about 4 - 6 kg. However, males are much larger than females, and small females weigh as little as 2.5 kg and large males as much as 12.2 kg. On average, the total length is about 110 cm, about half of that being the tail length.|$|E
50|$|The South American coati, or ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), is {{a species}} of coati, members of the raccoon family (<b>Procyonidae),</b> from {{tropical}} and subtropical South America. In Brazilian Portuguese it is known as quati. Weight in this species is 2 - 7.2 kg and total length is 85 - 113 cm, half of that being its tail. Its color is highly variable and the rings on the tail may be quite weak, but it lacks the largely white muzzle ("nose") of its northern cousin, the white-nosed coati.|$|E
