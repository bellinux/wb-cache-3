40|$|Karin Hannes said: What's being female {{got to do}} with anything? Little or nothing, because I know as {{many young}} males who have a {{difficult}} time maintaining an academic position while also being a husband and a father. I agree that there is a higher percentage of males having a wife that is less ambitious then they are, which makes the juggle between work and family life a bit more comfortable for them. However, it was my personal choice to opt for a male that is at least as ambitious as I am, spends professional time abroad and intends to grow in his job. There was a time where I thought I would have been better of with "a wife"; the type of person that has been described by Trisha Greenhalgh as the one bringing in the sandwiches that you have forgotten on the table [...] . (after having dressed up three toddlers in the rush to get them into child care in time, so that you can enter an aula of around 400 students feeling relaxed and prepared to engage with them). But I do not have such a wife, and neither does my partner. As time goes by, I have learned to deal with Murphy's law. I became a bit more chaotic, need to <b>postpone</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> more often, publish an article less a year. And frankly spoken, no-one really seems to care. In the end the number of papers I produce, the key-notes I have been able to give and the projects for which I succeeded in attracting money actually mean very little compared to being able to participate in the activities that are organized in preschool, seeing the stars in the eyes of my children because I was able to make it in time for their performance. My partner and I both have, of course, the luck to be working in a family friendly working environment, where colleagues allow us to reach our potential without making too many compromises in our personal life. We often drop a ball while juggling, but who the hell does not? Do I think there is an inequality between man and women? Yes, and the numbers can show us this. There is still much to achieve in setting up a judgment system where the career output of both men and women is measured based on the time they were actually professionally active, taking into account some major life events. But until that happens, let us not fall into the trap of getting manipulated, just because we are carrying a womb with us. status: publishe...|$|E

The voice of treaty started to raise as soon as the war was <b>postponed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>meeting</b> of delegation teams was called in Shikarjong but no decision was made. Nepali delegation team returned as they were to discuss with prime minister, Jung Bahadur Rana. In the meeting with Tibetan delegation, Jung Bahadur demanded one crore rupees for expenses of war and for returning the Tibetan land captured by Nepal. It was very hard for Tibetan delegation to make such a decision so Kaji Til Bikram was sent to Sikarjong along with the Tibetan in September. The ambassador of China replied with proud that he can give four lakhs rupees for war expenses and five lakhs rupees as penantly for the destruction of Nepalese troops in Lhasa. The ambassador also replied that the Tibet is a state of China and the Emperor gave it to Nuns only for religious purpose so Tibet was not subjected to give even one palm length of land to Nepal; if Nepal did not returned immediately from Tibet then Nepal must be ready to fight war with China. As Nepalese were not in support of this condition, the attempt of Treaty failed.|$|R

40|$|Meetings of shareholders, societies, {{and clubs}} often require a minimal {{participation}} quorum. In {{the absence of}} a quorum, no valid decisions can be made; thus, decisions are <b>postponed</b> to <b>a</b> later <b>meeting.</b> This paper examines the effect of such quorum constraints on both individual behavior and collective outcomes in a model of costly meetings. We show that when a binding quorum constraint delivers an immediate decision, it also induces a welfare loss with respect to the outcome that prevails when no quorum applies, potentially including policy distortions. When the quorum requirement is high and causes the decision to be postponed, the number of participants in the (second) meeting may decrease with respect to the zero-quorum rule. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
