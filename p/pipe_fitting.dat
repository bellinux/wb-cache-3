2500|$|Further complicating matters was a $30 million bid in August 2005 by Philadelphia-based {{real estate}} {{development}} company Lubert-Adler Management to purchase a [...] parcel of land {{on the corner of}} 9th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW. This land was owned by a trade union, the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and <b>Pipe</b> <b>Fitting</b> Industry (the Pipefitters), and the union's historic, 90-year-old headquarters occupied the site. Marriott, Gould, and the city hoped to convince the Pipefitters to sell their building for the hotel development. To prevent the Lubert-Adler purchase, WCSA placed a $900,000 deposit on the Pipefitters' property, and pledged that the historic building would be incorporated into the new hotel rather than demolished. On August 22, the Pipefitters agreed to sell their [...] parcel to WCSA for $30 million. This sale significantly strengthened the appeal of the Williams-preferred site.|$|E
2500|$|The {{planning}} process took longer than anticipated {{because it was}} complicated by additional real estate deals. On January 26, 2005, Kingdon Gould III (a local developer) swapped a [...] lot on {{the southeast corner of}} 9th Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW for a similar-sized lot {{at the site of the}} old convention center. This land swap was essential to constructing the new convention center [...] "headquarters hotel." [...] The site preferred by Mayor Williams and recommended by his task force was not large enough for the planned hotel, and not contiguous. Gould's lot would create a unified site large enough for the headquarters hotel. The deal began taking shape in August 2005, after the D.C. City Council had approved the awarding of the RFP. The WSCA put a $900,000 down payment on the lot (which included the historic former headquarters of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and <b>Pipe</b> <b>Fitting</b> Industry and an adjacent small piece of land). The city and Gould engaged in lengthy negotiations over the price of Gould's land, and whether a payment or land swap would be needed. A land swap was agreed to, and the city was able to move ahead with plans to build the Washington Marriott Marquis (the 1,430-room [...] "headquarters hotel" [...] long-desired by the city). The Gould land swap deal removed from northeastern-most lot on the old convention center site from the control of the Hines-led group, although it remained subject to the restrictions of the master plan. The land swap still required city council approval.|$|E

The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.|$|E
