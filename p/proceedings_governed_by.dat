40|$|On October 1, 1973 the Supreme Court promulgated rules {{prescribing}} {{the practice}} and procedure to be followed in cases and <b>proceedings</b> <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> Chapters I-VII and Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act. The procedural changes are extensive, permeating every stage of straight bankruptcy and Chapter XIII Wage Earner proceedings. One {{of the more important}} rules is Bankruptcy Rule 13 - 307 (d), which deals with claims of secured creditors in Wage Earner proceedings under Chapter XIII. Secured creditors have challenged the validity of Rule 13 - 307 (d), claiming that the rule modifies the secured party 2 ̆ 7 s substantive right to full recovery of the contract price. Thus, they allege that it is a substantive rule of law and outside the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s rulemaking power. Various courts have made conflicting decisions. The resolution of this issue will have significant impact on future creditor-purchaser relations and on the future of Chapter XIII Wage Earner proceedings as a viable alternative to straight bankruptcy...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{preliminary}} injunctions (injunctive relief) in civil proceedings {{has not been}} monographically processed and published in the Czech Republic {{for more than one}} hundred years. That is in spite of the practical relevance and topical debates pertaining to the topic. A whole array of problematic questions connected to preliminary injunctions is controversial and also legal opinions in Czech commentary literature considerably diverge in respect to particular issues. The thesis offers a systematic approach to preliminary injunctions and <b>proceedings</b> <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> the Czech Civil Proceedings Code and the Statute on Special Court Proceedings ("OSŘ" and "ZŘS"). Attention is paid to historic developments and comparable jurisdictions (especially Germany and Austria), which are used as a reference in cases where Czech sources are insufficient. The aim of the work is to pose and answer fundamental questions of the "law of preliminary injunctions". The work deals with function, typology, relation to the proceedings based on merits, interlocutory character, limits, means, effects, particularities (such as demonstration, justification), requirements for granting and possibilities of enforcement of preliminary measures, further with relation to relative legal creatures (i. e. preliminary enforceability) and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Legal {{status of}} a minor in civil {{proceedings}} The diploma thesis describes different stages and types of civil proceedings in their relation to the legal position of a minor (person {{under the age of}} 18). Legal position of a minor is assessed mainly in relation to his mental capacity and to the procedural rights to which the minor is entitled. The thesis approaches all of the civil proceedings {{from the point of view}} of a minor and points out all proceedings in which the minor can find himself to be a witness or a party. The main focus is given to the <b>proceedings</b> <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> the Act no. 292 / 2013 Coll., Code on Special Court Proceedings. A detailed description of the proceedings regarding interim relief, the court proceedings itself as well as the execution of a court decision is given. Furthermore, the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into the Czech civil proceedings was assessed. The main focus of this assessment was given to the best interest principle and to the child's right to be heard in matters directly affecting him. Each proceeding is also analysed from the point of the public authorities and other parties involved. In particular, the thesis assessed the position of the court (judge), of the child care services and the legal guardians of the minor. The main goal of the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The subject. This essay {{describes}} the procedural treatment of non-contentious matters in Italy. After a brief historical recount {{on the evolution}} of the concept of ‘non-contentious jurisdiction’, from Roman law to the law in force, the chapter emphasizes the extreme variety of non-adverse <b>proceedings</b> <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> the Code of civil procedure and special statutes as well. The purpose of the article is to understand the ‘default rules’ of non-adverse proceedings (meaning the rules applicable insofar as the law does not ordain otherwise) provided by the Code of civil procedure. These rules outline a procedure in chambers that is simpler and less time-consuming than the ordinary one: for these reasons, the procedure in chambers has been increasingly adopted for the judicial treatment of a few contentious matters, with mixed results. Methodology. The methodological basis for the study: general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, comparison, description); private and academic (comparative legal, interpretation, formal-legal). Results. It is difficult to foresee whether in the near future more attention will be devoted by Italian legislators to non-contentious jurisdiction so as to lay down rules that are uniform and consistent. In recent decades, Italian civil procedure has been re-written again and again in the attempt to solve the most serious and enduring problem of the justice system, namely, the excessive length of proceedings. Conclusions. As far as non-contentious matters, in light of the notorious overload of Italian courts the author believes that they could be handles more efficiently by administrative authorities. </p...|$|E

40|$|The South Australian Constitution {{fails to}} provide a useful {{mechanism}} for settling deadlocks between the two Houses of its bicameral Parliament. With both Houses of the South Australian Parliament having equal power with respect to all Bills (except money Bills), disputes between the two House inevitably arise. Throughout {{the history of the}} South Australian Parliament the Conference of Managers has been the preferred method for reconciling such differences, especially when a parliamentary session is drawing to a close and an important Government Bill is under threat of not being passed.

An examination of the Conference process clearly demonstrates that the informal procedures allow Managers to speak freely so that the maximum of agreement and the limit of concession are ascertained. The Conference has become the preferred method for resolving disputes as the flexible procedures are responsive to the perceived urgency of the situation as opposed to the statutory alternative. The success of the Conference process is principally brought about by having Managers from each House who accurately represent the opinion of their respectiv...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s position on the private enforceability of commitment decisions in national courts in the European Union in light of the current state of European law and other important procedural and practical considerations for third parties wishing to bring enforcement proceedings. As will become apparent, national courts faced with an application for private enforcement will have to grapple with a series of challenging legal issues concerning the nature of commitment decisions. The first of these questions will concern whether a commitment decision, which is a Community measure, will be capable of enforcement by application of the concept of direct effect of Community law. Our examination of the principles of direct effect indicates, however, that reliance on this concept may cause difficulties for national courts. Secondly, the principle of national procedural autonomy requires that enforcement <b>proceedings</b> will be <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> the procedural rules of the national court seized of the action. Even if commitment decisions are directly effective, there may consequently be substantial impediments to their effective private enforcement due to the national rules of procedure in the Member States...|$|R

40|$|In its 2011 report “Expert Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in England and Wales” (Law Com No. 325), the Law Commission {{recommended}} that the admissibility of expert evidence in criminal <b>proceedings</b> should be <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> a new statutory regime comprising a new statutory reliability test in combination with codification and refinement of existing common law principles relating to “assistance”, “expertise” and “impartiality”. The Government declined to enact the Law Commission’s draft Bill {{due to a lack}} of certainty as to whether the additional costs incurred would be offset by savings. Instead the Government invited the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee (CrimPRC) to consider amendments to the Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR) to introduce, as far as possible, the spirit of the Law Commission’s recommendations. The consequent amendments to CrimPR Part 33 (now CrimPR Part 19) in combination with the making of the new Practice Direction CrimPD 33 A (now CrimPD 19 A) by the Lord Chief Justice, resulted in what he described in his 2014 Criminal Bar Association Kalisher Lecture as “a novel way of implementing an excellent Report”.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the notion of ‘victim’ {{primarily}} refers to the position of the person who, {{in the course of a}} (sacred, religious, legal, etc.) procedure, is ritually sacrificed to avert the wrath of the gods or to preserve peace in the community. In early modernity the Latin victim (sacrificial animal) was also used as a reference to Jesus Christ. Christ was seen as the Lamb of God, the innocent sacrificial lamb which, after an unfair trial, was crucified and died for the sins of the world. In the eighteenth century, under influence of the Enlightenment, the victim concept has been secularized and come to refer to every casualty of bad luck, crime, or disaster. Art history, however, offers interesting examples of pictures of mythical figures such as Sisyphus and Prometheus, representing early images of secularized victimhood in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the present day, the concept of victimhood is often used to define the position of the injured party in criminal proceedings. In this frame, the injured victim, looking for legal recognition, is juxtaposed against the position of the accused who is characterized as the possible culprit. However, reflection on the history of the victim concept reveals that it primarily refers to the position of the wrongly or falsely accused or condemned in the course of legal (or pseudolegal) <b>proceedings.</b> A state <b>governed</b> <b>by</b> the rule of law (‘rechtsstaat’) can be defined as a legal form of society which does its utmost to avoid the justice system producing its own victims.
