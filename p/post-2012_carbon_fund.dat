Eleven pilotprojects carried out under the ActivitiesImplemented Jointly (AIJ) program and financedby Sweden are evaluated. Actual project costsare found to exceed projected costs in allcases.

Nos últimos anos assistiu-se a um desenvolvimento destes fundos, o que reflecte por um lado a preocupação ambiental, e por outro lado o interesse na possibilidade de obter lucro através do investimento em actividade de carácter ambiental. Em 2006 surge o primeiro e único fundo de carbono de origem portuguesa, o Luso <b>Carbon</b> <b>Fund</b> (LCF), que tem por objectivo a compra e venda de licenças de emissão de carbono e o desenvolvimento de projectos que visam a redução das emissões de carbono. Dado o crescimento destes fundos no mercado, questiona-se a {{performance}} dos fundos de investimento em carbono bem como a sua utilidade. Para responder a estas questões é utilizada uma abordagem de benchmarking para analisar o LCF. Em primeiro lugar é avaliada {{a performance}} do LCF face à performance de outros fundos de investimento portugueses, desta avaliação com base em amostras das cotações das unidades de participação conclui-se que o LCF parece ser aquele que parece apresentar a melhor performance. De seguida é avaliada a performance financeira do LCF face ao investimento em créditos de carbono disponíveis no mercado, de onde se conclui, com base nos dados das amostras que parece ser preferível o investimento no mercado de carbono através destes fundos. Conclui-se então deste trabalho que do ponto de vista dos investidores os fundos de investimento de carbono podem ser uma boa alternativa aos fundos de investimentos convencionais, e que para aqueles interessados em obter lucro no mercado de carbono, estes fundos parecem ser com base na análise a melhor opção face à compra e venda dos créditos de carbono. Expecting {{profit from the}} mechanisms created by the Kyoto Protocol, Assigned Amount Units, Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism, appeared <b>carbon</b> investment <b>funds</b> that aim to obtain capital by trading carbon credits. Over the last years the number of <b>carbon</b> investment <b>funds</b> grew up quickly evidencing simultaneously the environmental concern and the interest in making profits through the investment in environmental actions. In 2006, appeared the first <b>carbon</b> investment <b>fund</b> managed by a Portuguese company, the Luso <b>Carbon</b> <b>Fund</b> (LCF) based on carbon credits trading and in investing in projects {{that is expected to}} generate carbon credits. Because of the <b>carbon</b> investment <b>funds</b> growth, there is an interest on study the performance of these funds. Moreover, there is a question about the utility of these funds. To answer these questions it is used a benchmarking approach to analyze the LCF. In first place the performance of LCF is compared with the performance of other Portuguese investment funds resulting that LCF is the fund with the best performance. The financial performance of the LCF is then compared with the performance of the carbon credits available in the market, from this comparison {{it can be seen that}} the investment in the carbon market behind investment <b>carbon</b> <b>funds</b> is preferable than accessing directly the carbon market. We conclude from this work that for usual investors, investment <b>carbon</b> <b>fund</b> can be a good alternative to the conventional investment funds.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} CDM {{potential}} in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam by focusing {{not only on}} the absolute GHG abatement value of these countries. Rather, the potential of CDM inflows into the three countries will be identified through assessing the comparative CDM endowment on the basis of an holistic analysis of each country, thereby highlight the relative positions of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Vietnam in the global CDM market. The three main factors determining the competitiveness of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam in the global CDM market will be examined, namely "Potential supply size - countries' facts", "Country business climate" and "Country CDM institutions and CDM project experience". The study shows the overall competitiveness level of each studied country as well as discusses which activities a country shall take to maximise the opportunities to convert theoretical mitigation options into real CDM investments. In Vietnam, for instance, the highest challenge now is to make CDM ideas economically feasible. This study shows that it is questionable that a boom of CDM investment inflows into Vietnam or - in more quantitative word - a dozen of CDM projects will be registered before 2012. In Cambodia, the probability to get a couple of CDM projects running in the first commitment period is not high although the country is quite ahead in establishing their CDM institutions in comparison with other LDCs. One of the solutions to get through the narrow window is to gain attention from multilateral <b>carbon</b> <b>funds,</b> like the Community Development <b>Carbon</b> <b>Fund</b> (CDCF) and Bio <b>Carbon</b> <b>Fund</b> (BioCF). In the case of Lao PDR, this study demonstrates that the entry into the CDM is likely to be extremely high competitive for them given their poor CDM endowment and the "lag behind" activities of the government in constituting its own CDM structure. Thus, Laos needs to make a greater effort to develop its capacity to provide a basic sufficient framework to make the country as of one CDM-LDC destination in the international donors' eyes.
