Peripheral induction of CTL specific for the nucleocapsid protein of JHMV by vaccination with recombinant vaccinia viruses was unable to provide significant protection to a subsequent lethal virus challenge. By contrast, the transfer of nucleoprotein-specific CTL protected mice from a subsequent lethal challenge by reducing virus replication within the central nervous system, demonstrating the importance of the CTL response to this epitope in JHMV infection. Transfer of these CTL directly into the central nervous system was at least 10 -fold more effective than <b>peripheral</b> <b>transfer.</b> Histological analysis indicated that the CTL reduced virus replication in ependymal cells, astrocytes, and microglia.

Alternative paths from the slow 3 alpha process to produce CNO seed nuclei could change their fate. The C- 11 (p,gamma) N- 12 reaction is an important branch point in one such alternative path. At energies appropriate to stellar evolution of very low-metallicity, massive stars, nonresonant capture dominates the reaction rate.

This transition occurs when the proton capture rate on 13 N is faster, due to increasing stellar temperature (greater than or equal to 10 (9) K), than the N- 13 beta-decay rate. The rate of this reaction is dominated by the resonant capture through the first excited state of O- 14 (E-r= 0. 528 MeV). However, through constructive interference, direct capture below the resonance makes a non-negligible contribution to the reaction rate. We have determined this direct contribution by measuring the asymptotic normalization coefficient for O- 14 [...] > N- 13 +p.

Despite medical management, infection may be refractory to treatment and continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. We investigated adoptive transfer as an approach to treat and prevent neurotropic CMV infection in an adult immunodeficient mouse model. SCID mice were challenged with intracranial murine CMV (MCMV) and reconstituted with MCMV- or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -sensitized splenocytes, T cells, or T-cell subsets. T cells labeled with vital dye or that constitutively generated green fluorescent protein (GFP) were identified in the brain as early as 3 days following <b>peripheral</b> <b>transfer.</b> Regardless of specificity, activated T cells localized to regions of the brain containing CMV, however, only those specific for CMV were effective at clearing virus. Reconstitution with unsorted MCMV-immune splenocytes, enriched T-cell fractions, or CD 4 + cells significantly reduced virus levels in the brain within 7 days and also prevented clinical disease, in significant contrast with mice given VSV-immune unsorted splenocytes, MCMV-immune CD 8 + T cells, and SCID control mice. Results suggest CMV-immune T cells (particularly CD 4 +) rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier, congregate at sites of specific CMV infection, and functionally eliminate acute CMV within the brain. In addition, when CMV-immune splenocytes were administered prior to a peripheral CMV challenge, CMV entry into the immunocompromised brain was prevented.

40|$|The hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid {{feedback}} {{control is a}} dynamic, adaptive system. In situations of illness and deprivation of energy representing type 1 allostasis, the stress response operates to alter both its set point and <b>peripheral</b> <b>transfer</b> parameters. In contrast, type 2 allostatic load, typically effective in psychosocial stress, pregnancy, metabolic syndrome, and adaptation to cold, produces a nearly opposite phenotype of predictive plasticity. The non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) or thyroid allostasis in critical illness, tumors, uremia, and starvation (TACITUS), commonly observed in hospitalized patients, displays a historically well-studied pattern of allostatic thyroid response. This is characterized by decreased total and free thyroid hormone concentrations and varying levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) ranging from decreased (in severe cases) to normal or even elevated (mainly in the recovery phase) TSH concentrations. An acute versus chronic stage (wasting syndrome) of TACITUS can be discerned. The two types differ in molecular mechanisms and prognosis. The acute adaptation of thyroid hormone metabolism to critical illness may prove beneficial to the organism, whereas the far more complex molecular alterations associated with chronic illness frequently lead to allostatic overload. The latter is associated with poor outcome, independently of the underlying disease. Adaptive responses of thyroid homeostasis extend to alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations during fetal life, periods of weight gain or loss, thermoregulation, physical exercise, and psychiatric diseases.

We investigated the forces produced by FPL single motor units during a weak static grip involving all digits by spike-triggered averaging from single motor units, and by averaging from twitches produced by intramuscular stimulation. Nine adult subjects were studied. The forces produced at each digit {{were used to assess}} how forces produced in FPL are distributed to the fingers. Most FPL motor units produced very low forces on the thumb and were positively correlated with the muscle force at recruitment. Activity in FPL motor units commonly loaded the index finger (42 / 55 units), but less commonly the other fingers (P < 0. 001). On average, these motor units produced small but significant loading forces on the index finger (∼ 5. 3 % of their force on the thumb) with the same time-to-peak force as the thumb (∼ 50 ms), but had no significant effect on other fingers. However, intramuscular stimulation within FPL did not produce significant forces in any finger. Coherence at 2 – 10 Hz between the thumb and index finger force was twice that for the other finger forces and the coherence to the non-index fingers was not altered when the index finger did not participate in the grasp.

40|$|In {{the present}} review, signal-processing {{capabilities}} of the canal lateral line organ imposed by its peripheral architecture are quantified {{in terms of a}} limited set of measurable physical parameters. It is demonstrated that cupulae in the lateral line canal organ can only partly be described as canal fluid velocity detectors. Deviation from velocity detection may result from resonance, and can be characterized by {{the extent to which a}} single dimensionless resonance number, N (r), exceeds 1. This number depends on four physical parameters: it is proportional to cupular size, cupular sliding stiffness and canal fluid density, and inversely proportional to the square of fluid viscosity. Situated in a canal, a cupula may benefit from its resonance by compensating for the limited frequency range of water motion that is efficiently transferred into the lateral line canal. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>transfer</b> of hydrodynamic signals, via canal and cupula, leads to a nearly constant sensitivity to outside water acceleration in a bandwidth that ranges from d. c. to a cut-off frequency of up to several hundreds of Hertz, significantly exceeding the cut-off frequency of the lateral line canal. Threshold values of hydrodynamic detection by the canal lateral line organ are derived in terms of water displacement, water velocity, water acceleration and water pressure gradients and are shown to be close to the detection limits imposed by hair cell mechano-transduction in combination with the physical constraints of peripheral lateral line signal transfer. The notion that the combination of canal- and cupular hydrodynamics effectively provides the lateral line canal organ with a constant sensitivity to water acceleration at low frequencies so that it consequently functions as a low-pass detector of pressure gradients, supports the appropriateness of describing it as a sense organ that "feels at a distance" (Dijkgraaf in Biol Rev 38 : 51 - 105, 1963) ...|$|E

This was done in connection with our program to use transfer reactions to obtain data for nuclear astrophysics, in particular for the determination of the astrophysical S- 17 factor for Be- 7 (p, gamma) B- 8 using two (Be- 7,B- 8) proton transfer reactions. Elastic scattering was measured using Li- 7, B- 10, C- 13 and N- 14 projectiles on Be- 9 and C- 13 targets at or about E/A = 10 MeV/nucleon. Woods-Saxon type optical model potentials were extracted and are compared with potentials obtained from a microscopic double folding model. Several nucleon-nucleon effective interactions were used: M 3 Y with zero range and finite range exchange term, two density dependent versions of M 3 Y and the effective interaction of Jeukenne, Lejeune, and Mahaux. We find that the latter one, which has an independent imaginary part, gives the best description. Furthermore, we find the renormalization constant for the real part of the folding potential to be nearly independent of the projectile-target combination at this energy and that no renormalization is needed for the imaginary part. From this analysis, we are able to eliminate an ambiguity in optical model parameters and thus better determine the asymptotic normalization coefficient for B- 10 [...] >B- 9 +p. Finally we use these results to find optical model potentials for unstable nuclei with emphasis on the reliability of the description they provide for <b>peripheral</b> proton <b>transfer</b> reactions. We discuss the uncertainty introduced by the procedure in the prediction of the distorted wave Born approximation cross sections for the (Be- 7,B- 8) reactions used in extracting the astrophysical factor S- 17 (0) ...|$|R
40|$|Object: By {{making the}} “vascularized nerve flap for {{complete}} spinal cord gap ” model, we assessed the histological {{effect of this}} method. Method: Eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups: group A and group B. Group A included “nonvascularized nerve flap ” models, whereas group B consisted of “vascularized nerve flap ” models. In each group, we <b>transferred</b> <b>peripheral</b> nerves {{to fill the void}} made by complete surgical transection of the spinal cord. Postoperatively, we administered intravenous antibiotics and performed urethral catheterization and disimpaction everyday. Tissue sampling was done on postoperative day 10. Results: No necrosis occurred in group B, vascularized models. In group A, nonvascularized models, necrosis of the grafted nerves was observed in 2 of the 4 rats. As for the specimens of Kluver-Barrera’s method for selective myelin sheath staining, in group B, all specimens were stained with Kluver-Barrera’s method for selective myelin sheath staining, whereas in group A, 2 specimens with successful engraftment were not stained. With type IV collagen immunostaining, the increase of type IV collagen around the grafted area was not so severe, compared with that of normal region in vascularized cases. In nonvascularize...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSurvival of {{peripheral}} CD 8 (+) T cells requires TCR {{interactions with}} peptide-MHC complexes (p-MHC). In the adult mouse, {{in the presence}} of homeostatic mechanisms that strictly control T cell numbers, it is likely that diverse T cell clones may compete for shared patterns of p-MHC. In the present study, we investigate whether the recognition of p-MHC overlaps between different T cell populations and what role does this process plays in the establishment of the peripheral T cell pools. Using an experimental strategy that follows the fate of adoptively transferred polyclonal T cells into RAG(0 / 0) or different TCR transgenic RAG(0 / 0) hosts, we demonstrate that T cells bearing different TCR specificities share identical TCR-specific requirements for survival and lymphopenia driven proliferation (LDP). This interclonal competition applies to both naive and activated/memory T cells and is partially determined by the clone size of the established/resident T cells. However, clonal competition with activated/memory resident T cells impacts differently on the fate of newly produced bone-marrow-derived T cells or adoptively <b>transferred</b> <b>peripheral</b> T cells. Overall, our findings indicate that p-MHC define multiple diverse resource niches that can be shared by T cells from different compartments...|$|R
40|$|Intimal damage, contusion, laceration, dissection, pseudoaneursym and {{arteriovenous}} fistula {{may occur}} in arterial system after blunt trauma. Twenty years old male patient {{was admitted to}} the emergency service following room because of a traffic accident. Femoral artery dissection was detected in patient after blunt trauma. Saphenous vein graft interposition to the femoral artery is applied at the portion before the hunter&# 146;s channel. Microembolic spaces are detected in the basal ganglia and left hemisphere on magnetic resonance inspection of the patient developing unconsciousness at the tenth postoperative hour. Consciousness was opened in clinical follow up. The patient with palpable <b>peripheral</b> pulses was <b>transferred</b> to Neurology Clinic with partial neurological deficit. As a result, dissection of the femoral artery can be rarely seen due to blunt trauma. Although there was early signs of ischemia in our patient, it had not forgotten that the findings of ischemia were occurred in later periods. In this letter, we aimed to introduce a case of dissection on the femoral artery caused by blunt trauma and conducing lower extremity ischemia. [Cukurova Med J 2012; 37 (2. 000) : 116 - 120...|$|R
40|$|MUC 1 {{transgenic}} (MUC 1. Tg) mice have widely {{been used}} as model recipients of cancer immunotherapy with MUC 1. Although MUC 1. Tg mice have previously {{been shown to be}} immunologically tolerant to MUC 1, the involvement of regulatory T (Treg) cells in this phenotype remains unclear. Here, we showed that numbers of Treg cells in MUC 1 -expressing tumors were greater in MUC 1. Tg mice than in control C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice, and that the growth of tumor cells expressing MUC 1, but not that of control cells, in MUC 1. Tg mice was faster than in B 6 mice. The MUC 1. Tg mice appeared to develop MUC 1 -specific <b>peripheral</b> tolerance, as <b>transferred</b> MUC 1 -specific T cells were unable to function in MUC 1. Tg mice but were functional in control B 6 mice. The suppressive function of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) cells from MUC 1. Tg mice was more potent than that of cells from control B 6 mice when Treg cell activity against MUC 1 -specific T cells was compared in vitro. Therefore, the enhanced growth of MUC 1 -expressing tumor cells in MUC 1. Tg mice is likely due to the presence of MUC 1 -specific Treg cells...|$|R
40|$|Adoptive {{transfer}} of immune effector {{cells that are}} gene modified by retroviral transduction to express tumor-specific receptors constitutes an attractive approach to treat cancer. In patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, we performed a study with autologous T cells genetically retargeted with a chimeric antibody receptor (CAR) directed toward carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an antigen highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma. In the majority of patients, we observed distinct humoral and/or cellular anti-CAIX-CAR T-cell immune responses in combination with a limited <b>peripheral</b> persistence of <b>transferred</b> CAIX-CAR T cells {{in the majority of}} patients. Humoral immune responses were anti-idiotypic in nature and neutralized CAIX-CAR-mediated T-cell function. Cellular anti-CAIX-CAR immune responses were directed to the complementarity-determining and framework regions of the CAR variable domains. In addition, 2 patients developed immunity directed against presumed retroviral vector epitopes. Here, we document the novel feature that therapeutic cells, which were ex vivo engineered by means of transduction with a minimal gamma-retroviral vector, do express immunogenic vector-encoded epitopes, which might compromise persistence of these cells. These observations may constitute a critical concern for clinical ex vivo gamma-retroviral gene transduction in general and CAR-retargeted T-cell therapy in particular, and underscore the need to attenuate the immunogenicity of both transgene and vector...|$|R
