40|$|LectureLecture 6 : Typical {{floating}} production, {{storage and}} offloading (FPSO) compression applications are presented, including drivers and auxiliary equipment, and typical compressor operating conditions. Base packages consisting of centrifugal compressor(s), gear, motor or gas turbine driver, lube oil tank, and auxiliary equipment require extensive analyses to validate design requirements for service on FPSO vessels. Finite element analyses (FEA) are performed {{to insure that}} stress and displacement criteria are met. This paper discusses loading conditions that are evaluated including <b>package</b> <b>lifting,</b> transportation loads, short circuit torque, and upset loads. Operating load cases are also analyzed, which include dead weight, FPSO motion, rotor unbalance, torque, nozzle, and wind loads. Modal analyses are performed to ensure that predominant package modes do not lie in the run speed range. Rotor unbalance forced response analyses can be performed to ensure that amplitudes at key locations remain within allowable vibration criteria. Typical FEA models and analytical procedures are presented. The use of the analytical results to assist in selecting design modifications is discussed. The paper {{emphasizes the importance of}} gathering information early in the design cycle. This includes ship structural stiffness at the anti-vibration mount (AVM) locations, AVM stiffness, and load specifications including wind, wave, upset, and transport loading, and coupling capability. Finally, the paper presents a design change that allows for significant footprint reduction of the overall package...|$|R

50|$|Asymptote typesets {{labels and}} {{equations}} with LaTeX, producing high-quality PostScript, PDF, SVG, or 3D PRC output. It {{is inspired by}} Metapost, but has a C++-like syntax. It provides a language for typesetting mathematical figures, just as TeX/LaTeX provides a language for typesetting equations. It is mathematically oriented (e.g. rotation of vectors by complex multiplication), and uses the simplex method and deferred drawing to solve overall size constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and objects that should scale with figure size. Asymptote fully generalizes MetaPost path construction algorithms to three dimensions, and compiles commands into virtual machine code for speed without sacrificing portability. High-level graphics commands are implemented in the Asymptote language itself, allowing them to be easily tailored to specific applications. It {{also appears to be}} the first software <b>package</b> to <b>lift</b> TeX into three dimensions.This allows Asymptote {{to be used as a}} 3D vector file format.|$|R

The focus of the study lays {{on the concept of}} motivation within virtual projectmanagement {{and the role of the}} project manager to overcome the specificchallenges of this new working scenario. Additionally, parallels are drawn on themotivation features that virtual project management systems offer to projectmanagers as well as team members. This study shows the importance of bridging the difficulties of motivatingdispersed teams and how traditional techniques of motivation have a muchlesser impact on team members. The idea of progress and self accomplishmentare brought forth as the strongest motivators for dispersed teams.

The intervention was developed based on the center's results from a Performance Diagnostic Checklist (PDC), which focused on antecedents, equipment and processes, knowledge and skills, and consequences related to patient-transfers. A multiple baseline (MBL) across two lifts (pivot and trunk), with one lift (side) remaining in baseline {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of the treatment <b>package</b> on three <b>lifts</b> commonly used by three health-care workers. The results indicated a substantial increase in the overall safe performance of the three lifts. The mean increase for group safety performance following intervention was 34 % and 29 % over baseline measures for the two target transfers, and 28 % over baseline measures for the nontargeted transfer. The implications of these findings suggest that in settings where patient transfers are frequent and injuries are likely to occur (e. g., hospitals, day treatment centers), safe lifting and transferring behaviors can improve with an efficient and cost-effective intervention...|$|R
40|$|Workers {{exposed to}} {{hand-held}} vibrating machines may risk developing a {{hand-arm vibration syndrome}} (HAVS), a condition which can cause chronic impairment and disability. The aims of this thesis were 1) to obtain deeper insight and further knowledge of HAVS and the consequences for hand function, and aspects of quality of life (QoL); 2) to investigate the usefulness of clinical assessments in diagnosing HAVS; 3) to evaluate a treatment method for patients with severe cold intolerance. The thesis is based on five papers {{and a total of}} 131 vibration exposed workers. A number of questions on hand symptoms, standardised tests of hand function and questionnaires were included. Results: 1) The most common hand symptoms were cold intolerance, numbness and pain. Sensory functions were more disturbed than motor functions in clinical assessments. Working outdoors in cold weather, using vibrating machines, opening lids and <b>packages,</b> writing, <b>lifting</b> and carrying objects appeared more difficult than other activities. Workers with HAVS described lower QoL here expressed as less subjective well-being, more symptoms of ill-health and ADL difficulties than workers without symptoms. 2) Cold intolerance and pain showed a high agreement with the Stockholm Workshop Scales (SWS), the gold standard in diagnosing HAVS. Three out of ten objective tests of hand function, assessing perception of vibration, perception of touch/pressure, and dexterity showed a moderate agreement with SWS. Thus, corresponding defined objective tests of hand function (Tactilometry, Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, and Purdue pegboard test) combined with questions on cold intolerance and pain, together with the SWS can be helpful for diagnosing HAVS. 3) Behavioural treatment of cold intolerance was not effective in workers with HAVS although digital skin temperature increased after treatment. The results indicated that the subjective assessment of cold intolerance did not correlate with the objective assessment of digital skin temperature. The findings highlight the lack of knowledge of the nature and pathophysiology of cold intolerance. Conclusion: 1) HAVS can result in impaired hand function and lower QoL 2) Specific tests of hand function and questions of hand symptoms can be useful for detecting a vibration injury. 3) Since no treatment of HAVS has proved effective, prophylactic measures should be further highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore {{structural}} engineeringFor {{the installation}} of a topside onto jacket, lift method with crane barge has been a common concept. However the increasing weight and offshore exposure hours has led designers to consider the float-over method as an alternative. Float-over installation exceeds the maximum capacity of crane vessels and allows platform topsides be installed as a single integrated <b>package</b> without heavy <b>lift</b> crane vessel. This allows topsides to be completed onshore eliminating the substantial costs associated with offshore hook-up and commissioning, reducing the offshore exposure hours according to ref. [25]. This thesis investigate the float-over technology Versatruss which uses two floating barges equipped with lifting booms to install a topside. Today it a trend in the offshore business to pursue low CAPEX. Therefor a cheap Standard Viking barge (day rates 40 - 50 000 NOK/per day), which is relative cheap compared SAIPEM S 7000 and THIALF where the day rates is (6 000 000 NOK/per day). The barges are maneuvered around {{the legs of the}} jacket and the topside is lowered down to mate the topside onto the jacket. During the mating operation the topside and jacket experience impacts through the contact points. The effect of impact is converted into a limiting acceleration and velocity, and the accelerations and velocities are evaluated with non-linear time domain analysis in SIMA. The purpose of this report is to find the limiting wave height for the Versatruss system based on the limiting acceleration and velocity. The structural limitations has not been investigated. In order to do time domain analysis a conceptual model of the Standard Viking barge is made in GeniE and a hydrodynamic analysis is done to get the correct input (added mass, stiffness etc.) in SIMA. In addition hand calculations are done to verify the results from the hydrodynamic analysis. In SIMA the system is coupled in a Versatruss configuration and non-linear time domain analysis of the system is done with different wave heights, periods and directions. In SIMA the model is coupled with fenders and wires to satisfy the assumption that the barges are free to move relative to each other. Since the Versatruss lifting system is allocated along the centreline of the barge individual roll motion of the barges does not influence the motion of the topside. To assure that the results are correct a small time integration interval of 2, 5 e- 3 s is chosen. The most probable maximum (MPM) is taken from several analysis and the value with 10 % probability of exceedance (P 90) is taken as the maximum value.
