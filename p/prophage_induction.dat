An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
25|$|At high {{concentrations}} of cI, the dimers will also bind to operators OL1 and OL2 (which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators). When cI dimers are bound to OL1, OL2, OR1, and OR2 a loop is induced in the DNA, allowing these dimers to bind together to form an octamer. This is a phenomenon called long-range cooperativity. Upon formation of the octamer, cI dimers may cooperatively bind to OL3 and OR3, repressing transcription of cI. This autonegative regulation ensures a stable minimum concentration of the repressor molecule and, should SOS signals arise, allows for more efficient <b>prophage</b> <b>induction.</b>|$|E

While many lytic phages infective for these organisms have been isolated, and assessed for their suitability for use as biological control agents of activated sludge foaming, no studies have investigated how temperate phages might be induced for this purpose. Bioinformatic analysis using the PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) on Mycolata whole genome sequence data in GenBank for members of the genera Gordonia, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Tsukamurella revealed 83 % contained putative prophage DNA sequences. Subsequent <b>prophage</b> <b>inductions</b> using mitomycin C were conducted on 17 Mycolata strains. This led to the isolation and genome characterization of three novel Caudovirales temperate phages, namely GAL 1, GMA 1, and TPA 4, induced from Gordonia alkanivorans, Gordonia malaquae, and Tsukamurella paurometabola, respectively.

40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the process of}} <b>prophage</b> lambda <b>induction</b> with that of prophage Mu. According to the Campbell model, rescue of lambda DNA from the host DNA involves reversal of lambda integration such that the prophage DNA is excised from the host chromosome. We have monitored this event by locating the prophage DNA with a technique in which DNA of the lysogenic cells is cleaved with a restriction endonuclease and fractionated in agarose gels. The DNA fragments are denatured in gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose paper, and hybridized with 32 P-labeled mature phage DNA. The fragments containing prophage DNA become visible after autoradiography. Upon <b>prophage</b> lambda <b>induction,</b> the phage-host junction fragments disappear and the fragment containing the lambda att site appears. No such excision is seen in prophage Mu. The Mu-host junction fragments remain intact well into the lytic cycle, when Mu DNA has undergone many rounds of replication and apparently many copies of Mu DNA have been integrated into the host DNA. Therefore, we postulate that Mu DNA replicates in situ and the replication generates a form of Mu DNA active in the integrative recombination between Mu DNA and host DNA. This type of mechanism may be common to many transposable elements...|$|R

The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the ethanolic extract of C. americana stem bark using the <b>prophage</b> &# 955; <b>induction</b> test (SOS inductest). To evaluate the cytotoxicity of this plant, after treatment with different concentrations of the extract, Escherichia coli WP 2 s(&# 955;) cultures were diluted in M 9 buffer, inoculated into LB plates, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. To assess genotoxicity, the lysogenic strain E. coli WP 2 s(&# 955;) was treated with different concentrations of the extract. Then, the lysogenic strain was added to the indicator strain (RJF 013), LB(1 / 2) (malt/amp), seeded into plates with the matches, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After this period, the total number of colonies and the number of plaques were counted to evaluate C. americana cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, respectively. Our results showed that although the extract of "lixeira" did not modify the survival of bacteria (p > 0. 05), it caused a significant increase in <b>prophage</b> &# 955; <b>induction,</b> especially at the higher concentrations (p< 0. 05).

50|$|Upon {{detection}} of host cell damage, such as UV light or certain chemicals, the prophage is excised from the bacterial chromosome {{in a process}} called <b>prophage</b> <b>induction.</b> After induction, viral replication begins via the Lytic Cycle.

The period from infection to lysis is termed the latent period. A virus following a lytic cycle is called a virulent virus. Prophages are important agents of horizontal gene transfer, and are considered part of the mobilome.

40|$|The {{properties}} {{of a number}} of strains of K 12 (λ) which are defective in their ability to form lambda DNA after induction have been examined by genetic, physiological, and biochemical tests. The strains fall into four classes, and include mutants in cistrons N, O, and P, previously identified by Campbell (1961), and a fourth new class, called x, in a region between CI and CII. Mutants in each of the classes can be distinguished genetically, by their relative ability to form the λ-exonuclease, and by their tendency to show curing of their <b>prophage</b> after <b>induction.</b> Mutants in the P and O cistrons form normal levels of λ-exonuclease, whereas mutants in the N cistron form very low levels, and mutants in the x region, relatively high levels of this enzyme. Curing is very efficient for mutants in the x region, less efficient for mutants in the O and P cistrons, and is seldom observed with mutants in the N cistron. These patterns of curing are reflected in the curves for UV survival of the strains carrying defective mutations in the various cistrons. The significance of these findings in respect to the early events in phage development are discussed. © 1966. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) {{is able to}} form biofilms in vivo and {{previous}} studies propose that pneumococcal biofilms play a relevant role both in colonization and infection. Additionally, pneumococci recovered from human infections are characterized by a high prevalence of lysogenic bacteriophages (phages) residing quiescently in their host chromosome. We investigated a possible link between lysogeny and biofilm formation. Considering that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is {{a key factor in}} the biofilm matrix, we reasoned that prophage spontaneous activation with the consequent bacterial host lysis could provide a source of eDNA, enhancing pneumococcal biofilm development. Monitoring biofilm growth of lysogenic and non-lysogenic pneumococcal strains indicated that phage-infected bacteria are more proficient at forming biofilms, that is their biofilms are characterized by a higher biomass and cell viability. The presence of phage particles throughout the lysogenic strains biofilm development implicated <b>prophage</b> spontaneous <b>induction</b> in this effect. Analysis of lysogens deficient for phage lysin and the bacterial major autolysin revealed that the absence of either lytic activity impaired biofilm development and the addition of DNA restored the ability of mutant strains to form robust biofilms.

50|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect and {{replicate}} within a bacterium. Temperate phages (such as lambda phage) can reproduce using both the lytic and the lysogenic cycle. Via the lysogenic cycle, the bacteriophage's genome is not expressed and is instead {{integrated into the}} bacteria's genome to form the prophage. Since the bacteriophage's genetic information is incorporated into the bacteria's genetic information as a prophage, the bacteriophage replicates passively as the bacterium divides to form daughter bacteria cells. In this scenario, the daughter bacteria cells contain prophage and are known as lysogens. Lysogens can remain in the lysogenic cycle for many generations but can switch to the lytic cycle at any time via {{a process known as}} <b>induction.</b> During <b>induction,</b> <b>prophage</b> DNA is excised from the bacterial genome and is transcribed and translated to make coat proteins for the virus and regulate lytic growth.|$|R

The defective lysates transduce pro C at high frequency relative to other bacterial markers. The representation of phage genes is strongly polar with markers distal to pro C being rarely present.

40|$|Objectives: Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are {{pathogenic}} strains, whose virulence {{depends on}} induction of Shiga toxin–converting prophages and their subsequent lytic development. We explored which factors or conditions could inhibit {{development of these}} phages, potentially decreasing virulence of STEC. Materials and Methods: Lytic development of Shiga toxin–converting bacteriophages was monitored after mitomycin C-provoked <b>prophage</b> <b>induction</b> under various conditions. Phage DNA replication efficiency was assessed by measurement of DNA amount in cells using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: We demonstrated {{that the use of}} citrate delayed Shiga toxin–converting phage development after <b>prophage</b> <b>induction.</b> This effect was independent on efficiency of <b>prophage</b> <b>induction</b> and phage DNA replication. However, an excess of glucose reversed the effect of citrate. Amino acid starvation prevented the phage development in bacteria both able and unable to induce the stringent response. Conclusions: Lytic development of Shiga toxin–converting bacteriophages can be inhibited by either the presence of citrate or amino acid starvation. We suggest that the inhibition caused by the latter condition may be due to a block in <b>prophage</b> <b>induction</b> or phage DNA replication or both. Applications: Our findings may facilitate development of procedures for treatment of STEC-infected patients...|$|E

40|$|The genes {{encoding}} Shiga toxin (Stx), {{the major}} virulence factor of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, are {{carried in the}} genomes of bacteriophages that belong to the lambdoid family of phages. Previous studies demonstrated that <b>induction</b> of <b>prophages</b> encoding stx significantly enhances the production and/or release of Stx from the bacterium. Therefore, factors that regulate the switch between lysogeny and lytic growth, e. g., repressor, operator sites, and associated phage promoters, play important roles in regulating the production and/or release of Stx. We report the results of genetic and biochemical studies characterizing these elements of the Stx-encoding bacteriophage 933 W. Like �, 933 W has three operator repeats in the right operator region (O R), but unlike � and all other studied lambdoid phages, which have three operator repeats in the left operator region (O L), 933 W only has two operator repeats in O L. As was observed with �, the 933 W O R and O L regions regulate transcription from the early P R and P L promoters, respectively. A lysogen carrying a 933 W derivative encoding a noncleavable repressor fails to produce Stx, unlike a lysogen carrying a 933 W derivative encoding a cleavable repressor.

Previously reported enhancements of B 6 infectivity by ultraviolet irradiation, in samples inoculated after 1. 75 hr of dark incubation at 27 C, or immediately following irradiation, were found to occur most frequently after losses in cell viability of 60 % and of 90 % or more, respectively. Changes in colony-forming ability and tumor-initiating ability with increasing dose showed no obvious correlation until the maximal infectivity promotion of samples inoculated immediately after irradiation was reached. Thereafter, both bacterial responses typically decreased in parallel. With low dose rates, infectivity promotions were obtained with less than 10 % loss in cell viability. Data for tumor appearance and tumor growth resulting from inoculations with irradiated cultures showed no significant differences from controls, nor did the age of the bacterial culture or age of the host plant influence the response. The infectivity promotion appears to result from an increase in the proportion of viable cells that will subsequently initiate tumors.

Density label experiments with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine showed that postinduction DNA synthesis took place preferentially at the origin region of the bacterial chromosome. Measurement of the molecular weight of DNA replicated after induction clearly showed that postinduction DNA replication is chromosomal. No evidence for prophage detachment and autonomous phage DNA replication was found.

This approach allowed us to regulate the function of the lytic repressor at will and to prevent it from repressing cI, because lac repressor could not repress PRM in our constructs. Repression of cI by the lytic repressor was not required for <b>prophage</b> <b>induction</b> to occur. However, our evidence suggests that this binding can make induction more efficient, particularly at intermediate levels of DNA damage that otherwise cause induction of {{only a fraction of the}} population. These results indicate that this strategy of module exchange will have broad applications for analysis of gene regulatory circuits...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, Salmonella {{bloodstream}} infections {{have become a}} significant health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and {{are responsible for the}} deaths of an estimated 390, 000 people each year. The disease is predominantly caused by a recently described sequence type of Salmonella Typhimurium: ST 313, which has a distinctive set of prophage sequences. We have thoroughly characterized the ST 313 -associated prophages both genetically and experimentally. ST 313 representative strain D 23580 contains five full-length prophages: BTP 1, Gifsy- 2 (D 23580), ST 64 B(D 23580), Gifsy- 1 (D 23580), and BTP 5. We show that common S. Typhimurium prophages Gifsy- 2, Gifsy- 1, and ST 64 B are inactivated in ST 313 by mutations. Prophage BTP 1 was found to be a functional novel phage, and the first isolate of the proposed new species "Salmonella virus BTP 1 ", belonging to the P 22 virus genus. Surprisingly, ∼ 10 (9) BTP 1 virus particles per ml were detected in the supernatant of non-induced, stationary-phase cultures of strain D 23580, representing the highest spontaneously induced phage titer so far reported for a bacterial <b>prophage.</b> High spontaneous <b>induction</b> is shown to be an intrinsic property of prophage BTP 1, and indicates the phage-mediated lysis of around 0. 2 % of the lysogenic population. The fact that BTP 1 is highly conserved in ST 313 poses interesting questions about the potential fitness costs and benefits of novel prophages in epidemic S. Typhimurium ST 313...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase activity, {{which can}} cause DNA damage and result in bacterial cell death. In response to DNA damage, bacteria induce an SOS response to stimulate DNA repair. However, the SOS response may also induce prophage with production of infectious virions. Salmonella strains typically contain multiple prophages, and certain strains including phage types DT 120 and DT 104 contain <b>prophage</b> that upon <b>induction</b> are capable of generalised transduction. In this study, strains of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 120 and DT 104 were exposed to fluoroquinolones important for use in human and veterinary disease therapy to determine whether prophage(s) are induced that could facilitate phage-mediated gene transfer. Cultures of MDR S. Typhimurium DT 120 and DT 104 containing a kanamycin resistance plasmid were lysed after exposure to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and danofloxacin). Bacterial cell lysates were able to transfer the plasmid to a recipient kanamycin-susceptible Salmonella strain by generalised transduction. In addition, exposure of DT 120 to ciprofloxacin induced the recA gene of the bacterial SOS response and genes encoded in a P 22 -like generalised transducing prophage. This research indicates that fluoroquinolone exposure of MDR Salmonella can facilitate horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that fluoroquinolone usage in human and veterinary medicine may have unintended consequences, including the induction of phage-mediated gene transfer from MDR Salmonella. Stimulation of gene transfer following bacterial exposure to fluoroquinolones should be considered an adverse effect, and clinical decisions regarding antibiotic selection for infectious disease therapy should include this potential risk...|$|R
40|$|The group III Bacillus subtilis {{temperature}} phages include SP#beta# #phi# 3 T, #rho# 11, Z, SPR, IG 1, IG 3, IG 4, H 2 and E. IG 1, IG 3 and IG 4 {{are closely}} related to SP#beta# namely they are homoimune, they share the same primary and secondary attachment (Att) sites and mediate specialized transduction. In contrast, SPR, which also belongs to the same subgroup of immunity, integrates at a distant locus on the genome. SPR carries out specialized transduction of genetic markers flanquing its att site. The attP of SPR and IG phages were located in their genomes. the IG and SPR prophages exhibit circular permutation of the genomes suggesting that they circularize and integrate in the host chromosome by a Campbell - like mechanism. SP#beta# differs from IG 3 in having low induction rates whereas IG 3 is highly inducible. <b>Prophage</b> transfer and <b>induction</b> by PBS 1 reveled that absence of zygotic induction is not necessarily connected either with the low inducibility or with the ability to multiply, upon MMC treatment, followed by super infection with a clear mutant. SP#beta# also differs from the group III phages by the lack of a thymidylate synthetase gene (Thy P) conferring prototrophy to thymine. Cloning of IG 3 genome allowed to isolate, characterize and compare the thyP genes of IG 3 and #phi# 3 T. The thyPIG 3 gene as the attPIG 3 are both located in the central region of the genomeAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.
