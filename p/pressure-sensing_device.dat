40|$|An {{article by}} Ferber and coauthors in Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology {{reported}} {{on the ability of}} a novel in-shoe plantar sensory replacement unit (PSRU) to provide alert-based feedback derived from analyzing plantar pressure (PP) threshold measurements in real time. The study aimed at comparing the PSRU device to a gold standard <b>pressure-sensing</b> <b>device</b> (GS-PSD) to determine the correlation between concurrent measures of PP during walking. Data were collected simultaneously from 10 participants who walked overground with both devices. The variable of interest was the number of recorded data points greater than 32 mmHg for each of the PSRU sensors and corresponding average recordings from the GS-PSD. Authors concluded that the PSRU provides analogous data to the GS-PSD. However, several aspects of the study should be considered when interpreting their clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|Fiber-based, {{flexible}} pressure-sensing {{systems have}} attracted attention recently {{due to their}} promising application as electronic skins. Here, {{a new kind of}} flexible <b>pressure-sensing</b> <b>device</b> based on a polydimethylsiloxane membrane instrumented with double-twisted smart threads (DTSTs) is reported. DTSTs are made of two conductive threads obtained by coating cotton threads with carbon nanotubes. One thread is coated with a homogeneous thickness of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to detect the intensity of an applied load and the other is coated with a graded thickness of SWCNTs to identify the position of the load along the thread. The mechanism and capacity of DTSTs to accurately sense an applied load are systematically analyzed. Results demonstrate that the fabricated 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D sensing devices can be used to predict both the intensity and the position of an applied load. The sensors feature high sensitivity (between ≈ 0. 1 % and 1. 56 % kPa) and tunable resolution, good cycling resilience (> 104 cycles), and a short response time (minimum 2. 5 Hz). The presented strategy is a viable alternative for the design of simple, low-cost pressure sensors...|$|E
40|$|The micromechanical {{equivalent}} of a differential pressure flow-sensor, well known in macro mechanics, is discussed. Two separate pressure sensors are used for the device, enabling to measure both, pressure as well as volume flow-rate. An integrated sensor with capacitive read-out {{as well as a}} hybrid, piezo-resistive variant is made. The fabrication processes are described, using silicon and glass processing techniques. Based on the sensor layout, equations are derived to describe the sensor behavior both statically as well as dynamically. With the derived equations, the working range of the sensor and the thermal and time stability is estimated. The computed results of the stationary behavior are verified with the measured data. A good similarity in linearity of the pressure/flow relation is found. The computed hydraulic resistance, however, differs from the measured value for water with 21 %. This difference {{can be explained by the}} high sensitivity of the resistance to the resistor channel cross-section parameter in combination with the difference between the rounded etched shape and the rectangular approximation. From fluid dynamics simulations, a working range bandwidth of about 1 kHz is expected. Thermal influences on the sensor signal due to viscosity changes are in the order of 2 % flow signal variation per Kelvin. From these results, it can be concluded that the sensor can be used as a low cost, low power consuming flow and <b>pressure-sensing</b> <b>device,</b> for clean fluids without particles and without the tendency to coat the channel walls. If a high accuracy is wanted, an accurate temperature sensing or controlling system is needed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new low-cost pressure-sensitive user input device called “SqueezeOrb”. The device is built from an assembly force-sensing resistors embedded in an elastic hand exerciser. A USB-enabled microcontroller continuously samples the sensors, applies a double-exponential noise-reduction filter and streams the resulting “handgrip strength ” measurement to an attached host computer at a frequency {{of up to}} 1000 Hz. When combined with optical motion-tracking, the SqueezeOrb becomes a <b>pressure-sensing</b> input <b>device</b> for three-dimensional interaction...|$|R
40|$|Ferroelectric {{material}} supports both pyro- and piezoelectric {{effects that}} can be used for sensing pressures on large, bended surfaces. We present PyzoFlex, a <b>pressure-sensing</b> input <b>device</b> that is based on a ferroelectric material. It is constructed with a sandwich structure of four layers {{that can be}} printed easily on any material. We use this material in combination with a high-resolution Anoto-sensing foil to support both hand and pen input tracking. The foil is bendable, energy-efficient, and it can be produced in a printing process. Even a hovering mode is feasible due to its pyroelectric effect. ...|$|R
