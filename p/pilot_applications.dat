40|$|This {{graduate}} thesis {{deals with}} the analysis of unstructured data from public social media. In particular, it {{deals with the}} analysis of data from social media of Vodafone Czech Republic a. s. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part provides theoretical background for the second part. Therefore, the first part describes social media, structured and unstructured data and tools which are used for analysing of unstructured data. In the second part, tool Watson is used for the analysis of publicly available data. Then, methodology is designed to control the analysis process and subsequently this methodology used {{in the formation of the}} <b>pilot</b> <b>application</b> that has to verify the functionality of unstructured data by tool Watson. The results of the analysis are in the conclusion. The main benefits of this thesis are the development of a <b>pilot</b> <b>application</b> of Watson and the verification of its functionality. The <b>pilot</b> <b>application</b> cannot be equated with a complete analysis that can be done by Watson. But this <b>pilot</b> <b>application</b> may work as a demonstration of Watson's functionalities...|$|R

40|$|Product line {{engineering}} (PLE) aims at building products for a well-defined problem space in less time, with lower costs and higher quality by reusing core assets in a structured way. In the CESAR project, a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey of PLE techniques, methods, and processes among the partners {{showed that a}} majority of the partners used PLE techniques, some already quite extensively with several running product lines. The ways of exploiting PLE, however, were rather diverse. Among several <b>pilot</b> <b>applications,</b> we used a demonstrator by THALES Avionics to study the application of CESAR PLE solutions. In this demonstrator, a couple of CESAR tools were, e. g., DODT, CVL Tool, PLUM. However, the survey and the practical experience from the <b>pilot</b> <b>applications</b> showed that a more unified approach to PLE and modeling is required, which led us to the development of the CESAR Variability Ontology, which aims at introducing PLE concepts, harmonizing their use, and defining their interrelationships.

40|$|SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) is an {{architectural}} style for creating software systems. It encapsulates the functional behaviour behind services which are loosely coupled to each other. SOA brings flexibility, agility and dynamicity to software systems because it enables the collaboration of systems developed with different technologies. Moreover, SOA reduces {{the cost of}} the development since already existing services can be reused in new systems. Arrowhead Project aims to develop a technical framework, which enables the collaborative automation by networked embedded devices. The framework aims to solve the energy and competitiveness challenges with increased efficiency, which is gained by means of collaborative automation. Collaborative automation is enabled with SOA. The project is targeting to five different areas including Production, Smart Buildings and Infrastructures, Electro-Mobility, Energy Production and End-User Services, and finally Virtual Market of Energy. During the project, project partners are testing Arrowhead Framework by developing <b>pilot</b> <b>applications</b> for the project domains to demonstrate the use of the framework at various use-cases. This thesis presents <b>pilot</b> <b>applications</b> developed at FAST-lab at Tampere University of Technology during Pilot Generation 2. The first application is a managing and monitoring system for street lights and the second one for engine block heaters. They demonstrate how Arrowhead Framework could be used to develop Smart City applications. Since Arrowhead Framework is based on SOA, {{it should be possible to}} reuse the existing services in new applications. Therefore, a third pilot application was developed by integrating the components from the first two <b>pilot</b> <b>applications.</b> The resulting application controls the dimming of street lights based on the luminance and the heating time of engine block heaters based on the temperature. The application shows that Arrowhead Framework gives suitable tools to develop systems where the requested functionality by reusing the existing services in collaborative manner...|$|E
