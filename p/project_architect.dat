The building includes the Arena, where the daily flag raising ceremonies, parades and special functions are held, the Heritage Gallery, the school's tallest structure, and The Alumni Room, a gathering place for students.|$|E
25|$|Geresina Campani of Florence {{may have}} been the only Bahá'í to remain alive and active through World War II. Starting in 1946 Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American Bahá'í {{community}} to send pioneers to Europe; the pioneers set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by Edna True. Possibly the first Bahá'ís after WWII to enter Italy were Angeline and Ugo Giachery. They reached Naples on 20 February 1947 and sent a telegram to Shoghi Effendi from Rome. By the end of March the first Italian convert was enrolled in Genoa. He was Augnsto Salvetti who heard of the religion from a Persian believer while he was a prisoner of war in India and investigated the religion on return to Italy. Brother Rodolfo Salvetti soon followed joining the religion - and pioneers Mr. and Mrs. Phillip Marengella arrived in Italy by mid-1947. There was also one Bahá'í in Milan - perhaps a Turkish refugee. By early 1948 two more Italians had joined the religion - Verena Venturini and Luigi Peveri. By Ridván 1948 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Rome was elected. In 1948, Marion Little pioneered to Florence from America. Well known Bahá'í Dorothy Beecher Baker who was later named as a Hand of the Cause undertook a trip from 1948 across Europe including visiting Italy. Publications in Italian began with an introductory pamphlet which was sent to prominent citizens and to four hundred public libraries. This was followed by a new edition of John Esslemont's Bahá`u'lláh and the New Era, a special copy of which, bound in tooled green leather, was sent to the archives of the Bahá'í Faith in Palestine. Until 1964 when she returned to America, she served as chairman of the Italian Publishing Committee, a field which gave scope to her artistic and administrative skills. Under her direction and guidance many of the major Writings of the Faith were translated into Italian and published. She died in 1980 and her body buried in Cap d'Ail Cemetery, near Monaco. William Sutherland Maxwell came to Italy to begin reviewing materials for the expansion of the Shrine of the Bab in 1948 which continued through 1951 with shipments to Palestine for the <b>project.</b> <b>Architect</b> Andrea Rocca, Professor Emeritus of the Beaux Arts Academy of Carrara, assisted in work with the Shrine as well as the later International Archives building. The first all-Bahá'í Italian family came to be in April 1949 followed by the conversion of 81-year-old Giuseppe Berardi by July.|$|E

500|$|The {{treatment}} of the upper floors provides a striking contrast. 134,000 green, orange, lime and yellow glazed terracotta tiles cover the façades in 13 irregularly oriented vertical panels on the external perimeter. The façades facing the inner courtyard are lined with another eight panels covered with grey tiles, a design which <b>project</b> <b>architect</b> Maurits van der Staay says was intended to [...] "ensure that the upper storeys did not detract from the transparency of the ground floor and to maximise the amount of light reflected back into the offices." [...] The façades are hung on an internal chassis carrier system (a similar system is in use in another Piano development on Berlin's Potsdamer Platz). Pierced by rows of identical windows repeated across the entire development, the façades {{are expected to be}} effectively self-cleaning and immune to fading. The colours of the façades are evoked in the design of many of the development's interior fittings, such as lift-door reveals, handrails and lift displays. The tiles were produced in Germany by NBK of Emmerich am Rhein and mounted on prefabricated façade units in Wrocław, Poland, by Schneider Fassadenbau.|$|E
500|$|The centrepiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed [...] "The Bird's Nest" [...] {{because of}} its nest-like {{skeletal}} structure. [...] The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies {{as well as the}} athletics competition. Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing. In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs. The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs. The bird's nest model submitted by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 2003. Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, <b>project</b> <b>architect</b> Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.|$|E

During their first meeting in 2003, at Basel, the group {{decided to do something}} unlike Herzog and de Meuron had traditionally designed. [...] "China wanted to have something new for this very important stadium," [...] Li stated. In an effort to design a stadium that was [...] "porous" [...] while also being [...] "a collective building, a public vessel", the team studied Chinese ceramics. This line of thought brought the team to the [...] "nest scheme". The stadium consists of two independent structures, standing 50 feet apart: a red concrete seating bowl and the outer steel frame around it.|$|E
2500|$|Kahn's first {{design for}} the {{galleries}} called for angular vaults of folded concrete plates with light slots at the top. Brown liked the light slots but rejected this particular design because it had the ceilings 30 feet (9 m) high, too high for the museum he envisioned. [...] Further research by Marshall Meyers, Kahn's <b>project</b> <b>architect</b> for the Kimbell museum, revealed that using a cycloid curve for the gallery vaults would reduce the ceiling height and provide other benefits as well. [...] The relatively flat cycloid curve would produce elegant galleries that were wide in proportion to their height, allowing the ceiling to be lowered to 20 feet (6 m). [...] More importantly, that curve {{could also be used}} to produce a beautiful distribution of natural light from a slot {{in the top of the}} gallery across the entire gallery ceiling.|$|E

2500|$|Shimoda {{returned}} to Japan, [...] and submitted two preliminary design drawings. Shimoda avoided strictly imitating Western architectural styles seen in large scale hotel projects of the period, by amalgamating the East Asian hip-and-gable roof (入母屋, Irimoya) style and floor plan of Phoenix Hall Byōdō-in, into an earthquake resistant building. In March 1916, Following Shimoda's submission, the <b>project</b> <b>architect</b> {{was changed to}} Frank Lloyd Wright, who signed memorandum with the Imperial Household. When Wright's design plans became known to Shimoda, he made claims that his work had been plagiarised. The Imperial Hotels executives conceded to the considerable demands for compensation that Shimoda had made, during a six year copyright dispute over the architectural designs for the hotel. A review of Shimoda's work conducted by the Akita Prefectural Museum found that Wright had retained most of Shimoda's design, but replaced the Japanese roof with a Prairie School styled roof.|$|E

White argued the construction cost was a reasonable $110 per square foot. Architect John Carl Warnecke defended the building's cost, noting that it almost doubled in size (from [...] to [...] ), and that building costs in the District of Columbia leapt 76 percent during its erection. Warnecke dismissed allegations about Senate-ordered changes, saying these increased costs just 2 percent, and said that construction alone was just $107 million ($ in [...] dollars) (with another $28 million ($ in [...] dollars) coming from administrative costs, fees, and furnishings). He argued that excellent construction management held inflation in construction costs to just 67 percent, and that the building was erected at a cost of $97 per square foot, [...] "well below the costs of any other major public building built in the District during that period." [...] However, the American Institute of Architects said commercial construction costs in Washington, D.C., ranged from $54 to $65 per square foot, and The Christian Science Monitor reported the cost of the building at $137.70 per square foot.|$|E
