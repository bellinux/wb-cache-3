25|$|Loeb {{began his}} 2012 season by beating Mini's Dani Sordo {{to a record}} sixth win in the Monte Carlo Rally. He also secured the maximum points by {{recording}} the fastest time for the <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> In Sweden, after hitting a snowbank on stage seven, Loeb was {{forced out of the}} fight for the number one spot. He finished sixth and gained three extra points by again winning the <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> Loeb took his second victory of the season at the Rally Mexico, ahead of his new teammate Mikko Hirvonen.|$|E
25|$|The first {{amplifier}} stage is a preamplifier. It amplifies the audio signal {{to a level}} that can drive the <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> The preamplifier also changes {{the tone of the}} signal; high preamp settings add overdrive. The power amplifier produces a high current signal to drive a loudspeaker and produce sound.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 season {{brought a}} new {{generation}} of World Rally Cars. Now at the wheel of a Citroën DS3 WRC, Loeb started his year by finishing sixth at the Rally Sweden. He went on to win in Mexico for the fifth time in row, after teammate Sébastien Ogier crashed out from a narrow lead. In Portugal, Loeb finished second to Ogier and took his first <b>Power</b> <b>Stage</b> win, collecting three more points from the final stage. At the Jordan Rally, held during the Arab Spring, the entire first day was cancelled. Loeb placed third behind the closest-ever finish {{in the history of the}} World Rally Championship. He then beat Ford's Mikko Hirvonen to the win at the Rally d'Italia Sardegna.|$|E

2500|$|At this time, the KT66 valve was {{becoming}} more expensive, as the M-OV Company faced greater competition from Mullard. Hence, another valve change was made, with Marshall starting to use European-made Mullard EL34 <b>power</b> <b>stage</b> valves. These have a different overdrive character than the KT66s, which gave Marshalls a more aggressive voice still. In 1966 Jimi Hendrix was in Jim's shop, trying the amplifiers and guitars. Jim Marshall expected Hendrix to be [...] "another American wanting something for nothing" [...] but to his surprise, Hendrix offered to buy the amplifiers at retail price if Jim would provide him with support for them around the world. Jim Marshall agreed, and several of Hendrix's road crew were trained in the repair and maintenance of the Marshall amps through the years.|$|E

50|$|Circlotrons, unlike minimalistic {{single-ended}} amplifiers, need {{to employ}} quite complex balanced input and driver stages delivering at least 100V peak-to-peak voltage {{and able to}} drive relatively high capacitance loads (due {{to the number of}} paralleled power triodes and associated long wiring). The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two cathode followers inserted between the driver stage and the <b>power</b> <b>stage.</b> Both need a bipolar power supply, independent of the <b>power</b> <b>stage</b> power supplies, with power established before the <b>power</b> <b>stage</b> supply starts.|$|E

40|$|Multi-level <b>power</b> <b>stages</b> {{and control}} {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to increase power converter operating voltage levels above the voltage ratings of available power semiconductor switches, and also improve output waveform resolution. The multilevel power conversion idea, however, may also be adopted more generally in high-power amplifiers. In amplifiers based on the single-phase inverter topology, or H-bridge, this is most easily accomplished by the direct series, or parallel, connection of multiple H-bridge power-stages. Operating these with interleaved PWM control gives higher output power and produces an improved output voltage spectrum and significantly lower output current-ripple. Consideration is given here to the effect on output waveforms when H-bridge <b>power</b> <b>stages</b> are series and parallel connected, and controlled by optimally interleaved PWM. Parallel as well as series amplifier connection is shown to produce multilevel output waveform...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a fully {{integrated}} 900 -MHz CMOS differential power amplifier (PA) with new power combiner is designed and fabricated in a 0. 18 - um technology.

A parallel combination of the Class AB and the Class C amplifier or multiple gated common source transistors in <b>power</b> <b>stages</b> was used to improve both the linear operating range and the power efficiency simultaneously. The PA delivers an output power of 29 dBm and a power-added efficiency of 24 % with a power gain of 20 dB, including the losses of the bond-wires.

40|$|Multiport converters, a {{promising}} concept for hybrid power sources, have attracted increasing research interest recently. The {{use of a}} single <b>power</b> processing <b>stage</b> to interface multiple power inputs integrates power conversion for a hybrid power source. This structure removes redundant <b>power</b> <b>stages</b> that would exist in the conventional approach that uses multiple converters. The multiport structure is promising from the viewpoints of centralized control and compact packaging. The proposed basic bidirectional switching cells show several possibilities to construct a multiport converter. Several three-port topologies are discussed. Furthermore, based on the interleaving technology, topologies for higher power applications are also provided...|$|R
