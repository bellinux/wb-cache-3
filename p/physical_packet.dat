However, the main disadvantage of this technique is the sensitivity to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by time and frequency synchronization errors [2, 3]. Therefore, accurate time and frequency synchronization is absolutely required at the receiver. A synchronization process can be performed using either some redundant information (i.e., non-data-aided (NDA) techniques) or training sequences (i.e., data-aided (DA) techniques) included in the transmitted <b>physical</b> <b>packet.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{network hub}} is an unsophisticated device in {{comparison}} with a switch. As a multiport repeater it works by repeating bits (symbols) received from one of its ports to all other ports. It is aware of <b>physical</b> layer <b>packets,</b> that is it can detect their start (preamble), an idle line (interpacket gap) and sense a collision which it also propagates by sending a jam signal. A hub cannot further examine or manage any of the traffic that comes through it: any packet entering any port is rebroadcast on all other ports. A hub/repeater has no memory to store any data in - a packet must be transmitted while it is received or is lost when a collision occurs (the sender should detect this and retry the transmission). Due to this, hubs can only run in half duplex mode. Consequently, due to a larger collision domain, packet collisions are more frequent in networks connected using hubs than in networks connected using more sophisticated devices.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, the {{application}} of a type-II hybrid ARQ protocol in a slotted direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS-SSMA) packet radio system is investigated. Both the static performance and the dynamic performance of such a system are analyzed. In the <b>physical</b> layer, <b>packet</b> error and packet success probabilities are computed using the improved Gaussian approximation technique, which accounts for the bit-to-bit error dependence within a packet. In the data-link layer, two-dimensional Markov chains are employed to model the system dynamic. Based on this model, the performance of the type-II hybrid ARQ protocol is upper and lower bounded by considering, respectively, a superior scheme and an inferior scheme. Steady state throughput and delay performances of the two bounding schemes are obtained. Moreover, it is shown that for each fixed input load, there is an optimal retransmission probability under the finite user population assumption. Bounds on this optimal retransmission probability are also given.
