40|$|Abstract — An optimal call/connection {{admission}} control (CAC) policy is proposed for a packet-switched code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA) beamforming system, which employs a truncated automatic retransmission request (ARQ) scheme to mitigate the packet transmission error. Compared with the previous research in which call level QoS is ignored, the proposed CAC policy is capable of guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in physical, call and <b>packet</b> <b>levels,</b> while simultaneously maximizing the system throughput. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed CAC policy offers a more flexible tradeoff among physical-layer, packet-level and call level performances, and as a result, the multiple QoS constraints can be handled.

40|$|During {{a denial}} of service attack, it is {{difficult}} for a firewall to differentiate legitimate packets from rogue packets, particularly in large networks carrying substantial levels of traffic. Large networks commonly use network intrusion detection systems to identify such attacks, however new viruses and worms can escape detection until their signatures are known and classified as an attack. Commonly used IDS are rule based and static, and produce a high number of false positive alerts. The aim of this research was to determine if it is possible for a firewall to analyse its own traffic patterns to identify attempted denial of service. Statistical analyses of firewall logs for a large network were carried out and a baseline determined. Estimated traffic levels were projected using linear regression and Holt-Winter methods for comparison with the baseline.

50|$|Since even well-engineered IP {{networks}} {{tend to have}} a small residual {{packet loss}} rate caused by low-probability statistical congestion events and amplification of bit errors in the underlying hardware, most professional solutions use some kind of forward error correction to ensure that the encoded video stream can be reconstructed even if a few packets are lost. This is typically applied at the <b>packet</b> <b>level,</b> since the encapsulated video bitstream is typically only designed to tolerate low levels of bit or burst errors, rather than the loss of whole packets. Resending packets is not an option because of the sequential nature of the underlying video signal. For live video, a resent packet would arrive well after the arrival of the next frame of video.|$|E
50|$|RTMP is a TCP-based {{protocol}} which maintains persistent {{connections and}} allows low-latency communication. To deliver streams smoothly and transmit {{as much information}} as possible, it splits streams into fragments, and their size is negotiated dynamically between the client and server. Sometimes, it is kept unchanged; the default fragment sizes are 64 bytes for audio data, and 128 bytes for video data and most other data types. Fragments from different streams may then be interleaved, and multiplexed over a single connection. With longer data chunks, the protocol thus carries only a one-byte header per fragment, so incurring very little overhead. However, in practice, individual fragments are not typically interleaved. Instead, the interleaving and multiplexing is done at the <b>packet</b> <b>level,</b> with RTMP packets across several different active channels being interleaved {{in such a way as}} to ensure that each channel meets its bandwidth, latency, and other quality-of-service requirements. Packets interleaved in this fashion are treated as indivisible, and are not interleaved on the fragment level.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{introduces}} a new analytical method for performance evaluation of wireless packet-oriented networks. Unlike traditional call admission control procedures commonly used for performance evaluation of wireless networks, this paper {{deals with the}} problem of coupling connection and <b>packet</b> <b>level</b> QoS characteristics by analysis. At connection level we use the Blocked-Calls-Cleared (BCC) model, whereas at <b>packet</b> <b>level</b> we use the Blocked-Call-Interfered (BCI) model which has no immediate feedback from <b>packet</b> <b>level</b> to connection level about lost data. At connection level we use the convolution algorithm which defines the feasible state space at <b>packet</b> <b>level.</b> At <b>packet</b> <b>level</b> we take into consideration wireless interference (soft blocking). The traffic is modeled as multi-rate Binomial-Poisson-Pascal (BPP-) traffic at connection level and on-off traffic at <b>packet</b> <b>level.</b> We obtain individual performance measures for each service, both at connection level and at <b>packet</b> <b>level.</b> By case studies we investigate the trade-off between the two levels to meet Grade of Service (GoS) requirements for cellular networks with WCDMA radio interface.

30|$|In the literature, {{there exist}} some studies {{providing}} service differentiation among video packets, where video packets of less importance are mapped to the lower-priority AC queues than AC_VI either statically [5] or dynamically [6 – 10]. Although {{these studies have}} achieved performance gains over EDCA, the traffic impact of those downward mapped video packets to the lower-priority AC queues has not been well-discussed. To address this, in the newly released 802.11 aa- 2012 standard [11], two new concepts called intra access category prioritisation (IACP) and stream classification service (SCS) have thus been proposed. IACP achieves flow-level differentiation between real-time and non-real-time video by a double-queue framework, namely the primary (VI) and alternative (A_VI) AC queues as shown in Fig.  1 c, {{also referred to as}} AC_VI and AAC_VI, respectively, throughout this study. Based on IACP, SCS further achieves packet-level differentiation to pursue graceful degradation of video streaming quality during congestions by introducing drop eligibility indicator (DEI) enabling differential retransmission limits for lost video packets of different importance levels. Similarly, service differentiation can also be achieved for voice at both the flow and <b>packet</b> <b>levels.</b> In IACP and SCS, voice or video traffic flows are confined to their own (primary, alternative) AC queues, and thus generate zero traffic impact to the lower-priority AC queues.|$|R
