50|$|In the past, it {{was common}} for {{multiple}} five-way binding <b>posts</b> <b>to</b> have their drilled holes lined up; this provided convenience in some applications as a bare wire could be strung from <b>post</b> <b>to</b> <b>post</b> <b>to</b> <b>post.</b> But this also impaired safety as two wires or pin connectors could be inserted from opposite sides of two binding posts and {{the tips of the}} wires or probes might inadvertently short together. Holes are now normally aligned in such a fashion that such shorts cannot occur.|$|R
