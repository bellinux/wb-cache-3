40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} an {{experimental}} study that investigates insurance behaviours in low-probability high-loss risk situations. This study reveals that insurance behaviours {{may depend on}} the individual prior experience towards risk. It may also depend on {{the duration of the}} commitment period, namely the period during which individuals commit themselves to maintain the same insurance decision. Non-additive decision models such as Dual Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory seem to have a higher descriptive power than Expected Utility Theory when explaining subjects' behaviours. This paper presents a direct experimental test of the prediction of Myopic Prospect Theory relative to insurance demand. This study is also designed to test the significance of gambler's fallacy and availability bias in the insurance decision process. These theoretical concepts help to understand many behaviours commonly observed in reality but which remain unexplained within the E. U framework. In particular, this paper provides new explanations about the puzzling fact that people usually fail to obtain insurance against disaster-type risks such as natural disasters, even when premiums are close to actuarially fair levels. According to our experimental results, the deficiency of insurance demand for natural disasters {{may be due to the}} lack of individual prior experience towards such risks; as well as the relatively short commitment <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> policies (usually one fiscal year) compared with the empirical frequency of major natural hazards (centennial and even more).

Due to the current demographic trends, which is characterized by an aging population and associated {{increase in the number}} of people older ages in the labor market, the work focuses on a group of persons over 50 years, their position on the Czech labor market and proposes solutions supporting greater involvement of older persons in the labor market, which are in particular support for education, change of social view of older workers, more frequent use of part-time work and state financial support. Firstly, the characteristics and position of older persons on the Czech labor market are described and then the labor market of the CR as a whole is analyzed in comparison with the labor market of persons over 50 years of age. Here the work concludes that the development of the unemployment rate of persons over 50 years of age is quite similar to the development of the general unemployment rate, but despite the many years of experience on the labor market, people over 50 have suffered a long-term higher unemployment rate than the general population, mainly due to lower education, deteriorating health status and personality characteristics related to their age. Another reason is the prolonging retirement age and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> required to qualify for pension insurance. The state employment policy of the Czech Republic is then analyzed and evaluated. It is appropriately targeted to support the employment of people over 50, which is increasingly used by the European Social Fund.

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on current issues in the pension and {{sickness}} insurance of the self-employed, where fundamental changes occurred from 2009 onwards regarding not only collection of premiums but also the benefits provided by these systems. The system of insurance for self-employed persons underwent a long development period, every stage {{from the very beginning}} of insurance through interdependence of pension and sickness insurance to their complete separation affected the current behaviour of the self-employed in this field. Premiums should be understood also in terms of coverage of social incidents, which is an illness, injury, disability or old age. The amount of benefits provided from the system depends on the amount of premiums paid and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> For this reason, attention in the thesis was paid to the issue of present statutory regulation of premiums, focusing on special-purpose sickness insurance premiums for the self-employed and the subsequent payment of benefits. Also in the field of pension insurance it is necessary to consider whether the premium payers are sufficiently aware of the link between premiums paid and the amount of such benefits, and can responsibly decide on the choice of assessment base, which has an impact on future security in retirement. The objective of this thesis is, based on an analysis of main problems which consist of complexity and comprehensibility of the existing legislation in force for self-employed persons, to suggest changes aimed at simplifying it. The given topic was studied using qualitative research through semi-structured interviews in a relatively narrow circle of self-employed persons with the aim to investigate the status quo, to get a detailed understanding and practical application of the provisions of the Act. Based on the knowledge and experience from practice, questions were prepared, which were answered not only by clients but also by District Social Security Administration Office staff in Strakonice who deal with administration of premiums. Based on evaluation of individual respondents' replies and with regard to the current problems during practical implementation of pension and sickness insurance administration, an opinion was obtained that the existing legislation is complex and confusing for the self-employed. Therefore, measures were suggested, which could be used as tips for possible amendments to legislation in the field of self-employed persons´ insurance premiums...|$|E

40|$|This masters thesis {{deals with}} the issue of the pension system in {{relation}} to the demographic development in the Czech Republic. In describes the pension system from its very beginning until the effective legislation regulated by Act No. 155 / 1995, on Pension Insurance. The Czech pension system is based on two pillars [...] the basic obligatory system of pension insurance where the principle of social solidarity is applied and that is based on continuous funding (PAYG), and the voluntary private pension scheme with a state contribution. The private scheme is conceived as individual savings and is based on capital funding. The financial balance of the pay-as-you-go system where the expenditures on the benefits for current pensioners are immediately paid from the funds of those who are economically active to a critical extent depends on the rate between the number of pensioners and the number of contribution payers. As the expenditure on old-age pension accounts for the highest share in the expenditure on pension insurance, the rate between the number of pensioners and the number of contribution payers is primarily determined by the age structure of the population. Similarly to all developed countries, the development of the age structure {{of the population of the}} Czech Republic is marked with ageing of population as a result of the stagnating or decreasing fertility and extension of the lifespan. Benefits derived from the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> and generated earnings are then paid from the pension insurance. They include old-age pension, disability pensions, and survivors pensions. The aim of this thesis was not only to map out the current situation, but to define pros and cons of effective legislation related to pension insurance based on interviews with employees of district social security administrations, taking into account the demographic development in the Czech Republic. It also aimed at establishing the opinion of the lay public on the operation of the existing system and providing it within the context of the answers given by the expert public. To achieve these objectives, the qualitative method of document analysis and questioning was applied. Research techniques included a secondary data analysis and a half-standardised interview. The reviewed set comprised 11 officers at pension departments of district social security administrations and 11 respondents from among the lay public. The results of the research show that the current setting of the pension system is regarded as rather negative. The changes that must be made must be comprehensive and going across multiple systems; with a functioning labour market and stable background for families with children being an utmost necessity. It is also necessary to change the thinking of the citizens of the Czech Republic where one should no longer rely on the state only, but build on a responsible approach to ones life and provide for oneself with ones own founds for any social event, not only including the loss of income due to old age. The opinions of the expert and lay public were the same in more than 80...|$|E
40|$|Problem setting. Pension {{provision}} of citizens {{is among the}} priority tasks of social policy that is constantly {{on the agenda of}} public administration in developed countries. Under current conditions, the formation of the optimal pensions model that takes into account social and economic aspects of society is an important task for the state. Recent research and analysis of publications. There are certain theoretical and scientific achievements in the area under consideration. A significant contribution have been made by researchers and scientists in various fields, including V. Bessarab, I. Hnybidenko, M. Kravchenko, O. Krentovska, E. Libanova, B. Nadtochiy, A. Nechay, V. Skurativskyy, V. Tolub and others. However, some issues related to reforming of the pension system require further study with due regard for further modernization of state social policy. The paper objective is to review the European experience in reforming the pension system in the context of its possible application in the realities of current Ukraine. The main body of paper. Reforming of pension systems in Europe relied on the rapid aging of the population and increased pension burden on employees. Thus, in 2010, the EU population over 60 years made up about 24 %, up to 2040, according to the experts, it could reach the figure of 35 %, an increase by more than 10 %. Thus, the population of working age (20 - 59 years) will decrease from 54 % to 47 %, or by 7 % during the same period. Currently, pension systems in most European countries are based on the three-level models that include unfunded pension scheme with the {{provision of}} basic pension and funded one (mandatory and voluntary) scheme and are combined in different options. Analysis of pension systems in some European countries, including Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, shows that their reforms were carried out in the following directions: increasing the retirement age (for men -  to 65, women - 60 years); extending the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> and contributions to pension funds of the country; changes in the procedure of the pension benefit indexation; encouraging the development of additional professional programs of funded pension schemes and personal pension insurance; increasing premiums and upgrading the base for their calculations. The issue of retirement age is the most painful for all EU countries, as it affects the interests of several generations, present and future pensioners. The general trend towards increasing the retirement age is influenced by a number of demographic, economic and social factors: increased life expectancy and its active period; limited manpower; possibility of employing the professional and intellectual potential of elderly staff; the need for  spreading out  the base of contributors for the pension budget increase; preventing the risk of the poverty expansion among pensioners; smoothing the gap in living standards of the employed and pensioners. For our country, like for most European countries, the problem of population aging and, consequently, increased demographic burden {{is one of the biggest}} problems. The aging process of the Ukrainian nation is characterized by the rapid growth of the number of people aged over 60 years. According to demographic projections for 2026, their share will increase to 25 %. In this situation, the only solution is to reform the pension system of Ukraine. It would be reasonable to adopt the European system of pension insurance as an example. Conclusions of the research. For our country, further study of the European experience and successful workable solutions will be useful with regard to their application in the process of building and reforming own pension systems, thus avoiding the negative trends caused by socio-economic realities of modern society...|$|E
30|$|How {{do these}} reforms change the basic {{structure}} and goals of the pension system? As Fig.  5 shows, the state’s share of pension financing has increased substantially. This {{is the result of}} measures introduced to relieve upward pressure on payroll contributions and to finance <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> that are not financed by payroll contributions. A second substantial change is the significant reduction in future benefits. Between 1990 and 2014, the pension for a worker with 45 years of employment at average wages has decreased from 55.1 to 48 [*]% of average earnings. By 2028, the replacement rate is forecast to be 44.4 [*]%. Indeed, recent pension analyses from the government openly admit that the public pension will not be high enough to maintain a pensioner’s previous standard of living (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales 2013, p.  12). An explicit goal of reforms since 2001 has been the voluntary expansion of private and occupational pensions to compensate for cuts in the statutory pension. Since the 2001 pension reform, occupational pensions have increased significantly. In 2001 there were 14.6  million active occupational pension contracts, and this had increased to 19.6  million in 2011 (an increase of 34 [*]%) (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales 2013, p.  135). The 2001 reform also included provisions allowing workers to use request tax-favored salary sacrifice (Entgeltumwandlung); salary sacrifice is the most important driver of the increase in occupational pension provision in the last 10 years (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales 2013, p.  137). In addition, individuals may buy tax-preferred individual contracts (the Riester pension). At the end of June 2012, there were 15.6  million individual Riester contracts. In 2012, about 70 [*]% of those covered by the statutory system had additional pension coverage.|$|R

40|$|On 1 January 1986 {{a new era}} dawned for the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> law in Australia, for on that day the provisions <b>of</b> the <b>Insurance</b> Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) (hereafter referred to as 'the Act') came into operation. Section 3 of the Act repeals for Australia certain Imperial Acts including the Life Assurance Act 1774, the Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 and the Marine Insurance Act 1788. In so far as contracts <b>of</b> general <b>insurance)</b> can be governed {{by the laws of}} the Commonwealth of Australia, this repeal brought to an end a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> law relating to:- a [...] the concept of insurable interest; b. the principle of indemnity; and c. the rights of, and the classes of, persons entitled to make claims under contracts <b>of</b> general <b>insurance.</b> That development had commenced prior to the passage of the repealed Imperial Acts, but had been accelerated by, and as a result of, their passage. In Part III the Act lays down new rules with respect to the concept of insurable interest. Moreover, by sections 44, 45, 48, 49 and 76 certain material alterations are made to the law relating to: - a. the principle of indemnity; and b. the rights of, and the classes of, persons entitled to make claims under contracts <b>of</b> general <b>insurance.</b> In this thesis I propose to investigate and describe the law relating to:- a. insurable interest; b. the principle of indemnity; and c. the right of, and the classes of, persons entitled to make claims under contracts <b>of</b> general <b>insurance,</b> 1. as it had developed prior to the passage of the now repealed Imperial Acts, and their precursors; 2. as it developed after the passage of the now repealed Imperial Acts until the date of their repeal; 3. as it has been affected by the repeal and the new regime provided by the Act; and 4. as it is likely to develop in the future. Furthermore I propose to draw a comparison with the laws operating in the Netherlands, France and Germany at the relevant times to ascertain whether, and to what extent, such laws influenced the English law or were influenced by it. Finally the laws presently operating in those countries will also be examined by me to consider whether any, and if so which, recent continental developments might be useful, as indicating a solution to problems likely to face Australian Courts in the immediate future.

30|$|Another likely culprit {{preventing}} Europeans {{from moving}} is the relative rigidity of wages and generous pay-out <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> unemployment <b>insurance</b> plans. Wage regulation {{leads to an}} earnings compression that can mute the signals that the labor market sends {{from one part of}} a country to another. If wages are not sufficiently flexible, they can fail to provide incentives for capital to flow into economically lagging regions or for workers to move to economically booming regions. Generous unemployment insurance plans that provide support over long periods can act as a disincentive for workers with industry-specific or place-specific skills to retrain and move. In principle, the relationship could also be reverse in the sense that more generous unemployment benefits can give job seekers the resources and time to look for better matching job offers in other regions. Yet, as Hassler et al. (2001) show, on average {{there seems to be a}} negative relationship between mobility rates and unemployment insurance: high-mobility countries are characterized by low unemployment insurance benefits, while low-mobility countries have the most generous unemployment insurance plans.|$|R
40|$|We study a two-period general {{equilibrium}} {{model with}} incomplete asset markets and default. We make collateral endogenous by allowing each seller of assets to fix the level of collateral. Sellers are required to provide collateral whose first-period value, per unit of asset, exceeds the asset price by an arbitrarily small amount. Moreover, borrowers are also required to be fully covered by the purchase, in the first <b>period,</b> <b>of</b> state-by-state default <b>insurance.</b> These insurance contracts are offered by lenders. The insurance cost or revenue is a linear charge and {{plays the role of}} a spread penalizing borrowers who will incur in default and benefiting lenders who will suffer default. Under these assumptions, equilibrium always exists. Copyright Blackwell Publishers, Inc. 2000. ...|$|R

This article focuses on a detailed analysis <b>of</b> non-contributory <b>periods</b> in the Czech pension system {{and their impact on}} pension system balance and micro and macro economic connections. The extent <b>of</b> non-contributory <b>periods</b> considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. The amount <b>of</b> non-contributory <b>periods</b> or the proportion between non-contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid insurance and non-contributory <b>periods</b> (potential loss <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. The study presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons. The analysis reveals that non-contributory periods are a significant element of the Czech pension system amounting to 22. 4 % <b>of</b> the total <b>insurance</b> <b>period.</b> The average duration <b>of</b> non-contributory <b>periods</b> for current pensioners is 8. 7 years. social <b>insurance,</b> principle <b>of</b> solidarity, principle of equivalence, pension scheme, pension reform, non-contributory periods...|$|R
50|$|It {{sometimes}} takes {{a considerable}} time to finalise the preliminaries for {{the conclusion of}} a contract <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> In order to protect the proposed insured during the interval before the issue of a final policy, the parties frequently resort to temporary or interim insurance to cover the proposer immediately but for a limited <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. This is common practice in the case <b>of</b> short-term <b>insurance</b> contracts, but it may be invoked in all other forms <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|R
40|$|We examine empirically {{the dynamic}} {{historical}} relation between banking, insurance economic (income) growth in Sweden using time-series data from 1830 to 1998. We examine long-run historical {{trends in the}} data using econometric tests for cointegration and Granger causality. Our {{results indicate that the}} development of domestic banking, but not insurance, preceded economic growth in Sweden during the nineteenth century, while Granger causality was reversed in the twentieth century. We also find that the development of bank lending in the nineteenth century increased the demand for insurance as well as promoting economic growth. In later <b>periods,</b> the development <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> fosters demand for banking services but only in times of economic prosperity. For the entire <b>period</b> <b>of</b> our analysis, we find that banking is the predominant influence on both economic growth and the demand for insurance. In contrast, the insurance market appears to be driven more by the pace of growth in the economy rather than leading economic development. Therefore, we conclude that financial intermediation, particularly banking, is an important prerequisite for stimulating economic growth and argue that our results could have important policy implications for contemporary emerging economies that are developing their financial and legal infrastructures...|$|R
