2500|$|Gunston Hall has a basement, {{which has}} a main passage and four rooms like the floor above it. Three {{staircases}} lead down to the basement. The basement contains four brick arched chimney supports, and nine small windows. In 1975, a cast iron stove was excavated from the basement. The style of the stove suggests {{it is from the}} 18th or early 19th century. Around 1986, a [...] "shallow subsurface <b>perimeter</b> <b>drainage</b> system" [...] was built about four feet (1.2m) away from the foundation walls, due to an excess ground moisture. This significantly reduced standing water in the basement.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to exanimate the drainage network of the watersheds of Campinas county, using an automatic proceeding. Drainage basin morphometric parameters obtained by DEM such as watershed area, watershed <b>perimeter,</b> <b>drainage</b> density, stream density, and drainage network length were calculated as well as relief parameters such as relief ratio, watershed relief, relative watershed relief, and soil slope average. Indeed, the Campinas area has a strong human influence because of the pastoral areas, agricultural and urban areas, which modify the landscape. The morphometric analysis showed considerable differences among the watersheds. The first group was characterized by the largest watersheds as Atibaia and Capivari, the second group was represented by Anhumas and the third group was characterized by Capivari-Mirim, Jaguari and Quilombo. Concluing, the results indicated that the Anhumas, Capivari-Mirim and Quilombo might be more aptness for agriculture and Capivari for pasture. The largest watershed (Atibaia) show feature appropriate for the development of pasture and reforestation. Pages: 3381 - 338...|$|E
50|$|The {{drainage}} basin {{acts as a}} funnel by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each {{drainage basin}} is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a <b>perimeter,</b> the <b>drainage</b> divide, making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a ridge, hill or mountains) forming a barrier.|$|R

During the opening of <b>drainage</b> <b>perimeter,</b> the archaeologists discovered an older dis-activated channel system, that ran along the principal facade of the church along with an older calçada pavement, which was conserved, {{eliminating the need for}} further drainage projects.|$|R
30|$|Strahler (1964) {{demonstrated}} circularity ratio (Rc) as {{the ratio}} of basin area {{to the area of}} a circle having the same <b>perimeter</b> of the <b>drainage</b> basin. Rc value near to 1 indicates the circular shape of the basin and similar infiltration rate over the basin area. Lower values of Rc represent youth stage of basin development where the surface water flow takes comparatively lesser time to reach the basin outlet. Rc values of Vaitarna and Ulhas are 0.38 and 0.24, respectively. Moderate values of Rc for both basins indicate mature topography and Ulhas basin is comparatively elongated than Vaitarna.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} how dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) concentration in lakes of the North American temperate forest (Upper Great Lakes region) is related to nine catchment characteristics (lake area, lake <b>perimeter,</b> <b>drainage</b> area, ratio of drainage area to lake area, proportion of watershed occupied by wetlands, proportion of lake perimeter in wetlands, shoreline development, elevation, and watershed slope) and compared selected relationships to those from other regions across the globe. For the temperate lakes, {{the proportion of the}} lake perimeter and the proportion of the watershed occupied by wetlands were the best predictors of DOC in both univariate (r 2 � 0. 34 and 0. 30, respectively) and multivariate regression models. Forested wetlands, in particular those with coniferous vegetation, explained the largest proportion of lake DOC variability. Wetlands with scrub-shrubs and emergent vegetation explained very little or no variability. Secondary to wetlands, lake DOC decreased with lake area and watershed slope. When we combined the temperate lake data set with that of 10 other geographical regions of the world (ranging from subtropical to tundra), the only two variables significant in predicting DOC were proportion of wetlands in the watershed (r 2 � 0. 36) and lake elevation (r 2 � 0. 34). We conclude that regional or small-scale DOC models likely have limited applicability in predicting DOC in other geographical areas of the world.

40|$|Many {{discharge}} basin {{features that}} are important to the hydrologist can be quantified in terms of length, length squared, and length cubed. Examples are elevation, stream length, basin <b>perimeter,</b> <b>drainage</b> area, and volume. The concept of geometric similarity can be applied to drainage basins just as it is to many systems. Most readers would be aware of model-prototype studies of aircraft, dams, and turbo machinery. Such studies involve considerations as well as dynamic similarity. In the same manner that inferences as to the operation of a prototype can sometimes be drawn from a geometrically similar model, inferences can also be drawn about the operation of one drainage area on the basis of information obtained from a similar one. Perfect similarity will never be realized if drainage systems are compared, but striking similarities have been observed which can often be put to practical use. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate a power equation relating drainage basin area to stream length with respect to the Gongola River Basin (Case Study and shown in Figure 1). The Gongola River is one of the two (2) major rivers in Bauchi State within Northern Nigeria and is a tributary of the River Benue. This area has poor rainfall and hence the need to properly study the River for water resource management. The logarithm of cumulative stream length is plotted against the logarithm of drainage area basin. Theories postulated shows that drainage area and stream length are related in a power function. The result obtained which affirmed the theory also gives a foundation for the comparison or computation of drainage basin morphology given that the new basin being considered is of a similar geometry and exists within the same hydrologic cycle...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of the drainage {{does not appear to}} be complete if it lacks the systematic approach towards the development of drainage basin in the area. Drainage lines of an area not only explain the existing three-dimensional geometry of the region but also help to narrate its evolutional process (Singh 1980). Drainage provides a basic to understand initial gradient, variation in rock resistance, structural control, geological and geomorphologic history of the drainage basin or watershed. Evaluation of morphometric parameters requires the {{analysis of}} various drainage parameters such as ordering of the various streams, measurement of basin area and <b>perimeter,</b> length of <b>drainage</b> channels, drainage density (Dd), bifurcation ratio (Rb), stream length ratio (RL), and relief ratio (Rh).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Seepage {{gradients}} play {{an important}} role in the detachment of soil particles from the side walls of stream chan-nels and drainage ditches. Most seepage studies have focused on water losses. Relatively few have addressed the determina-tion of these gradients as causes of soil loss and incipient gully development. This paper presents the methodology of calcu-lating these gradients on any point of the soil-water interface of a subsurface flow system, for which a close-form analytical solution was obtained (Römkens 2009). Such a solution was derived using conformal transformations for a situation in which a ponded surface drains by subsurface flow into a ditch with a water table lower than that of the ponded surface. The derived relationships allow a close estimate of the soil detachment forces on the wetted <b>drainage</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the stream system...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this project is to {{stabilize}} the abandoned coal storage area and redirect the storm water runoff from sanitary sewer system to the storm drain system. Currently, the existing storm water runoff is directed to a <b>perimeter</b> concrete <b>drainage</b> swale and collected in a containment basin. The collected water is then pumped to a treatment facility and after treatment, is discharged to the Y- 12 sanitary sewer system. The existing drainage swale and collection basin along with silt fencing will be used during aggregate placement and grading to provide erosion and sediment control. Inlet protection will also be installed around existing structures during the storm water diversion construction. This project scope will include the installation of a non-woven geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base (paving optional) to stabilize the site. The geotextile specifications are provided on the vendor cut sheets in Appendix B. The installation of a storm water collection/retention area will also be installed on the southern side of the site in accordance with EPA Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The total area to be disturbed is approximately 2. 5 acres. The order of activities for this Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be: (1) post notice of coverage (NOC) in a prominent display near entrance of the site; (2) install rain gauge on site or contact Y- 12 Plant Shift Superintendent daily for Met tower rain gauge readings; (3) install stabilized construction exit on site; (4) install silt fencing along perimeter as indicated on the attached site plan; (5) regrade site; (6) install geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base; (7) install catch basin inlet protection where required; (8) excavate and lower existing catch basin tops, re-grade and asphalt to drain; and (9) when all disturbed areas are re-stabilized, remove silt fencing and any other temporary erosion control...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{long-term}} drainage capacity of four types of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) and three types of prefabricated horizontal drains (PHDs), and as well of the transmissivity of a dual function (reinforcement and drainage) geotextile (DFG) are presented. PVD, PHD and DFG are together called geosynthetics drains in this study. A method of calculating the hydraulic radius (R) (cross-sectional area divided by the <b>perimeter</b> of a <b>drainage</b> channel) of PVDs and PHDs by considering the deformation of the filter (under confinement) is proposed. Based on the limited test data, {{it is found that}} the rate of water flow per unit drainage area, q; increases with the hydraulic radius of the drainage channel, thereby q is approximately proportional to R 1 : 2 and R 1 : 7 for elapsed times of 1 and 3 months, respectively. Including the {{results of the}} DFG (R-value is close to zero), the drainage capacity ratio (r), defined as the value at time t divided by the corresponding initial value (t 0) increases almost linearly with the R-value. It is recommended to employ geosynthetics drains with a larger R-value, i. e. a stiff filter, a strong core, and large and square-shaped drainage channels. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractStudy regionIncreasing {{demographic}} pressure {{and economic development}} in the Mekong Basin result in greater dependency on river water resources and increased vulnerability to streamflow variations. Study focusImproved knowledge of flow variability is therefore paramount, especially in remote catchments, rarely gauged, and inhabited by vulnerable populations. We present simple multivariate power-law relationships for estimating streamflow metrics in ungauged areas, from easily obtained catchment characteristics. The relations were derived from weighted least square regression applied to streamflow, climate, soil, geographic, geomorphologic and land-cover characteristics of 65 gauged catchments in the Lower Mekong Basin. Step-wise and best subset regressions were used concurrently to maximize the prediction R-squared computed by leave-one-out cross-validations, thus ensuring parsimonious, yet accurate relationships. New hydrological insights for the regionA combination of 3 – 6 explanatory variables – chosen among annual rainfall, <b>drainage</b> area, <b>perimeter,</b> elevation, slope, <b>drainage</b> density and latitude – is sufficient to predict a range of flow metrics with a prediction R-squared ranging from 84 to 95 %. The inclusion of forest or paddy percentage coverage as an additional explanatory variable led to slight improvements in the predictive power {{of some of the}} low-flow models (lowest prediction R-squared= 89 %). A physical interpretation of the model structure was possible for most of the resulting relationships. Compared to regional regression models developed {{in other parts of the}} world, this new set of equations performs reasonably well...|$|R
