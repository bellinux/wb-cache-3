Four homes and 20businesses in King George County were severely damaged, with an additional 150–200 reporting lesser damage from winds and falling trees. Gusty winds forced the closure of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge. In Prince William County, seven homes were destroyed, with 24homes and three businesses experiencing major damage. Several roads were closed due to downed trees. The Marine Corps Base Quantico reported severe damage amounting to $9.5million (2003USD, $11million 2008USD).

25|$|Initially, parking at the Anacostia {{station was}} low. Only {{an average of}} 275 people parked each day at the station's parking garage and parking lot by March 1992. To {{encourage}} parking, in April 1992 Metro offered half-price parking coupons to encourage commuters to use the Anacostia parking spaces. Metro also held public hearings in Maryland to learn why commuters {{did not use the}} lot; crime was the highest concern. The campaign worked, and by November 1992 the lot was nearly full every weekday. In July 1993, District of Columbia officials canceled plans to build a $5.4 million ground-level <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Anacostia Metro station. The unused funds sat idle until 2004, when the District of Columbia finally used them to improve traffic signals, lighting, and pedestrian access along South Capitol Street between E Street SE and the Anacostia Metro station, and for the design of a new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well. In 1981, Metro had proposed building 1,000 parking spaces in a three-level parking garage and 300 spaces at a ground-level <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station and using interstate highway {{funds to pay}} for them. Metro officials argued the facility was highway-related, since it provided parking, but the Federal Highway Administration refused to allow the District of Columbia use its funds {{to pay for the}} parking garage. Local citizens also opposed the parking garage in favor of ground-level-only parking at the station, and demanded that Metro provide more connecting bus routes at the proposed station. These disagreements were put off as Metro officials and others focused on getting the Green Line built, but by 1985 the parking garage remained part of the station's overall transportation and construction plan. Metro solicited bids for an $11 million contract to build the parking garage in early 1985, but rejected all bids when the lowest bidder failed to meet minority-contracting standards. In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on the parking garage would begin in June.|$|E

25|$|Target Field {{was built}} in what was a <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north end of {{downtown}} Minneapolis {{within walking distance of}} the Target Center. On September 15, 2008 the Twins announced that they had sold naming rights to the Target Corporation and that the stadium would be known as Target Field. The Metro Light Rail was extended to the ballpark area with a connection to the Northstar Commuter Rail, which terminates at the ballpark. Preliminary plans called for a seating capacity of 40,000 seats and 72 suites. There are approximately 34 rest rooms compared to only 16 in Metrodome. The concourses are open to the playing field with a view of the downtown Minneapolis skyline from every seat in the park. There is no retractable roof on the stadium which would have added about $200 million on to the cost which was $522 million. This received some objection due to the potentially harsh game conditions in early April (similar to other northern pro baseball teams such as the White Sox, Cubs, Tigers, Indians, Red Sox, etc.) and the potential risk of resulting lost revenue. The official groundbreaking for the stadium, originally scheduled for 2 August 2007, was postponed to August 30 due to the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge.|$|E
