5000|$|<b>Pitche</b> Blende’s {{popularity}} rapidly accelerated {{during this}} time forsaking typical three-minute songs {{in favor of a}} new exploratory sound along the lines of more progressive bands such as Traffic (band) which they covered in their show. In 1969 they released their first and only vinyl recording “My World Has Stopped” with [...] "Stop" [...] on the B side and received regional air play which allowed them a preferred billing position among the more renowned groups of that time. The two songs were released on the Michigan Mixture Volume 1 LP (and later on the two-disc CD compilation) and are considered by garage rock and psychedelic collectors to be standout songs from the era. [...] <b>Pitche</b> Blende disbanded in 1970 as tensions ensued with two of the members joining the Jesus movement while the two sisters had relationship break-ups with the other two male band's members.|$|E
50|$|Their {{approach}} {{evolved from}} the garage/psychedelic sound to more commercial rock as groups such as The Cherry Slush, who had already released two pop hit singles and were rising to the top on Billboard Magazine. <b>Pitche</b> Blende, however, remained experimental in nature. This was {{during a time when}} often concerts were three day-long music festival affairs, much like the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967 and Woodstock in 1969, when a numerous bands would perform. Meanwhile, in Michigan, there were other acts such as The MC5, Iggy Pop, Ted Nugent and The Amboy Dukes, Frijid Pink, Bob Seger, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, Grand Funk Railroad, Question Mark & The Mysterians, Dick Wagner and The Frost, SRC (band), Savoy Brown and The Pleaure Seekers (later Cradle), many of whom would attain national notoriety while routinely performing in clubs throughout the Mid-Michigan area. Dick Wagner supported many of the young musicians in Michigan and produced The Cherry Slush's first record. The band members of <b>Pitche</b> Blend frequently opened for Wagner who became a mentor and family friend to the two sisters, Laurie and Jinny Seaman, and continued to do work with them through the years.|$|E

At age 14 she was {{the female}} lead singer of the Saginaw, Michigan cult-underground band <b>Pitche</b> Blende, a {{featured}} band on The Michigan Mixture Volume 1 album. She is most associated with her affiliation as the keyboard player and vocalist with Chicago's reformed group the Buckinghams from 1982 to 1985; and as lead singer in the reformed group The Mamas & The Papas from 1986 to 1993 with original members John Phillips and Denny Doherty along with Spanky McFarlane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitche</b> Blende was an American garage rock/psychedelic {{rock band}} formed in 1967, in Saginaw, Michigan. The group was {{composed}} of high school students, mostly from Arthur Hill High School, and became a regional success in the early Michigan Rock culture movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band consisted of six members which included two sisters, vocalist Laurie Seaman (Laurie Beebe Lewis) and bassist Jinny Seaman, guitarist Dennis Malenfant, rhythm guitarist Dan Quinnan, drummer Mike Volker and singer Tom Morris. The Seaman sisters' mother, Clara Jeanne Seaman, was their manager.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between motor function and processing speed in preterm children. Processing speed was compared in 145 adolescents, born 25 - 41 weeks gestational age, utilizing tasks including differing motor demands. The influence of motor cortex excitability and functional motor skills on task performance was assessed. For tasks with motoric demands, differences in performance between preterm and term-born children were mediated by {{the relationship between}} gestational age, corticomotor excitability, and motor function. There were no differences in non-motor processing speed task performance between preterm and term-born children. Measures of processing speed may be confounded by a timed motor component. L. A.

40|$|Four Nb 3 Sn {{conductor}} lengths {{were prepared}} {{according to the}} ITER TF conductor design and assembled into two SULTAN samples. The four lengths are not fully identical, with variations of the strand supplier, void fraction and twist pitch. Lower void fractions improve the strand support and increased twist pitches also lower the strand contact pressure but both tend to increase the AC loss and the lower void fraction also increases the pressure drop so that the mass flow rate in the strand bundle area of the cable is reduced. The assembly procedure of the two samples is described including the destructive investigation on a short conductor section to assess a possible perturbation of the cable-to-jacket slippage during the termination preparation. Based on the DC performance and AC loss results from the test in SULTAN, {{the impact of the}} void fraction and twist pitch variations is discussed in view of freezing the ITER conductor design and large series manufacture. A comparison with the former generation of conductors, using similar strands but based on the ITER Model Coil layout, is also carried out. The ITER specifications, in terms of current sharing temperature, are fulfilled by both samples, with outstanding results for the conductor with longer twist <b>pitche...</b>|$|E

40|$|Afferent input {{has been}} shown to be a {{powerful}} modulator of cortical inhibition. Such modulation is likely to be important for the control of ongoing movement, but may also play a role in facilitating neuroplastic reorganisation. Human motor control and neuroplasticity both decline with ageing, whereas the efficacy of short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) appears not to. We examined if ageing alters the efficacy of afferent modulation of SICI. Previously, electrical cutaneous stimulation of a finger {{has been shown}} to reduce SICI in the motor cortices of young adults. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess SICI in the cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. SICI was assessed separately under two conditions: with and without prior afferent input from electrical cutaneous stimulation of the index finger. Fifteen ‘young’ (20. 1 ± 2. 1 years) and 15 ‘old’ male humans (65. 5 ± 3. 9 years) were studied. SICI did not differ when young and old males were compared. However, when preceded by electrical cutaneous finger stimulation, SICI was reduced in young men but not old men. Reflex testing indicated preservation of the afferent volley to the cortex. These findings suggest that a contributing factor in the decline of motor function, and possibly neuroplasticity, with ageing is loss of SICI modulation, probably due to altered cortical sensorimotor integration of afferent input.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that there are aging-related changes in corticospinal stimulus-response curve characteristics in later life. However, there is also limited evidence that these changes may only be evident in postmenopausal women and not in men. This study compared corticospinal stimulus-response curves from a group of young men [19. 8 ± 1. 6 yr (range 17 – 23 yr) ] and a group of old men [n = 18, aged 64. 1 ± 5. 0 yr (range 55 – 73 yr) ]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the contralateral motor cortex was used to evoke motor potentials at a range of stimulus intensities in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of each hand separately. There was no effect of age group or hemisphere (i. e., left vs. right motor cortex) on motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude or any other stimulus-response characteristic. MEP variability was strongly modulated by resting motor threshold but not by age. M-wave (but not F-wave) amplitude was reduced in old men, but expressing MEP amplitude as a ratio of M-wave amplitude did not reveal any age-related differences in cortically evoked stimulus-response characteristics. We conclude that male corticospinal stimulus-response characteristics are not altered by advancing age and that previously reported age-related changes in motor cortical excitability assessed with TMS are likely due to changes inherent in the female participants only. Future studies are warranted to fully elucidate the relationship between, and functional significance of, changes in circulating neuroactive sex hormones and motor function in later life. Ashleigh E.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and/or facilitation (ICF) changes with ageing, {{and if this}} {{can be attributed to}} age-related changes in the inhibition and/or corticospinal stimulus–response curves. SICI/ICF was studied in 17 “old” (63. 1 ± 4. 2 years) and 13 “young” males (20. 0 ± 2. 0 years) in both hemispheres using a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm at four interstimulus intervals (1, 3, 10 and 12 ms). Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle at rest, with a conditioning intensity set at 5 % stimulator output below the active threshold (aMT). Regardless of age, SICI was greater in the left compared with the right hemisphere. SICI was increased in old men at 3 ms in the left hemisphere and at 1 ms in the in both hemispheres, but ICF was not altered. However, aMT, and hence the conditioning stimulus intensity, was higher in old men. Comparisons of pairs of young and old men with the same aMT, and of SICI curves constructed relative to aMT, failed to show any age-related increase in SICI, although age-related changes in aMT accounted for less than 20 % of the variability. Corticospinal stimulus–response characteristics did not influence SICI/ICF and appear not to be altered by ageing in men. When measured in resting muscles, SICI/ICF appears unaltered by age. But it remains unknown if, when assessed during movement preparation or movement, there are changes in SICI related to functional motor changes commonly associated with ageing, such as slowing of movement.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} a range of prenatal and postnatal factors on cognitive development in preterm and term-born adolescents. Study design Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities were used to assess general intellectual ability and 6 broad cognitive abilities in 145 young adolescents aged approximately 12. 5 years and born 25 - 41 weeks gestational age (GA). To study potential links between neurophysiologic and cognitive outcomes, corticomotor excitability was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation and surface electromyography. The influence of various prenatal and postnatal factors on cognitive development was investigated using relative importance regression modeling. Results Adolescents with greater GA tended to have better cognitive abilities (particularly general intellectual abil- ity, working memory, and cognitive efficiency) and higher corticomotor excitability. Corticomotor excitability ex- plained a higher proportion of the variance in cognitive outcome than GA. But the strongest predictors of cognitive outcome were combinations of prenatal and postnatal factors, particularly degree of social disadvantage at the time of birth, birthweight percentile, and height at assessment. Conclusions In otherwise neurologically healthy adolescents, GA accounts for little interindividual variability in cognitive abilities. The association between corticomotor excitability and cognitive performance suggests that reduced connectivity, potentially associated with brain microstructural abnormalities, may contribute to cognitive deficits in preterm children. It remains to be determined if the effects of low GA on cognitive outcomes attenuate over childhood in favor of a concomitant increase in the relative importance of heritability, or alternatively, if cognitive development is more heavily influenced by the quality of the postnatal environment.
