5|$|In the United Kingdom a {{total of}} 4100ha were planted with bulbs, of which 3800ha were Narcissi, the UK's most {{important}} bulb crop, much of which is for export, making this the largest global production centre, {{about half of the}} total <b>production</b> <b>area.</b> While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, German {{vineyards}} {{are predominantly}} white (63.1% of <b>production</b> <b>area</b> in 2006), {{as are the}} Swiss vineyards (more than 50% of the area in production are white grapes) and the Luxembourg vineyards (93% of the <b>production</b> <b>area</b> in white or grey grapes or gray). In France the northern half produces most of the white wines (Alsace, Jura, Champagne, and the Loire Valley). In Spain, paradoxically, Castile-La Mancha accounts for 50% of the Spanish vineyards, producing mostly white wine on a very large <b>production</b> <b>area</b> in a high temperature zone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of discriminating the different varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons of Taiwan partially fermented tea by using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A total of 308 partially fermented tea samples with 6 different tea varieties, 6 <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and 2 different production seasons were collected and analyzed. The principal component analysis (PCA) result of NIRS spectra data showed that the first three principal components could explain the sample variation LIP to 95. 0 %. The ability of classifying different <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> of tea samples by PCA was the best followed by tea varieties. The discriminant model further established by NIRS data with partial least square (PLS) could recognize and identify the varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons of tea samples up to 98. 4 % (299 of 305), 97. 4 % (296 of 304), and 100 %, respectively. Using the established discriminant model, the tea samples with different varieties, <b>production</b> <b>areas</b> and seasons could be correctly predicted and identified at the levels of 96. 3 %, 94. 1 % and 99. 2 %, respectively...|$|R

25|$|Gas can be {{temporarily}} {{stored in}} the pipeline system itself, through a process called line packing. This is done by packing more gas into the pipeline {{by an increase in}} the pressure. During periods of high demand, greater quantities of gas can be withdrawn from the pipeline in the market area, than is injected at the <b>production</b> <b>area.</b> The process of line packing is usually performed during off peak times to meet the next day’s peaking demands. This method, however, only provides a temporary short-term substitute for traditional underground storage.|$|E

Rashke wrote that the soluble type of plutonium found in Silkwood's body came from a <b>production</b> <b>area</b> which she had not accessed for four months.

Many lines to coal and iron ore pits further east were built, but serving remote areas the lines closed when the mineral extraction ceased.|$|E
25|$|Hastings District, {{as one of}} {{the largest}} apple, pear and stone fruit {{producing}} areas in New Zealand, has an important relationship with the Napier Port. It has also become an important grape growing and wine <b>production</b> <b>area</b> with the fruit passing from the growers around Metropolitan Hastings and then to Napier for exporting. Napier is an important service centre for the agriculture and pastoral output of the predominantly rural Hastings District.

25|$|Trabzon's {{regional}} cuisine {{is traditionally}} reliant on fish, especially hamsi (fresh European Anchovy {{similar to the}} British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the Akçaabat köfte (spicy lamb meatball from the Akçaabat district), Karadeniz pidesi (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), kuymak (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), Vakfıkebir ekmeği (large country-style bread), Tonya tereyağı (Tonya butter), tava mısır ekmeği (deep-dish corn bread) and kara lahana çorbası (bean and cabbage soup). Taflan kavurması is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts.

25|$|In 1957, a new {{gas plant}} at Taylor, near Fort St. John, British Columbia, began {{supplying}} Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. This plant's practices differed from {{those used in}} Alberta {{in a number of}} ways. For example, although it generally required dehydration, sweetening and processing for liquid hydrocarbons, companies transported the natural gas from northeastern British Columbia long distances before processing it further. Consequently, while planning the Westcoast pipeline, the field operators agreed to process all the gas at a single facility, rather than have individual gas plants in every major <b>production</b> <b>area.</b> At 10 million cubic metres per day, the Taylor plant had the capacity to process as much natural gas as all eleven of the other gas plants operating in Canada combined. The plant was also by far Canada's most northerly. Heavily insulated buildings protected the processing facilities and allowed them to function at temperatures typical of more southerly climes.|$|E

In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.|$|E
25|$|Century-old vines {{still exist}} in many {{regional}} vineyards {{and allow for}} the production of long-aging, robust red wines with intense fruit and enhanced tannic content. The best known appellation is the DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) Barbera d'Asti in the Piedmont region: the highest-quality Nizza DOCG wines are produced within a sub-zone of the Barbera d'Asti <b>production</b> <b>area.</b> When young, the wines offer a very intense aroma of fresh red cherries and blackberries. In the lightest versions notes of cherries, raspberries and blueberries and with notes of blackberry and black cherries in wines made of more ripe grapes. Many producers employ the use of toasted (seared over a fire) oak barrels, which provides for increased complexity, aging potential, and hints of vanilla notes. The lightest versions are generally known for flavors and aromas of fresh fruit and dried fruits, and are not recommended for cellaring. Wines with better balance between acid and fruit, often with the addition of oak and having a high alcohol content are more capable of cellaring; these wines often result from reduced-yield viticultural methods.|$|E
