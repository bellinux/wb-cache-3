There are similarities and differences between <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. In particular, it has been an open question whether non-abelian self-interactions are the limiting factor in the growth of non-abelian <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities.</b> We study this problem with 3 + 1 dimensional numerical simulations. We find that non-abelian <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> behave very differently from abelian ones once they grow to be non-perturbatively large, in contrast with earlier results of 1 + 1 dimensional simulations. In particular, they grow more slowly at late times, with linear rather than exponential dependence of magnetic energy on time.

50|$|The Chromo-Weibel {{instability}} is a <b>plasma</b> <b>instability</b> {{present in}} homogeneous or nearly homogeneous non-abelian plasmas which possess an anisotropy in momentum space. In the linear limit it {{is similar to}} the Weibel instability in electromagnetic plasmas but due to non-linear interactions present in non-abelian plasmas the late development of this instability is characterized by a turbulent cascade of modes. This instability is relevant in the understanding of the early-time dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma as produced in heavy-ion collisions.|$|E
40|$|QCD <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> {{appear to}} play an {{important}} role in the equilibration of quark-gluon plasmas in heavy-ion collisions in the theoretical limit of weak coupling (i. e. asymptotically high energy). It is important to understand what non-linear physics eventually stops the exponential growth of unstable modes. It is already known that the initial growth of <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in QCD closely parallels that in QED. However, once the unstable modes of the gauge-fields grow large enough for non-Abelian interactions between them to become important, one might guess that the dynamics of QCD <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> and QED <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> become very different. In this paper, we give suggestive arguments that non-Abelian self-interactions between the unstable modes are ineffective at stopping instability growth, and that the growing non-Abelian gauge fields become approximately Abelian after a certain stage in their growth. This in turn suggests that understanding the development of QCD <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the non-linear regime may have close parallels to similar processes in traditional plasma physics. We conjecture that the physics of collisionless <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theory becomes equivalent, respectively, to (i) traditional plasma physics, which is U(1) gauge theory, and (ii) plasma physics of U(1) x U(1) gauge theory.

At the time, no known mechanism was available to explain the phenomenon, but the theory was subsequently demonstrated in the laboratory. Subsequent research by Brenning and Axnäs (1988) have suggested that a lower hybrid <b>plasma</b> <b>instability</b> is involved in transferring energy from the larger ions to electrons so that they have sufficient energy to ionize.

50|$|The Weibel {{instability}} is a <b>plasma</b> <b>instability</b> {{present in}} homogeneous or nearly homogeneous electromagnetic plasmas which possess an anisotropy in momentum (velocity) space. This anisotropy is most generally understood as two temperatures in different directions. Burton Fried showed that this instability {{can be understood}} more simply as the superposition of many counter-streaming beams. In this sense, {{it is like the}} two-stream instability except that the perturbations are electromagnetic and result in filamentation as opposed to electrostatic perturbations which would result in charge bunching. In the linear limit the instability causes exponential growth of electromagnetic fields in the plasma which help restore momentum space isotropy. In very extreme cases, the Weibel instability is related to one- or two-dimensional stream instabilities.|$|E
