It iodine value was determine as 45. 050 gI 2 / 100 g which classified it as non-drying oil. The synthesis of surface coating driers {{was carried out by}} precipitation method using APO, palm kernel oil (PKO), sodium hydroxide, lead (II) trioxonitrate (V), cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate and anhydrous calcium chloride. The colour of lead, cobalt and calcium driers of APO and PKO were found to be yellow, purple and white respectively. The specific gravity of PKO driers were greater than those of APO driers. The <b>prepared</b> <b>driers</b> and the commercial driers were used separately in the formulation of white gloss alkyd paints and the properties of APO driers were found to b...|$|E
