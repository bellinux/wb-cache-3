40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare two methods used for {{determining}} the proper shielding of computed tomography (CT) rooms while considering recent technological advances in CT scanners. The approaches of the German Institute for Standardisation and the US National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements were compared {{and a series of}} radiation measurements were performed in several CT rooms at the Lausanne University Hospital. The following three-step procedure is proposed for assuring sufficient shielding of rooms hosting new CT units with spiral mode acquisition and various X-ray beam collimation widths: (1) calculate the ambient equivalent dose for a representative average weekly dose length product at the position where shielding is required; (2) from the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>dose</b> at the location of interest, calculate the transmission factor F that must be taken to ensure proper shielding and (3) convert the transmission factor into a thickness of lead shielding. A similar approach could be adopted to use when designing shielding for fluoroscopy rooms, where the basic quantity would be the dose area product instead of the load of current (milliampere-minute) ...|$|E

Week 52 remission, response, and mucosal healing rates were assessed in ULTRA 2 adalimumab-randomised patients who escalated to <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing.</b> Patients were stratified by week 8 response per partial Mayo score. Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analyses estimated time to <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> and defined predictors of escalation to <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing,</b> respectively.

The rate of escalation to <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> was 16. 3 % (20 / 123) for week 8 responders and 38. 4 % (48 / 125) for week 8 nonresponders. Week 52 remission, response and mucosal healing rates with <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> were 20 %, 45 %, and 45 % for week 8 responders and 2. 1 %, 25 % and 29. 2 % for nonresponders, respectively (NRI).

40|$|Intermittent {{preventive}} treatment (IPT) {{is used to}} reduce malaria morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women. IPT with the fixed dose combination of piperaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is being evaluated as a potential mass treatment to control and eliminate artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria. This study explored alternative DHA-PQ adult dosing regimens compared to the monthly adult dosing regimen currently being studied in clinical trials. A time-to-event model describing the concentration-effect relationship of preventive DHA-PQ administration was used to explore the potential clinical efficacy of once <b>weekly</b> adult <b>dosing</b> regimens. Loading dose strategies were evaluated and the advantage of <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen was tested against different degrees of adherence. Assuming perfect adherence, three tablets <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen scenarios maintained malaria incidence of 0. 2 - 0. 3 % per year, compared to 2. 1 - 2. 6 % for all monthly dosing regimen scenarios and 52 % for placebo. The three tablets <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen was also more forgiving (i. e. less sensitive to poor adherence), resulting in a predicted ∼ 4 % malaria incidence per year compared to ∼ 8 % for dosing regimen of two tablets weekly and ∼ 10 % for monthly regimens (assuming 60 % adherence and 35 % inter-individual variability). These results suggest that <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> of DHA-PQ for malaria chemoprevention would improve treatment outcomes compared to monthly administration by lowering the incidence of malaria infections, reducing safety concerns about high PQ peak plasma concentrations and being more forgiving. In addition, <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> is expected to reduce the selection pressure for PQ resistance...|$|R

40|$|A {{post hoc}} {{analysis}} of data from the adalimumab Crohn's disease (CD) maintenance trial (CHARM, NCT 00077779), examining the relationship between adalimumab dosing and maintenance of remission and response in subgroups stratified by previous anti-TNF use and baseline CRP. All patients received open-label induction (adalimumab: 80 mg, week [wk] 0; 40 mg, wk 2). At wk 4, all patients were randomized to double-blind maintenance adalimumab (40 mg weekly or every other week [eow]) or placebo for 52 weeks. In this analysis, clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and clinical response (CR- 100) at wk 26 and wk 56 by baseline CRP (high: ≥ 10 mg/L, or low: < 10 mg/L) and prior anti-TNF use were determined for patients with CR- 70 at wk 4. Of 498 patients in this analysis, 260 (52. 2 %) were anti-TNF-naïve. For anti-TNF-naïve patients, the wk 56 remission rates in the adalimumab groups were significantly greater than placebo (P < 0. 05) for both high and low CRP cohorts, with {{no statistically significant differences}} between remission rates with eow and <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> within each CRP cohort (high: 52. 8 % eow, 53. 5 % weekly; low: 34. 7 % eow, 41. 9 % weekly). For anti-TNF-exposed patients, wk 56 remission rates were higher than placebo with both eow and <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> within each cohort; <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> in the high CRP cohort and eow dosing in the low CRP cohort achieved statistical significance (P < 0. 05). In the high CRP cohort, remission rate with <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> (46. 9 %) was statistically significantly greater compared with eow dosing (22. 5 %).

Patients and Methods: CKD patients (n = 33) on regular HD therapy 3 times a week were treated for 18 months with epoetin zeta i. v. The hemoglobin levels, the <b>weekly</b> <b>dose</b> {{as well as the}} injection fre-quency of epoetin zeta were monitored at least every two weeks. Patients were followed in three time periods: 1) ex-tended follow-up (months 1 - 18); 2) intervention phase (months 19 - 21); and 3) post intervention observation phase (months 28 - 30). During extended follow-up the majority of patients (n = 21) received only one injection of epoetin zeta per week. During the intervention phase, injection frequency was increased to 3 injections per week in all patients accompanied by a reduction in <b>weekly</b> <b>doses</b> of approximately 20 %- 30 %. Following a 9 -month period of dose adjust-ment all parameters were monitored again in the post-intervention phase. Results: During the first 18 months of epoetin zeta therapy the mean hemoglobin level was stable between 11 and 12 g/dl.

40|$|Objectives: Once <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> of alendronate {{has been}} shown to provide {{equivalent}} efficacy to once daily dosing for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Whether patients will prefer <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> to daily dosing for a chronic condition such as osteoporosis has not been studied. The aim of this international study was to assess preference for the <b>weekly</b> or daily <b>dosing</b> regimen of alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: This randomised open-label crossover study was conducted at 45 study sites in 19 countries. Four hundred and six postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were assigned randomly to treatment with either alendronate 70 mg once weekly for 4 weeks followed by alendronate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks or vice versa. The main outcome was the responses of the participants to the Dosing Regimen Questionnaire administered {{at the end of the}} study. Results: Of the participants expressing a preference, 84 % preferred the once <b>weekly</b> <b>dosing</b> regimen with alendronate to the once daily dosing regimen. In addition, the once weekly regimen was considered by 87 % of the participants to be more convenient and was the regimen most of the participants (84 %) would be more willing to take for a long period of time (P< 0. 001 for each parameter). Conclusions: The majority of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis preferred the once weekly to the once daily dosing regimen of alendronate. Physicians should consider patient preference for dosing regimen when selecting the appropriate treatment for osteoporosis. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
