We have cloned cDNA coding for a transcription factor (REST) that binds to this silencer element. Expression of a recombinant REST protein confers the ability to silence type II reporter genes in neuronal cell types lacking the native REST protein, whereas expression of a dominant negative form of REST in nonneuronal cells relieves silencing mediated by the native <b>protein.</b> <b>REST</b> transcripts in developing mouse embryos are detected ubiquitously outside of the nervous system.

40|$|The neuron-restrictive {{silencer}} element (NRSE) {{has been}} identified in several neuronal genes and confers neuron specificity by silencing transcription in nonneuronal cells. NRSE {{is present in the}} promoter of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β 2 -subunit gene that determines its neuron-specific expression in the nervous system. Using transgenic mice, we show that NRSE may either silence or enhance transcription depending on the cellular context within the nervous system. In vitro in neuronal cells, NRSE activates transcription of synthetic promoters when located downstream in the 5 ′ untranslated region, or at less than 50 bp upstream from the TATA box, but switches to a silencer when located further upstream. In contrast, in nonneuronal cells NRSE always functions as a silencer.

In an effort to obtain a statistically meaningful set of time traces that simultaneously avoid any experimental artifacts, we performed quantum-dot labeled kinesin experiments on both surface and levitated microtubules. Similar to glassy systems, we found that mean velocities of individual kinesin motors vary widely from one motor to another, the variation of which is greater than that expected from the stochastic variation of stepping times. In the presence of heterogeneity, an ensemble-averaged quantity such as diffusion constant or randomness parameter is ill-defined.

40|$|AbstractUsing {{a genetic}} screen to {{identify}} genes that carry out redundant functions during development with lin- 35 /Rb, the C. elegans Retinoblastoma family ortholog, {{we have identified}} a mutation in spr- 1. spr- 1 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of human CoREST, a protein containing Myb-like SANT and ELM 2 domains, which functions {{as part of a}} transcriptional regulatory complex. CoREST recruits mediators of transcriptional repression, including histone deacetylase, and demethylase, and interacts with the tumor suppression <b>protein</b> <b>REST.</b> spr- 1 /CoREST was previously shown in C. elegans to suppress defects associated with loss of the presenilin sel- 12, which functions in the proteolytic processing of LIN- 12 /Notch. Here we show that lin- 35 and spr- 1 coordinately regulate several developmental processes in C. elegans including the ingression of vulval cells as well as germline proliferation. We also show that loss of lin- 35 and spr- 1 hypersensitizes animals to a reduction in LIN- 12 /Notch activity, leading to the generation of proximal germline tumors. This defect, which is observed in lin- 35; spr- 1; lin- 12 (RNAi) and lin- 35; spr- 1; hop- 1 (RNAi) triple mutants is likely due to a delay in the entry of germ cells into meiosis...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic {{technologies}} {{enable the}} manipulation and observation of circuits controlling behavior by permitting expression of genetically encoded reporter genes in neurons. Frequently though, neuronal expression {{is accompanied by}} transgene expression in non-neuronal tissues, which may preclude key experimental manipulations, including assessment of the contribution of neurons to behavior by ablation. To better restrict transgene expression to the nervous system in zebrafish larvae, we have used DNA sequences derived from the neuron-restrictive silencing element (NRSE). We find that one such sequence, REx 2, when {{used in conjunction with}} several basal promoters, robustly suppresses transgene expression in non-neuronal tissues. Both in transient transgenic experiments and in stable enhancer trap lines, suppression is achieved without compromising expression within the nervous system. Furthermore, in REx 2 enhancer trap lines non-neuronal expression can be de-repressed by knocking down expression of the NRSE binding <b>protein</b> <b>Rest.</b> In one line, we show that the resulting pattern of reporter gene expression coincides with that of the adjacent endogenous gene, hapln 3. We demonstrate that three common basal promoters are susceptible to the effects of the REx 2 element, suggesting that this method may be useful for confining expression from many other promoters to the nervous system. This technique enables neural specific targeting of reporter genes and thus will facilitate the use of transgenic methods to manipulate circuit function in freely behaving larvae...|$|E
40|$|Amino acids (AAs) {{derived from}} {{hydrolysis}} of <b>protein</b> <b>rest</b> streams are interesting feedstocks for {{the chemical industry}} due to their functionality. However, separation of AAs is required {{before they can be}} used for further applications. Electrodialysis may be applied to separate AAs, but its efficiency is limited when separating AAs with similar isoelectric points. To aid the separation, specific conversion of an AA to a useful product with different charge behavior to the remaining compounds is desired. Here the separation of L-aspartic acid (Asp) and L-glutamic acid (Glu) was studied. L-Glutamate a-decarboxylase (GAD, Type I, EC 4. 1. 1. 15) was applied to specifically convert Glu into c-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA has a different charge behavior from Asp therefore allowing a potential separation by electrodialysis. Competitive inhibition and reduced operational stability caused by Asp could be eliminated by maintaining a sufficiently high concentration of Glu. Immobilization of GAD does not reduce the enzyme’s initial activity. However, the operational stability was slightly reduced. An initial study on the reaction operating in a continuous mode was performed using a column reactor packed with immobilized GAD. As the reaction mixture was only passed once through the reactor, the conversion of Glu was lower than expected. To complete the conversion of Glu, the stream containing Asp and unreacted Glu might be recirculated back to the reactor after GABA has been removed. Overall, the reaction by GAD is specific to Glu and can be applied to aid the electrodialysis separation of Asp and Glu...|$|E

In our recent works, we demonstrated the high performance of mouse neonate pancreas extract (MPE) in production of functional IPCs from carcinoma stem cells. In this study, MPE was used to generate IPCs from MSCs without any genetic manipulation. To this end, bone marrow MSCs were isolated and characterized. In order to differentiate, MSCs were induced by selection of nestin-expressing cells and treatment with 100 [*]µg/ml MPE. Morphological features of the differentiated cells were confirmed by dithizone staining. Immunoreactivity to insulin receptor beta, proinsulin, insulin and C-peptide was observed by immunoflourescence. We also quantified glucose-dependent insulin production and secretion by ELISA. Real-time PCR indicated the expressions of β cell related genes, PDX- 1, INS 1, INS 2, EP 300 and CREB 1 in IPC cells. Possible pathways governed by CREB 1, EP 300, and PDX- 1 transcription factors in differentiation of MSCs to IPCs were determined based on Gene Set Enrichment (GSE) approach at p[*]=[*] 0. 05. Pathway discovery highlighted the negative regulatory effects of MIR 124 - 2, HDAC 5 <b>protein,</b> <b>REST</b> and NR 0 B 2 transcription factors on expression of CREB 1, EP 300, and PDX- 1 and inhabitation of IPC differentiations.

40|$|Islet-brain 1 (IB 1) is {{the human}} and rat {{homologue}} of JIP- 1, a scaffold protein interacting with the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). IB 1 expression is mostly restricted to the endocrine pancreas and to the central nervous system. Herein, we explored the transcriptional mechanism responsible for this preferential islet and neuronal expression of IB 1. A 731 -bp fragment of the 5 ′ regulatory region of the human MAPK 8 IP 1 gene was isolated from a human BAC library and cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. This construct drove high transcriptional activity in both insulin-secreting and neuron-like cells but not in unrelated cell lines. Sequence analysis of this promoter region revealed {{the presence of a}} neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) known to bind repressor zinc finger <b>protein</b> <b>REST.</b> This factor is not expressed in insulin-secreting and neuron-like cells. By mobility shift assay, we confirmed that REST binds to the NRSE present in the IB 1 promoter. Once transiently transfected in β-cell lines, the expression vector encoding REST repressed IB 1 transcriptional activity. The introduction of a mutated NRSE in the 5 ′ regulating region of the IB 1 gene abolished the repression activity driven by REST in insulin-secreting β cells and relieved the low transcriptional activity of IB 1 observed in unrelated cells. Moreover, transfection in non-β and nonneuronal cell lines of an expression vector encoding REST lacking its transcriptional repression domain relieved IB 1 promoter activity. Last, the REST-mediated repression of IB 1 could be abolished by trichostatin A, indicating that deacetylase activity is required to allow REST repression. Taken together, these data establish a critical role for REST in the control of the tissue-specific expression of the human IB 1 gene...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were to examine how {{proteins}} in barley are degraded during the beer brewing process and if the protein content in the final beer product differ if the barley is sown in different locations and with different amount of nitrogen in fertilization. The proteins extractability was also followed through the beer brewing process. The beers were brewed in a pilot brewery and were analyzed with SE-HPLC. Certain beer proteins {{have been shown to}} influence the beer foam and haze formation and since consumers rely much on their visual impression {{it is important for the}} breweries that the beer has a stable foam and no haze formation. Two albumins in beer have been associated with beer foam formation; protein Z and lipid transfer protein 1 (LTP 1), while it is proline-rich proteins which has been shown to influence the beer haze formation. The results showed that all the polymeric proteins were degraded into monomeric proteins during the brewing process; in the final beer product 70 % of the proteins were small monomeric proteins and the rest was large monomeric proteins. The unextractable proteins were transformed extractable to some extent during malting and mashing and the unextractable proteins left in the wort after mashing were removed during lautering.

PDHt and PDK activities, and their respective protein and mRNA expression, did not differ after 1 week of aerobic training.

40|$|Free amino {{nitrogen}} (FAN) levels in sorghum grain brewing are characteristically low {{as a direct}} consequence of the very low levels of FAN in unmalted sorghum grain. During fermentation, FAN provides nutritional support to the yeast, enabling optimal yeast growth and efficient fermentation. Exogenous proteolytic enzymes are required to hydrolyse sorghum grain protein into FAN. Eight commercial proteolytic enzymes were studied in terms of their efficacy to produce FAN levels during mashing considered adequate (150 mg/L) to support optimal yeast functionality and their effect on extract levels. FAN as determined by the ninhydrin assay, ranged between 25 - 72 mg/ 100 g sorghum grist (representing 0 %- 185 % increase) when mashing was carried out at 55 °C over 45 mins with the 8 different enzymes. The proteolytic enzymes varied greatly in terms of their efficacy, possibly as a result of having different optimal operating conditions. It is also suggested that the proteolytic enzymes differed in terms of their classification and exopeptidase/endopeptidase ratio. In an attempt to further increase FAN levels, the effects of the reducing agent potassium metabisulphite (KMS) and different mashing temperatures (50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C) were also studied. Three enzymes (Flavourzyme, Neutrase, Papain) were selected for this part of the study. The addition of KMS caused {{a significant increase in the}} FAN in mashing systems that utilized Flavourzyme (22 % when mashing at 55 °C) and Neutrase (14 % when mashing at 55 °C), but not with Papain. It is suggested that KMS reduced the stabilizing disulphide bonds present in the sorghum kafirin, thus making the kafirin more digestible. The KMS could have reduced the effectiveness of Papain because it is a sulphydryl protease which possesses stabilizing disulphide bonds which were reduced by the KMS. Flavourzyme and Papain were more active at 55 °C, while Neutrase displayed maximum activity at 50 °C. The effect of mashing at a low temperature (40 °C) over an extended time period (7 hr) on FAN was studied using Flavourzyme. Samples treated with Flavourzyme and KMS showed a five-fold increase in FAN, while those treated with Flavourzyme only showed a four-fold increase. It is proposed that the low temperature was able to suppress the rate at which disulphide bonds were formed in kafirin, therefore improving its digestibility. The lower temperature also retarded the enzyme denaturation rate, while the long time period allowed the enzyme more contact time with the substrate. Microstructure analysis of sorghum protein bodies using transmission electron microscopy and of sorghum endosperm using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the relative indigestibility of kafirin makes a significant contribution to the relatively low FAN levels. Although the action of the proteolytic enzyme and KMS on the sorghum endosperm protein matrix showed notable degradation, large fragments of undigested protein bodies were observed. This once again suggested that disulphide bond cross-linking played a major role in reducing the digestibility of sorghum protein. The addition of Flavourzyme to a complete mashing cycle was also found to result in a significant increase (9 %) in extract. The ncrease in extract is attributed to the increased availability of starch to amylase hydrolysis as a result of the degradation of the protein matrix which envelopes the starch granules. The addition of KMS to the sorghum grain mashing system and the utilisation of a low temperature <b>protein</b> <b>rest</b> are effective methods of improving FAN in sorghum grain brewing.

The key role of these partners comes to pass in many cellular processes such as signalization, regulation of a cell cycle and division, apoptosis and others. This thesis deals with the interaction of 14 - 3 - 3 protein with fosfatidylinositol 4 -kinase IIIβ on a molecular level using the method of X-ray crystallography. Phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase IIIβ (PtdIns 4 KIIIβ) situated on a cytosol side of mostly Golgi aparatus membranes catalyses the connection of a phosphate group to the fourth carbon of an inositol circle. The activity of PtdIns 4 KIIIβ depends upon the phosphorylation of Ser 294. Not only this phosphorylation increases the kinase activity PtdIns 4 KIIIβ, but is the condition of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins binding as well. This interaction provides the protection of PtdIns 4 KIIIβ against dephosphorylation and this way it guarantees continual synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate, a major signalization molecule and the precursor of other phosphate derivatives of phosphatidylinositol.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study has}} been made of the N-terminal amino acid pattern of human plasma {{proteins}} under normal and pathological conditions. The normal pattern shows the following N-terminal amino acids in order of diminishing quantifies: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, alanine, tyrosine, leucines, and glycine. In healthy individuals this pattern is qualitatively stable with moderate quantitative differences between individuals. On the other hand radical quantitative changes in the pattern have been observed under pathological conditions. Present classification of plasma <b>proteins</b> <b>rests</b> almost entirely on physicochemical properties; i. e., electrophoretic mobility and sedimentation rate. This is a natural consequence of the fact that until recently only the physicochemical methods were sufficiently perfected to offer a useful means of classification.

Thus it is now entirely feasible to identify a protein through a certain structural feature, e. g. a terminal amino acid sequence, or less rigorously, a terminal amino acid(s).

Here, we found that REST can activate DYRK 1 A transcription via a neuron-restrictive silencer element at bp − 833 to − 815 of human DYRK 1 A promoter. The coordinated expression of DYRK 1 A and REST in mouse brain further supports the cross-interaction of DYRK 1 A and REST during neurodevelopment. Moreover, we showed that DYRK 1 A dosage imbalance reduced <b>REST</b> <b>protein</b> stability and transcriptional activity through facilitating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of <b>REST</b> <b>protein.</b> Therefore, the regulation of DYRK 1 A by REST in a negative feedback loop suggests that DYRK 1 A and REST are closely related in neurodevelopment...|$|R
40|$|Here we have {{investigated}} the regulation of TNF-alpha expression in macrophages during HSV- 2 infection. Despite a low basal level of TNF-alpha mRNA present in resting macrophages, no TNF-alpha protein is detectable. HSV- 2 infection marginally increases the level of TNF-alpha mRNA and <b>protein</b> in <b>resting</b> macrophages, whereas a strong increase is observed in IFN-gamma-activated cells infected with the virus. By reporter gene assay {{it was found that}} HSV infection augments TNF-alpha promoter activity. Moreover, treatment of the cells with actinomycin D, which totally blocked mRNA synthesis, only partially prevented accumulation of TNF-alpha protein, indicating that the infection lifts a block on translation of TNF-alpha mRNA.

40|$|Two genes {{encoding}} {{for late}} embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs) {{are expressed in}} encysted diapausing embryos (or resting eggs) of rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis O. F. Müller) and females forming them. The two genes (bpa-leaa and bpa-leab) share approximately 50 % of their nucleotides sequence, and bpa-leaa is more than twofold longer than bpa-leab. The deduced amino acid sequences show high abundance of alanine, glycine, lysine, and glutamic acid; a hydropathy index of lower than one; and a relatively high (81 – 82 %) predicted probability of forming alpha-helices in their secondary structure, {{all of which are}} character-istic features of LEAs. The predicted molecular masses of bpa-LEAA (; 67 kDa) and bpa-LEAB (; 27 kDa) are similar to the molecular mass determined by Western-blot analyses, suggest-ing a low probability of posttranslational modifications. In silico analysis reveals that the two LEAs resemble group 3 LEAs based on the repeats for 11 mer motifs, although they also display several putative amino acids typical of the 20 mer motif of group 1 LEAs. The rotifer LEAs do not contain a predicted target sequence and are more likely localized in the cytosol. LEAs were expressed in resting eggs and females producing them, but not in other female forms or males. LEA transcripts and proteins are degraded during hatching, suggesting that LEAs are develop-mentally programmed during resting egg formation and hatch-ing. LEAs probably equip the resting eggs to withstand desiccation if that occurs during dormancy. The present study expands our knowledge about the biological pathways associat-ed with formation of rotifer resting eggs and also demonstrates the occurrence of LEAs in dormant, nondesiccated, encysted animal embryos. developmentally programmed, diapause, dormancy, embryo, encysted diapausing embryos, gamete biology, LEA <b>proteins,</b> <b>resting</b> eggs, rotifer...|$|R
