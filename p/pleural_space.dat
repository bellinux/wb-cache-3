5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} cavity is the space inside the chest {{that contains the}} lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> Despite the low pressure in the <b>pleural</b> <b>space,</b> air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> produce gas.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

50|$|Hours to days later, pleural effusion(s) with {{or without}} pneumothorax, widened mediastinum, and {{subcutaneous}} emphysema are typically seen. CT scan may show esophageal wall edema and thickening, extraesophageal air, periesophageal fluid {{with or without}} gas bubbles, mediastinal widening, and air and fluid in the <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces,</b> retroperitoneum or lesser sac.|$|R
40|$|The roentgenologic {{signs of}} free {{air in the}} subcutaneous, mediastinal <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> may be {{indicative}} of fractures of the trachea and bronchi and injuries to the larynx. While these findings are also present in otherwise uncomplicated rib fracture and following tracheostomy, {{care must be taken}} {{to make sure that the}} cause of these abnormalities is not an unrecognized bronchial or tracheal rupture...|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>space),</b> pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
30|$|RTMUS is a {{technique}} that permits willing but inexperienced personnel to perform accurate POC ultrasound examinations {{on behalf of a}} remote expert. The critical requirement to enable this is Internet connectivity and a willing remote expert, as the technical requirements are otherwise modest. With this concept, nurses can examine the <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> to detect post-TT removal pneumothoraces. However, many other forms of POC ultrasound examinations could also be performed as dictated by the clinical situation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to causing some cases of abortion in cattle and sheep, C. fetus is an opportunistic human pathogen {{and can cause}} bacteremia and thrombophlebitis. Though rare, C. fetus can lead to fatal septicemia in newborns and immunocompromised individuals. C. fetus, along with C. coli, {{has been shown to}} cause septicemia. Bacteremia can lead to localized infections of the meninges in the brain, the respiratory <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> or lungs, joints, the pericardial sac around the heart, or the peritoneum.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Residual pleural {{cavities}} are <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> {{caused by}} a lack of pulmonary reexpansion mainly secondary to pleural infections or thoracic surgeries. If they can not be solved with first line treatments (thoracic drainage, fibrinolytics or surgical decortication), these can become cronic and complicate. Material and Methods: Retrospective descriptive study of patients with complicated residual pleural cavities at the Thoracic Surgery Service of the “Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete” from November 2004 to May 2015. Results: Sixty-three patients were diagnosed, showing that incidence was more frequent in men (n= 57; 90. 5...|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the <b>pleural</b> <b>space,</b> or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E

30|$|Herniation of {{abdominal}} organs or peritoneal fat {{into the}} <b>pleural</b> or pericardial <b>space.</b>|$|R
30|$|At {{the present}} time, the EFAST {{examination}} {{is able to}} identify previously undetected pneumothoraces after injury in our sickest patients. The question remains though, how does this help them? Are occult pneumothoraces important or will we injure more patients by acting on this information and draining all the <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> concerned? Only well constructed and conducted prospective research appropriately related to the overall clinical needs of the patient can answer this [13]. Until these results are available, however, we would suggest that awareness {{and respect for the}} power of ultrasound as knowledge rather than ignorance of the unknown are the first and hopeful step in understanding.|$|R
40|$|Is {{this really}} pneumothorax? A 75 -year-old female non-smoker was {{admitted}} for investiga-tion of suspected interstitial lung disease. A left lower lobe {{transbronchial lung biopsy}} was performed, complicated by suspected bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum and surgical emphysema (fig 1). Bilateral intercostal catheters (ICCs) were inserted. In view of the ongoing air leak and worsening surgical emphysema, a CT chest was undertaken. This was suspicious of extrapleural air leak. Following cardiothoracic consultation, video assisted thoracic surgery was performed which confirmed obliterated <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> bilaterally with extrapleural air leak, as shown in fig 2. Bilateral ICCs were inserted into the air filled extrapleural space with dramatic reduction in surgical emphysema. The patient declined further invasive investigations...|$|R
25|$|The {{elephant}} is {{the only}} mammal known to have no <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> Rather, the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective tissue. This lack of a <b>pleural</b> <b>space,</b> along with an unusually thick diaphragm, {{are thought to be}} evolutionary adaptations allowing the elephant to remain underwater {{for long periods of time}} while breathing through its trunk which emerges as a snorkel.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} and earliest {{procedure was}} to introduce {{air into the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> so as to collapse the affected lung and therefore the open cavity. There was always spontaneous resolution of the pneumothorax and the procedure had to be repeated every few weeks.|$|E
25|$|A high amylase level (twice the {{serum level}} or the {{absolute}} value is greater than 160 Somogy units) in the pleural fluid is indicative of either acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst that has dissected or ruptured into the <b>pleural</b> <b>space,</b> cancer or esophageal rupture.|$|E
50|$|The {{placement}} {{technique for}} postoperative drainage (e.g. cardiac surgery) {{differs from the}} technique used for emergency situations. At the completion of open cardiac procedures, chest tubes are placed through separate stab incisions, typically near the inferior aspect of the sternotomy incision. In some instances multiple drains {{may be used to}} evacuate the mediastinal, pericardial, and <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces.</b> The drainage holes are placed inside the patient and the chest tube is passed out through the incision. Once the tube is in place, it is sutured to the skin to prevent movement. The chest tube is then connected to the drainage canister using additional tubing and connectors and connected to a suction source, typically regulated to -20 cm of water.|$|R
30|$|After stabilisation, {{a volume}} of 75  mL/kg {{temperate}} vegetable oil was installed equally into both <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces.</b> The piglets then stabilised for 30  min before PLE readings and were randomly assigned in a 2 : 2 : 1 allocation ratio into three groups using www.randomization.com: a fluid loading group (n =  12) received continuous infusion of Lactated Ringer’s solution (80  mL/kg/h) persisting in six 15 -min intervals, a norepinephrine group (n =  12) treated with incremental infusion rates in six intervals of 15  min each (0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3  μg/kg/min) and a control group (n =  6) with no further intervention. PLE was evacuated in all groups, at which point fluid loading was discontinued whereas norepinephrine infusion continued at the maximal infusion rate. The final data point was obtained 30  min after evacuation.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a person}} speaks, the vocal cords create {{vibrations}} (vocal fremitus) in the tracheobronchial tree {{and through the}} lungs and chest wall, {{where they can be}} felt (tactile fremitus). [...] This is usually assessed with the healthcare provider placing the flat of their palms on the chest wall and then asking a patient to repeat a diphthong such as [...] "blue balloons" [...] or [...] "toys for tots" [...] (the original diphthong used was the German word Neunundneunzig but the translation to the English 'ninety nine' was not a diphthong and thus not as effective in eliciting fremitus). An increase in tactile fremitus indicates denser or inflamed lung tissue, which can be caused by diseases such as pneumonia. A decrease suggests air or fluid in the <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> or a decrease in lung tissue density, which can be caused by diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.|$|R
25|$|When {{cardiopulmonary}} {{status is}} compromised (i.e. when the fluid or air has its repercussions on {{the function of}} heart and lungs), due to air (significant pneumothorax), fluid (pleural fluid) or blood (hemothorax) outside the lung, then this procedure is usually replaced with tube thoracostomy, the placement of a large tube in the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|Decubitus – taken {{while the}} patient is lying down, {{typically}} on his side. useful for differentiating pleural effusions from consolidation (e.g. pneumonia) and loculated effusions from free fluid in the <b>pleural</b> <b>space.</b> In effusions, the fluid layers out (by comparison to an up-right view, when it often accumulates in the costophrenic angles).|$|E
500|$|They may be {{classified}} as [...] "open" [...] or [...] "closed". In an open pneumothorax there is a passage from the external environment into the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> through the chest wall. When air is drawn into the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> through this passageway it {{is known as a}} sucking chest wound. [...] A closed pneumothorax is when the chest wall remains intact.|$|E
30|$|After {{anaesthesia}} induction and instrumentation, bilateral thoracotomies {{were performed}} in the fifth intercostal space exposing the interlobar fissures. A CMA 63 microdialysis catheter (CMA Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with a molecular weight cut-off of 20  kDa, an outer diameter of 0.6  mm and a membrane length of 30  mm was used. Four microdialysis catheters were inserted, in the right upper and lower and the left upper and lower lobes using an introducer needle under direct vision. Bioglue (Coseal surgical sealant, Cohesion technologies, US) was applied at the lung puncture site to minimise catheter movement post-insertion. An intercostal catheter was inserted {{in each of the}} <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces</b> and low-pressure suction applied, and the thoracotomy incisions will be closed. An intravascular microdialysis catheter, CMA 64 (CMA Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with a molecular weight cut-off 20  kDa and a membrane length of 20  mm, was inserted in the left jugular vein through a percutaneously inserted 18 G cannula (B. Braun Australia Pty Ltd., Bella Vista, Australia).|$|R
30|$|Intraoperative transesophageal {{echocardiography}} is a minimally invasive monitoring tool {{that can provide}} real-time visual information on ventricular function and hemodynamic volume status in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases states that {{transesophageal echocardiography}} {{should be used in}} all liver transplant candidates in order to assess chamber sizes, hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic function, valvular function, and left ventricle outflow tract obstruction. However, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can be used to “visualize” other organs too; thanks to its proximity and access to multiple acoustic windows: liver, lung, spleen, and kidney. Although only limited scientific evidence exists promoting this comprehensive use, we describe the feasibility of TEE in the setting of liver transplantation: it is a highly valuable tool, not only as a cardiovascular monitoring, but also as a tool to evaluate lungs and <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces,</b> to assess hepatic vein blood flow and inferior vena cava anastomosis and patency, i.e., in cases of modified surgical techniques. The aim of this case series is to add our own experience of TEE as a comprehensive intraoperative monitoring tool in the field of orthotopic liver transplantation (and major liver resection) to the literature.|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} used in cardiothoracic {{surgical}} procedures like coronary artery bypass surgery, heart valve replacement and repair surgery or Ventricular Assist Device surgery to improve the evacuation of post-surgical blood from the pericardial and <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces.</b> The catheter system includes a chest tube and an internal clearance apparatus that allows clinicians to clear away obstructions that can form inside {{as a result of}} blood clotting. The clearance apparatus uses a wire with a loop that is magnetically coupled to an external handle to allow the obstructions to be cleared without breaking the sterile environment. If these obstructions are not cleared away, they can cause chest tube clogging, which can prevent fluid from draining and cause such clinical complications as pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, pleural effusions, and increased mortality. Conventional techniques to clear these obstructions, including chest tube milking and stripping, have not been shown to be effective. They also significantly increase negative intrathoracic pressures that can harm internal structures and potentially impair post-operative recovery. To combat the suboptimal methods of responding to chest tube clogging, many surgeons employ large-diameter chest tubes though they are thought to be associated with more pain.|$|R
500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of oral surgery, laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a pneumonectomy, in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the <b>pleural</b> <b>space</b> through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are air driven. [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the crepitus (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E
500|$|The {{size of the}} {{pneumothorax}} (i.e. {{the volume}} of air in the <b>pleural</b> <b>space)</b> can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring {{the distance between the}} chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed {{at the level of the}} hilum (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex (top) of the lung with 3cm differentiating between a [...] "small" [...] and a [...] "large" [...] pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly, but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.|$|E

40|$|Asbestos {{bodies are}} the {{histological}} hallmarks of asbestos exposure. Both conventional and advanced techniques {{are used to}} evaluate abundance and composition in histological samples. We previously reported {{the possibility of using}} synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) for analyzing the chemical composition of asbestos bodies directly in lung tissue samples. Here we applied a high-performance synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) set-up that could allow new protocols for fast monitoring of the occurrence of asbestos bodies in large histological sections, improving investigation of the related chemical changes. A combination of synchrotron X-ray transmission and fluorescence microscopy techniques at different energies at three distinct synchrotrons was used to characterize asbestos in paraffinated lung tissues. The fast chemical imaging of the XFM beamline (Australian Synchrotron) demonstrates that asbestos bodies can be rapidly and efficiently identified as co-localization of high calcium and iron, the most abundant elements of these formations inside tissues (Fe up to 10 % w/w; Ca up to 1 %). By following iron presence, we were also able to hint at small asbestos fibers in <b>pleural</b> <b>spaces.</b> XRF at lower energy and at higher spatial resolution was afterwards performed to better define small fibers. These analyses may predispose for future protocols to be set with laboratory instruments...|$|R
30|$|Once such {{a system}} has been {{constructed}} to transmit {{from the site of}} the patient as a ‘package’ delivered over VOIP, the receiving station may be as varied as there are computer or smartphone devices that will support a particular VOIP software. This freedom allows the remote mentor {{to be able to use}} any of their desktop computer, laptops, or smart devices such as smartphones or tablet-type devices. For example, a video call was initiated by the user in Calgary, Canada to a panel of remote experts in Aberdeen, Scotland. The senders were connected to a 3 [*]G network, facilitated by the use of a ‘dongle/rocket stick’ (Rocket Mobile Internet Stick, Nokia Corp., Keilaniemi, Finland) to facilitate the connections between the laptops. A rocket stick is essentially a device that allows the laptop to connect to the internet through the same way your smartphone does when not connected to Wifi. Your smartphone and tablet computers normally have this built in, and you can in fact use some mobiles themselves as a ‘rocket stick’.
