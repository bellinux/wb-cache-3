40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the status of electronic data processing services and/or functions in the public schools of Indiana. To provide additional insight to the organizational structure of a data processing center, four existing regional data processing centers serving a group of school districts in adjoining states through a centrally located computer facility were examined. The procedures used in collecting and analyzing the data for the study included the following: (1) appropriate data gathering instruments were designed, (2) a questionnaire accompanied by a cover letter explaining the {{purpose of the}} study was mailed to each superintendent of all school corporations in Indiana, (3) a personal interview was conducted with the administrative personnel directly responsible for the operation of each of the four selected regional data processing centers, (3) data obtained from the questionnaire and the personal interview were compiled, tabulated, analyzed, and presented, and (4) the findings, conclusions and recommendations for further study were presented. The superintendents were asked to respond to the question, "Do you presently utilize data processing (computer and <b>punch</b> <b>card)</b> <b>equipment</b> in any part of the operation and/or administration of your school district?" Those school administrators responding "YES" were then asked to indicate those services and functions which were accomplished in their school corporation, to indicate the method of obtaining data processing services and to indicate methods. All of the superintendents were asked to indicate their future plans for the use of data processing services in their local school corporation(s). The systematic analysis of the procedures necessary for implementing educational data processing services to a group of school districts in adjoining states included the following elements: (1) background information, (2) objectives, (3) historical development, (4) equipment, (5) personnel, (6) services and/or functions, (7) orientation procedures, (8) advantages of a central computer facility, (9) disadvantages of a central computer facility, and (10) future plans. The findings indicated the following major general conclusions to be appropriate the level of their satisfaction with both services. There has been only limited development toward the organization of educational data processing systems throughout the state of Indiana. This situation lends itself to collective exploration by interested school administrators toward cooperative arrangements of obtaining data processing services, regardless of the size of the school district. Qualified and competent personnel must be responsible for the operation of the data processing center. The director of the data processing center should be totally familiar with all facets of school administration so that he may use electronic data processing services to facilitate the instructional program. A central computer facility organized to provide electronic data processing services to a group of school districts is capable of supporting the more sophisticated computer equipment at a reduction in cost, provided the equipment is operating at a near capacity work load. It is possible for a group of school districts to benefit from the developmental experience of existing data processing centers. The amount of time once considered necessary to progress from feasibility of operation to full-scale implementation has been greatly reduced by administrators' capitalizing on the systematic developments of existing regional data processing centers. School districts involved in data processing can benefit from the efforts of an administrative officer whose function is to systematically analyze administrative operations. This individual is referred to as a systems analyst or operations analyst. Teleprocessing has great potential for providing electronic data processing services to school districts regardless of size. Teleprocessing provides school administrators with direct access to sophisticated electronic data processing equipment and computer programs which have been successfully developed and implemented in other school districts. The Indiana Department of Education should assume the leadership in establishing regional service centers throughout Indiana to provide comprehensive educational data processing services to local school districts. Colleges and universities should serve as a catalyst of ideas for the intelligent use of electronic data processing services to perform administrative and instructional functions. Thesis (D.

In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. He {{may be considered}} the first computer scientist and information theorist, for, among other reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he released his simplified arithmometer, {{which was the first}} calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and [...] "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer". [...] "A crucial step was the adoption of a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> system derived from the Jacquard loom" [...] making it infinitely programmable. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first computer program. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>equipment</b> and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit.
