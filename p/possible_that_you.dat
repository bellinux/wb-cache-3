2500|$|On October 2, 2016 at a {{press conference}} at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that the {{anonymous}} drug test in 2003 were inconclusive because [...] "it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program." [...] Manfred argued that [...] "it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were not a positive". Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on [...] "leaks, rumors, innuendo, [...] not confirmed positive test results". Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many [...] "legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, {{an event}} which {{signaled}} {{the start of}} relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as [...] "writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism". At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu [...] "played along", transforming himself from a [...] "not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue" [...] into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was [...] "joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always knew, just like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant he was (or appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines". During a 2004 interview, reflecting {{on the value of}} literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: [...] "Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, how was it <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wrote so badly in the years of dogmatism?'. 'Forget that, dear—he would say—the problem is that I couldn't tell I was writing badly'." ...|$|E
