40|$|The {{interaction}} of plan geometry and structural configuration, a determinative {{factor in the}} earthquake behavior of buildings, has become a serious issue in the building industry in Turkey due to the poor seismic performance of R/C buildings during the latest earthquake. Consequently, designing new buildings without structural irregularities against earthquake loads {{is proving to be}} more significant. This study focuses on the effects of plan geometries on earthquake performances of buildings. In that respect, structural irregularities in the plan are investigated in detail based on the Turkish Earthquake Code (TEC 2007). The study is based on five main parametric models and a total of 40 sub-models that are grouped according to their plan geometries with excessive projections such as L-shaped, H-shaped, T-shaped and U-shaped models. In addition to these, a square model without any projections is also generated. All models are designed to have the same storey gross area but with different number of storeys. Changes in the earthquake behavior of buildings were evaluated according to the number of storeys, the <b>projection</b> <b>ratios</b> and the symmetry conditions of each model. The analysis of each structural irregularity resulted in many findings, which were then assessed.

In {{addition to}} traditional professional measuring instruments, smartphone-based methods {{have been used to}} measure forest LAI. However, when smartphone methods were used to measure conifer forest LAI, very different performances were obtained depending on whether the smartphone was held at the zenith angle or at a 57. 5 ° angle. To further validate the potential of smartphone sensors for measuring conifer LAI and to find the limits of this method, this paper reports the results of a comparison of two smartphone methods with an LAI- 2000 instrument. It is shown that the method with the smartphone oriented vertically upwards always produced better consistency in magnitude with LAI- 2000. The bias of the LAI between the smartphone method and the LAI- 2000 instrument was explained with regards to four aspects that can affect LAI: gap fraction; leaf projection ratio; sensor field of view (FOV); and viewing zenith angle (VZA). It was concluded that large FOV and large VZA cause the 57. 5 ° method to overestimate the gap fraction and hence underestimate conifer LAI. For the vertically upward method, the bias caused by the overestimated gap fraction is compensated for by an underestimated leaf <b>projection</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{partitioning}} is {{a design}} technique {{for reducing the}} number of disk accesses to execute a given set of queries by minimizing the number of irrelevant instance variables accessed. This is accomplished by grouping the frequently accessed instance variables as vertical class fragments. The complexity of object-oriented database models due to subclass hierarchy and class composition hierarchy complicates the definition and representation of vertical partitioning of the classes, which makes the problem of vertical partitioning in OODBs very challenging. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive analytical cost model for processing of queries on vertically partitioned OODB classes. A set of analytical evaluation results is presented to show the effect of vertical partitioning, and to study the trade-off between <b>projection</b> <b>ratio</b> vs. selectivity factor vis-a-vis sequential vs. index access.

The main processing steps include image enhancement, "ncorrection of varying illumination effect, automatic facial skin detection, automatic feature extraction, facial measurements and surgery analysis. For quantitative analysis of nose surgery, we randomly selected 100 patients from the database provided by the ENT division of Imam Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The frontal and profile images of these patients before and after rhinoplasty were available for experiments. For statistical analysis of nasal two clinical parameters, i. e., Nasolabial Angle and Nasal <b>Projection</b> <b>ratio</b> are computed.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine pre-operative or intra-operative risk factors for cut-out failure of lag screws in unstable, intertrochanteric fractures fixed with short Gamma 3 nails. Methods: One hundred and seventy-six patients over 60 years of age, with unstable intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA 31 -A 2, 31 -A 3) treated with short Gamma 3 nails were included in this study. All patients completed a minimum of 1 -year follow-up. Analysis of post-operative radiographs included assessment for cut-out failure of lag screw, appropriateness of the entry point, posterior lag screw axis, fracture gaps, posterior displacement of the proximal fragment, and tip-apex distance. Results: Of the 176 patients in this study, 22 patients were identified with cut-out failure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that improper entry point in an antero-posterior <b>projection</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 10. 39, 95 % confidence interval 1. 74 – 78. 4), posterior displacement distance of the proximal fragment in a lateral <b>projection</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 1. 35, 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 – 1. 59), and female sex (odds ratio 17. 14, 95 % confidence interval 1. 88 – 876. 11) were correlated with cut-out failure. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of an optimal position of reduction in the lateral projection in reducing the risk of cut-out failure.

The criterion is defined as the weighted <b>ratio</b> of two <b>projections.</b> The <b>ratio</b> is computed on a pixel per pixel basis and weighting is performed by setting the ratios between one and zero pixels to a standard high value. The mean squared value of the weighted ratio is computed over the union of the one areas of the two projections and it is minimized using the Chebyshev polynomial approximation using n= 5 points. The sum of x and y projections is used for translational adjustment and a 45 deg projection for rotational adjustment. 20 T 1 -T 2 registration experiments were performed and gave mean errors 1. 19 deg and 1. 78 pixels.

40|$|Retirement {{adequacy}} {{is estimated}} using Malaysian Household Income Survey (HIS) 2009 data based on 5881 sample of households {{with information on}} income, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of each household. The adequacy of retirement income is assessed by comparing accumulated projected wealth of an individual’s work life at retirement age with his/her total consumption (needs) in retirement. From the idea of life cycle model, the desired retirement income is to maintain the preretirement level of living throughout retirement. Therefore, retirement wealth {{can be defined as}} adequate if the total retirement income is equal or greater than the total desired retirement consumption. Based on the wealth-need <b>ratio</b> <b>projections,</b> 69 % of households are adequately prepared for retirement. Besides the projection of retirement adequacy, a logistic regression is performed to determine the demographic and socioeconomic determinants of retirement adequacy. In addition, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios are projected to discern the effects of retirement and investment factors on retirement wealth adequacy...|$|R
