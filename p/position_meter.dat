40|$|A new {{procedure}} of the linear position measurement which allows to obtain sensitivity {{better than the}} Standard Quantum Limit {{and close to the}} Energetic Quantum Limit is proposed and analyzed in detail. Proposed method is based on the principles of stroboscopic quantum measurement and variation quantum measurement and allows to avoid main disadvantages of both these procedures. This method can be considered as a good candidate for use as a local <b>position</b> <b>meter</b> in the “intracavity ” topologies of the laser gravitational-wave antennae. ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{relatively}} small-scale experimental setups aimed on prototyping {{of future}} laser gravitational-wave detectors {{and testing of}} new methods of quantum measurements with macroscopic mechanical objects, are under development now. In these devices, not devoted directly to the gravitational-wave detection, Mach-Zehnder interferometer with pass-through Fabry-Perot cavities in the arms can be used instead of the standard Michelson/Fabry-Perot one. The advantage of this topology {{is that it does}} not contain high-reflectivity end mirrors with multilayer coatings, which Brownian noise could constitute the major part of the noise budget of the Michelson/Fabry-Perot interferometers. We consider here two variants of this topology: the "ordinary" <b>position</b> <b>meter</b> scheme, and a new variant of the quantum speed meter. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{modification}} of the variation quantum measurement is considered, which allows to eliminate the main shortcoming of such a measurement — the meter hardware setup dependence on the signal shape and arrival time. This method is based on approximation of the signal by series of short rectangular “slices ” and periodical applying the variation measurement procedure fitted to such a rectangular pulse. It allows to reconstruct the signal shape with precision not limited by the standard quantum limit. “Price”, {{in the case of}} the parametric <b>position</b> <b>meters</b> (including interferometric ones), is pumping energy 720 = 4 7 : 4 times higher than for the usual variation measurement.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{design of}} QND gravitational-wave detector based on speed meter principle is considered {{with respect to}} optical losses. The detailed analysis of speed meter interferometer is performed and the ultimate sensitivity {{that can be achieved}} is calculated. It is shown that unlike the <b>position</b> <b>meter</b> signal-recycling can hardly be implemented in speed meter topology to replace the arm cavities as it is done in signal-recycled detectors, such as GEO 600. It is also shown that speed meter can beat the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) by the factor of ∼ 3 in relatively wide frequency band, and by the factor of ∼ 10 in narrow band. For wide band detection speed meter requires quite reasonable amount of circulating power ∼ 1 MW. The advantage of the considered scheme is that it can be implemented with minimal changes in the current optical layout of LIGO interferometer. Comment: 20 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Speedmeters {{are known}} to be quantum non-demolition devices and, by {{potentially}} providing sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, become interesting for third generation gravitational wave detectors. Here we introduce a new configuration, the sloshing-Sagnac interferometer, and compare it to the more established ring-Sagnac interferometer. The sloshing-Sagnac interferometer is designed to provide improved quantum noise limited sensitivity and lower coating thermal noise than standard <b>position</b> <b>meter</b> interferometers employed in current gravitational wave detectors. We compare the quantum noise limited sensitivity of the ring-Sagnac and the sloshing-Sagnac interferometers, in the frequency range, from 5 Hz to 100 Hz, where they provide the greatest potential benefit. We evaluate the improvement in terms of the unweighted noise reduction below the standard quantum limit, and by finding the range up to which binary black hole inspirals may be observed. The sloshing-Sagnac was found to give approximately similar or better sensitivity than the ring-Sagnac in all cases. We also show that by eliminating the requirement for maximally-reflecting cavity end mirrors with correspondingly-thick multi-layer coatings, coating noise can be reduced by a factor of approximately 2. 2 compared to conventional interferometers...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{implementation}} of a quantum speed meter QND measurement scheme. It employs two independent optical readouts of the interferometer test masses, featuring strongly different values of the bandwidths γ_ 1, 2 and of the optical circulating power I_ 1, 2, with the special relationship of I_ 1 /I_ 2 =γ_ 1 /γ_ 2. The outputs of these two position meters have to be combined by an additional beamsplitter. In this scheme, signals at the common and the differential outputs of the interferometer setup are proportional to the position and the velocity of the test masses, respectively. The influence of the position meter-like back action force associated with the position signal can be cancelled using the EPR approach by measuring the amplitude quadrature of the beamsplitter common output correlated with this force. In the standard signal-recycled Michelson interferometer topology of the modern gravitational-wave detectors, two independent optical position meters can be implemented by two orthogonal polarisations of the probe light. Our analysis shows that the EPR speedmeter provides significantly improved sensitivity for all frequencies below ∼ 30 Hz compared to an equivalent signal recycled Michelson interferometer. We believe the EPR speedmeter scheme to be very attractive for future upgrades of gravitational wave detectors, because it requires only minor changes to be implemented in the interferometer hardware and allows to switch between the <b>position</b> <b>meter</b> and the speed meter modes within short time-scales and without any changes to the hardware.

40|$|The quantum {{nature of}} the {{electromagnetic}} field imposes a fundamental limit on the sensitivity of optical precision measurements such as spectroscopy, microscopy and interferometry 1. The so-called quantum limit is set by the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which constrain the precision with which optical signals can be measured 2 – 4.

30|$|Some {{approaches}} to tremor signal removal {{have been proposed}} by previous researchers. Rocon et al. proposed an adaptive filter with a weighted-frequency Fourier linear combiner for the force and angular velocity data that they used for their proposed exoskeleton for tremor patients [29]. Yano et al. developed an adaptive filter for force sensor data {{that was used in}} admittance control for a meal-assistance manipulator [9, 10]. This filter estimated the tremor frequency and attenuated the signal in the estimated frequency band using a band stop filter. Riviere et al. proposed a filtering algorithm for physiological tremors that arise during microsurgery [30]. However, these studies aimed to reduce tremor noise in motion signals that were measured by sensors such as force sensors or <b>position</b> <b>meters.</b> In these signals, the effects of the tremors are observed as additive noise. Therefore, it is difficult to apply these methods to the patients’ EMG signal.|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of General Relativity we develop a method for analysis of {{the operation of the}} optical <b>position</b> <b>meters</b> in their photodetectors proper reference frames. These frames are non-inertial in general due to the action of external fluctuative forces on meters test masses, including detectors. For comparison we also perform the calculations in the laboratory (globally inertial) reference frame and demonstrate that for certain optical schemes laboratory-based analysis results in unmeasurable quantities, in contrast to the detector-based analysis. We also calculate the response of the simplest optical meters to weak plane gravitational waves and fluctuative motions of their test masses. It is demonstrated that for the round-trip meter analysis in both the transverse-traceless (TT) and local Lorentz (LL) gauges produces equal results, while for the forward-trip meter corresponding results differ in accordance with different physical assumptions (e. g. procedure of clocks synchronization) implicitly underlying the construction of the TT and LL gauges.

40|$|Digital {{multimedia}} {{broadcasting signal}} is {{promised to be}} a wireless positioning signal. This paper mainly studies a multimedia broadcasting technology, named China mobile multimedia broadcasting (CMMB), {{in the context of}} positioning. Theoretical and practical analysis on the CMMB signal suggests that the existing CMMB signal does not have the <b>meter</b> <b>positioning</b> capability. So, the CMMB system has been modified to achieve <b>meter</b> <b>positioning</b> capability by multiplexing the CMMB signal and pseudo codes in the same frequency band. The time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation method is used in base station positioning receivers. Due to the influence of a complex fading channel and the limited bandwidth of receivers, the regular tracking method based on pseudo code ranging is difficult to provide continuous and accurate TDOA estimations. A pseudorange measurement scheme based on snapshot is proposed to solve the problem. This algorithm extracts the TDOA estimation from the stored signal fragments, and utilizes the Taylor expansion of the autocorrelation function to improve the TDOA estimation accuracy. Monte Carlo simulations and real data tests show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the TDOA estimation error for base station positioning receivers, and then the modified CMMB system achieves <b>meter</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy...|$|R
