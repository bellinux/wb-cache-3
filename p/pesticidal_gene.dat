40|$|Chemotaxis in Agrobacierium tumefaciens was studied. Several plant derived {{monocyclic}} {{phenolic compounds}} were analysed {{for their ability}} to act as chemoattractants for A. tumefaciens C 58 C (^ 1) and as inducers of the Ti-plasmid virulence operons. The results divided the phenolics into 4 groups. A strong correlation between vir- inducing ability and Ti-plasmid requirement for chemo taxis was established and chemical structure rules for vir induction and chemo taxis are outlined. Furthermore, virA and virG were found to be the Ti-plasmid virulence genes required for chemo taxis towards the monocyclic phenolic compound acetosyringone. Chemotaxis towards both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant extracts was analysed. Undiluted shoot and root extracts from both sources elicited a response from both Ti-plasmid harbouring and cured A. tumefaciens C 58 C(^ 1) However, when diluted extracts of Wheat and Kalanchoe shoot homogenate were analysed, a distinct enhancement of chemotaxis was conferred by the Ti-plasmid, suggesting that recognition of, and attraction towards, susceptible plants is not the step blocked in monocot transformation. Analysis of cell wall material revealed that native cell wall components are not required for chemotaxis of A. tumefaciens C 58 C (^ 1) towards plant extracts. Results obtained on chemotaxis along with current knowledge of vir- induction allowed the development of a novel idea involving Agrobacterium as a biocontrol agent. A chitinase gene from Serratia marcescens was manipulated such that its promotor was removed. The promotorless cassette was linked to the virB pro-motor from an octopine Ti-plasmid and the construct introduced into Agrobacterium harbouring virA and virG. The potential benefit of this biocontrol system with respect to other existing biocontrol systems is that expression of the <b>pesticidal</b> <b>gene</b> is regulated by components of wound exudate and therefore is a conservative process, pesticide being produced only when a plant is wounded, {{at a time when it}} is most susceptible to attack by plant pathogens, and then exclusively in the microrhizosphere around the wound site...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was twofold: to {{construct}} plasmids with a <b>gene</b> encoding a <b>pesticidal</b> protein expressed from an Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence promoter and to determine, in planta, the sites of Agrobacterium vir-induction. A number of methods were employed to detect in situ vir-induction and, to this end, genes encoding Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) and bioluminescence (lux) were linked in plasmid constructs to Agrobacterium vir-promoters. In each case, expression of the gene was shown to be induced by the v/r-inducing phenolic compound acetosyringone. An existing plasmid, in which the lacZ gene was under control of the virB promoter was utilised to demonstrate v/r-induction occurring at sites of injury on the roots of mung bean seedlings. <b>Pesticidal</b> <b>genes</b> expressed from Agrobacterium vimlence promoters would {{form the basis of}} a biological control system. A microbial inoculant harbouring such a construct would produce the pesticidal protein only when in the presence of vi-inducing compounds in plant wound exudates. A chitinase gene, chiB, from Serratia marcescens was characterised and sequenced and, following removal of its promoter region, was linked to an Agrobacterium virB promoter. Plasmids were also constructed in which the chiA gene of S. marcescens was brought under the control of a virB or virE promoter. All the constructs specified acetosyringone- inducible production of chitinase. Chitinase is effective in the biological control of chitin containing organisms such as fungi...|$|R
