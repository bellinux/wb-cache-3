5|$|Gold, a siderophile, is most {{commonly}} recovered by dissolving the ores {{in which it}} is found in a cyanide solution. The gold forms a dicyanoaurate(I), for example: 2 Au + H2O +½ O2 + KCN → 2 K + 2 KOH. Zinc is added to the mix and, being more reactive than gold, displaces the gold: 2 + Zn → K2 + 2 Au.

5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species.

40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} the effect of iron/aluminum hydrolyzed <b>precipitate</b> layer on ultrafiltration (UF) membrane, both hydrolyzed <b>precipitate</b> layers on a flat sheet UF membrane surface were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} aluminum hydrolyzed <b>precipitate</b> layer was much better than that of the iron hydrolyzed <b>precipitate</b> layer on protecting the UF membrane. X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrated that the structure of the aluminum <b>precipitate</b> layer was amorphous. Although the <b>precipitate</b> layer of aluminum sulfate hydrate could cause a slight flux decline, it improved the protection of the UF membrane to some extent. The rejection of different pollutants with Al <b>precipitate</b> layer was much higher than that without Al <b>precipitate</b> layer and many humic acid (HA) /bovine serum albumin (BSA) with different molecular weights could be adsorbed by the Al <b>precipitate</b> layer, especially for those with larger molecular weight.

5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium <b>precipitates</b> out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence <b>precipitates</b> out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E
5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining <b>precipitates</b> followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The <b>precipitates</b> are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
5|$|In deep seawaters the isotope 230Th {{make up to}} 0.04% {{of natural}} thorium. This is because its parent 238U is soluble in water, but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and <b>precipitates</b> into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{preliminary}} evaluation of desorption energy requirement for a <b>precipitating</b> system shows that <b>precipitate</b> formation results to {{a decrease in}} desorption energy requirement for a <b>precipitating</b> amino acid salt system compared to a non-precipitating one.

Vapour liquid solid equilibrium measurement was carried out for a newly selected <b>precipitating</b> system at 40 and 120 °C. This <b>precipitating</b> system has good absorption rate {{and is able to}} <b>precipitate</b> earlier in the absorption process. The measured equilibrium CO 2 partial pressure shows good temperature sensitivity and thus good potential for a significant reduction in desorption energy requirement. The cyclic capacity of this system at 10 kPa CO 2 partial pressure is found to be higher than that of 30 wt% MEA by 61 % and by 39 % for a <b>precipitating</b> 5 m’ KSAR system...|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of an astatine compound with hydrogen– usually referred to as hydrogen astatide– was noted by the pioneers of astatine chemistry. As mentioned, there are grounds for instead referring to this compound as astatine hydride. It is easily oxidized; acidification by dilute nitric acid gives the At0 or At+ forms, and the subsequent addition of silver(I) may only partially, at best, precipitate astatine as silver(I) astatide (AgAt). Iodine, in contrast, is not oxidized, and <b>precipitates</b> readily as silver(I) iodide.|$|E
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which <b>precipitates</b> as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, the <b>precipitate</b> is {{converted}} to a more chemically stable form. For instance, calcium ion might be <b>precipitated</b> using oxalate ion, to produce calcium oxalate (CaC2O4); it might then be heated to convert it into the oxide (CaO).

5000|$|The {{presence}} of second phase particles often causes lattice distortions. These lattice distortions result when the <b>precipitate</b> particles differ {{in size and}} crystallographic structure from the host atoms. Smaller <b>precipitate</b> particles in a host lattice leads to a tensile stress, whereas larger <b>precipitate</b> particles leads to a compressive stress. Dislocation defects also create a stress field. Above the dislocation there is a compressive stress and below there is a tensile stress. Consequently, there is a negative interaction energy between a dislocation and a <b>precipitate</b> that each respectively cause a compressive and a tensile stress or vice versa. In other words, the dislocation will be attracted to the <b>precipitate.</b> In addition, {{there is a positive}} interaction energy between a dislocation and a <b>precipitate</b> that have the same type of stress field.

5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide <b>precipitates</b> out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its {{absorption}} spectrum is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium <b>precipitates</b> out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} newly {{formulated}} enterotoxaemia vaccine having oil and alum adjuvants, with presently available toxoid and alum <b>precipitated</b> vaccines.

Results: Out of three enterotoxaemia vaccines tested, alum <b>precipitated</b> oil adjuvant vaccine produced higher and persistent antibody titre for more than 45 days without any booster dose and did not produce any untoward reactions at the injection site. Alum <b>precipitated</b> vaccine elicited better and persistent immune response than toxoid vaccine though it was less than alum <b>precipitated</b> oil adjuvant vaccine. In MNT, alum <b>precipitated</b> and alum <b>precipitated</b> oil adjuvant vaccines showed protection at 45 th day of post vaccination while toxoid vaccine showed only up to 28 th day.

5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and <b>precipitates</b> out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and <b>precipitates,</b> whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
