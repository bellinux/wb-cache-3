The research used a qualitative approach, treating primary and secondary data to content analysis. Contributions of the research include the observation that <b>prequalification</b> <b>processes</b> for public entrepreneurs are an advancement in public administration in terms of filling appointed positions. However, based upon the literature review and data, appointing such positions in Brazil can be a way for governments to gain political support, at least when they don't consist of mere appropriation of government jobs for the purpose of bypassing civil exams, which are usually mandatory in Brazil...|$|R

The information, assessment and evaluation strategies currently used by procurers for screening contractors are considered, and the results are reported of an extensive literature review and a Delphic interview study with a small select sample of construction professionals with extensive experience in prequalification and bid evaluation processes. The findings indicate that the most common criteria considered by procurers during the <b>prequalification</b> and bid <b>process</b> are those pertaining to financial soundness, technical ability, management capability, and the health and safety performance of contractors.

After receiving an application for the VHPready certificate, VHPready Services GmbH will instruct testing laboratories to test the plants {{on the basis of}} the VHPready-technical requirements. The process is divided in two parts: the first part consists of static conformance tests, where the systems and their properties are checked against the specifications provided by the VHPready standard, followed by verification of the dynamic properties of the system, meaning tests under controlled conditions. [...] In the second part end-to-end tests are done with the aid of reference systems. After successful testing and approval of the testing report by VHPready Services GmbH the plants will receive a product-related VHPready certificate.

Using the motivation-opportunity-abiiity framework, the authors consider {{factors that influence}} sales reps ' pursuit (or lack thereof) of marketing and selfgenerated leads. The proportion of time that sales reps devote to marketing leads depends on organizational lead prequalification and managerial tracking processes (extrinsic motivation), as well as marketing lead volume (opportunity), and sales rep experience and performance (ability). Consistent with a person-situation framework, individual sales rep factors should also moderate the infiuence of organizational processes on lead follow-up. Data from 461 sales reps employed by four firms confirm that as sales reps ' experience increases, their responses to manageriai tracking of lead follow-up and marketing lead volume decrease; responses {{to the quality of}} the iead <b>prequalification</b> <b>process</b> increase. As sales reps ' performance improves, their response to the volume of marketing leads increases, but their response to manageriai tracking decreases.

40|$|Abstract: Clayey soil {{found in}} coal mines in Appalachian Ohio is often sold to {{landfills}} for constructing Recompacted Soil Liners (RSL) in landfills. Since clayey soils possess low hydraulic conductivity, {{the suitability of}} mined clay for RSL in Ohio is first assessed by determining its clay content. When soil samples are tested in a laboratory, the same engineering properties are typically expected for the soils originated from the same source, provided that the testing techniques applied are standard, but mined clay from Appalachian Ohio has shown drastic differences in particle size distribution depending on the sampling and/or laboratory processing methods. Sometimes more than a 10 percent decrease in the clay content is observed in the samples collected at the stockpiles, compared to those collected through reverse circulation drilling. This discrepancy poses a challenge to geotechnical engineers who work on the <b>prequalification</b> <b>process</b> of RSL material as it can result in misleading estimates of the hydraulic conductivity of the samples. This paper describes a laboratory investigation conducted on mined clay from Appalachian Ohio to determine {{how and why the}} standard sampling and/or processing methods can affect the grain-size distributions. The variation in the clay content was determined to be due to heav...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{completion}} of a project heavily depends on {{the selection of a}} suitable contractor. The most important and the initial step of the contractor selection process is contractor pre-qualification. <b>Prequalification</b> <b>process</b> is basically used to screen out capable contractors who have potential to carry out a particular project at satisfactory level in terms of cost, quality and time in the competitive market. The aim of the research is to evaluate and optimize the existing pre-qualification process in Sri Lankan construction industry. General pre-qualification criteria and pre-qualification models including computer based models that apply in local and international industry are identified and characteristics of each evaluation method discussed through comprehensive literature survey. The questionnaire survey was carried out among the construction professionals who exposed the positive and negative aspects of currently implemented pre-qualification evaluation methods use in Sri Lankan construction industry. Application of computer based evaluation methods and use of some general pre-qualification criteria are absent in the existing practice. However, the opportunity to implement computer based evaluation models to the construction industry is more possible with the technology available in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the paper draws attention on minimizing construction disputes through proper evaluation and recommendations to optimize the pre-qualification process are also addressed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} identifying prequalification criteria that both clients and contractors believe are good indicators of future construction performance. Criteria {{used in the past}} have been developed by clients in a largely idiosyncratic manner with little or no consultation with the contractors affected. The methodology chosen for the research was a survey which probed stakeholder attitudes to commonly used prequalification criteria. This was carried out via a postal questionnaire involving contactors and clients across Australia. The data was analysed using Discriminant Analysis, which is a multivariate statistical approach that determines the differences between groups. The {{research is}} structured around 39 criteria that were developed as part of a whole-of–government task force into best practice in procurement. The findings identified the most important criteria from both a client’s perspective, and a contractor’s perspective. The purpose was to discover if those differences reduce the effectiveness of the procurement process. This paper contributes to a more clarified understanding of the impact or contrasting views between the stakeholders involved in the <b>prequalification</b> <b>process.</b> This work is innovative because it is one of a few pieces of research that showed that clients and contractors do actually have divergent opinions on the importance of some criteria currently relied upon in the decision making process. The most important prequalification criteria are identified and possible reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The low bid {{method has}} been the most common {{competitive}} bid selection approach used for public projects in the U. S. construction industry and worldwide. This method is usually coupled with a <b>prequalification</b> <b>process</b> to ensure that the lowest bidder has the financial capacity, the necessary experience, and enough bonding capacity to take charge of the project and to perform the work according to the project’s requirements. However, driven by their bad financial status or by their urgent need for work, some contractors tend to abuse the free and price-directed competitive nature of the low bid method by deliberately submitting extremely low bid prices in order to enhance their chance of winning and to at least cover their general and administrative expenses. Thus it is possible for the project to be awarded to an accidental or deliberate unrealistic low bid. This often leads to cost overruns, schedule delays, claims and further disputes between parties during construction. Alternatively, an owner could have paid a little more and reduced these risks by eliminating the lowest bid and rather awarding the contract to the second lowest bidder. This paper uses Monte Carlo simulation approach to analyze and model the second low bid method where the contractor whose bid is the second lowest one among submitted bids is awarded the contract. The simulation results are presented in nomographs that are used to determine optimal markup and optimum profit for a given project and to compare the merits and disadvantages of the low and second low bidding methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a research project studying prequalification for restricted developer competitions aimed at housing in Sweden. The methodology includes an inventory of competitions, case studies, document reviews, and interviews with members in the organizers’ selection committees. The case studies comprise three restricted developer competitions in Danderyd, Nacka, and Trelleborg organized by the respective municipalities.   The design teams are selected by prequalification in restricted competition. The organizer starts prequalification by inviting candidates to the competition. The organizer’s invitation contains a short description of the competition task, {{the aim of the}} competition and the conditions, submission requirements, and criteria for the evaluation of applications. The essential demands are general and based on Swedish law on public procurement. The evaluation criteria are experience-based and reflect professional merits for the competition.   The three developer competitions generated a total of sixteen applications from candidates, teams of constructors, and developers in cooperation with architect firms. The lead applicant was the constructor or developer – not the architect firm. Eleven design teams were invited to the developer competitions after prequalification.   Winners in developer competitions receive building permits and can implement their proposal, either by purchasing the land or acquiring the leasehold. Building costs (economy) and design quality (aesthetics) are key factors for organizers. The invited teams generally take part in the developer competitions at their own expense. This was the case for two of the competitions studied here, while in one the invited teams each received 50, 000 SEK for their design proposals, which is very low compensation for design proposals as compared with architecture competitions.   The organizers were pleased with the information in the candidates’ applications and the selection committees were easily able to choose teams for the competitions, which {{can be explained by the}} low number of applications. According to the selection committees, the <b>prequalification</b> <b>process</b> worked well, although the organizers had expected wider interest from the building sector and more applications from constructors and developers.

This method is usually coupled with a <b>prequalification</b> <b>process</b> to ensure that the lowest bidder has the financial capacity, the necessary experience, and enough bonding capacity to take charge of the project and to perform the work according to the project's requirements.

Thus it is possible for the project to be awarded to an accidental or deliberate unrealistic low bid. This often leads to cost overruns, schedule delays, claims and further disputes between parties during construction. This research investigates alternative competitive bidding methods that have the potential to remedy the aforementioned drawback of the low bid method. Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to study and model average-based bidding methods where the winning bid is defined in relation to the average of submitted bids. This research also studies two other competitive bidding methods: the second low bid method where the second lowest bid is awarded the project and the median bid method where the winner is defined to be the median bid. The merits and shortcomings of these methods are analyzed and compared relative {{to each other and to}} the low bid method through produced nomograms that depict the winning probability, the optimum markup and the optimum expected profit under each. After studying the aforementioned bidding methods from the perspective of a risk-neutral contractor, this research uses established principles of decision analysis and utility theory to develop a risk-sensitive bidding model that can be applied to each of the studied bidding methods. This model helps a contractor determine his optimal markup for a project given his risk attitude and his uncertainty about the project's estimated and final costs...|$|E
