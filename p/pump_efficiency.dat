First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of <b>pump</b> <b>efficiency</b> also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.|$|E

CO2 refrigerant (R744, GWP=1) or ammonia (R717, GWP=0) also have the benefit, depending on operating conditions, of resulting in higher heat <b>pump</b> <b>efficiency</b> than conventional refrigerants. An example is a 14 MW(thermal) district heating network in Drammen, Norway which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use R717 refrigerant, and has been operating since 2011. 90°C water is delivered to the district loop (and returns at 65°C). Heat is extracted from seawater (from [...] depth) that is 8 to 9°C all year round, giving an average coefficient of performance (COP) of about 3.15. In the process the seawater is chilled to 4°C; however, this resource is not utilized. In a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning, the effective COP would be considerably higher.|$|E

A finite-length nano-scale surface-charged cylindrical capillary with reservoirs connected at the capillary ends is considered as the physical domain. The Navier-Stokes, Laplace, Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations are solved simultaneously {{to obtain the}} fluid flow, electric potential distribution and ion concentration distribution in the physical domain. The <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> predicted using a one-dimensional model assuming an infinitely long channel, Boltzmann ion distribution and equal ionic electrical mobility is also carried out and compared with the two-dimensional result. It is found that the surface charge density and dimensionless Debye length (kappa a) magnitudes are the two parameters that determine the electro-kinetic <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> is found to increase {{with the increase in}} surface charge density for KG in the 0. 03 - 30 range. For all surface charge densities studied, higher maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> can be obtained when the dimensionless Debye length (kappa a) is less than 2. That is, an electrical double layer (EDL) overlap effect enhances the <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In this kappa a range. the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> predicted by the two-dimensional model is higher than that predicted by the one-dimensional model.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for predicting the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> and pressure difference generation by an electrokinetic-driven fluid pumping system through a capillary tube {{is presented in}} this study. Both the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> and optimum pressure difference generation are found to depend on a single variable. This single variable is termed as the figure of merit since it determines the performance of electrokinetic pumping. The figure of merit is found to depend on three dimensionless parameters, the normalized Debye length, zeta potential, and Levine number indicating the nominal ratio of convective current to conductive current. All three parameters {{can be related to}} the pH value and concentration of aqueous salt solution by the introduction of concentration-dependent electrical conductivity and pH-dependent zeta potential. By presenting the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> and optimum pressure difference generation as functions of pH value, salt concentration, and capillary tube radius, it is found that both maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> and optimum pressure difference generation increase with the decrease in capillary radius and salt concentration. The optimum pH values at which the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> and optimum pressure difference generation occur are found to be in the range between 6 and 9. For the salt concentration of 10 (- 6) M, pH 6. 9, and a capillary tube radius value of 0. 5 mu m, the predicted maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>efficiency</b> is 5. 4 % which is close to the experimental measurement reported in the literature...|$|R
