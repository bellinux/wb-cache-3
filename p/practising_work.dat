40|$|In 1973 the {{government}} of the Federal Republic plans to introduce a flexible retirement age. According to this new law, old age pensions can be paid already to people who are 63 years of age instead of 65 as at present. The government thus hopes to do more justice to the difference in capacity for work of elderly insured people and to the lact that the decline of life of humans depends to a certain extent on the occupational requirements demanded of them. Based on social science and medical research results this essay shows that the flexible retirement age cannot master these problems. The essay mentions in particular general relationships between age and work as well as special relationships between <b>practised</b> <b>work,</b> illness, disability and age. The bibliography includes literature connected with other aspects of the flexible retirement age...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we examine how {{flexible}} <b>work</b> <b>practises</b> impacts employees psychologically. It has come to our attention that flexible <b>work</b> <b>practises</b> on one hand seems to be stimulating, educating and satisfying for employees {{but on the other}} hand seems to cause stress and worn out employees. Serving as proof for our work thesis, we utilize current fieldwork studies. We seek to understand how one can comprehend the opposition that the individual might encounter in flexible <b>work</b> <b>practises</b> from a culture-historical point of view. To answer this question we take a theoretically based approach, utilizing a wide range of activity theories, including the work of Klaus Holzkamp and Alexej Nikolaevitj Leontjev. Flexible work practice is on one hand making <b>work</b> <b>practises</b> more vibrant and less uniform, and therefore leaving employees with greater possibilities for continuous personal development and to extends one’s capacity to exercise rights. Routines can on the other hand be seen as crucial for the individual’s everyday life and if these are lost, the individual might perceive the world as chaotic and meaningless. In continuation hereof we discuss the individual's need for constant personal development in proposition to the needs of recreational and non-productive activity. Finally, we argue that flexible <b>work</b> <b>practises</b> are undermining the distinction between work life and personal life, leaving the individual in a constant grey area between the two arenas. We conclude that the employee must seek out to balance all of these areas flexible work areas in order to succeed and take full advantage of the flexibility and possibilities this type of work offers...|$|R

Teaching can help to reduce anxiety about <b>practising</b> social <b>work</b> law but familiar barriers to learning and its application in practice also surfaced. In addition to the time allocated to law learning, development of legal knowledge and skills was greatly affected by the priority given to this aspect of practice during placements.

40|$|In June 2012, the General Medical Council (GMC) {{instituted a}} series of new rules that {{reformed}} their fitness to <b>practise</b> <b>work.</b> The most significant change to disciplinary proceedings was {{the formation of a}} Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) which is led by a former Deputy High Court Judge. Aimed at safeguarding patient safety, the MPTS is an autonomous part of the GMC which will now adjudicate on all cases relating to doctors whose fitness to practise is called into question. With the new development, the GMC will continue to collect evidence and carry out the investigations, but the cases will be adjudicated by the tribunal which is empowered to impose sanctions against doctors’ registration. The fitness to practise panels which sit on these hearings are made up of medical and lay members who receive specific training and are regularly appraised. The hearings are conducted in public and the tribunal is accountable to Parliament. The GMC had hoped that the change would bolster public and professional confidence that these hearings are impartial, fair and transparent. They have described the change as “the biggest shake-up of fitness to practise hearings since they were first established in 1858 ” (GMC Press Release, 11 June 2012).
