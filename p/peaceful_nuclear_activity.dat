5000|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency, {{charged with}} {{monitoring}} and ensuring <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities,</b> referred {{the matter of}} Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council in February 2006, after finding that Iran {{had not been in}} compliance with its duties as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). For what the IAEA judged to be continued non-compliance, the UN Security Council has voted four times since 2006 to impose limited economic sanctions against Iran. In its resolutions, the Council required Iran to fully cooperate with the IAEA and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related activities. Dore Gold, Israel's former ambassador to the United Nations, has emphasized that the resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and [...] "are legally binding under international law, adding further legal force to the argument that Iran has no legal right whatsoever to enrich uranium".|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn 1967, {{the treaty of}} Tlatelolco declared Latin America to be a nuclear weapons-free zone, but this goal remains unfulfilled. Argentina and Brazil, the :Latin American nations most capable of building nuclear weapons, refuse {{to comply with the}} treaty. Argentine and Brazilian military leaders pursued the development of nuclear weapons fro the 1970 's to the late 1980 's. The emergence of democratic regimes from the 1980 's encouraged the gradual "denuclearization" of weapons research in these nations. In July 1991, the presidents of Argentina and Brazil signed an accord in Guadalajara, Mexico, each promising to abandon the development of nuclear weapons. The risks of nuclear proliferation may be reduced because of this agreement. The Guadalajara Accord offers hope that nuclear proliferation in Latin America can be slowed and perhaps stopped. The establishment of civilian control over the military and the reduction I the belligerent rivalry between Argentina and Brazil are central factors in ending the quest for nuclear weapons. The firm commitment of these civilian leaders to pursue only <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> is a positive sign. The adoption of IAEA full-scope safeguards in Argentina and Brazil will be the best guarantee for a nuclear weapons-free Latin America. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) safeguards system has been a cornerstone of U. S. efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation since the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was adopted in 1970. Safeguards allow IAEA to verify countries' compliance with the NPT. Since the discovery in 1991 of a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iraq, IAEA has strengthened its safeguards system. In addition to IAEA's strengthened safeguards program, there are other U. S. and international efforts that have helped stem {{the spread of nuclear}} materials and technology {{that could be used for}} nuclear weapons programs. This testimony is based on GAO's report on IAEA safeguards issued in October 2005 (Nuclear Nonproliferation: IAEA Has Strengthened Its Safeguards and Nuclear Security Programs, but Weaknesses Need to Be Addressed, GAO- 06 - 93 [Washington, D. C. : Oct. 7, 2005]). This testimony is also based on previous GAO work related to the Nuclear Suppliers Group [...] a group of more than 40 countries that have pledged to limit trade in nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to only countries that are engaged in <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> [...] and U. S. assistance to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union for the destruction, protection, and detection of nuclear material and weapons. ...|$|R
2500|$|Iran also {{minimizes}} {{the significance of}} the IAEA's inability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, arguing the IAEA has only drawn such conclusions in a subset of states that have ratified and implemented the Additional Protocol. The IAEA has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but not the absence of undeclared activities. According to the IAEA's Safeguards Statement for 2007, of the 82 states where both NPT safeguards and an Additional Protocol are implemented, the IAEA had found no indication of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> in 47 states, while evaluations of possible undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> remained ongoing in 35 states. Iran ceased implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond that required under its safeguards agreement after the IAEA Board of Governors decided to report its safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. Iran insisted that such cooperation had been [...] "voluntary," [...] but on 26 December 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which among other things required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, [...] "beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol." [...] The IAEA reported on 19 November 2008, that, while it is [...] "able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran," [...] it [...] "has not been able to make substantive progress" [...] on [...] "key remaining issues of serious concern" [...] because of a [...] "lack of cooperation by Iran." [...] Iran has maintained that the Security Council's engagement in [...] "the issue of the <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> of the Islamic Republic of Iran" [...] are unlawful and malicious. Iran also argues that the UN Security Council resolutions demanding a suspension of enrichment constitute a violation of ArticleIV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which recognizes the inalienable right of signatory nations to nuclear technology [...] "for peaceful purposes." ...|$|R

40|$|Dear Ms. Lee: I {{refer to}} the letter from your office dated December 17, 1999 {{requesting}} {{the views of the}} Executive Branch as to whether issuance of an export license In accordance with the application hereinafter described meets the applicable criteria of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended: NRC No. XCOM 1134 - Application by General Electric to export 48 zirconium alloy tubes to Norway for testing by the Institute for Energiteknikk in the Halden Research Reactor. Following testing, the tubes will be disposed of in Norway. It is the judgment of the Executive Branch that the proposed export will not be inimical to the common defense and security of the United States, and is consistent with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. As a party to the NPT, Norway has committed itself to maintain IAEA safeguards on all of its <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> and has pledged not to manufacture or otherwise acquire any nuclear explosive device. It is therefore the judgment of the Executive Branch that criteria (1) and (2) for exports of nuclear components, substances and items under Section 109 b of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, are met. The remaining criterion, agreement not to retransfer any U. S. -supplied component or material without prior U. S. consent, has been satisfied by a letter from the Norwegian Institute for Energy Technology forwarded by a letter from the Embassy of Norway, copies of which are enclosed. On the basis of the foregoing, the Executive Branch recommends that the license be issued. Sincerely, Enclosure: assurance letters...|$|R

5000|$|Iran's Khodadad Seifi {{responded to}} {{allegations}} against the Iranian nuclear programme saying that Iran has an inalienable right to <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy and is fully committed to its non-proliferation agreements, {{that it has}} always been for peaceful purposes and that Iran continues to fully cooperate with the IAEA. All activities are carried out under the agency’s cameras and resident inspectors regularly visit the sites and measure and seal uranium containers. Some cooperation, it said, is even beyond the legal obligations so as to build more trust and confidence; non-diversion has always been confirmed by the agency. He added that the [...] "agency continues to verify the material at the nuclear facilities by Iran in accordance with the agreement." [...] He further noted that all countries have right to nuclear energy and none to nuclear weapons: “nuclear energy for all and nuclear weapons for no one.” Iran addresses genuine proliferation but rejects conflating <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy with developing nuclear weapons. In addition to obligations, he said, Islamic teaching is against pursuing nuclear weapons program. Nuclear weapons do not bring security but are the greatest threat to nuclear-haves and have-nots. As {{there is no reason to}} accept nuclear weapons but many reasons to abolish them all, nuclear weapons have no place in the defence doctrine of Iran. Yet some countries express concerns over Iranian nuclear weapons and there is a deep mistrust by Iran over the policies and intentions of these countries. Therefore there is a need to build mutual trust that is possible only by resorting to the force of logic not the logic of force. The golden rule is to resort to diplomacy alone. Sustainable solutions are attainable only by peaceful and respectful negotiations. For its part, Iran expresses full readiness to stick to meaningful time-bound negotiations. Iran stands ready to ensure its nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and remove concerns of other parties and acknowledge the inherent right of Iran to <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy including a full national fuel cycle. As such sanctions, whether unilateral or multilateral, should be lifted. Mutual respect and equal treatment is essential for a win-win situation. Other parties need to adopt the same approach. Moreover Iran underlines the important contribution other countries can make to the process. Iran takes this opportunity to thank all countries that support sovereign rights to peaceful science and tech and those who have supported, in the past several days, the Iranian programme. However, he cited the as yet extremely inflammatory statement by the “last speaker” with allegations against the <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> of Iran and it would not dignify such unfound accusations with answers other than categorically rejecting them all. He said that Netanyahu tried to “mislead this august body” about the nuclear programme, but that unlike last year his comments tried to be more royal than a king by setting a standard for Iranian <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> and level of enrichment. As such, he must know that no one can dictate to Iran what to do and not to do. “As a party to the NPT, Iran is fully aware of its rights and is fully committed to its obligations. Indeed the one who is badly in need to be educated about these issues is Israel, the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle East. And to that end Israel no choice but to accede to the NPT without delay and place all its nuclear possessions under IAEA safeguards. Netanyahu talked of WMDs in the Middle East without mention that Israel is the only one in the region that possesses all types of WMDss but is still not party to any treaty banning them.“ Netanyahu also did not mention the proposed 2012 conference on the establishment of a WMD free zone in the Middle East which was not convened only due to Israeli objections. Similarly to last year, he continued sabre rattling to Iran by abusing the General Debate by threatening a founding member of the body that was intended to prevent breaches of the peace according to the UN charter. Despite this Israel enjoys full freedom and is “proud of all atrocities and over 10 wars waged in 65 years by the Israel regime against all neighbours and others as well. It may wish to apply for an international award certifying the ability of Israeli forces in never ending savage attacks against people under occupation, in particular women and innocent children.” Iran warned that Israel should seriously avoid miscalculation about Iran and that Iran’s century’s old policy of non-aggression should not be seen as an inability to defend itself not because of its ability but its principled policy of rejecting the use of force. Iran is proud of being the best in exercising the inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN charter. Thus Netanyahu better not think of attacking Iran let alone planning for that. In conclusion, to point allegedly made by Iran’s foreign minister at the General Debate: “we have been accused of having a smile attack, a smile attack is better than a military attack” he then concluded that “indeed a smile policy is better than lying.” ...|$|R
