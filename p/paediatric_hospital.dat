40|$|Prescribing {{support tools}} range from {{traditional}} printed texts to state-of-the-art computerised decision support systems. Comparison between available literature is difficult due to country-specific resources often being {{the focus of}} the research. In the UK, it is widely accepted that hospitals take their own individualised approaches to reducing prescribing errors. Objective - This study focused on specialist <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> It aimed to identify the localised approaches taken by <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> to reduce prescribing errors. Method - Applied thematic analysis was used to explore the publically published board meeting minutes from the four specialist stand-alone <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in England. Three years of data was collected from each hospital. Codes were collected into groups to identify themes from the data. Results - The main themes identified were clinician involvement in prescribing support is important; credit card-sized reminder tools are used to provide prescribing guidance; electronic prescribing is considered important for reducing prescribing errors; feedback from clinical pharmacists on prescribing errors is widely used; junior doctors require extra support when prescribing; medical records may be incomplete and specific prescribing support (eg, antibiotic prescribing support) is widely in use. Conclusions - There is no single collaborative approach taken to paediatric prescribing support in English <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Success of electronic prescribing in English <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> is considerably behind leaders such as the USA. Use of clinical pharmacists to support prescribers is important as supported by previous studies in Spain and the USA...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{measure and}} compare {{computed}} tomography (CT) radiation doses delivered to patients in public <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Australia and Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Doses were measured for routine CT scans of the head, chest and abdomen/pelvis for children aged 3 - 6 years in all dedicated public <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Australia and Saudi Arabia using a CT phantom measurement cylinder. RESULTS: CT doses, using the departments&#x 2019; protocols for 3 - 6 year old, varied considerably between hospitals. Measured head doses varied from 137. 6 to 528. 0 mGy 7;cm, chest doses from 21. 9 to 92. 5 mGy 7;cm, and abdomen/pelvis doses from 24. 9 to 118. 0 mGy 7;cm. Mean head and abdomen/pelvis doses delivered in Saudi Arabian paediatric CT departments {{were significantly higher}} than those in their Australian equivalents. CONCLUSION: CT dose varies substantially across Australian and Saudi Arabian <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Therefore, diagnostic reference levels should be established for major anatomical regions to standardise dose...|$|R

40|$|A survey {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the prevalence of antibiotic use in hospitalised children was conducted in June 2007, in Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital in Rome which has the highest annual number of inpatients among <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Italy. Data were collected by reviewing medical charts of all patients hospitalised for> 48 hours. A total of 412 hospitalised children were evaluated; their median age was 42. 3 months, and 55. 6 % were males. Antibiotics were prescribed to 181 of the 412 patients (43. 9 %). The prevalence was lowest (37. 7 %) in medical wards, higher (51. 1 %) in intensive care units and highest (52. 2 %) in surgical wards. Of the patients treated with antibiotics in surgical wards, 71 % received the treatment as prophylaxis. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were ceftazidime and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. The observed prevalence of antibiotic use was within the range recently reported from other <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Europe; however, it is advisable to collect data {{from all over the}} country in order to identify priority areas and design interventions.

40|$|Objectives To {{quantify}} the presence, purpose, function, governance and funding of clinical ethics services (CES) in tertiary <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Australia and New Zealand. Design, setting and participants A descriptive, quantitative {{survey was conducted}} across eight <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Main Outcome Measures Responses from survey questions on the presence, purpose, function, governance and funding of the CES. Results Seven of eight tertiary <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> identified access to CES. Regarding purpose and function, all CES provided clinical case consultation, six of seven provided education and training, six of seven assisted with organisational policy and guideline development and four of seven undertook original ethics research. There was wide variation in how case consultations were conducted, reported and documented. With respect to governance and funding, all CES reported to their hospital executive and only one CES reported having a dedicated, albeit small, budget. Conclusions Heterogeneity {{in the process of}} case consultation and CES policy content exists across the organisations studied. There is consistency with the broader values that underpin CES such as their multidisciplinary nature and level of training required for key staff. There is an apparent lack of formal budgetary support from health services for CES activities, with support derived mostly from staff who contribute their time in addition to their primary roles...|$|R

40|$|Background: Licensed {{formulations}} are {{not always}} suitable for young children. Pharmacy departments at <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> produce in-house extemporaneous preparations for children. The Department of Health in England has recently announced a major investment in hospital production units to improve the manufacturing facilities. However, there is no published systematic study to investigate the extemporaneous production activities in <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in England {{in order to support}} future planning. Objectives: To identify the methods, frequencies and types of medications prepared extemporaneously in the pharmacies of <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in England and the percentage of above preparations that were available from specials manufacturers. Methods: A national survey of in-house extemporaneous preparations by the seven <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in England was conducted over a period of 12 months. The drug, type of product and frequency of each preparation were recorded, and analysed. Results: All seven hospitals (100 %) replied to our survey. On average, 1. 5 items per day per hospital were manufactured. The top 20 drugs represented more than 58 % of the workload, indicating the repetitive nature of the work. 76 % of the final preparations were in liquid dosage forms. Only 27 % of medicines extemporaneously prepared were unlicensed chemical entities. However, 50 % of the extemporaneous products made could be provided by specials manufacturers. Conclusions: The extent of extemporaneous dispensing in paediatric pharmacies was lower than anticipated. The top 20 commonly used drugs (58 % of the workload) could be produced by licensed units or specials manufacturers {{to reduce the risk of}} production errors. As the diversity of strengths of the same medicines that are produced in different centres creates opportunities for medication errors, the idea of establishing a national extemporaneous formulary to standardise the strengths and presentations should be explored. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the past}} 30 years, {{the rate of}} obesity has risen {{considerably}} among Canadian children. <b>Paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> are {{in a unique position}} to model healthy environments to Canadian children. OBJECTIVE: To obtain an overview of healthy active living (HAL) policy and practice in Canadian <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> METHODS: Working in partnership with the local Canadian Paediatric Society HAL champions and the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres liaisons, a nationwide survey was conducted in 2006 / 2007 to identify healthy eating, physical activity and smoking cessation practices in all 16 Canadian <b>paediatric</b> academic <b>hospitals.</b> RESULTS: Policies addressing healthy eating and/or physical activity promotion were present in 50 % of hospitals with a greater focus on nutrition. Wellness committees were created in 50 % of the hospitals, most of which were recently established. Healthy food options were available in cafeterias, although they were often more expensive. Fast food outlets were present in 75 % of hospitals. Although inpatient meals were designed by dietitians, 50 % offered less nutritious replacement kids meals (ie, meal substitutions) on request. Options for play available to inpatients and outpatients were primarily sedentary, with screen-based activities and crafts predominating over active play. Physical activity promotion for staff focused on reduced membership fees to fitness centres and classes. CONCLUSION: Canadian <b>paediatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> do not adequately promote HAL for patients and staff. The present study findings suggest further effort is required to create necessary healthy lifestyle modifications in these institutions through Canadian Paediatric Society/Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres-led policy development and implementation initiatives. A national-level policy framework is required to regulate interhospital variability in policies and practices...|$|R
