5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the {{zygomatic}} arches (cheekbones) are {{broad and}} squared, and the incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> the palate between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is {{perforated}} by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in O.antillarum.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Perforated</b> metal, {{also known}} as <b>perforated</b> sheet, <b>perforated</b> plate, or <b>perforated</b> screen, is sheet metal that has been {{manually}} or mechanically stamped or punched to create a pattern of holes, slots, or decorative shapes. Materials used to manufacture <b>perforated</b> metal sheets include stainless steel, cold rolled steel, galvanized steel, brass, aluminum, tinplate, copper, Monel, Inconel, titanium, plastic, and more.|$|R
5|$|The incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, {{extending}} between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) <b>perforate</b> the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a <b>perforate</b> acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E

5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which <b>perforate</b> the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which <b>perforate</b> the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short {{and do not}} reach near the first molars; they are longer in T.hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not {{extending}} beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two foramina (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of T.ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process to receive the root of the lower incisor, which is absent in T.hylophilus.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that <b>perforate</b> the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The {{zygomatic}} plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|The {{front part}} of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front portion of the cheek bone, is expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The jugal bone is small, but less reduced than in Holochilus. The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which <b>perforate</b> the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Perforating</b> {{disorders}} of the skin, is {{an often}} overlooked entity characterized by transepidermal elimination of {{material from the}} upper dermis and are classified histopathologically according {{to the type of}} epidermal disruption {{and the nature of the}} eliminated material. They include Kyrle′s disease, <b>perforating</b> folliculitis, reactive <b>perforating</b> collagenosis, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa. Aim: The aim of this study was to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of <b>perforating</b> disorders of the skin. Materials and Methods: In our study, we reviewed last 2 years skin biopsies received by us.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesEndoscopic {{ligation}} of <b>perforating</b> veins {{is useful}} in treatment of <b>perforating</b> vein incompetence. Over {{the last few years}} the topic of interest has been the medial side of the lower leg; however, laterally located venous ulcers (10 % of all) are of equal importance. Our poor results with lateral subfascial endoscopic <b>perforating</b> vein surgery (SEPS) procedures led us to study the anatomy of the <b>perforating</b> veins in the lateral leg. The presence of persistent insufficient <b>perforating</b> veins in our patients suggests that our procedure failed because of misinterpreted perforator anatomy. Methods and resultsAnatomic dissection was performed in 16 cadavers in two stages, subcutaneously and subfascially. <b>Perforating</b> veins were classified relative to the short saphenous vein and intermuscular septa, with coordinates. Three hundred fifty-one <b>perforating</b> veins were found, for an average of 21. 9 <b>perforating</b> veins per leg. The results showed that there is alignment of the <b>perforating</b> veins according to the septa between the anterior and peroneal compartment and between the peroneal compartment and the superficial dorsal compartment. Most of the <b>perforating</b> veins did not correlate with the short saphenous vein. ConclusionPoor clinical results of lateral SEPS procedures might be improved after adjustment of the procedure for new anatomic information, which shows alignment of <b>perforating</b> veins along the intermuscular septa, obligating full septa dissection on the lateral side...|$|R

25|$|The SIEA flap {{design is}} more or less similar to the DIEAP flap design, however, it is perfused by {{different}} blood vessels. The superficial epigastric vessels branch off the common femoral vessels in the groin area and vascularise the ipsilateral lower hemi-abdomen. Unlike the DIEAP flap the SIEA flap is not a perforator flap, because the vessels do not <b>perforate</b> the abdominal wall musculature. Therefore, the flap can be raised without incising the anterior rectus sheath and dissecting within the rectus muscles and thus further reducing the chance of donor site morbidity.|$|E
