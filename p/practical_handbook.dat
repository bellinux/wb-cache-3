50|$|At the time, most {{gardening}} {{books were}} <b>practical</b> <b>handbooks,</b> and Amherst {{was the first}} writer to take a careful {{look at the history}} of gardening in England, going back much further in time than other gardening writers did. Indeed, she spearheaded the first wave of writing about Euro-American garden history, with such well-known works as Rose Standish Nichols' English Pleasure Gardens following in 1902 and Marie-Luise Gothein's A History of Garden Art in 1913. More scholarly but less eloquent than her contemporary Gertrude Jekyll, Amherst never became nearly as popular or influential a writer on gardening. But with its meticulous footnotes and exhaustive annotated bibliography, The History of Gardening in England became the authoritative work in its field and remains of value to historians today.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an expert system for both process planning and die design of sheet metal cutting and piercing operations. Knowledge for the system is acquired from <b>practical</b> <b>handbooks,</b> theory and empirical knowledge from industrial partners and is expressed as "crude" rules, transformed by the knowledge engineer into production rules. These are then coded into constructs of the CLIPS expert system development environment. This process is explained using a number of examples. The expert system comprises of five modules: initial calculations (including data input), process planning, finishing operation, die and press selection, and tools selection. Each module draws upon one or more among 18 rule pools defined around the important notions characterising the problem studied. The results of the expert system can be used by both the designer deciding on the production feasibility (manufacturability) for a sheet metal component and by the manufacturer receiving advice either on the hardware needed or on the process plan...|$|R
