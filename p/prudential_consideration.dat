I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I shall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.|$|E
60|$|The {{common people}} had, {{throughout}} the day, toiled and struggled at football; the nobles and gentry had fought cocks, and hearkened to the wanton {{music of the}} minstrel; while the citizens had gorged themselves upon pancakes fried in lard, and brose, or brewis--the fat broth, that is, in which salted beef had been boiled, poured upon highly toasted oatmeal, a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple, old fashioned Scottish palates. These were all exercises and festive dishes proper to the holiday. It was no less a solemnity of the evening that the devout Catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had means to procure; and, if young and able, that he should dance at the ring, or figure among the morrice dancers, who, {{in the city of}} Perth, as elsewhere, wore a peculiarly fantastic garb, and distinguished themselves by their address and activity. All this gaiety took place under the <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> that the long term of Lent, now approaching, with its fasts and deprivations, rendered it wise for mortals to cram as much idle and sensual indulgence as they could into the brief space which intervened before its commencement.|$|E

60|$|Colonel Desborough acquitted {{his right}} honourable and {{excellent}} cousin and kinsman of all species of unkindness; Master Bletson discovered, that {{the interest of}} the state was trebly concerned in the good administration of Windsor more than in that of Woodstock. As for Harrison, he exclaimed, without disguise or hesitation, that the gleaning of the grapes of Windsor was better than the vintage of Woodstock. Thus speaking, the glance of his dark eye expressed as much triumph in the proposed earthly advantage, as if it had not been, according to his vain persuasion, to be shortly exchanged for his share in the general reign of the Millennium. His delight, in short, resembled the joy of an eagle, who preys upon a lamb in the evening with not the less relish, because she descries in the distant landscape an hundred thousand men about to join battle with daybreak, and to give her an endless feast on the hearts and lifeblood of the valiant. Yet though all agreed that they would be obedient to the General's pleasure in this matter, Bletson proposed, as a precautionary measure, in which all agreed, that they should take up their abode for some time in the town of Woodstock, to wait for their new commissions respecting Windsor; and this upon the <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration,</b> that it was best not to slip one knot until another was first tied.|$|E
40|$|Graphics {{processing}} units (GPU) {{have been}} investigated to release the computational capability in various scientific applications. Recent research shows that <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> needs {{to be given to}} take the advantages of GPUs while avoiding the deficiency. In this paper, the impact of GPU acceleration to implicit integrators and explicit integrators in transient stability is investigated. It is illustrated that implicit integrators, although more numerical stable than explicit ones, are not suitable for GPU acceleration. As a tradeoff between numerical stability and efficiency, an explicit 4 th order Runge-Kutta integration algorithm is implemented for transient stability simulation based on hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. The differential equations of dynamic components are evaluated in GPU, while the linear network equations are solved in CPU using sparse direct solver. Simulation on IEEE 22 -bus power system with 6 generators is reported to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|This note {{examines}} the extreme deference the Court gives to Congress {{in the realm}} of immigration legislation. The author argues that, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

Viewed through the Court 2 ̆ 7 s own analysis of its power to make and revise precedent decisions, the immigration plenary power doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudential shortcomings become more evident and the arguments to overturn the doctrine become more powerful. This Note concludes that no principled constitutional or <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> upholds the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s extraordinarily deferential approach to immigration legislation. It further concludes that the Court should review immigration legislation by the same standards it applies to any other act of Congress...|$|E

40|$|The guilt left by immoral actions is why moral duties {{are more}} {{pressing}} and serious than other reasons like <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations.</b> Religions talk {{of sin and}} karma; the secular still speak of spots or stains. I argue that a moral staining view of guilt {{is in fact the}} best model. It accounts for guilt's reflexive character and for anxious, scrupulous worries about whether one has transgressed. To understand moral staining, I borrow Christine Korsgaard's view that we construct our identities as agents through our actions. The contribution of immoral actions to self-constitution explains why moral obligations have priority and importance...|$|R
6000|$|One notable {{result of}} dulness and apathy {{is to make}} a person unattractive to the {{opposite}} sex and to be unattracted by them. It is antagonistic to sexual affection, and the result is a diminution of offspring. There exists strong evidence that the decay of population in some parts of South America under the irksome tyranny of the Jesuits, which crushed what little vivacity the people possessed, was due to this very cause. One cannot fairly apply the term [...] "misery" [...] to apathy; I should rather say that strong affections restrained from marriage by <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> more truly deserved that name.|$|R
40|$|Early modern {{political}} thought transformed toleration from a <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> into a moral obligation. Three questions {{need to be}} answered by any explanation of this transition: Did religious toleration really become an obligation {{of the state in}} this period? If this was the case, how could tolerating heresy and idolatry possibly become a moral duty to Christians? How could Europeans both condemn practices as idolatrous and immoral, and yet insist that these practices ought to be tolerated? To answer these questions, the article shows how the early policy of toleration in British India was constituted by a Protestant theological framework. Toleration turned into a moral obligation, it is argued, because the Reformation had identified liberty in the religious realm as God’s will for humanity. This gave rise to a dynamic in which Christian states and churches were continuously challenged for their violations of religious liberty. The principle of toleration developed as a part of this dynamic...|$|E

40|$|In Moore v. U. S. House of Representatives,I the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit {{addressed}} {{the question of}} whether individual congressmen have standing to sue the Congress. In Moore, members of the House of Representatives sought declaratory relief to invalidate the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). 2 The congressmen contended that TEFRA originated in the Senate in violation of the origination clause of the United States Constitution, 3 which requires that bills for raising revenue originate in the House of Representatives. Although the District of Columbia Circuit ultimately denied relief on the basis of <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> 4 it held, significantly, that the congressmen had standing to bring suit in federal court. 5 Thus, the Moore court determined that the federal court had jurisdiction over the controversy but that, because of prudential concerns, that power should not be exercised. Part I of this comment outlines the facts and holding of Moore. Part II examines the standing analysis which the court employed and concludes that the Moore court 2 ̆ 7 s finding of standing does not comport with traditional tests for standing. Finally, Part III discusses the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision to deny relief based on <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations.</b> This comment concludes that, contrary to the Moore holding, denial of relief should have been the consequence of constitutional command rather than judicial discretion...|$|R

This Article posits {{that the idea}} of 2 ̆ 2 rehabilitative 2 ̆ 2 or structural reparations continues to have both conceptual and pragmatic currency.

40|$|Critical {{theory is}} a multifarious and dynamic body of thought, {{and it is}} hard to make general {{statements}} about its relation to practical philosophy without shoehorning it into one-size-fits-all judgments. To avoid doing this, this article indicates wherever possible whose critical theory is at issue and at what phase in its development. The Frankfurt School critical theory is a particular kind of Gesellschaftskritik or social criticism, the practical aims of which are essential to and inseparable from it. Indeed, as distinct from social theory or sociology, critical theory is, in the eyes of its architects and practitioners, a kind of practice. Yet critical theory is still very much philosophy. Furthermore, critical theory from early on had an almost entirely negative view of instrumental reasoning. This raises the question which asks about the kind of practical upshot that critical theory can have, absent of all political, moral, and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), an {{administrative}} action can be invalidated as arbitrary and capricious if the agency fails to sufficiently {{explain the reasons}} for its choices. This principle applies to agency adjudication {{as well as to}} agency rulemaking. How does this principle apply to IRS adjudications? Examining five paradigms of IRS decisionmaking, this Article first establishes that the IRS does engage in APA–style adjudication. The Article then examines tax-specific explanation requirements and asks whether a more robust explanation duty patterned on the APA should be imposed on IRS determinations. Based on a variety of legal and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> the Article concludes that such an additional duty generally is not advisable as to IRS assessment determinations (that is, the amount of tax liability owed) but may be useful as to IRS collection determinations (that is, when and how to proceed with enforced collection after assessment) ...|$|R

At length, little Pyrrhus, who was all the while lying at his feet, began to creep closer toward him; and, finally, taking hold of the king's robe, he began to climb up by it, and attempted to get into his lap, looking up into the king's face, at the same time, with a countenance in which the expression of confidence and hope was mingled with a certain instinctive infantile fear. The heart of the king was so touched by this mute appeal, that he took the child up in his arms, dismissed at once all <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> from his mind, and, in the end, delivered the boy to the queen, Beroa, directing her to bring him up with her own children.|$|R

Marriages in that grade of society are almost always mere transactions of business, being governed altogether by political and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations.</b> In all Charles's proposals he was aiming simply at strengthening his own position {{by means of the}} wealth or family influence of the bride, supposing as he did that the honor of being even nominally a queen would be a sufficient equivalent to the lady. The ladies themselves, however, to whom he addressed himself, or their friends, thought that the prospect of his being really restored to his throne was very remote and uncertain, and, in the mean time, the empty name of queen was not worth as much as a rich and powerful heiress, by becoming his bride, would have to pay for it.|$|R

Indeed, considerable portions still remain wholly unexplored; and there is doubt as to the actual existence of certain shoals, and reefs, and small clusters of islands vaguely laid down in the charts. The mere circumstance, therefore, of a ship like ours penetrating into these regions, was sufficient to cause any reflecting mind to feel at least a little uneasy. For my own part, the many stories I had heard of ships striking at midnight upon unknown rocks, with all sail set, and a slumbering crew, often recurred to me, especially, as from the absence of discipline, and our being so shorthanded, the watches at night were careless in the extreme.|$|R

One might speculate about the political or <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> that went into the majority’s characterization of what it was actually doing, but as I read the opinion reverse-payment settlements of the type at issue in Actavis are now subject to a de facto regime of presumptive illegality.

40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{debate about the}} special nature of banks. Based on a unique dataset of {{legislative}} changes in industrial countries, we identify events that strengthen competition policy, analyze their impact on banks and non-financial firms and explain the reactions observed with institutional features that distinguish banking from non-financial sectors. Covering nineteen countries for the period 1987 to 2004, we find that banks are special in that a more competition-oriented regime for merger control increases banks 2 ̆ 019 stock prices, whereas it decreases those of non-financial firms. Moreover, bank merger targets become more profitable and larger. A major determinant of the positive bank returns, after controlling inter alia for the general quality of institutions and individual bank characteristics, is the opaqueness that characterizes the institutional setup for supervisory bank merger reviews. Thus strengthening competition policy in banking may generate positive externalities in the financial system that offset unintended adverse side effects on efficiency introduced through supervisory policies focusing on <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> and financial stability. Legal arrangements governing competition and supervisory control of bank mergers may therefore {{have important implications for}} real activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to develop an explorative {{analysis}} of the functions and relations among actors involved in the organization {{and implementation of the}} Saint Agatha Religious Festival in Catania attracting nearly one million presences {{during the first week of}} February. The research is based on the survey of different sources of information, such as literature, news, media, and deep interviews with key informants pertaining to civil and religious institutions. The survey is designed to profile the Festival in terms of history, the character of the stakeholders, size, origin of assets, venues used, decision-making structure, and programs. The Festival’s use of volunteers and sponsors is specifically addressed. Empirical research sketches the network of stakeholders, the relationship between organizations, the importance of local social actors and strategies in enhancing local culture and sustainable tourism, regarding, in particular, the socio-cultural impacts of religious tourism. The local society has historical peculiarities which impose <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> in generalizing about findings, and a comparative study with other Sicilian and/or Italian religious festivals will be important, mainly in order to delineate the actual sustainability of Festivals. The framework developed in this study can be helpful in the application of local social policies and also help comparative festival studies...|$|R
6000|$|I {{proceed to}} inquire on what {{principle}} the House of Lords deals with Liberal measures. The right hon. Member for Dover[8] by an imaginative effort assures {{us that they}} occupy {{the position of the}} umpire. Are they even a sieve, a strainer, to stop legislation if it should reveal an undue or undesirable degree of Radicalism or Socialism? Are they the complementary critic--the critic who sees all the things which the ordinary man does not see? No one can maintain it. The attitude which the House of Lords adopts towards Liberal measures is purely tactical. When they returned to their [...] "gilded Chamber" [...] after the general election they found on the Woolsack and on the Treasury Bench a Lord Chancellor and a Government with which they were not familiar. When their eyes fell upon those objects, there was a light in them which meant one thing--murder; murder tempered, no doubt, by those <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> which always restrain persons from acts which are contrary to the general feeling of the society in which they live. But their attitude towards the present Government has from the beginning been to select the best and most convenient opportunity of humiliating and discrediting them, and finally of banishing them from power.|$|R

With these <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> and doubtless not without an eye to his own ease and convenience, he taught the boy as much, and only as much, as he chose to learn, readily admitting whatever apology it pleased his pupil to allege in excuse for idleness or negligence. As the other persons in the castle, to whom such tasks were delegated, readily imitated the prudential conduct of the major-domo, there was little control used towards Roland Graeme, who, of course, learned no more than what a very active mind, and a total impatience of absolute idleness led him to acquire upon his own account, and by dint of his own exertions. The latter were especially earnest, when the Lady herself condescended to be his tutress, or to examine his progress.|$|R

40|$|In {{limiting}} patent litigants’ {{access to}} the declaratory judgment remedy, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has primarily invoked the “actual controversy” requirement imposed by the U. S. Constitution and the federal Declaratory Judgment Act. However, an examination of Federal Circuit decisions {{and those of the}} district courts reveals that the courts have often confused, or blurred the distinction between, constitutional requirements and the discretion the Act affords the federal courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction. Specifically, the courts often attribute constitutional significance to factors that instead bear on policy. It is important to distinguish between jurisdictional limits and policy considerations when deciding justiciability issues in patent cases. Misapplication of the law, or even mere imprecision in the allocation of jurisdictional and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> engenders confusion among the affected parties – litigants and potential litigants – who then bear the costs of this confusion in the form of uncertainty, higher litigation expenses, and forgone opportunities. Furthermore, when the courts are attentive to the distinction between the jurisdictional and prudential bases for justiciability decisions, {{they are more likely to}} carefully evaluate the policy implications of those determinations. Litigants, in turn, will be motivated to provide courts with more careful analysis. The likely results include the development of better policy and improved judicial decisionmaking...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of “continuing breaches” {{for the purposes}} of determining jurisdiction ratione temporis has taken on particular importance in the past several years. Most bilateral and multilateral treaty instruments include clauses that establish temporal limitations on jurisdiction, but they do not explicitly address “continuing breaches. ” Recently, NAFTA tribunals have considered this question under the three year time limitation of NAFTA Article 1116 (2), but the issue still remains largely unresolved. This paper will analyze “continuing breaches” in both investment law and general international law and conclude that “continuing breaches” are not valid exceptions to established time limitations in investment treaties. Section I will introduce policy considerations; Section II will analyze the specific language of Article 1116 (2) in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter VCLT); Section III will consider international law on jurisdiction ratione temporis and extinctive prescription more broadly, with particular focus on Article 14 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility and the concept of “continuing violations” in international law; Section IV will review the existing jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American human rights systems with respect to “continuing violations;” Section V will examine existing NAFTA jurisprudence that has considered this question; and Section VI will offer general conclusions and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> on jurisdiction ratione temporis...|$|R

Though naturally cold and calculating, William Ferrars, like most of us, had a vein of romance in his being, and it asserted itself.

Everybody talked about them, and they went everywhere--among other places to the House of Commons, where Miss Carey, spying the senators from the old ventilator in the ceiling of St. Stephen's Chapel, dropped in her excitement her opera-glass, which fell at the feet of Mr. Under-Secretary Ferrars. He hastened to restore it to its beautiful owner, whom he found accompanied by several of his friends, and he was not only thanked, but invited to remain with them; and the next day he called, and he called very often afterwards, and many other things happened, and at the end of July the beauty of the season was married not to a Duke, but to a rising man, who Zenobia, who at first disapproved of the match--for Zenobia never liked her male friends to marry--was sure would one day be Prime Minister of England.|$|R
