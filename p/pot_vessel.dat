25|$|U.S. {{fisheries}} use most {{fishing gear}} types. Vessels are often configured {{so they can}} change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as lobster pots to bottom trawls to scallop dredges. The main techniques are purse seining and trawling. Some vessels freeze their catch at sea, such as factory trawlers, tuna boats, Alaskan crab <b>pot</b> <b>vessels,</b> and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land their catches near their homeports.|$|R

40|$|In 2000 the UK {{started a}} Patagonian {{toothfish}} (Dissostichus eleginoides) tagging program {{to investigate the}} spatial and temporal movement of fish and to validate otolith-based growth estimates. Approximately 2 260 toothfish have been tagged and released during groundfish surveys and CCAMLR observer trips. This includes about 900 that have been injected with either strontium chloride or oxytetracycline that places a permanent chemical marker on the otolith indicating the date of injection and release. To date, 51 fish have been recaptured, mostly around Shag Rocks where there is greatest fishing activity. Most of the fish recaptured to date were tagged and released during experimental pot fishing in 2000 and 2001, and have been at liberty from one to two years. Four fish were tagged and recaptured from the same longline vessel in 2002 after up to two months at liberty The fish tagged during the groundfish surveys may not yet {{be large enough to}} be available to the longline fishery and there have been no reported recaptures of these fish tagged at South Georgia or elsewhere in the South Atlantic. Similarly, D. eleginoides tagged and released on the Patagonian Shelf have not been recaptured at South Georgia.

50|$|Traction trebuchets (which may be {{what are}} {{referred}} to as mangonels in medieval sources) were beam-sling weapons, similar to trebuchets. They were used to hurl rocks, burning objects(fire <b>pots,</b> <b>vessels</b> filled with flammable materials that created a fireball on impact), or anything else readily available to the attacking and defending forces. The medieval mangonel was principally used in siege warfare to damage a castle or city's walls and infrastructure, or to harm or harass defending troops.|$|R
40|$|Men of the Thar Desert in the Indian {{states of}} Rajasthan and Gujarat and the Pakistan state of Sindh {{have been the}} {{traditional}} masters of ply-split braiding. They have focused on trappings for camels, including elaborately decorated girths, bridles and other accoutrement, made of goat hair or cotton. Particularly since the 1998 publication of Collingwood’s The Techniques of Ply-split Braiding, fiber artists have explored other possibilities for using ply-split braiding to create vessels and other three-dimensional structures. Most of those innovations {{have been done in}} what Collingwood calls single-course oblique twining (SCOT), which allows great freedom in color patterning because where cords of contrasting color meet, either can be chosen as the surface color. Plain oblique twining (POT) is more constraining, as a given cord alternately splits and is split by the cords it meets along its path. A recentpaper in Shuttle, Spindle 2 ̆ 6 Dyepot documented novel cord sequences that allow a variety of <b>POT</b> <b>vessels</b> to be made with orthogonally oriented cords (which Speiser calls course parallel). The current report describes a very different set of possibilities when <b>POT</b> <b>vessels</b> are made with diagonally oriented cords (course oblique). Particularly notable in these course-oblique <b>POT</b> <b>vessels</b> are opportunities for combining solid and fenestrated surfaces, varying sizes and relations of fenestrations to shape vessels, creatingfootings or handles that are integral to the vessel, and using cord substitution to create blocks of color with complex junctures. David W. Fraser’s textile interests center on structures that are not readily mechanized and the cultures in which they have importance. He has pursued these interests as both scholar and practitioner. His scholarship has included the study of weft twining across cultures and time and (with Barbara Fraser) an acclaimed exploration of the backstrap loom-woven textiles of the Chin peoples of South and Southeast Asia. His artistic work in recent years has focused on ply-split braiding. Building on the work of the late Peter Collingwood, he has designed new cord sequences to permit construction of a variety of novel vessels with radial symmetry. He is a Research Associate at The Textile Museum and a Juried Member of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen. www. fraserfiber. co...|$|R
50|$|Pizarro {{and his men}} had {{the fortune}} of {{ascending}} into the Andes just as Atahualpa was returning to Cuzco after successful conclusion of his northern campaigns. After launching a surprise attack in Cajamarca and massacring upward of 6,000 Incan soldiers, Pizarro took Atahualpa prisoner. To secure his release, Atahualpa pledged to fill a room of approximately 88 cubic meters with precious golden objects, the famous Atahualpa's Ransom Room. Over the next months, trains of porters carted precious objects from across the empire, including jars, <b>pots,</b> <b>vessels,</b> and huge golden plates pried off {{the walls of the}} Sun Temple of Qurikancha in Cuzco. On May 3, 1533, Pizarro ordered the vast accumulation of golden objects melted down, a process that took many weeks.. Finally, on July 16, the melted loot was distributed among his men, and 10 days later, Pizarro had Atahualpa executed.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of rim sherds from vessels of unknown form but thought to {{possibly}} of very deep bowls. The fabric of these vessels is distinctly sandy and usually comes in a pink or red shade. There is a single sample of a large, very thickly <b>potted</b> <b>vessel,</b> whose fabric is a light green buff. The sides of this vessel are nearly vertical. There is also a single sherd that appears to have been from the late ninth century which is believed to be a pseudo Sigilatta style slipware. There is also a single sherd of a grey impressed ware vessel which seems to be of a closed wheel thrown variety, perhaps some sort of jug or bottle. The sherd shows a grey-brown paste and is decorated with tooled incised lines and a walked motif.|$|R

40|$|The STAR {{experiment}} at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) performs {{studies of}} diffractive processes with {{the focus on}} the exclusive production of particles in central range of rapidity. In 2015 STAR collected 18 pb^- 1 of data in polarized proton+proton collisions at √(s) = 200 GeV to measure Central Exclusive Production (CEP) process pp→ pXp through Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE) mechanism. The intact protons moving inside the RHIC beampipe after the collision were measured in silicon strip detectors (SSD), which were placed in the Roman <b>Pot</b> <b>vessels.</b> This enables full control over interaction kinematics and verification of the exclusivity of the reaction by measuring the total (missing) transverse momenta of all final state particles: the central diffractive system in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the forward protons in the Roman Pots. With the use of ionization energy loss in the TPC, dE/dx, it was possible to discriminate various production channels in pp→ pXp reaction. This paper presents results on exclusive production of two charged particles (π^+π^- and K^+K^-) in mid-rapidity region, - 1 <η< 1, with small squared four-momentum transfer of forward protons, 0. 03 <-t< 0. 3 (GeV/c) ^ 2, obtained using 2. 5...|$|R

So we conclude that it was placed in position in these rooms for ornament and decoration. The rooms were used for private parties and for the king's musicians, and these hollow places in the walls retained the echoes and produced the sounds of the singing and musical instruments clearly in all parts.|$|R

50|$|A ladle (dipper) {{is a type}} of spoon {{used for}} soup, stew, or other foods. Although designs vary, a typical ladle has a long handle {{terminating}} in a deep bowl, frequently with the bowl oriented at an angle to the handle to facilitate lifting liquid out of a <b>pot</b> or other <b>vessel</b> and conveying it to a bowl. Some ladles involve a point {{on the side of the}} basin to allow for finer stream when pouring the liquid; however, this can create difficulty for left handed users, as it is easier to pour towards one's self.
