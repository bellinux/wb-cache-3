40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} associations between borderline personality (BP) traits <b>and</b> reactive <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> aggression, <b>and</b> to compare the meditational effects of maladaptive coping in samples of older adolescents (n = 133) and young adults (n = 93), which has not hitherto been explored. This was a cross-sectional study that used self-report measures to assess BP traits on a continuum, trait-based reactive <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> aggression, <b>and</b> coping strategies. In adults, maladaptive emotional coping significantly mediated the relationship between BP and reactive aggression, and maladaptive avoidant coping mediated the relationship between BP <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> aggression; no significant mediational effects were found for adolescents. These findings highlight potential explanations for associations between BP traits <b>and</b> reactive <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> aggression in young adults, and indicate that reactive aggression in adult BPs could be decreased by reducing emotional coping, <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> aggression by reducing avoidant coping.

500|$|Reverend Henry Michell Wagner was the Anglican vicar of Brighton {{for much}} of the 19th century. [...] His son Reverend Arthur Wagner was also an {{important}} part of religious life in the town throughout his adult life. [...] Both men were rich, charitably minded and <b>proactive,</b> <b>and</b> they established a series of churches in poor parts of Brighton to make Anglican worship more widely accessible in a town where pew rental (a requirement to pay to worship) was still an established practice. [...] In 1824, when Henry Michell Wagner's tenure began, there were about 3,000 free places in the town's churches, but about 20,000 people were considered poor enough to need them. [...] Between them, the Wagners funded 11 new churches in densely populated lower-class areas of Brighton, which contributed to the near-doubling of Anglican church provision in Brighton in a 25-year period of the mid-19th century. [...] By the postwar period, as people moved to new suburbs and rising land values in central Brighton encouraged the replacement of houses with commercial and entertainment buildings, many of these churches were no longer needed. [...] Six of the eleven Wagner churches were demolished: only two of Arthur Wagner's six survive, along with three of his son's five.|$|E

In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more <b>proactive</b> <b>and</b> current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her.

[...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest initial vote count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film Where the Wild Things Are. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: Its not about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is easy when you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because [...] "she’s a pretty good singer for someone her age".|$|E

500|$|Featuring [...] "multi-layered" [...] lyrics, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{has been}} the subject of various interpretations; common inferences range from an adventurous {{teenager}} seeking independence from overprotective parenting, to [...] "deeper meaning relating to gender" [...] and longing to be part of [...] "a different kind of society". The overall sentiment remains empowering. The line [...] "Bet you on land, they understand/Bet they don't reprimand their daughters/Bright young women sick of swimming, ready to stand" [...] has been widely interpreted as a feminist statement. Jenny Shelton, writing for Standard Issue Magazine, identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "a protest song" [...] that is both <b>proactive</b> <b>and</b> pro-feminist. Thought Catalogs Zaron Burnett III described the lyrics as [...] "feminist-sounding". One critic believes that since [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was released in 1989 during [...] "an uncertain time for women" [...] amidst backlash resulting from the women's movement, the song [...] "could represent the disillusionment of women in this decade – sick of being told to settle with their lot and placate their dreams of true liberation with capitalist consumerism; in the same way that Ariel has been forced to satiate her true desires with meaningless trophies by her father’s patriarchal subjugation." [...] A number of critics have also identified the song's lyrics as an allegory for the LGBT community seeking public acceptance and a place in which they feel as though they belong.

40|$|Objective: This study aims {{to explore}} the {{relationships}} between various coping types, resilience, and anxiety among older Australians. Particular {{attention is paid to}} whether resilience moderates coping’s effect on anxiety. Method: A total of 324 Australians aged between 55 and 90 (M = 66. 7, SD = 8. 6) were surveyed as part of the study. Moderation was assessed using structural equation modelling and plots of simple slopes. Results: Significant negative correlations were detected between anxiety <b>and</b> both <b>proactive</b> coping <b>and</b> preventive coping. Higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of anxiety. Age moderated both <b>proactive</b> coping <b>and</b> reflective coping's effects on anxiety and gender moderated avoidance coping’s effect on anxiety. Resilience was found to moderate the relationships between <b>proactive</b> coping <b>and</b> anxiety, and instrumental support seeking and anxiety. For those high in resilience, there was little association between anxiety <b>and</b> <b>proactive</b> coping or anxiety and instrumental support seeking. Among low resilience individuals, there was a negative association between <b>proactive</b> coping <b>and</b> anxiety, but a positive association between instrumental support seeking and anxiety. Conclusion: Resilience, <b>proactive</b> coping, <b>and</b> preventive coping are all important predictors of anxiety among older people. Among those who are low in resilience, proactively coping with stress may be particularly important for good mental health. The results of the study highlight the complexity of the relationship between resilience, coping, and anxiety among older people...|$|R

More broadly, one of the obvious advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions".

[...] This election result ended most prospects of an immediate declaration of independence and also called into question whether there really had been an increase in Taiwanese independence sentiment. [...] Despite this, the PRC proceeded with the drafting of the law. [...] The main reasons given to Western interlocutors were that the PRC leadership believed that its Taiwan policy in the past had been reactive rather than <b>proactive</b> <b>and</b> that it was necessary for the PRC to show initiative rather than merely react to events. [...] Furthermore, Beijing expressed residual distrust for Chen Shui-bian.
