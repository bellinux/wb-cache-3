50|$|German author Heinrich von Kleist was {{the first}} to suggest using rockets to deliver mail. While editor of the Berliner Abendblätter, he wrote an article {{published}} on 10 October 1810 which proposed using fixed artillery batteries to fire shells filled with letters to <b>predetermined</b> <b>landing</b> <b>locations</b> of soft ground. Kleist calculated that a network of batteries could transmit a letter from Berlin to Breslau, 180 miles away, in half a day. Later in the 19th century, Congreve rockets were used to deliver mail in Tonga, but the missiles were unreliable. Hermann Oberth suggested using rockets for mail in a 1927 letter, and he lectured on the topic {{at a meeting of the}} Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt in June 1928. The lecture caused many experimentalists to expect the use of rockets for mail as inevitable, and by 1929 Jacob Gould Schurman, the United States ambassador to Germany, discussed the legalities of transatlantic rocket mail with a German reporter.|$|R

40|$|Explanation {{of how one}} {{perceives}} {{environmental properties}} differs between cognitive and ecological theories of visual perception. This study compared hypotheses motivated by which approach (cognitive or ecological) best explained skilled tennis performers 2 ̆ 7 ability to predict tennis ball <b>landing</b> <b>location.</b> Twenty-seven Division I male college tennis players observed two distinct video conditions representing the two divergent hypotheses. Participants viewed 24 video sequences of a Live Model (LM) executing four different tennis strokes, and 24 video sequences of a tennis ball 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory from a Ball Machine (BM). Participants predicted the ball 2 ̆ 7 s <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> by placing a 1 / 4 " dot on a paper diagram of a tennis court and circling their level of response confidence. ^ Results found the BM condition was perceived more accurately than the LM condition along the x- and y-axes and in angular direction. Examination of x-axis responses found contrasting effects for the video condition and side of court (left, middle, right) interactions. LM left side shots were perceived right of the actual <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> while right side shots were perceived left of the actual <b>landing</b> <b>location.</b> Conversely, BM left side shots were perceived left of actual <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> while right side shots were perceived right of the actual <b>landing</b> <b>location.</b> BM Y-axis responses were superior to LM {{with the exception of}} the middle of the court in which players severely underestimated the landing position of balls approaching head-on. Within the LM condition, traditional ground strokes (closed-stance forehands, one-handed backhands) were perceived more accurately than non-traditional ground strokes (open-stance forehands, two-handed backhands). Finally, response self-confidence was not related to successful response predictions. In sum, a limited ball flight trajectory was more informative than pre-contact (advance) visual cues. While important perceptual information is specified in an opponent 2 ̆ 7 s pre-contact kinematics, success in predicting ball <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> may be due to a higher-order variable of optical structure, time-to-contact. That is, perceiver emphasis is on information generated by the ball itself, not by the person propelling the ball. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the reliability and validity of a coding system for measuring serve and return of serve locations in tennis. A notational analysis of mens and womens singles matches at the 2008 Australian Open was undertaken. The results revealed that the inter-rater reports were highly similar on first or second serve (r= 0. 972), serve <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> (r= 0. 999), returners impact location (r= 0. 990) and return of serve <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> (r= 0. 995). Hawk-Eye data were used to validate the coding measures for ball location. When comparing the coded ball location data of the researcher (n= 1) and tennis coaches (n= 4) to Hawk-Eye data, high correlations for the <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> of the serve (r= 0. 998), the impact location of the return (r= 0. 993) and the <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> of the return of serve (r= 0. 997) were registered. The match notation system analysed was shown to be reliable and valid for the study of serve and return of serve strategies and tactics in tennis. This system also provides a template for other researchers and coaches to evaluate game tactics in tennis. ...|$|R

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) is the {{parachute}} system for NASA s Orion spacecraft. CPAS {{is currently in}} the design and testing phase of development. The test program consists of numerous drop tests, wherein a test article rigged with parachutes is extracted or released from an aircraft. During such tests, range safety is paramount, as is the recoverability of {{the parachute}}s and test article. It is crucial to establish an aircraft release point that will ensure that the article and all items released from it will <b>land</b> in safe <b>locations.</b> Early in the CPAS project, a legacy tool (previously used on the X- 38 project) was used to determine a safe release point and to predict the <b>landing</b> <b>locations</b> (the footprint) of the payload and all released objects. Due to increasing test complexity and the need for a more flexible tool, a new footprint predictor tool, called Sasquatch, was created in MATLAB. This tool takes in a simulated trajectory for the test article, information about all released objects, and atmospheric wind data (simulated or actual) to calculate the trajectories of the released objects. Dispersions are applied to the <b>landing</b> <b>locations</b> of those objects, taking into account the variability of winds, aircraft release point, and object descent rate. A safe aircraft release point is determined based on the <b>landing</b> <b>locations</b> of the payload and released objects. The release point, <b>landing</b> <b>locations,</b> and dispersions are plotted on a simple map of the drop zone for easy reference. To date, Sasquatch has been used for thirteen drop tests. Comparing the predictions with actual test results has allowed for significant improvements in the tool s predictive capabilities, especially the incorporation of a well-correlated horizontal throw model. Intended future improvements to the tool include tighter dispersions on the <b>landing</b> <b>locations,</b> Monte Carlo capability, direct input from trajectory simulations, and a graphical user interface...|$|R

40|$|Model rockets {{have been}} {{employed}} in student projects, {{but very few}} papers in aerospace education offer concise summaries of activities at university-course levels. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. The rockets used by our students reached some 500 m (~ 1, 640 feet) in altitude, deployed a parachute, and spent 2 - 3 minutes descending to the ground. We present a series of analyses and experiments that students performed in order to predict the flight time, the maximum altitude, and the <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> of these rockets. They wrote computer programs to numerically integrate equations of motion, and experimentally measured input parameters (e. g., the thrust profile and drag coefficients). Once launched, these rockets could not be controlled; targeting the <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> would thus mean tilting the launch rail to a required angle. The largest source of error in <b>landing</b> <b>location</b> came from the difficulty in modeling wind velocities. Also discussed in this paper are the infrared spectroscopy and the extraction experiment as novel additions to model rocket projects. Comment: 22 pages, 22 figures, 11 equation...|$|R
