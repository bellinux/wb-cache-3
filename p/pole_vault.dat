5|$|None of {{the four}} athletes {{advanced}} past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Evans ranked thirtieth overall in the qualifying round for javelin; Johnson also ranked thirtieth overall in the <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> qualifying round; and Spencer ranked twenty-seventh in the qualifying round for high jump. Additionally, Beaubrun ranked forty-second in the swimming qualifying stages.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} bronze medals awarded {{was greater than}} either the gold or silver. This was due {{to a number of}} dead heats for third position, {{including}} the women's 100 meter hurdles and men's <b>pole</b> <b>vault.</b> Also, a second bronze medal was awarded for each of the boxing and judo events as there were no third/fourth position tiebreakers held.|$|E
5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the <b>pole</b> <b>vault.</b>|$|E

25|$|Initially, <b>vaulting</b> <b>poles</b> {{were made}} from stiff {{materials}} such as bamboo or aluminum. The introduction of flexible <b>vaulting</b> <b>poles</b> in the early 1950s made from composites such as fiberglass or carbon fiber allowed vaulters to achieve greater height. Physical attributes such as speed, agility and strength are essential to <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting</b> effectively, but technical skill is an equally if not more important element. The object of <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting</b> is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights (standards) without knocking it down.|$|R

5|$|Uses {{for regular}} glass fiber include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the <b>pole</b> <b>vault.</b> Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|The French team, {{representing}} the Racing Club de France, included 3 {{players who were}} later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, {{but this was a}} case of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría taking part in the tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes from each of Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot put and the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the <b>pole</b> <b>vault,</b> triple jump, standing triple jump and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish pullers took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot put and discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.|$|E

5|$|The modern event sees athletes {{run down}} {{a strip of}} track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the {{horizontal}} bar before {{letting go of the}} pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, metal or bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.|$|E
5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's floor events in artistic gymnastics, {{there was a}} tie for the gold medal and no silver was awarded. There were also ties for the silver medal in men's 200 metres breaststroke in swimming, men's <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> in athletics, and men's doubles in bowling. Thus, no bronzes were awarded in these events. Lastly, ties for third in both canoeing’s men's K1 1000 metres and athletics’ women’s high jump, {{as well as a}} three-way tie for third in athletics’ men’s high jump, meant that multiple bronze medals were awarded for these events.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events were also {{present at the}} Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and they spread to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began {{developing}} in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the <b>pole</b> <b>vault,</b> which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|After the 2004 Olympics, Komrsková {{decided to}} end her {{gymnastics}} career and try <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting,</b> following {{the example of}} Daniela Bártová, a former Czech gymnast {{who went on to}} set <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting</b> records. However, Komrsková was hindered by her elbow injury. She then tried to join her sister Lucie in long jumping, but ultimately decided to return to gymnastics.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the bar with their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of sports CCAs offered in HCI, ranging from soccer to ten-pin bowling, and from wushu to touch rugby. The canoeing, gymnastics, judo, shooting, table tennis and track & field teams garner {{nationwide}} achievements almost every year. HCI has won track & field championships in most divisions. The HCI track & field team used to hold and currently holds a few national records, particularly in <b>pole</b> <b>vault.</b> Other sports which have achieved significant results over the years include the basketball, canoeing, volleyball, water polo and wushu teams. For example, in 2010, the volleyball team, won the championships in both A divisions (Boys and Girls). Nine HCI students were selected to represent Singapore in the Youth Olympics Games 2010, two of them from the championship-winning basketball team.|$|E

5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he could run the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could <b>pole</b> <b>vault</b> 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; and throw the discus 136feet.|$|E
5|$|During the 110meters hurdles, Maurice Smith {{was placed}} in the second heat against eight other athletes. Maurice Smith ranked third with a time of 14.08seconds. Andres Raja of Estonia ranked second (14.06seconds) and American decathlete Bryan Clay ranked first (13.93seconds). He placed fourth of the 29 {{finishing}} athletes. In the discus throw event, Maurice Smith was in the first heat and placed second out of the 14 finishing athletes, having thrown the discus 53.79meters away. Pogorelov finished directly behind Smith (50.04meters), while Clay finished directly ahead of him (53.79meters). Overall, 29 competitors finished the event. The Jamaican athlete ranked second. In the <b>pole</b> <b>vault,</b> Smith vaunted over a 4.6meter-tall bar. He placed fifth of the 11 people who finished in his heat, behind Belarus' Mikalai Shubianok and ahead of China's Qi Haifeng. Of the 24 finishing athletes, Smith ranked 18th. Javelin occurred next; he participated in the first heat of the event, finishing ninth out of 13 finishing athletes after throwing the javelin 51.52meters. Smith placed between Kasyanov (51.59meters) and Iran's Hadi Sepehrzad (49.56meters) in a heat led by Garcia (65.60meters) and France's Romain Barras (65.40meters). The final event of the decathlon was the 1500meters decathlon; Maurice Smith participated in the second heat, placing fifth of 13 athletes by finishing the race in 4:31.62 between Barras (4:29.29) and Germany's Andre Niklaus (4:32.90). He placed seventh of 26 athletes, concluding the decathlon. Smith accrued 8,205points, ranking ninth of the 26 athletes that finished the decathlon.|$|E
5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} <b>pole</b> <b>vault)</b> set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
