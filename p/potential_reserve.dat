25|$|According to the Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia has {{shale gas}} proven {{resources}} of 574.07 trillion cubic feet (tcf) distributed as follows: Sumatra Island has 233.05 tcf proven resources, Kalimantan Island has 193.93 tcf resources, Papua Island has 94.04 tcf, Java Island has 47.64 tcf, and Sulawesi Island has 5.41 tcf proven resources. In Sumatra Island, the proven shale gas resources {{are in the}} North Sumatra province, Central Sumatra, Ombilin, and South Sumatra. Proven shale gas reserves also found in north-west and also north-east of Java Island. In Kalimantan Island, the proven reserves are in Barito, Kutei, Tarakan, Melawi, and Ketungau. Whereas, in Sulawesi Island, {{there is only one}} proven reserve, which is Sengkang. Lastly, in Papua Island, the reserves are found in Akimeugah and Bintuni. As of 2012, shale gas, like coal bed methane (CBM), is not yet being developed in Indonesia. The <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> of Indonesia shale gas is greater than either CBM or conventional natural gas, with 453 tcf and 334 tcf, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|... 4D Basin {{analysis}} of the Santos Basin has revealed insights about the interplay among the elements and processes of the petroleum system to assess source rock potential (vertical and horizontal distribution), thermal evolution of the source rocks, transformation ratio, hydrocarbon generation and charge, timing of migration, oil origin, quality, and volume of petroleum in the main reservoirs. In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.|$|E

40|$|Using {{ecological}} criteria as a theoretical framework, {{we describe the}} steps involved in designing a network of marine reserves for conservation and fisheries management. Although we-describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, {{but no more than}} four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30 - 50 % of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> network scenarios that all met the established goals...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of its participation {{in the decision-making process}} of the single monetary policy, the BCL, among other things, needs to analyse the national economy. Different parts of this paper address different audiences: in order to expose to the general and non-expert public why central banks are interested in labour markets, the first section begins with the basic link between monetary policy and labour markets. The discussion reviews the arguments indicating {{that in the long run}} a loose attitude towards inflation does not lead to lower unemployment. In addition, the discussion sketches out to what extent the labour market provides useful information for the conduct of an appropriate monetary policy. In the second part, the paper focuses on the particularities of the Luxembourg labour market and its impact on the price level. The standard Phillips curve relationship is altered by a number of circumstances: monetary policy is fixed for the euro area as a whole, while the evolution of the labour market is a concern for local policy makers. The very large share of non-residents in domestic employment is the central aspect of Luxembourg's labour market. In addition, the smallness of the economy is associated with a very high degree of openness in terms of exports and imports. These characteristics affect the determination of equilibrium unemployment and the price level. Since residents' low participation rates are often criticised, the size of the <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> this represents for the labour market is estimated. This <b>potential</b> <b>reserve</b> is very limited compared with the current speed of job creation, so it remains crucial for the national labour market to remain attractive to cross-border commuters and immigrants. The wage bargaining process and non-wage labour costs also play an important role in the national labour market performance. Finally, aspects of resident unemployment are discussed in the light of job search theory. ...|$|E
