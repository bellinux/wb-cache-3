5|$|Sri Lanka's {{electricity}} demand is currently met by nine thermal power stations, fifteen large hydroelectric power stations, and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most hydroelectric and thermal/fossil fuel–based power stations {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable energy sector consists mostly of privately run plants operating on a <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> with the CEB.|$|E
5|$|The nominal 250 MW solar {{electric}} generating facility generates steam {{in solar}} steam generators, which will expand through a {{steam turbine generator}} to produce electrical power from twin, independently operable solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power for more than 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year. Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to a 25-year <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Churchill Falls is {{a single}} {{underground}} generation station located on the Churchill River {{near the town of}} Churchill Falls and the Smallwood Reservoir in Labrador. It was constructed over a period of five to six years from 1966 to 1971–72 by the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation (CFLCo), though generators were installed after major construction was completed. The single generation facility cost C$946 million to construct and produced 5,225MW of power initially after all eleven generating units were installed. A station upgrade in 1985 raised the generating capacity to over 5,400MW. Hydro-Québec Generation owns a 34.2% interest in CFLCo, which is the same company that constructed the generating plant. However, Hydro-Québec has rights to most of the 5,400MW of power the station produces under a 65-year <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> expiring in 2041.|$|E

The company is {{planning}} to expand the capacity to 1350 MW in phases. Tenders for a 350-MW expansion have been requested. A 220-MW power station (being expanded to 2400 MW at a cost of Rs 100billion) owned by Reliance Energy and a 464-MW combined-cycle power plant by GVK Group are in operation at Samalkota (Kakinada Rural). These plants supply electricity to the state's transmission utility, AP Transco, under a <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{two months}} of controversies, New Brunswick and Quebec representatives signed a second agreement, {{reducing}} {{the scope of the}} sale. The Globe and Mail and Radio-Canada both reported on January 18, 2010 that the sale would involve the hydroelectric and nuclear power plant, which would be bought by Hydro-Québec for C$3.4 billion. The government of New Brunswick would still own the transmission and distribution divisions and NB Power would enter into a long-term <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> with Hydro-Québec. The PPA would allow NB Power to deliver the rate freeze for residential and general customers. However, the industrial rates rollback would be smaller than under the original MOU.|$|E
25|$|The company faced {{financial}} trouble from 2002, {{when it first}} approached the British government for financial aid. This followed a slump in wholesale energy prices, a failure to obtain relaxations on the Climate Change Levy, and renegotiations of its back-end fuel costs with BNFL, as well as issues {{with a number of}} its reactors (resulting in much capacity being offline during critical periods of the company financial crisis) and a failure to complete a timely sale of its joint-venture share in AmerGen. Parties to the resulting talks included bondholders, significant but unsecured creditors, <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement</b> counterparties, and a group of secured creditors known as the Eggborough banks; who had provided financing for the purchase of the Eggborough coal-fired power plant in 2000.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} in 1993, during the {{government}} of Rafael Leonardo Callejas (1990–1994), ENEE signed its first <b>Power</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Agreement</b> (PPA) with an Independent Power Producer (IPP) {{for the provision of}} thermal energy. The contract was signed with Electricidad de Cortés (Elcosa) for a period of 17 years. One year later, Carlos Roberto Reina (1994–1998) approved two giant 10-year contracts for Empresa de Mantenimiento, Construcción y Electricidad (EMCE), which itself belongs to the Honduran Terra group, and the Honduran energy company Luz y Fuerza de San Lorenzo (Lufussa). EMCE and Lufussa managed to sign new contracts with {{the government of}} Carlos Flores (1998–2002), which included tax exemptions for up to five years and the payment of fixed and variable charges, the former independently of whether energy was actually being produced, as it is typically the case in Power Purchase Agreements.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to managing gas extraction, KivuWatt will also manage the electrical generation plants and on-sell the electrical {{power to the}} Rwandan government {{under the terms of}} a long-term <b>Power</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Agreement</b> (PPA). This allows KivuWatt to control a vertically integrated energy offering from point of extraction to point of sale into the local grid. Extraction is said to be cost-effective and relatively simple because once the gas-rich water is pumped up, the dissolved gases (primarily carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and methane) begin to bubble out as the water pressure gets lower. This project is expected to increase Rwanda's energy generation capability by as much as 20 times, and will enable Rwanda to sell electricity to neighbouring African countries. The firm was awarded the 2011 Africa Power deal of the year for innovation in the financing arrangements it obtained from various sources for the KivuWatt project. The $200 million power plant was operating at 26 MW in 2016.|$|E

500|$|The PV {{industry}} {{is beginning to}} adopt levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local insolation, 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a capacity factor of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by EPIA, has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years. [...] As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free {{in return for a}} long term <b>power</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>agreement.</b> Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.|$|E

The deal is subject to approval by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (PUC). [...] In February 2012, NSTAR Utility agreed to a PPA equivalent of 129MW capacity, a demand from PUC for allowing NSTAR and Northeast Utilities to complete a $4.8 billion merger.
