Transgenic poplars expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxin gene (Bt) {{were employed in}} the plantation for pest control in China. Field testing of the Bt poplars showed that the plantations were able to effectively protect themselves against damage of their defoliators. To assess any possible risk of transgenic poplar to the ecosystem, {{it is necessary to}} measure the rate of gene flow through pollen and the fate of seeds from the transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation.</b> In this study, we used the Bt transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> (Populus nigra), established in 1994, to investigate the probability of Bt seeds produced by the surrounding non-transgenic female trees, and the germination rate of the Bt seeds in the field. We found the pollen pool from the Bt transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> and the surrounding plantations (22 Bt- and about 1000 non-transgenic male trees) was able to fertilize the female in clonal plantation of Populus pioner located within 1000 m in distance from Bt transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation,</b> and the Bt seeds were produced at the probability from 2 / 1000 at 0 m to less than 3 / 10000 at 500 m in distance from the Bt transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation,</b> respectively. The Bt seeds lost their capability to germinate in 2 weeks in the field, 3 weeks in the laboratory, but much less when they were stored at 4. No seedling survived in the field without any treatment, while about 1. 75 % of survival was found with treatments of irrigation and weed control. These results indicated that the transgene of Bt <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> had rare chance to spread through pollen and seed if not impossible in the field in northern China.

The land use change from NF to PP not only affected the stock but also the vertical distribution of SOC: plowing led to the transfer of SOC from soil surface into the deeper layers resulting in a more uniform allocation of C in the ploughed layer and disappearance of the SOC stratification observed in the forest.

This paper presents the results of an analysis of trends in timber investment returns from <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in the Po Valley. In specific, we estimated how these returns have changed in the last 15 years (2001 - 2015) {{as a result of the}} evolution of the key variables of cost and timber price, and assuming a representative plantation management regime. The results show that, in the considered period, poplar timber investments have had a significant decline, with estimated Internal Rate of Returns dropped of 22. 1 %- 44. 2 % from 2001 to 2015. In specific, the Internal Rates of Returns, when defined and in the base case scenario, ranged from values between 7. 1 % and 14. 0 % (2001) to 4. 4 %- 11. 0 % (2015). <b>Poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> are offering interesting income opportunities only when average timber prices are high, while in all the other cases the investments are at the threshold of economic viability or even negative. The decreased profitability, together with the high variability of potential financial returns, are negatively influencing the attitude towards the investments in <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations.</b> These results are discussed in the light of the recent sectorial public policies. In particular, we focused on the Measures to support plantations of the regional Rural Development Plans, which often proved to be decisive for establishing new plantations and crucial in (de) stabilizing the sector. The lack of a strategic coordination among the northern Italian Regions and the discontinuity of subsidies schemes have contributed to the destabilization of the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} cost-effectiveness {{of poplar}} cultivation and commercial cost-effectiveness of long-rotation (42 -year) <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation</b> were analyzed. The {{aim of the}} research is, based on analysis of expenses and receipts during the period of 42 years and by applying the method of analysis of the project commercial cost-effectiveness, to show the justification of long rotations in poplar plantations. Modern methods of investment valuation were applied and consequently their practical application in forestry was confirmed...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} study was to check the justification of the invested financial means in artificial poplar plantations, based on the analysis of costs and receipts in the period of 25 years, by using the method of analysis of commercial profitability. The evaluation of investments was performed by modern methods which, in this way, found their practical implementation in forestry...|$|E

We address specific policy needs (strategic objectives) for the local territorial planning in the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. The analysis is used retrospectively (ex post evaluation) but our results could also be used prospectively to appraise new proposals of constructed wetlands under similar circumstances. The results reflect that the green infrastructure performs equal or even better than the grey infrastructure alternative for water purification and flood protection, it has a similar cost, and it provides additional benefits (like wildlife support and recreation). The most preferred alternative is the green infrastructure, followed by the grey infrastructure and the <b>poplar</b> <b>plantation.</b> This study demonstrates (a) the effectiveness of investments on nature-based solutions, (b) the potential of green infrastructures for delivering a broad range of ecosystem services, and (c) the utility of integrating different value systems and stakeholders' viewpoints to support environmental decision-making...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the economic and financial rotation lengths for hybrid <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> (Populus x Euramericana Guiner cv. I- 214) in a selected area from Turkey. It was determined the year providing maximum mean annual increment to economic rotation length should be measured. However, it was determined the year providing maximum financial return to financial rotation length should be measured. According to results, the economic and financial rotation lengths have been determined as 9 years and 11 years, respectively. The rotation lengths could be determined according to various factors. For example; many previous studies indicate that economic and financial rotation lengths in hybrid poplars depend on the site characteristics and planting spaces. Therefore, the most appropriate rotation length for hybrid <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> should be determined by local studies...|$|R

The potentially large expansion of isoprene emitting species (e. g., poplars) for bioenergy production might, therefore, impact tropospheric O 3 formation. Using the eddy covariance technique we have simultaneously measured fluxes isoprene, O 3 and of CO 2 from a <b>poplar</b> (Populus) <b>plantation</b> grown for bioenergy production. We used the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to scale-up the isoprene emissions associated with the existing <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> in Europe, and we assessed the impact of isoprene fluxes on ground level O 3 concentrations. Our findings suggest that isoprene emissions from existing poplar-for-bioenergy plantations do not significantly affect the ground level of O 3 concentration. Indeed the overall land in Europe covered with <b>poplar</b> <b>plantations</b> has not significantly changed over the last two decades despite policy incentives to produce bioenergy crops. The current surface area of isoprene emitting poplars-for-bioenergy remains too limited to significantly enhance O 3 concentrations and thus to be considered a potential threat for air quality and human health. © The Author(s) 2016...|$|R
