The elicited immune response indicated that both peptides contain at least one B-cell epitope (as demonstrated by their ability to induce specific antibodies) and one T-cell epitope that strongly stimulated the proliferation of T cells primed with either the free peptide or total cysticercal T. crassiceps antigens. The high percentage of spleen cells expressing inflammatory cytokines points to the likelihood of a T 1 response being involved in protection.

40|$|The Taenia crassiceps {{recombinant}} antigen KETc 7 {{has been}} shown to be effective as a vaccine against experimental murine cysticercosis, a laboratory model used to test potentially promising molecules against <b>porcine</b> Taenia solium <b>cysticercosis.</b> Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of this proline-rich polypeptide, three fragments, GK- 1, GK- 2, and GK- 3, were chemically synthesized in linear form. Of the three peptides, only GK- 1 induced sterile protection against T. crassiceps cysticercosis in 40 to 70 % of BALB/cAnN male mice. GK- 1 is an 18 -amino-acid peptide which contains at least one B-cell epitope, as demonstrated by its ability to induce an antibody response to the peptide and T. crassiceps antigen without need of a carrier protein. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that anti-GK 1 antibodies strongly react with the native protein in the tegument of T. crassiceps and also with anatomical structures of T. solium eggs, oncospheres, cysticercus, and tapeworm. GK- 1 also contains at least one T-cell epitope, capable of stimulating the proliferation of CD 8 + and to a lower extent CD 4 + T cells primed either with the free peptide or T. crassiceps total antigen. The supernatant of the stimulated cells contained high levels of gamma interferon and low levels of interleukin- 4. Similar results were obtained with T cells tested for intracellular cytokine production, an indication of the peptide’s capacity to induce an inflammatory response. The remarkable protection induced by GK- 1 immunization, its physicochemical properties, and its presence in all developmental stages of T. solium point to this synthetic peptide as a strong candidate in the construction of a synthetic vaccine against T. solium pig cysticercosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis (NCC), {{the central}} nervous system {{infection}} by Taenia solium larvae, is a preventable and treatable cause of epilepsy. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the role of NCC in epilepsy differs geographically and, overall, is poorly defined. We aimed at contributing specific, first data for Rwanda, assessing factors associated with NCC, and evaluating a real-time PCR assay to diagnose NCC in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At three healthcare facilities in southern Rwanda, 215 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 51 controls were clinically examined, interviewed, and tested by immunoblot for cysticerci-specific serum antibodies. Additionally, CSF samples from PWE were tested for anticysticercal antibodies by ELISA and for parasite DNA by PCR. Cranial computer tomography (CT) scans were available for 12. 1 % of PWE with additional symptoms suggestive of NCC. The Del Brutto criteria were applied for NCC diagnosis. Cysticerci-specific serum antibodies were found in 21. 8 % of PWE and 4 % of controls (odds ratio (OR), 6. 69; 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI), 1. 6 - 58. 7). Seropositivity was associated with age and lack of safe drinking water. Fifty (23. 3 %) PWE were considered NCC cases (definitive, based on CT scans, 7. 4 %; probable, mainly based on positive immunoblots, 15. 8 %). In CSF samples from NCC cases, anticysticercal antibodies were detected in 10 % (definitive cases, 25 %) and parasite DNA in 16 % (definitive cases, 44 %). Immunoblot-positive PWE were older (medians, 30 vs. 22 years), more frequently had late-onset epilepsy (at age > 25 years; 43. 5 % vs. 8. 5 %; OR, 8. 30; 95 %CI, 3. 5 - 20. 0), and suffered from significantly fewer episodes of seizures in the preceding six months than immunoblot-negative PWE. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: NCC is present and contributes to epilepsy in southern Rwanda. Systematic investigations into <b>porcine</b> and human <b>cysticercosis</b> as well as health education and hygiene measures for T. solium control are needed.

The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries. During phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: East Coast fever (ECF) that affects cattle, Rift Valley fever (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis,</b> that affects pigs and also people, and Newcastle disease, that affects poultry.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the fact}} that pigs {{are part of a}} life cycle, {{vaccination}} of pigs is another feasible intervention to eliminate cysticercosis. Research studies have been focusing on vaccine against cestode parasites, since many immune cell types are found to be capable of destroying cysticercus. Many vaccine candidates are extracted from antigens of different cestodes such as Taenia solium, T. crassiceps, T. saginata, T. ovis and target oncospheres and/or cysticerci. In 1983, Molinari et al. reported the first vaccine candidate against <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> using antigen from cysticercus cellulosae drawn out from naturally infected. Recently, vaccines extracted from genetically engineered 45W-4B antigens have been successfully tested to pigs in an experimental condition. This type of vaccine can protect against cysticercosis in both Chinese and Mexican type of T. solium. However, it has not been tested in endemic field conditions, which is important because the realistic condition in the field differ greatly from experimental condition, and this can result in a great difference in the chances of infection and immune reaction.|$|E

40|$|This English review {{concerning}} {{the current status}} of cysticercosis in Vietnam has been compiled from various reports of studies conducted over the past 15 years, which have appeared in national publications in Vietnamese, {{in order to make the}} information available to the international community. Hospital surveys indicate that cysticercosis is emerging as a serious health problem in the country though most of the information comes from the Hanoi area. Many more men than women are being treated for cysticercosis with most patients being young to middle-aged adults though several juvenile cases have been seen in the south. Clinical manifestations of the disease in humans include subcutaneous nodules, epileptic seizures, severe headache, impaired vision and memory loss. Albendazole has been found to be the best drug for treating cysticercosis though it does not appear to be totally effective for curing cerebral cysts. Information concerning <b>porcine</b> and bovine <b>cysticercosis</b> is very limited and based mostly on passive surveillance at Hanoi slaughterhouses. Surveys for human taeniasis in central and northern provinces indicate a prevalence of 0. 2 - 7. 2 %. However, techniques of low sensitivity were used and the results are inconclusive since it is unknown with which species of tapeworm the people were infected. In addition to Taenia solium which causes human cysticercosis, T. saginata and T. asiatica are also known to be present in Vietnam. Risk factors investigated thus far with regard to transmission of T. solium suggest that consumption of raw pork, inadequate or absent meat inspection and control, poor sanitation in some areas, and the use of untreated human waste as fertilizer for crops may play important roles in Vietnam but this remains to be validated. The evidence thus far collected suggests that a national surveillance program for cysticercosis is a great need for Vietnam. The authors recommend further research on the epidemiology and impact of cysticercosis in both human and pig hosts in order to determine whether a prevention and control program in Vietnam would be merited and cost effective...|$|R

The overall prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> was 7. 3 % (95 % CI: 5. 6, 9. 4; n = 784). The K functions revealed a significant overall clustering of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> incidence for all distances between 600 m and 5 km from a randomly chosen case household based on Ag-ELISA.

40|$|Pig {{production}} has increased {{significantly in the}} Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region during the past decade, especially in rural, resource-poor, smallholder communities. Concurrent {{with the increase in}} smallholder pig keeping and pork consumption, there have been increasing reports of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in the ESA region. This article reviews the findings concerning the presence and impact of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in seven of the ESA countries. Most of the reported findings are based on surveys utilising lingual palpation and post-mortem examination, however, some also used serological assays. In Tanzania, community-based studies on <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> indicate a prevalence of 17. 4 % in the northern highlands district of Mbulu and a prevalence range of 5. 1 - 16. 9 % in the southern highlands. In Kenya recent surveys in the southwestern part of the country where smallholder pig keeping is popular indicate that 10 - 14 % of pigs are positive for cysticercosis by lingual examination. Uganda has the most pigs in Eastern Africa, most of which are kept under smallholder conditions. Preliminary surveys in 1998 and 1999 at slaughterhouses in Kampala indicated a prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> between 0. 12 and 1. 2 %, however, a rural survey in northern Uganda in 1999 indicated 34 - 45 % of pigs slaughtered in selected villages were infected. Additionally, a new survey of 297 pigs slaughtered in Kampala in 2002 indicated that pigs from the central region of the country were negative for cysticercosis while 33. 7 % of the pigs coming from the rural Lira district in the north were positive. Interestingly 8 piglet foetuses removed from an infected slaughtered sow coming from Lira district were all found to harbour cysts of T. solium providing evidence of congenital transmission of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis.</b> In Mozambique, abattoir records indicate that <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is present in all provinces of the country. A serological survey on pigs in rural Tete Province found 15 % of pigs positive. In Zimbabwe, a retrospective study in official abattoirs around the country from 1994 to 2001 reported a mean prevalence of 0. 34 % which is in contrast to a post-mortem survey in 1999, which showed that the prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in rural west Zimbabwe where smallholder pig keeping is popular was 28. 6 %. In Zambia, abattoir records reported <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in six of the nine provinces. Routine meat inspection of 1316 pigs at a slaughter slab in Lusaka showed that 20. 6 % of the pigs had cysticercosis whereas serological testing of 874 pigs at the same abattoir indicated that 56. 6 % were found to have circulating antigens of Taenia solium. Field surveys based on lingual palpation in Southern and Eastern Provinces of Zambia revealed prevalences of 8. 2 - 28. 4 and 5. 2 %, respectively. South Africa has the largest number of pigs in Southern Africa and cysticercosis has been recognised as a problem in the country for many decades. There is strong evidence supporting the high prevalence of neurocysticercosis infecting humans from resource-poor areas of the country where pigs are being raised under smallholder conditions. In spite of this community-based surveys on <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> have never been conducted in South Africa and the last slaughterhouse survey was conducted nearly 40 years ago. The prevalences of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> found in these ESA countries rank {{among the highest in the}} world and the disease is emerging as an important constraint for the nutritional and economic well being of resource-poor smallholder farming communities. The current findings suggest the widespread presence of human tapeworm carriers and thus a high risk of human cysticercosis in both rural areas and urban centres in the ESA region. More research is required in the region to assess the extent and public health and economic impact of T. solium infection in order to determine whether and what prevention and control efforts are needed...|$|E

The disease was declared eradicable by the International Task Force for Diseases Eradication (ITFDE) in 1993, {{and it is}} listed among the 17 WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases and Neglected Zoono-ses that are potentially eradicable. In view of that, WHO has proposed a step-wise approach to its elimination, including chemotherapy of infected pigs. Different drugs have been tested on <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> with varying efficacies. These include flubendazole, fenbendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulphoxide, oxfendazole, prazi-quantel, and nitazoxanide. This review summarises available information on the efficacies and adverse effects shown by these drugs in pigs. Oxfendazole has shown to be effective for the control of porcine cysticercosis; however, {{it needs to be}} integrated with other control approaches. There is a need for standardised guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of anthelmintics against <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis,</b> and more efficacy studies are needed since the conclusions so far are based on a limited number of studies using few infected pigs...|$|E
40|$|Many {{interventions}} against Taenia solium {{are evaluated}} by assessing {{changes in the}} prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> ascertained by carcass dissection. Financial and logistical difficulties often prohibit dissection of entire pig carcasses. We assessed 209 pigs from rural areas of Cameroon and Peru {{for the presence of}} T. solium cysticerci and determined the distribution of parasites within the musculature of infected animals. Considering the presence of cysts in the tongue, masticatory muscles and heart, 31 of the 38 (81 %) naturally infected animals were identified as having cysts. Dissection of only the tongue, masticatory muscles and heart provides a relatively sensitive and highly specific method for diagnosis of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is an {{emerging}} zoonosis with {{public health and}} economic importance. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to investigate the disease in free-range pigs on 182 smallholder farms in Busia District, Kenya. The survey households were selected using a snowballing technique. Serum samples were obtained from 284 pigs of all ages at farm level and 37 pigs from slaughter slabs in the study area. The samples were analysed {{for the presence of}} cysticercus antigen using an antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A structured questionnaire was administered to determine the risk factors for <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> on the study farms. At pig level, the total number of pigs testing positive were 11, resulting in a seroprevalence of 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 9 – 6. 2 %), while the farms with a positive pig were 9 % (95 % CI: 3. 9 – 14. 1 %). All pigs examined in the slaughter slab survey were seronegative. The distribution of possible risk factors for <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> that were observed at farm level was as follows: free-range pig keeping (100 %), history of human taeniosis infection in a family (51 %), slaughtering of pigs at home (20 %), lack of meat inspection (15 %) and absence of latrines (15 %). The only significant (x 2 4. 4, P 0. 034, odds ratio (OR) 3. 8) risk factor associated with the occurrence of cysticercosis was lack of latrines at household level. The study shows that <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is prevalent in free-range pigs in Busia District, Kenya and thus control measures need to be instituted...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled field trial {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg of oxfendazole (OFZ) treatment for control of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> was conducted in 4 rural villages of Angónia district, north-western Mozambique. Two hundred and sixteen piglets aged 4 months were selected and assigned randomly to OFZ treatment or control groups. Fifty-four piglets were treated at 4 months of age (T 1), while another 54 piglets were treated at 9 months of age (T 2) and these were matched with 108 control pigs from the same litters and raised under the same conditions. Baseline data were collected on the prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> using antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA), as well as knowledge and practices related to Taenia solium transmission based on questionnaire interviews and observations. All animals were followed and re-tested for <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> by Ag-ELISA at 9 and 12 months of age when the study was terminated. Overall prevalence at baseline was 5. 1 % with no significant difference between groups. At the end of the study, 66. 7 % of the controls were found positive, whereas 21. 4 % of the T 1 and 9. 1 % of the T 2 pigs were positive, respectively. Incidence rates of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> were lower in treated pigs as compared to controls. Necropsy of 30 randomly selected animals revealed that viable cysts were present in none (0 / 8) of T 2 pigs, 12. 5 % (1 / 8) of T 1 pigs and 42. 8 % (6 / 14) of control pigs.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} map the {{distribution}} of Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis and the co-distribution with schistosomiasis in Africa. These two major neglected tropical diseases are presumed to be widely distributed in Africa, but currently the level of co-distribution is unclear. Methods: A literature search on T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis was performed to compile all known studies {{on the presence of}} T. solium and apparent prevalence of taeniosis and <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in Africa. Studies were geo-referenced using an online gazetteer. A Bayesian framework was used to combine the epidemiological data on the apparent prevalence with external information on test characteristics to estimate informed district-level prevalence of taeniosis and <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis.</b> Districts with T. solium taeniosis/cysticercosis presence were cross-referenced with the Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Database for schistosomiasis presence. Results: The search strategies identified 141 reports of T. solium in Africa from 1985 to 2014 from a total of 476 districts in 29 countries, 20 with <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis,</b> 22 with human cysticercosis, and 16 with taeniosis, in addition to 2 countries identified from OIE reports. All 31 countries were considered, on national scale, to have co-distribution with schistosomiasis. Presence of both parasites was confirmed in 124 districts in 17 countries. The informed prevalence of taeniosis and <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> were estimated for 14 and 41 districts in 10 and 13 countries, respectively. Conclusions: With the paucity of data, T. solium infection is grossly under-reported and expected to be more widespread than this study suggests. In areas where co-distribution occurs {{there is a need for}} increased emphasis on evaluation of integrated intervention approaches for these two helminth infections and allocation of resources for evaluating the extent of adverse effects caused by mass drug administration...|$|E
40|$|Apilot {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 2 districts in Mozambique to determine the most important health problems facing smallholder pig producers. While African swine fever {{is the most serious}} disease that affects pigs at all levels of production in Mozambique, it is likely that productivity is reduced by the presence of mange and gastrointestinal parasites, while in traditional systems the conditions are favourable for the development of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, which poses a health risk to communities. Results of the pilot survey confirmed that, with the exception of African swine fever, ecto- and endoparasites are probably the most important health risks for producers. <b>Porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> is more prevalent among pigs in traditional, free-ranging systems, while mange becomes a serious factor when pigs are permanently confined...|$|E
40|$|Tongue {{examination}} and detection of circulating antigen (Ag-ELISA) {{were used to}} establish the prevalence of Taenia solium <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in free-range pigs in selected districts of Eastern, Southern and Western provinces of Zambia, and to determine if prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> was associated with age, breed and sex. Households with pigs were identified using the snowballing technique. A total of 1691 pigs were examined out of which 183 (10. 8 %) were positive on tongue examination. Ag-ELISA gave a sero-prevalence of 23. 3 %. When considering the factors in a logistic regression analysis, only breed type {{was significantly associated with}} <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> (OR= 0. 72; 95 %CI= 0. 63 - 0. 81). The crossbred pigs were 72 % more likely to have had cysticercosis than the Nsenga (dwarf local) breed as determined by Ag-ELISA. The result that crossbred pigs had a higher prevalence of T. solium cysticercosis suggests that pig breeds may display different susceptibility to cysticercosis. The limited use of latrines in these areas implies that people use the nearby bush for defecation, resulting in pigs having access to human faeces. Therefore, investigation of taeniosis and cysticercosis in humans is warranted to better comprehend the local epidemiology and transmission risks. This should then be followed by extension programs to communities so that the control plans that could be instituted are more sustainable...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{constraints}} to profitable swine production in rural, resource-poor communities of Eastern and Southern Africa {{is the emergence of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> caused by the zoonotic porcine tapeworm, Taenia solium. Cysticercosis in pigs has grave economic impacts through the condemnation of affected meat, and is also a growing detriment to public health and human productivity. Factors contributing to an increased prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in developing areas include poor sanitation and hygiene, free-ranging pig management, and an overall lack of meat inspection. An epidemiological study was recently undertaken to better characterize the prevalence and risk factors of cysticercosis among free range pigs of Teso District, in western Kenya. Three hundred sixteen small pig farmers were randomly selected and their pigs were examined by a veterinarian for evidence of cysticercosis; prevalence among study households was determined to be approximately 10 %. Information on pig husbandry practices was collected from each of the participants via a structured questionnaire. Absence of a human latrine was significantly associated with <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis.</b> Other risk factors surveyed included pig housing and nutrition, local prevalence of T. solium in humans, and knowledge of the disease. Control measures such as improvements in sanitation and hygiene, treatment and vaccination of pigs, and meat inspection should be implemented where possible in collaboration with local populations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{magnitude}} and some risk factors of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in Bafut and Santa, two sub-divisions noted for pig farming in the North West Region of Cameroon. MethodsA total of 499 pigs in 300 households were examined by tongue inspection and serologically by Ag-ELISA. Information was sought on the age and sex of the animals, prevailing husbandry systems, types of feed, the state of each pen {{and the state of}} toilets. Futhermore, a questionnaire was administered to the farmers to determine their awareness on taeniasis/cysticercosis and related factors. ResultsThe prevalence of the disease was significantly higher in Santa (10. 2 %) than in Bafut (4. 2 %), although there was a higher level of awareness in both localities (62. 3 %). Age of pigs, traditional rearing systems (roaming, tethered, earth floor pen, raised floor pen), faecal disposal in the environment and poor sanitation significantly influenced the seroprevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> in both localities. Most farmers (79. 7 %) used a combination of concentrate, grass and kitchen waste to feed pigs. Financial loss from <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> was estimated at 346 900 CFA representing 2 % of total income. ConclusionsControl measures advanced here include sensitization campaigns, periodic examination and treatment of infected pigs by veterinarians, improved husbandry systems, proper use of standard latrines regularly inspected by sanitary officers, and sound hygienic and sanitary practices...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis,</b> a survey {{was carried out in}} 27 villages belonging to two rural communities of West-Cameroon (Bafou and Bamendou). Between January and August 2000, a total of 707 pigs were examined serologically and by tongue inspection. Serum samples were examined for circulating parasite antigen using a monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA) and for antibodies against cysticerci (Ab-ELISA). Seventy-eight samples (11. 0 %) were found positive in the Ag-ELISA and 154 (21. 8 %) in the Ab-ELISA, while by tongue inspection on the same animals cysticerci were detected in forty-three pigs (6. 1 %). Gibbs Sampling using results of these three tests indicated that the estimated prevalence of <b>porcine</b> <b>cysticercosis</b> was 10. 9 %. Analysis of the Ag-ELISA results demonstrated that adult pigs showed a significantly higher seroprevalence (15 %) than young ones (8. 4 %). There was no statistical difference in cysticercosis prevalence in pigs raised in households with or without a latrine. Animals that were reported to be usually confined were significantly less infected (9. 9 %) than free roaming pigs (16. 2 %). Infection rates were significantly higher in pigs that had access to human faeces (13. 8 %) than those which did not have access (9. 1 %).

40|$|The pork {{tapeworm}} Taenia solium causes {{an important}} economic and health burden, mainly in rural or marginalized communities of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin-America.
