50|$|The Pueblo {{people of}} the Rio Grande valley had {{developed}} primitive irrigation systems by the 10th century AD, and by the 13th century {{most of the major}} pueblos had been established. The Pueblo <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> ditches {{is one of the oldest}} <b>of</b> the <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> in North America. These systems used a main acequia (shared irrigation ditch) into which water was diverted from the river, with secondary ditches leading off the main channel named for specific families. Maintenance of the main acequia would be a community responsibility. The Spanish arrived in New Mexico in 1598, and steadily expanded their presence, founding Albuquerque in 1706. The Spanish used Indian labor to extend the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> ditches. Again, once a community grew large enough they would form a community association to look after maintenance. The Spanish were familiar with Moorish irrigation techniques, and may have adapted them to the canals that had been built by the Pueblos.|$|R

It will show that the avaible arable land, together with methods <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> (all the land included in this analysis is subject to irrigation), underwent changes which reflected the changes suffered by contemporany society. These were different system to distribute water: namely the clan system (in its broad sense), the topographic system, and the buy-sell <b>system</b> <b>of</b> allotted times. <b>Irrigation</b> was connected as much to social structures as to islamic culture itself.

50|$|The more {{significant}} left-hand tributes of the Tisza include the Szamos with the Kraszna, the Körös, {{which is usually}} called Treble Körös, because it gathers up the water of several minor rivers, (White Körös, Black Körös, Rapid Körös, Berettyó and the Hortobágy river). Before the great river controls of the 19th century this region was an almost endless stretch of marshlands and fens. Today there is a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> canals in the area.|$|R

For watering gardens a complicated <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> was performed using lead pipes it was made in 1409 by Juan D'Espernou and later in 1414 by John Nelbort of Bristol. As winter was cold, the trees were protected by awnings that were attached to the walls, in the manner of greenhouses.|$|R

Nineveh was transformed into the largest {{city in the world}} at the time. His first task was to affirm his control over Cilicia, which was attempting to rebel with Greek help. Sennacherib marched into Cilicia, defeating the rebels and their Greek allies. He also reasserted Assyria's mastery of Corduene, Cilicia and Phrygia in Asia Minor.|$|R
50|$|The {{soil of the}} Mendoza wine {{region is}} {{primarily}} alluvial composed of loose sand over clay. Mountain rivers, including the Desaguadero, Mendoza, Tunuyán, Diamante and the Atuel Rivers, provide ample water supplies from melted glaciers in the Andes. Nearly 17,000 boreholes are scattered throughout the region, providing the equivalent of an additional two rivers' worth of water flow to the area. A <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> channels, canals and reservoirs (some dating to the 16th century) help sustain viticulture in this semi-arid desert region.|$|R
50|$|To {{the north}} of the village extends the valley of Mesaoria. The land was fertile and was the major source of wheat for the island. In older times, the valley also {{produced}} cotton, sesami, grapes and a variety of vegetables. The land is so fertile mainly because of the river Yialias, which both supplied the necessary irrigation but also deposited rich soil over the adjacent farmland. Water from Yialias was diverted to the surrounding areas through an old <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> channels.|$|R

About a year later, Shearer sold out, turning {{his attention to the}} newly organized Yakima Produce and Trading company, with George Plank, A.W. McDonald and M. McDonald as partners. The company bought some acreage and leased more sagebrush land to develop the 1700-acre ranch near Satus Station. Mr Shearer had a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> ditches constructed leading from Satus Creek to the acreage.|$|R

2500|$|In the Sierra, {{the most}} {{important}} groups were the Pasto, the Caras, the Panzaleo, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Palta. They lived on hillsides, terrace farming maize, quinoa, beans, potatoes and squash, and developed <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Their political organization was a dual system: one of chieftains, the other, a land-holding system called curacazgo, that regulated the planting and harvesting of multiple cycles of crops. While some historians have referred to this system as the [...] "Kingdom of Quito", it did not approach the level of political organization of the state.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} warabandi <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> prevalent in NorthWest India and Pakistan.

This has implications for efforts at replicating the system {{in other parts of the}} region. An understanding of these features is also essential in assessing the prospects and potential for irrigation management reform in the region. The paper concludes by identifying some challenges and opportunities for management reform in the warabandi system...|$|R

The arched superstructure carried across the important road between Pasargadae and the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon.
