5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} <b>propshaft</b> seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E
500|$|Triton {{began her}} sea trials on 27 September 1959. [...] Over {{the next five}} days, the ship's systems and {{equipment}} were thoroughly tested under the overall direction of Hyman G. Rickover of the Bureau of Ships' Naval Reactors branch and Captain A. C. Smith, the Supervisor of Shipbuilding at Electric Boat. Triton generated [...] on sea trials, reaching her design surface speed of , and achieved a surface speed well in excess of [...] [...] Triton subsequently executed a four-hour, full-power submerged run and a crash-back maneuver. [...] The only significant problem encountered during her initial sea trials was the overheating of the lubricating oil system for the starboard <b>propshaft</b> spring bearing. [...] At the recommendation of Admiral Rickover, a hose was rigged to spray the bearing housing with {{a steady stream of}} sea water to keep the shaft cool, as well as a special watch set to monitor the temperature of the lube oil.|$|E

50|$|GKN Driveline is the world's largest {{producer}} of constant-velocity joints, which it pioneered {{for use in}} automobiles. Its other products include sideshafts, <b>propshafts,</b> power transfer units, differentials, AWD couplings, disconnects, electric rear axles, and electric drive transmissions.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} vehicle (chassis no. LDX001) was {{operated by}} Bristol Tramways & Carriage Company Ltd Ltd who designed {{and made the}} chassis at its 'MCW' (Motor Constructional Works) which {{at that time was}} still {{an integral part of the}} company. It was allocated fleet no. LC5000 and registered LHY949. There is a story that the first vehicle originally had two separate <b>propshafts,</b> one to each side rear wheel with the differential at the front of the vehicle. This was soon changed to incorporate the differential into the off-side gear train - a concept still used today by several international bus manufacturers.|$|R

As a solutions provider with advanced technology, innovation and {{a depth of}} understanding in AWD Systems, GKN Driveline is a key partner for the world’s vehicle manufacturers. Within AWD Systems, GKN Driveline offers one, two or three-piece high speed <b>propshafts</b> made from steel, aluminium or composite tubes. Forefront example of this technology {{is used in the}} custom made to order by Ford Performance for the Ford Focus RS launched in 2016. It utilizes an intelligent torque vectoring AWD system with rear differentials.|$|R
2500|$|The tall Bristol {{engine was}} mounted {{forward in the}} chassis, with drive passing along a <b>propshaft</b> {{directly}} under the cockpit to the four-speed gearbox mounted behind the driver. This arrangement, while requiring precise balancing of the engine-speed shaft, meant that weight distribution was as even as possible. Fuel was carried in two pannier cells behind the front wheels, in the position that Bristol road cars traditionally have battery and spare wheel compartments; their central position also resulted in minimal disturbance to the handling character of the 450, whether running on full tanks or empty. The sweet handling of the resulting car was commented on by driver Lance Macklin, when he stated that the Bristol 450 [...] "could be driven without hands".|$|E

5000|$|Early {{front wheel}} drive systems such as those used on the Citroën Traction Avant and the front axles of Land Rover and similar four wheel drive {{vehicles}} used universal joints, where a cross-shaped metal pivot sits between two forked carriers. These are not CV joints as, except for specific configurations, they result in {{a variation of the}} angular velocity. They are simple to make and can be tremendously strong and are still used to provide a flexible coupling in some <b>propshafts,</b> where there is not very much movement. However, they become [...] "notchy" [...] and difficult to turn when operated at extreme angles.|$|R
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{companies}} offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys, who converted vans {{on behalf of}} Ford as a Special Vehicle Operations factory option. The first Transit County models {{were based on the}} Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a Dana 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and rear axle using three custom <b>propshafts.</b> The Transit rear axle was retained, mounted to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305 mm diameter front brake discs.|$|R
50|$|Given the {{successful}} operation of rotary cam poppet valve gear on the Class 19C, {{it was also}} used on the Class 16E. The valves were driven by outside rotary <b>propshafts</b> from turning mechanisms mounted on the driving coupled wheels. The valves were double-seated and housed {{at each end of}} the cylinders, an arrangement that resulted in short and straight ports between the valves and the cylinder barrels. The admission valves were 8 in in diameter and the exhaust valves 9 in. Most of the detail parts of the rotary cam gear, particularly the main drive and reversing gear, were interchangeable with similar parts on the Class 19C. The poppet valve gear gave the engine extremely free-running characteristics.|$|R

The C30 electric delivers up to 150 km under the NEDC cycle.|$|E
50|$|The F4 layout Quadra model {{uses the}} Ford Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 transmission, {{transfer}} box, front <b>propshaft</b> and front differential with minor modifications. The rear suspension {{is the same}} as on the IRS FR model, but the front has modified wishbones to take the Ford 4x4 uprights with their driveshafts.The Quadra has a standard tyre dimension of 225 on both axles.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetically and aerodynamically the T51 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the T43 and T45 cars that had given Cooper their first two wins. The Coopers continued their practice of building spaceframe chassis that ignored orthodox design thinking in having several curved links and the rear-engine layout meant weight savings and aerodynamic advantages over the front-engined cars, which typically had separate gearbox and differential cases, and had to find room for <b>propshafts</b> to the rear wheels. Also {{the location of the}} fuel tanks {{on either side of the}} cockpit rather than at the rear meant the car handled more consistently with different fuel loads, a vital factor during races which lasted up to three hours. One notable throwback, however, was the car's leaf spring rear suspension, although it used a more modern coil spring and wishbone setup at the front.|$|R
5000|$|The Daimler Armoured Car was a {{parallel}} development to the Daimler Dingo [...] "Scout car", a small armoured vehicle for scouting and liaison roles. It was another Birmingham Small Arms design. A larger version designed {{on the same}} layout as the Dingo fitted with the turret {{similar to that of}} the Mark VII Light Tank and a more powerful engine. Like the scout car, it incorporated some of the most advanced design concepts of the time and is considered one of the best British AFVs of the Second World War. The 95 hp engine was at the rear linked through a fluid flywheel to a Wilson preselector gearbox and then a H-drive arrangement with <b>propshafts</b> to each wheel. Four wheel steering similar to early models of the Scout car was considered but not implemented following experience with the Dingo.|$|R

5000|$|An {{example of}} modern {{multi-valve}} engines for small boats is the Volvo Penta IPS Series. These joystick-operated seawater-cooled inboard diesel engines use combined charging (turbo and supercharger, except IPS450) with aftercooler, common rail fuel injection and DOHCs with hydraulic 4-valve technology. <b>Propshaft</b> power ranges from [...] (highest efficiency 59.7 kW/liter for IPS400 3.7-liter straight-4 diesel). Multiple units can be combined.|$|E
5000|$|The Ant used an A-Series engine, {{transverse}} mounted {{and tilted}} slightly backward to allow greater ground clearance and suspension movement. The main gearbox {{was placed in}} the engine sump, as on the Mini. A reduction gearbox took power from the main gearbox to the rear axle via a <b>propshaft.</b> The same layout was used 30 years later (with a K-Series engine) on the Rover Group's Land Rover Freelander.|$|E
50|$|In 1903 {{their first}} {{automobile}} was made. Except for engine, ignition system, carburetor, and tires, {{the car was}} made entirely of Swedish products. The engine used was the German Fafnir, but converted to be water-cooled. Transmission was via <b>propshaft,</b> rather than chain or belt as was the norm. The first car was driven from Gothenburg to Stockholm for a car exhibition. However, finances were grim and only ten cars were built. Production ended in 1906.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} car {{was shown}} {{to the world in}} May 1985. It was powered by a David Wood designed bespoke 3-litre V6 powerplant which used some of the engine architecture of the Cosworth DFV. It featured twin overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. The engine was a break from the norm, as it wasn't turbocharged as the majority of its competitors were. The engine was mounted back to front in the car, with the forward end of the engine facing the hatchback and the gearbox attached conventionally behind it and, therefore, {{in the middle of the}} vehicle. The four-wheel-drive was permanently engaged, and drove separate <b>propshafts</b> to the front and rear differentials. The rear differential was mounted on the side of the engine sump with one driveshaft running through the sump to the nearside rear wheel. Much of the outer bodywork was made of GRP, with the only exception being the roof panels (which were aluminium), the steel doors and the remaining panels from the original Metro shell. The doors were, however, concealed by plastic airboxes. Indeed, models now on show generally have stickers demonstrating where it is safe to push from when moving the vehicle, so as not to damage the bodywork.|$|R
50|$|The rear axle, {{like the}} gearbox and engine, was housed in an {{aluminium}} case. In {{addition to the}} normal function of providing a differential, it also provided the reverse gear, and contained the rear brake (foot operated). Reversing is achieved by changing which of the large bevel gears (these days known as crown wheels) engages with the drive {{on the end of}} the <b>propshaft.</b> Like the gearbox, all gears within the axle are helical cut.|$|E
5000|$|The car used a tuned {{version of}} the six-cylinder Morris QPHG engine {{enlarged}} to 2561 cc. The compression ratio was increased to 7.25 to 1 and a new balanced crankshaft was fitted. Drive was to the live rear axle via a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three ratios and a divided <b>propshaft.</b> Wire wheels were fitted and the 14 inch drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} a version called Golf Country (7.735 cars), co-manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria, {{designed}} for medium off-road driving. It had more suspension travel, Syncro four-wheel drive, improved ground clearance of 21 cm, bullbars at front and rear (generally over a single headlight grille), a skid plate for protecting the engine area, sub-frame to protect the rear Syncro differential and <b>propshaft</b> and a spare wheel mounted externally on a swing-away triangular frame on the back.|$|E
50|$|Sülzer {{developed}} a 6-cylinder, primarily diesel powered, 4x4 {{version of the}} long wheelbase VW LT, of which 156 were built. These were either LT40 or LT45 (rated 4 or 4.5 tonne). Opposed to the normal LT40 & LT45, the 4x4s only had single wheels on the rear axle. The chassis is lifted, 26mm anti-rollbars are added to cope with body-roll and the axles are replaced. A <b>propshaft</b> driven, rod/shaft controlled transfer box was installed under the vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout its {{production}} run, engine choices included the AEC-based TL12, a straight carry {{over from the}} preceding [...] "stopgap" [...] model Marathon range, The Rolls-Royce Eagle 265/300 and the Cummins 290 L10 and 14-litre 350 coupled to a Spicer or Eaton transmission, although all versions produced a distinctive whine from the <b>propshaft</b> knuckle joint when approaching 60 mi/h km/h. The TL12 engine was dropped {{early on in the}} production run, with most large fleet buyers choosing the Rolls-Royce engine.|$|E
50|$|Fitted with a Daihatsu 1600 cc SOHC 16Valve {{inline-four}} petrol engine, carburated or EFI, linked via {{a manual}} gearbox or Aisin automatic transmission, <b>propshaft</b> and differential {{to the front}} wheels and rear axle to provide either four-wheel drive or two-wheel drive depending on the driver requirement. 2WD, 4WD Low and 4WD High are selected using a selector next to the gear stick in the cabin. Full-time 4WD with lockable inter-axle differential version were available, but without a low gear in transfer case.|$|E
5000|$|The HPI Pro 4 is a 1/10 scale radio {{controlled}} {{touring car}} manufactured by Hobby Products International (HPI). It features a centre <b>propshaft</b> {{to transfer the}} power from the motor to the rear and the front ball differentials. The gearbox features a bevel-and-ring gear design, and is made of graphite-reinforced plastic. The car is extremely popular with racers all around the world, because {{of its ability to}} be tuned to different track conditions. The Pro 4 won the 2004 National Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Advantages of the sterndrive system versus inboards include simpler {{engineering}} for boatbuilders, {{eliminating the}} need for them to design <b>propshaft</b> and rudder systems; ease of trailering and shallow water maneuvering (with the drive trimmed up); also, a significant space savings with the engine mounted all the way aft, freeing up the boat's interior volume for occupancy space. This is of particular significance to consumers who are interested in [...] "pocket cruisers," [...] boats which have amenities like a head, a galley, and separate sleeping quarters in a boat less than 30 feet in length.|$|E
50|$|The Hornet is a Lotus Seven copy {{built by}} T&J Sportscars. The Hornet {{was created by}} T&J Sportscars and was {{designed}} to take the majority of components from the Ford Cortina mk 3, 4 or 5. This means there is a choice of 1300/ 1600 OHV Kent or OHC 1600/2000 OHC Pinto Ford engines. All the running gear is taken from the Cortina, although T&J manufactured front wishbones were an option to replace the Cortina pressed steel items. The only items {{that need to be}} modified are the <b>propshaft,</b> which needs to be shortened, and the alternator that needs to be repositioned.|$|E
50|$|An {{attempt to}} make a motor vehicle capable of deep wading for river {{crossings}} and amphibious landing, the Bedford Giraffe was developed as insurance against the shallow wading kits under development did not prove effective in deeper water. As a 'plan B' Vauxhall adapted a Bedford GL by mounting its engine, cab and gearbox on an elevated girder frame some seven feet high, with a chain drive transmitting power to the <b>propshaft.</b> The ungainly but effective vehicle demonstrated it was a viable solution should hastily extemporised waterproofing kits fail but they proved effective and so no specialised type was required.|$|E
50|$|The MT75 {{has five}} speeds and reverse. This {{was the first}} Ford {{production}} gearbox to have a synchromesh on reverse (so reverse can be selected whilst in slight forward motion).The internal gear assembly in order {{from front to back}} as installed on the mainshaft is as follows: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Reverse with 5th gear situated at the rear towards the output (<b>propshaft</b> flange), all gears are of a helical cut with the exception of reverse which is straight cut. Refined over time with slight improvement made to the synchro's phasing out single part synchromesh's on 1st & 2nd gear in favour of three part syncro's.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} the twin-carburettor type 103 H (50 PS CUNA) carried {{over from the}} {{outgoing}} Lusso, for a 130 km/h top speed.Thanks to new flexible rubber mounts {{it was possible to}} replace the two-piece <b>propshaft</b> with a simpler one-piece one, even with the more powerful engine. A Saxomat automatic clutch was available as on option on the Special only.At some point during the Special's production run the tooling was modified, eliminating the decorative ridges extending from the front wheel opening to the front door, present since 1953.1100 Export and Special remained on sale until 1962, when they were both replaced by the Fiat 1100 D.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} formed by two rubber Kegresse track units with a {{multi-directional}} pivot in between. The front unit contains {{the engine and}} gearbox through which power is delivered to the front and, via a <b>propshaft</b> in the pivot mechanism, the rear tracks. A hydraulic ram on the pivot [...] "bends" [...] the vehicle in the middle to steer it—there is no braking of track units for steering as on conventional tracklaying vehicles. The controls are a conventional steering wheel on the left hand front of the vehicle. It can reach a speed of 35 km/h on land and 7 km/h (4 kn) on water.|$|E
