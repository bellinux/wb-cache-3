25|$|The {{apparent}} {{need for}} a propagation medium for such Hertzian waves {{can be seen by}} the fact that they consist of perpendicular electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of matter, so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current that would seem to have to exist at any point along the <b>propagation</b> <b>path</b> of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of electric fields without associated electric charge, or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic induction of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.|$|E
25|$|Sudden {{changes in}} the atmosphere's {{vertical}} moisture content and temperature profiles can on random occasions make UHF, VHF and microwave signals propagate hundreds of kilometers up to about 2,000 kilometers (1,300mi)and for ducting mode even fartherbeyond the normal radio-horizon. The inversion layer is mostly observed over high pressure regions, but there are several tropospheric weather conditions which create these randomly occurring propagation modes. Inversion layer's altitude for non-ducting is typically found between 100 meters (300ft) to about 1 kilometer (3,000ft) and for ducting about 500 meters to 3 kilometers (1,600 to 10,000ft), and {{the duration of the}} events are typically from several hours up to several days. Higher frequencies experience the most dramatic increase of signal strengths, while on low-VHF and HF the effect is negligible. <b>Propagation</b> <b>path</b> attenuation may be below free-space loss. Some of the lesser inversion types related to warm ground and cooler air moisture content occur regularly at certain times of the year and time of day. A typical example could be the late summer, early morning tropospheric enhancements that bring in signals from distances up to few hundred kilometers for a couple of hours, until undone by the Sun's warming effect.|$|E

2500|$|Faraday {{rotation}} is {{an important}} tool in astronomy for the measurement of magnetic fields, which can be estimated from rotation measures given {{a knowledge of the}} electron number density. In the case of radio pulsars, the dispersion caused by these electrons results in a time delay between pulses received at different wavelengths, which can be measured in terms of the electron column density, or dispersion measure. A measurement of both the dispersion measure and the rotation measure therefore yields the weighted mean of the magnetic field along the line of sight. [...] The same information can be obtained from objects other than pulsars, if the dispersion measure can be estimated based on reasonable guesses about the <b>propagation</b> <b>path</b> length and typical electron densities. In particular, Faraday rotation measurements of polarized radio signals from extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona can be used to estimate both the electron density distribution and the direction and strength of the magnetic field in the coronal plasma.|$|E

40|$|A {{difficult}} {{challenge in}} geometrical acoustic modeling is computing <b>propagation</b> <b>paths</b> from sound sources to receivers fast enough for interactive applications. We paper describe a beam tracing method that enables interactive updates of <b>propagation</b> <b>paths</b> from a stationary source to a moving receiver. During a precomputation phase, we trace convex polyhedral beams from {{the location of}} each sound source, constructing a "beam tree" representing the regions of space reachable by potential sequences of transmissions, diffractions, and specular reflections at surfaces of a 3 D polygonal model. Then, during an interactive phase, we use the precomputed beam trees to generate <b>propagation</b> <b>paths</b> from the source(s) to any receiver location at interactive rates. The key features of our beam tracing method are: 1) it scales to support large architectural environments, 2) it models propagation due to wedge diffraction, 3) it finds all <b>propagation</b> <b>paths</b> up to a given termination criterion without exhaustive search or risk of under-sampling, and 4) it updates <b>propagation</b> <b>paths</b> at interactive rates.

The model for the DMC is parameterized by three parameters, a base delay, the coherence bandwidth or delay-spread, and the attenuation factor of the dense multipath component. It is shown in this paper that the distributed scattering contributes significantly to the capacity of the MIMO-wideband radio channel.
