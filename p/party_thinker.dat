40|$|As {{one of the}} world’s largest Communist parties, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M) ] {{considered}} Deng Xiaoping’s ‘socialist’ engineering as {{an experiment}} to circumvent the purely ‘statist’ model of socialism that was failing to manage peoples’ aspirations. The CPI(M) `s experience of being in power in West Bengal from 1977 taught the party that merely offering the people an “intermittent relief program” might {{not be enough to}} retain power. It therefore started its search for reforms based on generating new industries and employment through private capital around 1984 - 85. In the party’s new discourse, the market would take charge of building super markets and socialist policies would look after the poor people. This new communication narrative was constituted by three elements - the state, the party and the market - instead of the old state-party model. This thesis is based on conversations in 2010 with leading <b>party</b> <b>thinkers,</b> work in <b>party</b> archives in 2009 and 2010, and ten years experience as a journalist working in West Bengal as well as other parts of India...|$|R

500|$|Macdonald {{was sworn}} in as Premier of Nova Scotia on September 5, 1933. He was 43 years old and had never held a seat in the legislature. Historian Murray Beck writes that Macdonald's cabinet was [...] "probably Nova Scotia's strongest". Biographer Stephen Henderson points out that the [...] "ministers were fresh, {{motivated}} and knowledgeable about their portfolios", although Macdonald himself had no experience in finance. Biographer John Hawkins characterizes the Liberal party of 1933 as [...] "a <b>party</b> of <b>thinkers</b> and reformers". During the 1930s, Macdonald's Liberals took credit for leading the province out of the depths of the Great Depression. As journalist Harry Flemming wrote many years later, Macdonald became [...] "God himself", the premier who [...] "paved the roads and put the power into every home from Cape North to Cape Sable".|$|R

The serial tale becomes intersected in [...] "Euterpe, Episode 3" [...] with David Carrico's [...] "Fran and Marta" [...] tales ("Suite For Four Hands" [...] in the anthology Grantville Gazette V).|$|R
40|$|Current Indian {{politics}} {{is marked by}} communalism castism and annexation of vote bank by political <b>parties.</b> Ancient political <b>thinkers</b> such as Plato and Aristotle looked at politics as something pious and ethical. Politics was regarded as part of ethics. They were not mistaken. After independence till the declaration of emergency in June 1975 Indian politicians cherished values based politics. They were committed to certain ideologies {{till the end of}} their life. Declaration of emergency heralded a new era of opportunistic politics. All the opposition parties irrespective of their ideologies got together with the single objective of over-throwing Indira Gandhi’s government. They succeeded in their mission under the leadership of Shri. Jai Prakash Narain but as expected they scattered like play cards in less than three years. Janta government fell and the alliance partners got back to their original destinations. Indira Gandhi regained power. Although stable government followed, but stability was provided not by honest activities, but either by sympathy factor or due to defection. Ethical conduct remained a distant dream...|$|R
50|$|Out of government, Fine Gael again {{went into}} decline. In the mid-1960s, however, it {{launched}} a new policy statement, known as The Just Society, advocating policies based on principles of social justice and equality. That document {{was the brainchild of}} Declan Costello, a Fine Gael TD and son of former Taoiseach John A. Costello, and reflected an emerging faction in the party that was being influenced by Social Democracy. This new strand of thinking in Fine Gael {{paved the way for the}} rise within the <b>party</b> of liberal <b>thinkers</b> such as Garret FitzGerald. Party leaders of the time remained conservative but the seeds of the 1980s revolution had been sown. In 1966, Fine Gael's young presidential candidate, Tom O'Higgins, came within 1% of defeating the apparently unbeatable sitting president, Éamon de Valera, in that year's presidential election. This was regarded as a substantial achievement as Fianna Fáil had persuaded RTÉ to provide no coverage of the campaign and the election was held in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising in which de Valera had played a prominent role. O'Higgins came from the emerging social democratic wing of the party.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, the {{government}} set up TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which reduced the interference of Government in deciding tariffs and policy making. The political powers changed in 1999 {{and the new}} government {{under the leadership of}} Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more pro-reforms and introduced better liberalisation policies. In 2000, the Vajpayee government constituted the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) through an amendment of the TRAI Act, 1997. The primary objective of TDSAT's establishment was to release TRAI from adjudicatory and dispute settlement functions in order to strengthen the regulatory framework. Any dispute involving parties like licensor, licensee, service provider and consumers are resolved by TDSAT. Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT. The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS) which was later named as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political <b>parties</b> and leftist <b>thinkers.</b> Domestic business groups wanted {{the government}} to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises. TATA finally took 25% stake in VSNL.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{political}} reformation of “faction” {{in the political}} thought of Montesquieu, David Hume, and Edmund Burke, three thinkers whose works span what Pierre Manent calls “an exquisite moment of liberalism. ” It examines the transformation of faction from one based largely on class to one based largely on political function and argues that as the political emphasis of “party” overtook that of class, a disconnect in constitutional theory appeared between the principles formerly associated with class, such as honor, and the principles now associated with parties. This disconnect is examined {{by focusing on the}} interrelated concepts of political principle, or that which motivates and regulates men, and faction, itself divided into two types, principled and singular. This thesis further considers the role of political principle to faction in each thinker’s thought in order to demonstrate how limited domestic political conflict could sustain itself via a <b>party</b> system. Each <b>thinker</b> recognized that limited political conflict did not weaken the state but rather strengthened it, if engendered by “principled faction” cognizant of a nominal sovereign. Accordingly, it is argued that a similar understanding of “principled faction,” though focused largely on aristocratic ideas of prejudice, self-interest, and inequality, better promoted political liberty within the state and contributed to a greater acceptance of party in political thought.
