5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} the Eastern Bloc nations met at the Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation.

After Jogaila's baptism, he was known in Poland by his baptismal name Władysław and the <b>Polish</b> <b>version</b> of his Lithuanian name, Jagiełło. The union strengthened both nations in their shared opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Żak’s {{repertoire}} of forms {{may not be}} rich, but it is characteristic enough due to make his works immediately recognizable. His style inspired many Polish artists gathered around “Rhythm,” a group which co-created a <b>Polish</b> <b>version</b> of Art Deco. The important feature of Żak’s grammar of forms was his treatment of the human silhouette, which the painter endowed with elongated proportions that had {{little in common with}} those of the real models, a mannerist over-emphasis on contrapposto, and dance-like postures usually ascribed to marionettes or dummies rather than to people.|$|E
25|$|When a {{historic}} document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation {{in an effort}} to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel The Saragossa Manuscript by the Polish aristocrat Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by Edmund Chojecki in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete Saragossa Manuscript have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's <b>Polish</b> <b>version.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, {{according}} to Michael C. Steinlauf, only {{on rare occasions}} did appeals to Poles to help Jews accompany these statements before the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943. Steinlauf {{points out that in}} one speech made in London Sikorski was promising equal rights for Jews after the war, but the promise was omitted from the printed <b>Polish</b> <b>version</b> of the speech. According to David Engel, the loyalty of Polish Jews to Poland and Polish interests was held in doubt by some members of the exiled government, leading to political tensions. The Jewish Agency refused to give support to Polish demand for the return of Lwów and Wilno to Poland. Overall, as Stola notes, Polish government was just as unprepared to deal with the Holocaust as were the other Allied governments, and that the government's hesitancy in appeals to the general population to aid the Jews diminished only after reports of the Holocaust became more wide spread.|$|E
