Additionally, Peru spends only 3.3% of its GDP on education {{compared to the}} Latin American average of 4.5%.4. SKIP’s education program aims to fill the gaps {{that exist in the}} public education system for students beginning at an early age. The World Bank recognizes that “One of the principal challenges in reducing poverty and accelerating development in Peru is improving the quality of education.”According to the organization’s philosophy, “SKIP understands the complex factors and consequences of poverty and therefore employs a holistic approach focusing on four pillars of family development: education, economic stability, emotional well-being, and healthy and safe home environments.” SKIP also works towards the achievement of the 2nd and 3rd millennium goals proposed by the UN, which are that by 2015, children everywhere will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education in all levels of education in no later than 2015.SKIP places a high importance on participation of families and children in their programs and views high rates of participation as key to their holistic approach. Their rates of attendance have increased from around 15 percent in 2008 to 83 percent in 2011.SKIP’s education program focuses on primary and secondary students and provides academic support in the form of Maths, Communication and English classes as well as workshops in other areas such as art and sport. There are about 300 students between the ages of four and eighteen currently enrolled in SKIP’s education <b>program.</b> <b>SKIP</b> states that their goal is to create “an exciting, stimulating and engaging school environment complete with learning structures and tools that promote sound intellectual development and sustained interest in learning.” ...|$|E

40|$|Under anoxia a coordinated, cytoprotective {{program is}} induced, called the {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4) is a mediator of the UPR and activates a gene expression program, promoting tumour {{growth and survival}} under anoxia. A key gene induced by ATF 4 under normoxic conditions is SKIP 3. We characterized the induction of SKIP 3 during anoxic exposure to determine whether UPR alone was sufficient or there was a more complex regulatory response to anoxia. There was temporal separation of acute hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 alpha- and chronic ATF 4 -dependent gene expression <b>programs.</b> <b>SKIP</b> 3 was regulated by chronic (48 h) rather than acute anoxia (< 24 h) by {{a complex set of}} pathways and mechanisms, besides ATF 4 induced by the classical UPR, there was transcriptional regulation by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and RNA stabilization by HuR. Temporal activation of the NF-kappaB pathway under anoxia protected cells from negative consequences of the oxygen stress and involved the canonical signalling pathways that promote IkappaBA phosphorylation and degradation, and reduced mRNA level of the inhibitory protein IkappaBA followed by the translational repression of IkappaBA. We also show that SKIP 3 acts as an inhibitor of NF-kappaB and ATF 4 -dependent transcription under anoxia and provides a regulatory feedback loop. Repression of the survival pathway NF-kappaB by SKIP 3 sensitized cells to metabolic consequences of the anoxic stress. Thus, the response to anoxia is mediated by three pathways independently of HIF, suggesting that combined therapeutic approaches would be needed to maximize effects against this pathway...|$|R

Oktober, 2, 2017, Heerlen, Nederland: Open Universiteit. As {{adolescents}} {{continue their}} educational career in high school, {{they need to}} develop a variety of study tactics that stimulate a deeper level of processing and understanding and improve information retention. Research has demonstrated that students can improve academic performance through study skill interventions, especially if the intervention is integrated in the subject courses. The Dual Study Skill Intervention <b>Program</b> (2 <b>SKIP)</b> is designed to develop learners’ study skills and enhance the teachers’ positive attitude towards the integration of study skill development in their classroom. The aim of this educational design research is to test, evaluate and improve 2 SKIP. To achieve this goal, I examined the most conducive characteristics of the 2 <b>SKIP</b> <b>program</b> and looked for ways to improve the 2 <b>SKIP</b> <b>program</b> to ensure that (1) students develop both procedural and conditional knowledge on study tactics and (2) teachers develop a positive attitude towards the integration of study skill development in their classroom. The 2 SKIP and the study were conducted in a private high school in Swaziland. Nine teachers and seventy five students participated in the intervention and study. The intervention was offered over a period of two terms {{in the second and third}} year of high school. This educational design research triangulated qualitative data based on study tasks, content tests, study skill brochures, a study skill test and focus group discussions with teachers and students collected and conducted throughout the intervention. Firstly, the results revealed a need to refine and adapt some of the seven characteristics of a successful study skill intervention, as described in the literature, for 2 SKIP to be more effective. Secondly, the results show that project team teachers were highly positive and involved throughout the implementation period. Surprisingly the major obstacle, was the students’ resistance towards the intervention. To overcome the students’ resistance, strategies need to be put in place to address the students’ study skill fatigue, the lack of empowerment and students’ negative attitude towards the value of study skill development for their educational career. Lastly, data also indicated a need to consider the teachers’ workload and their ongoing professional development in the re-design of the 2 SKIP. To address the identified challenges the following changes and additions to 2 SKIP are suggested: (1) reformulation of some characteristics (2) a multi-year intervention that starts at an early age, (3) formalization of learning how to study (4) focus on implicit instruction (5) Explicit reflective feedback sessions (6) improve the teacher support component. I believe that this study made an important contribution to our understanding of the design and implementation of a study skill intervention for high schools. The study refined the important characteristics of a successful study skill intervention program. It also offers practitioners an example of how to translate those characteristics into a practical, comprehensive and integrated intervention program for high schools...|$|R

40|$|Background As next {{generation}} sequence technology has advanced, {{there have been}} parallel advances in genome-scale analysis programs for determining evolutionary relationships as proxies for epidemiological relationship in public health. Most new <b>programs</b> <b>skip</b> traditional steps of ortholog determination and multi-gene alignment, instead identifying variants across a set of genomes, then summarizing results in a matrix of single-nucleotide polymorphisms or alleles for standard phylogenetic analysis. However, public health authorities need to document the performance of these methods with appropriate and comprehensive datasets {{so they can be}} validated for specific purposes, e. g., outbreak surveillance. Here we propose a set of benchmark datasets to be used for comparison and validation of phylogenomic pipelines. Methods We identified four well-documented foodborne pathogen events in which the epidemiology was concordant with routine phylogenomic analyses (reference-based SNP and wgMLST approaches). These are ideal benchmark datasets, as the trees, WGS data, and epidemiological data for each are all in agreement. We have placed these sequence data, sample metadata, and “known” phylogenetic trees in publicly-accessible databases and developed a standard descriptive spreadsheet format describing each dataset. To facilitate easy downloading of these benchmarks, we developed an automated script that uses the standard descriptive spreadsheet format. Results Our “outbreak” benchmark datasets represent the four major foodborne bacterial pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni) and one simulated dataset where the “known tree” can be accurately called the “true tree”. The downloading script and associated table files are available on GitHub: [URL] Discussion These five benchmark datasets will help standardize comparison of current and future phylogenomic pipelines, and facilitate important cross-institutional collaborations. Our work is part of a global effort to provide collaborative infrastructure for sequence data and analytic tools—we welcome additional benchmark datasets in our recommended format, and, if relevant, we will add these on our GitHub site. Together, these datasets, dataset format, and the underlying GitHub infrastructure present a recommended path for worldwide standardization of phylogenomic pipelines...|$|R

5000|$|If {{the program}} is wrong, {{there is a high}} {{probability}} that the machine will crash, or ram the tool into the part under high power. This can be costly, especially in newer machining centers. It is possible to intersperse the program with optional stops (M01 code) that let the program run piecemeal for testing purposes. The optional stops remain in the <b>program</b> but are <b>skipped</b> during normal running. Fortunately, most CAD/CAM software ships with CNC simulators that display the movement of the tool as the program executes. Nowadays the surrounding objects (chuck, clamps, fixture, tailstock, and more) are included in the 3D models, and the simulation is much like an entire video game or virtual reality environment, making unexpected crashes much less likely. Many modern CNC machines also allow programmers to execute the program in a simulation mode and observe the operating parameters of the machine at a particular execution point.

40|$|Improving program {{performance}} and resilience are long-standing goals. Traditional approaches include {{a variety of}} transformation, compilation, and runtime techniques that share the common property that the resulting program has the same semantics as the original program. However, researchers have recently proposed {{a variety of new}} techniques that set aside this traditional restriction and instead exploit opportunities to change the semantics of programs to improve performance and resilience. Techniques include skipping portions of a program's computation, selecting different implementations of program's subcomputations, executing programs on unreliable hardware, and synthesizing values to enable <b>programs</b> to <b>skip</b> or execute through otherwise fatal errors. A major barrier to the acceptance these techniques in both the broader research community and in industrial practice is the challenge that the resulting programs may exhibit behaviors that differ from that of the original program, potentially jeopardizing the program's resilience, safety, and accuracy. This thesis presents the first general programming systems for precisely verifying and reasoning about the programs that result from these techniques. This thesis presents a programming language and program logic for verifying worst-case properties of a transformed program. Specifically the framework, enables verifying that a transformed program satisfies important assertions about its safety (e. g., that it does not access invalid memory) and accuracy (e. g., that it returns a result within a bounded distance of that of the original program). This thesis also presents a programming language and automated analysis for verifying a program's quantitative reliability - the probability the transformed program returns the same result as the original program - when executed on unreliable hardware. The results of this thesis, which include programming languages, program logics, program analysis, and applications thereof, present the first steps toward reaping the benefits of changing the semantics of programs in a beneficial yet principled way. by Michael James Carbin.

40|$|BackgroundWith {{improvements}} in technology, electronic data capture (EDC) for large surveys is feasible. EDC offers benefits over traditional paper-based data collection, including more accurate data, greater completeness of data, and decreased data cleaning burden. MethodsThe second Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS 2012) was a population-based survey of persons aged 18 months to 64 years. A software application {{was designed to}} capture the interview, specimen collection, and home-based testing and counseling data. The application included: interview translations for local languages; options for single, multiple, and fill-in responses; and automated participant eligibility determination. Data quality checks were <b>programmed</b> to automate <b>skip</b> patterns and prohibit outlier responses. A data sharing architecture was developed to transmit the data in realtime from the field to a central server over a virtual private network. ResultsKAIS 2012 was conducted between October 2012 and February 2013. Overall, 68, 202 records for the interviews, specimen collection, and home-based testing and counseling were entered into the application. Challenges arose during implementation, including poor connectivity and a systems malfunction that created duplicate records, which prevented timely data transmission to the central server. Data cleaning was minimal given the data quality control measures. ConclusionsKAIS 2012 demonstrated the feasibility of using EDC in a population-based survey.
