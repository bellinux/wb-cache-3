5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts {{to use the money}} to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E
25|$|Layden {{took over}} as {{general manager of the}} Knicks after the strike-shortened, Cinderella-story season of 1998-99 that saw the team make history by {{becoming}} the first #8 seed in a conference to reach the NBA Finals. He replaced interim GM Ed Tapscott, who had already used the team's selection in the 1999 NBA Draft to take injured Frenchman Frédéric Weis with the team's first round <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> Ron Artest.|$|E
25|$|Crevice-gleaning is a niche {{particular}} to dry and rocky habitats. Adaptations for crevice-gleaning {{are similar to}} that of bark-gleaning. Just as the Bewick's wren, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, has a long bill suited for poking around in the small places of woods and gardens, another North American wren, the canyon wren, has an even longer bill, which allows it to probe crevices in rocky cliffs. It also has skeletal adaptations to aid it in reaching deep into small spaces. These same traits are useful for gleaning the sides of buildings, as well. Another kind of rocky habitat is found along mountain streams, where birds such as the Louisiana waterthrush of North America and the forktails of Asia <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> stream-side rocks and exposed roots for aquatic insects and other moisture-loving prey.|$|E

25|$|On June 7, 1974, the New Orleans Jazz were {{admitted}} as an expansion franchise into the National Basketball Association (NBA). Team officials selected the name {{because of its}} definition in the dictionary: collective improvisation. The team began its inaugural season in New Orleans in the 1974–75 season. The team's first major move was to trade for star player Pete Maravich (who had played collegiately at LSU) from the Atlanta Hawks for two first-round draft picks, three second-round picks, and one third-round <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> the next three years. Although he {{was considered one of}} the most entertaining players in the league and won the scoring championship in 1977 with 31.1 points per game, the Jazz' best record while in New Orleans was 39–43 in the 1977–78 season. Maravich struggled with knee injuries from that season onward.|$|E
500|$|Constant {{strumming}} with {{a guitar}} <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pick-guard since classical guitars {{are meant to}} be played fingerstyle instead of with picks. Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell's, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar. In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: [...] "When Trigger goes, I'll quit". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent got there, and bring it to him on Maui. Nelson then hid the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to <b>pick</b> <b>over.</b> But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

500|$|Specialized cases: foliage gleaning; hover-gleaning; crevice-gleaning. The {{strategy}} of gleaning over surfaces by birds to catch invertebrate prey, chiefly insects and other arthropods, by plucking them from foliage or the ground, from crevices such as rock faces {{and under the}} eaves of houses or even, {{as in the case}} of ticks and lice, from living animals. When gleaning the leaves and branches of trees and shrubs it is called [...] "foliage gleaning", which can involve a variety of styles and maneuvers. Some birds, such as the common chiffchaff [...] of Eurasia and the Wilson's warbler of North America, feed actively and appear energetic. Some will even hover in the air near a twig while gleaning from it; this behaviour is called [...] "hover-gleaning". Other birds are more methodical in their approach to gleaning, even seeming lethargic as they perch upon and deliberately <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> foliage. This behaviour is characteristic of the bay-breasted warbler and many vireos. Another tactic is to hang upside-down from the tips of branches to glean the undersides of leaves. Tits such as the familiar black-capped chickadee are often observed feeding in this manner. Some birds, like the ruby-crowned kinglet use a combination of these tactics. [...] "Crevice-gleaning" [...] is a niche particular to dry and rocky habitats.

500|$|The 2003 {{draft is}} known for {{having one of the}} most talented draft pools in draft history. Four of the top five picks are NBA All-Stars and [...] "Redeem Team" [...] Olympic Gold Medalists: Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James. Many players have been in the {{starting}} line-ups of their respective teams; nine have already participated in an All-Star Game, Dwyane Wade was named NBA Finals MVP in 2006 and won the NBA All Star Game MVP in 2010, Boris Diaw won the Most Improved Player Award in 2006, Jason Kapono won the three point shootout back-to-back years in 2007 and 2008, James Jones won the three point shootout in 2011, Leandro Barbosa won the Sixth Man Award in 2007, Kyle Korver set the NBA record for three point shooting percentage in 2010 (53.6%), and in the 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013 seasons LeBron James won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, and the NBA Finals MVP in 2012, 2013 and 2016. Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 NBA Scoring Title and [...] is the only player in NBA history to win at least three Olympic gold medals. Chris Bosh left Toronto in 2010 as its all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, double doubles, free throws made and attempted, and minutes played. The 2003 draft class has drawn comparisons to the 1984 and 1996 NBA draft classes, but is also known for the Detroit Pistons making the controversial selection of Darko Miličić with the second <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> other prospects. [...] Four of the first five picks have won an NBA Championship: Darko Miličić with the Pistons in 2004; Dwyane Wade with the Heat in 2006, 2012 and 2013; Chris Bosh also with the Heat in 2012 and 2013; LeBron James with the Heat in 2012 and 2013 and in 2016 with the Cavaliers. Out of the entire draft, only Nick Collison has played his entire career for the team that drafted him, although Kirk Hinrich, after being traded twice, returned to the Bulls team that drafted him and holds the team record for most career 3-point field goals and is third all-time in games played, behind only Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. LeBron James, who was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, left for the Miami Heat in 2010, but re-signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on July 11, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|After {{passing on}} the 2009 NFL Draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL Draft. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL {{potential}} was much debated. According to former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, who said he could [...] "revolutionize" [...] the pro game. Says Gruden: [...] "Tim Tebow is 250 pounds, and he's the strongest human being that's ever played the position. He can throw well enough at any level." [...] Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> any quarterback in the 2010 Draft. However, NFL analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. believed Tebow {{did not have the}} intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL. [...] "I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback.

2500|$|A small {{minority}} of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, British film critic Tom Shone suggested that Vertigos critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise, and argued for a more measured response. Faulting Sight & Sound for [...] "perennially" [...] putting the film {{on the list of}} best-ever films, he wrote, [...] "Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up to a nice humming shine, and so the Sight and Sound team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case– it's all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> at his leisure." [...] In 2007, poet and critic Dan Schneider criticized the ending of Vertigo as melodramatic and argued that a close examination of the film's plot reveals numerous implausibilities, such as Elster allowing someone who knew his murder plot to remain living and thus possibly reveal the plan, or the police officers at the crime scene not inspecting the tower for evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Dravid was {{a picture}} of calm and patience, as he played yet another {{important}} innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and put away the bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams {{turned out to be the}} chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise <b>pick</b> <b>over</b> Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, [...] "It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, there was a bit of hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. And those things don't happen everyday.". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.|$|E
