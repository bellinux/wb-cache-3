5|$|About one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important}} part of treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two {{areas of the brain}} that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E

Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases.

25|$|Post-polio {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} approximately 25 to 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> survive a poliomyelitis infection. On average, it occurs 30–35 years afterwards; however, delays of between 8–71 {{years have been}} recorded. The disease occurs sooner in persons with more severe initial infection. Other factors that {{increase the risk of}} postpolio syndrome include increasing length of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and being female.|$|E
25|$|It affects up to 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{have had}} {{diabetes}} for 20 years or more.

The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of developing diabetic retinopathy.

25|$|Post-polio {{syndrome}} (PPS, or post-poliomyelitis syndrome or post-polio sequelae) is {{a condition}} that affects approximately 25 to 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have previously survived an acute attack of poliomyelitis —a viral infection of the nervous system—after the initial infection. Typically the symptoms appear 15 to 30 years after recovery from the original paralytic attack, at an age of 35 to 60. Symptoms include acute or increased muscular weakness, pain in the muscles, and fatigue. The same symptoms may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio (NPP) infection.|$|E

25|$|Approximately three <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are {{suffering}} from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis {{is due to the}} long-term effects of alcohol resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E
