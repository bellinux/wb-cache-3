5|$|The great {{demand for}} Harry Potter books {{motivated}} the New York Times {{to create a}} separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels {{had been on the}} list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list. On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. For the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book. Together, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book. In the United States, the book's initial <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> was 3.8million copies. This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8million copies. 6.9million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day. The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} remarked {{that the average}} <b>print</b> <b>run</b> for a book of poetry or prose is {{probably}} 500, though a popular work of detective fiction might have a <b>print</b> <b>run</b> of 2,000.|$|R
25|$|The Parcel Post stamps of 191213 {{were printed}} on the flat plate press which yielded plate blocks of six stamps with the plate number {{designated}} in the margin (designating a particular <b>printing</b> <b>run).</b> Beginning in January 1913, the denomination of the stamps was printed in word form in the margin.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} published for a British audience by Routledge Press in March 1944 in the United Kingdom {{and then by}} the University of Chicago Press in September 1944. The U.S. publisher’s expectation was that the book would sell between 900 and 3,000 copies. The initial <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> of 2,000 copies was quickly sold out, and 30,000 copies were sold within six months. , the University of Chicago Press estimated that more than 350,000 copies had been sold.|$|E
25|$|Others, however, {{reason that}} Houghton Mifflin must have printed the volumes several {{distinct}} times between 1938 {{and the second}} edition of 1951. They point out {{that none of the}} variations could have come about {{during the course of a}} single <b>printing</b> <b>run.</b> Also, thirteen years elapsed between the first printing and the appearance of the second edition; it seems improbable that Houghton Mifflin would not have reprinted the book (presuming the arrangements with Allen & Unwin permitted). And finally, while the bowing hobbit (first printing) version appears on the market uncommonly, first editions as a whole show up scarcely less often than all the printings of the second edition combined.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{of these}} editions saw {{multiple}} <b>print</b> <b>runs</b> each incorporating newly found corrections. Starting {{with the third}} printing, updated table entries were marked by adding a small superscript number to the entry number indicating the corresponding <b>print</b> <b>run</b> ("3" [...] etc.), a convention carried over into later editions by continuing to increase the superscript number {{as kind of a}} revision number (no longer directly corresponding with actual <b>print</b> <b>runs).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{publisher}} {{creates a}} <b>print</b> <b>run</b> of a fixed {{number of copies}} of a new book. <b>Print</b> <b>runs</b> for most modern books number in the thousands. These books can be ordered in bulk by booksellers, and when all the bookseller's copies are sold, the bookseller has the option to order additional copies. If the initial <b>print</b> <b>run</b> sells out and demand still exists, the publisher will have more copies printed, if possible. When the book is no longer selling either at a rate fast {{enough to pay for}} the inventory costs, or to justify another <b>print</b> <b>run,</b> the publisher will cease to print additional copies, and may remainder or pulp the remaining unsold copies. When all of the books in a <b>print</b> <b>run</b> have been sold to booksellers, the book is said to be [...] "out of print", meaning that a bookseller cannot get any further copies from the publisher. If a book sells out unexpectedly quickly, it may be considered out of print briefly when its initial <b>print</b> <b>run</b> is exhausted, but is usually soon reprinted.|$|R

25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore what it might be worth.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1906, Gleizes and his {{associates}} pursue an idea proposed by Charles Vildrac of establishing of a self-supporting artists community which {{would enable them to}} develop their art free of commercial considerations. A suitable house and grounds is found in Créteil, then a small village outside Paris. The rent {{for the first six months}} is provided by Barzun through a small inheritance. In December, Gleizes and Vildrac move in. At the outset of 1907 the Abbaye de Créteil consists of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel himself, like Barzun, appears intermittently. The group is joined by the musician , later to become known as founder of the Fêtes du Peuple. Alexandre Mercereau arrives in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife who speaks no French. The group supports itself through the fine quality <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> by Linard and Gleizes. Occasional visitors include the painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, with New Worlds on {{a stable}} {{quarterly}} schedule, Nova Publications decided {{to launch a}} companion, Science Fantasy. They chose Walter Gillings as the editor; but he was replaced by Carnell after two issues, partly because Nova {{could not afford to}} pay two editorial salaries, and partly because of [...] "fundamental differences of opinion". [...] At the end of 1951 New Worlds went bimonthly, and {{by the middle of the}} year had reached a circulation of 18,000. [...] The price had been reduced to 1/6 with the third issue, but with paper costs rising Nova looked for a cheaper printer. [...] The new printer, The Carlton Press, was supposed to take over production with the May 1953 issue (number 21), but the issue was late, and had to be dated June 1953 instead. [...] The issue was shoddily produced, which dismayed Nova's board, and printers' strikes caused further delays. [...] Nova discovered that The Carlton Press was an agent with no printing facilities; they farmed out work to other printers, but were only able to get their commissions executed when they paid off any prior debts to those printers. [...] Issue 22 was repeatedly delayed; proofs appeared in August, and the issue itself was promised for November. [...] Even this late schedule was not adhered to, and Carnell finally received a copy of the print run in January 1954. [...] The copy was dated 1953 (with no month), and since this made it useless for distribution in 1954, Carnell refused to accept the print run. While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell's, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith covered the conference for Illustrated, a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of Maclaren & Sons Ltd, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. [...] Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova, with a commitment to produce New Worlds on a monthly basis and Science Fantasy on a bimonthly schedule. By January 1954, when The Carlton Press delivered the incorrectly dated issue 22, the acquisition by Maclaren was complete, and Maclaren's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute. [...] The printing press who had actually printed the issue were not paid by The Carlton Press, so an injunction was obtained that sequestered the issues to avoid them being sold to recover the printing costs. [...] Carnell retained the copy he had been sent in January, and it is thought that this is the only copy that exists of The Carlton Press's version of this issue, as the remainder of the <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> was destroyed at the conclusion of the court case. [...] The cover painting, by Gerard Quinn, was subsequently used on issue 13 of Science Fantasy, and all the stories and editorial material eventually appeared in later issues of New Worlds over the next year.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{sold out}} its first <b>print</b> <b>run</b> of 750 copies {{in the middle}} of 1813, marking a success for its author, who then had a second <b>print</b> <b>run</b> later that year. The novel {{continued}} in publication throughout the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|R
50|$|A {{publisher}} {{hopes to}} recoup {{a large amount}} of the book's initial costs from the sale of the book's first <b>print</b> <b>run.</b> A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books in a <b>print</b> <b>run,</b> and their unit price.|$|R

[...] In 2009, Swanwick posted the stories on a weblog dedicated to the purpose.|$|R
2500|$|Leavitt also {{acted as}} {{publisher}} for his early employee Putnam, {{who went on}} to open his own eponymous publishing firm, which became an industry fixture. [...] "Mr. Leavitt is willing to publish the volume I have compiled", Putnam wrote to a correspondent during his term of employment with Jonathan Leavitt, [...] "as soon as he is satisfied that it will be acceptable with the public." [...] In 1833, Leavitt publish Putnam's first book: Chronology, or An Introduction and Index to Universal History, Biography, and Useful Knowledge. The volume, which Putnam had first compiled for his own use, received a then-enormous <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> of 1,000 copies. The book's success, and Putnam's increasing usefulness to Leavitt's business caused the proprietor to advance him to a salary of two dollars per week, and within a few months to four dollars per week.|$|E

This dedication {{appears in the}} first <b>printing</b> <b>run</b> of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, I told my wife {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; then I began to receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. I laughed at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E
