Without management accounting information corporations in Botswana may {{find it difficult to}} create sustainable corporate governance. Methodology:A questionnaire was used to investigate the use of management accounting tools by the directors in the target organisations. The researchwas carried out among listed companies on the stock exchange and the <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations</b> in Botswana. Main findings: Most directors in the organisations don‟t emphasise the use of management accounting in decision making.

More than 1, 000 employees were interviewed in a variety of employment sectors, including state and <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations,</b> formal and informal private sectors. This article reports on respondents' level of support for a compulsory contribution towards a hospital insurance scheme funding care at public sector hospitals in South Africa. The results showed that only 11 per cent of employees supported an SHI scheme if public hospitals remain as they are. Support increased to 53 per cent if preferential access to treatment was offered to those contributing to the scheme. Support was almost unanimous (87 per cent) if public hospitals were improved. The levels of support differed by current type of health insurance. Thus, support for a compulsory SHI tax to fund care in public hospitals was conditional upon either improving the hospitals or providing differential treatment to contributing members. If one or both of these conditions are not met, its long-term success will be compromised. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|A World Bank {{long-term}} perspective {{study on}} Sub-Saharan Africa highlighted {{the need to}} build human and institutional capacity in virtually all sectors and countries. In South Africa, establishment of a democratic government in 1994 saw increased emphasis placed on capacity building. This led to the revision of policies and legislation directing human resources development. This emphasis on capacity development is reflected in procurement policies {{to the extent that}} it is increasingly difficult to successfully bid for funding from government and <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations</b> unless there is both a plan and a commitment to capacity building in the previously marginalised sectors. There are currently no guidelines to support researchers in their attempts to support the intentions of legislation and policy. It has been assumed that researchers have the understanding and expertise to effectively promote capacity building. Under such conditions the expectations of research administrators are neither clearly structured nor are they understood by researchers. Not surprisingly, researchers often fail to meet the expectations of administrators. In an attempt to contribute towards developing a structured approach, this paper interprets what is meant by capacity building in the context of research projects. Based on this interpretation, reasonable and unreasonable expectations with respect to the extent to which capacity building can be achieved within a given project duration are discussed. A model is suggested, which would improve understanding and delivery and in doing so, achieve better congruence between expectations and outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Smallholders, {{especially}} in less developed countries, have encountered several challenges in {{gaining access to}} markets. Market access includes the ability to obtain necessary farm inputs and farm services, {{and the ability to}} deliver farm products to buyers. Market access was less of a problem in the era of the marketing boards, roughly from 1940 to 1990, when a <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisation</b> – the marketing board – tended to provide essential farm inputs such as seed, fertilisers and ploughing services, farm services such as extension and credit, and output market services such as collection of the harvest, quality assessment and buying. Marketing boards tended to issue pan-seasonal and/or pan-territorial product prices and purchased from farmers and traders at several central locations. The consequence of this approach was that the decisions made by producers, processors, transporters, traders and consumers were not fully guided by free market principles and prices as indirect subsidies were involved. Marketing boards were dissolved in the ‘eighties’ and ‘nineties’ in the majority of developing countries because their activities, as a rule, appeared not to be economically sustainable and consequently a heavy burden on the national government’s budget. Consequently, smallholders were suddenly deprived of a supportive institutional marketing structure. This was also the case in South Africa with the repeal of the Marketing Act of 1968 and the implementation of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of 1996 (e. g. Van Schalkwyk et al., 2003) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the relationship between value- and life-orientation and job satisfaction, as well as determining the influence of gender, age and cultural group within the selected South African organisational context. Problem investigated: The success of a diverse organisation in a complex globalised world is largely dependent on the values of managers, their life-orientation and their level of job satisfaction. Managers and employees, in a multicultural and diverse South African organisational context, need to be aware of and manage their similarities and differences in these aspects to contribute to overall organisational success. Design and/or research methodology and/or approach: In this exploratory research, use is made of a quantitative perspective in the positivist research paradigm. Value-orientations of managers (N = 30) at a selected <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisation</b> in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa were measured by making use of the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) (Schwartz, 1992, 1994); life-orientation, also referred to as Sense of Coherence (SOC), was assessed by using Antonovsky's (1997) Life Orientation Questionnaire as well as job satisfaction (JS) using Smith, Kendall and Hulin's (1969) 's Job Descriptive Index. Data were analysed using the R statistical software package (R Development Core Team, 2010). Each of the three research instruments (SVS, SOC & JS) considered in this study were used to calculate descriptive statistics and univariate statistical methodologies were used to test the various hypotheses. Findings and/or implementations: In terms of value-orientation, the value of benevolence (preservation and enhancement of the welfare of others) was scored the highest by the managers, and a significant difference was found in the average value scale score of stimulation (excitement, novelty, and challenge in life) and age. The findings with regard to life-orientation indicated that manageability and comprehensibility were more important to managers than meaningfulness. A significant difference was found between meaningfulness and gender. In terms of cultural groups, significant differences between the average African and Indian and White and Indian meaningfulness scale scores were found. With regard to job satisfaction, there was generally a highly satisfied response to co-workers and a moderate satisfaction with work and supervisors. However, respondents were dissatisfied with pay and promotion. Additionally, significant relationships were found between some of the life- and value-orientation scales; the value-orientation and job satisfaction scales; and life-values and job satisfaction scales. Originality and/or value of research: This paper is based on original research and contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between value- and life-orientation and job satisfaction in a South African organisational context, as well as contributing towards empirical evidence of such relationships. Even though there seems to be a theoretical relationship between value and life-orientation, no empirical evidence to support this assertion has been found, highlighting the importance of this exploratory research. It has also been found that value-orientation is related to job satisfaction, and that life-orientation is related to job satisfaction. However, the theoretical link between life-orientation and job satisfaction has received relatively little research attention in South Africa, and empirical evidence to support this within a South African perspective is required. The findings of this exploratory research will also be of value to the selected organisation, and will provide information that can be used to develop intervention strategies. Conclusion: Managers in this parastatal highly value socially orientated values, indicating a strong in-group, mutual support and a concern for society, reflecting the vision and nature of the organisation. Referring to life-orientation, a stronger sense of meaningfulness could positively influence organisational meaning and managerial satisfaction. Greater job satisfaction could increase the value of life-orientation for managers. In terms of the relationship between value- and life-orientation, negative and positive linear relationships were found. Negative linear relationships were found between value-orientation and job satisfaction, while a positive linear relationship was found between life-orientation and job satisfaction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Public sector organisations {{responsible}} for infrastructure development in most non-industrialised countries, which include infrastructure departments/ministries, <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations</b> and other statutory organisations qualify as project-oriented organisations (POO). There are strong indications {{to suggest that}} these organisations' project management (PM) competencies leave {{a lot to be}} desired. At face value they purport to be fully fledged project-oriented organisations and performing as competent PM organisations, while in reality they are predominantly dependent on accidental project managers. This paper reports on a study that was carried out in one of the large infrastructure departments in South Africa. The focus is on one of the premiere programmes managed by the department. The management of the programme is scrutinised in order to establish the department/ministry's PM competence. An evaluation of the performance of the programme was carried out in relation to the ministry's mandate in order to assess its PM competence. It is found that the programme in its current form could be described as a 'white elephant' and a programme that does not have an appropriate organisation structure, nor appropriate and sufficient staff to carry out its objectives. The programme's management system is found to be very poor and at the lowest level of maturity (level 1 out of 5). Recommendations are made that the programme in its current form cannot fulfil its mandate successfully without a fundamental overhaul, addressing its organisational structure, personnel qualifications and programme management system.

40|$|Thesis (M Social Work (Social Work)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. This {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of how formal organisations can assist on building the capacity of informal community based organisations (CBO’s). Although informal CBO’s are being regarded as valuable resources rendering much needed services to marginalized communities, they are at present still exclude from governmental funding, because they do not meet the requirements prescribed by the state. To obtain the funds which will enable informal CBO’s to render effective and sustainable services to marginalized and poor vulnerable communities, it is from the developmental perspective in welfare crucial to build the capacity of these informal CBO’s. As a point of departure the researcher provides a general picture of the current structure of social service providers in South Africa. This is done, first of all, by conceptualizing “social service providers” within the context of general concepts such as “social welfare” and “social work”. In this respect a schematic representation provides a general picture of the various categories of social service providers involved, followed by a concise description of each, including their focuses, roles and responsibilities. This necessitates that a distinction should be drawn between the government sector, <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations,</b> profit-yielding non-governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations without a profit-seeking motive. The concept “capacity building” is explored in accordance with the policy and legislative framework applicable to the capacity building of informal CBO’s by formal welfare organisations. This framework is supplemented by a description of other key concepts which have a bearing on the capacity building of informal CBO’s by formal welfare organisations, such as “empowerment” and “development”. Emanating from this an attempt is made to formulate the objective of the capacity building of informal CBO’s by formal welfare organisations. From the diversity of the developmental requirements and the obstacles informal CBO’s experience, aims for obtaining capacity building are deduced...|$|R

40|$|The {{unpredictable}} economic ups and downs, {{competition and}} advancement in technology has seen organisations that hold {{a great deal}} of real estate (RE) taking greater interest in the way their Corporate Real Estate (CRE) is managed: with the aim of reducing costs and making sure organisations occupy the right amount of space that is flexible to their changing needs. Public sector (PS) organisations are no exception, with tight budgetary constraints and calls for improved accountability in the use of public resources has seen CRE gain strategic importance. Governments have introduced Corporate Real Estate management (CREM) reforms, giving birth to establishment of RE management departments or subsidiaries and outsourcing of certain RE functions to experts in the private sector. PS organisations have replicated similar strategies to those applied in the private sector such as disposal of surplus property to unlock tied up capital, sale and lease back of property, collocation and portfolio management as value adding mechanisms to improve performance of their real estate. The main aim of CREM is to ensure that the properties occupied by organisations support their core operations. CREM is a discipline that has received {{a great deal of}} attention from organisations in the developed world due to pressure to stay competitive and improve shareholder value. CREM is relatively a new concept in developing countries and has not been studied at all in Botswana. The aim of this research report is to explore the current CRE management practices in Central Government Departments (CGD) in Botswana, and how it impacts on efficient use of office space compared to similar sized Private sector and <b>Parastatal</b> <b>organisations.</b> The intention of this research report is to develop CRE framework that will aid in the utilisation of office in government departments. Data was collected through semi structured interviews, open and closed end questionnaires administered to CRE professionals in public and private institutions. The Report recommends that Central Government Departments establish formal CRE units and the current CRE managers must go for further training in Real Estate management disciplines to improve their expertises in the field. Central Government Departments must take cognisance of the existing national office occupancy rate of 9 m 2 per office space per person and benchmark the use of their occupancy levels against it. It is recommended that CRE managers introduce more open plan office space layouts to improve efficiency in space occupation. The ratio cellular or enclosed to open plan offices is recommended at a rate of 1 : 9. Further investigation is required to establish office occupancy densities across the three sectors using the total number of offices occupants and total useable floor area. It is recommended that the future research adopts a comparative approach that is based on size and similar functions of the organisations.

The inadequacy of financial resources is undermining the efforts of universities to produce educated citizens to engage in productive careers. Public universities' reliance on their governments for funding when there are many competing needs for public resources calls for attention. This thesis is an exploration of perceptions of university academics and administrators and government officials of current and future strategies for funding higher education in the small Commonwealth countries: Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. A combination of human capital and social capital theories was used as a guide for the development of this study. It is a qualitative study whose data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis between March and June 2005. The data were analysed using a thematic comparative method. The findings reveal that government funding, student tuition fees, residence and meal fees and bank interest are the main sources of funding for each of the universities. The governments allocate funds to the universities in simple block grants for manpower development and for providing access to higher education. This is in a range of 54 to 68 % which is significantly different from trends in sub-Saharan Africa. Each institution centrally allocates funds to its faculties and departments in accordance with prepared budgets. Budget holders in the offices of Deans of Faculty and Heads of Department control the resource spending at their levels. The universities prepare annual audited financial statements as a means of being accountable to stakeholders. The study also found that there are some innovations that are either in place or due to be implemented as future funding strategies. In each case government funding will continue, with governments planning to introduce cost-sharing with parents/students. Each university has ventured into revenue diversification or income generating activities {{in order to meet the}} shortfall in government funding. Notably, the University of Botswana and the University of Swaziland have each established a foundation to fundraise with the private sector, international organisations and alumni. Thus, social capital is built onto the universities' fundraising activities. There are challenges facing the three universities. University strategic plans are not being implemented in all three universities. All three universities cannot increase student fees at will. Government requires all <b>parastatal</b> <b>organisations</b> to declare unused funds at the end of the year in Botswana. This has implications on funding for the following year. The establishment of a second university in Botswana poses some funding uncertainties at the University of Botswana. Similarly, future funding may be negatively affected at the University of Swaziland and the National University of Lesotho because the former sometimes approaches the Chancellor for extra funding, a thing that could sour relations between the Government of Swaziland and the University.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with these}} Guidelines is to assist local people and social researchers to negotiate equitable research agreements. This document {{lays out the}} purpose of the guidelines, provides some background information about the process that led to this document, and provides some general principles and practical guidelines for social research in local communities. The Guidelines have their origins in a long process of consultation, discussion and exchange between social researchers and local people, which took place in South Africa over a period of three years (2005 - 2008). It draws on the substantial experience of people living adjacent to the Kruger National Park with research and researchers; also on the collective experience of the informal network of researchers that participated {{in the development of the}} guidelines. Local people have experienced research in positive and negative ways. Some communities in the area adjacent to the Kruger National Park can justifiably feel over-exposed to researchers, while others feel that opportunities and insights potentially generated by research passes them by. Yet even these often feel that some guidelines are required to avoid duplication and negative engagement. Important is to mention that the engagement between social researchers and communities is not a matter of these two groups alone. Many facilitating, structurating stakeholders such as NGOs, <b>parastatals</b> conservation <b>organisations</b> and government organisations, are important influencing players in this engagement. Therefore, while the guidelines focus specifically on researcher-community interactions, these other players should not be forgotten and should themselves be aware of their effects in these interactions. The guidelines outline opportunities and constraints that arise when local people and social researchers engage one another. The guidelines are not prescriptive, but raise issues and suggest ways in which these can be dealt with...|$|R

These challenges are further aggravated by factors such the increasing volumes of waste, landfills that {{are running out of}} capacity and scarcity of suitable land to construct new landfill sites. The National Waste Management Strategy requires participation from all members of society including households, businesses, community <b>organisations,</b> nongovernmental <b>organisations,</b> <b>parastatals</b> and the three spheres of government, to promote practices that minimise the volumes of waste generated. The purpose of the research was to assess and investigate the current waste management practices at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), and recommend a waste management system. The research employed a quantitative approach, where participants were asked to complete a survey questionnaire. A literature review was conducted on waste management at higher learning institutions, with particular focus on the contribution that a university can make in alleviating some of the adverse effects of waste management. The outcome of the review highlighted some of the opportunities and barriers that can either disrupt or augment the process of implementing a waste management system. The results from the research revealed that CPUT does not conform to the hierarchy of waste management, and there is no waste management policy in place. The effect of this is that the stakeholders were not satisfied with the lack of leadership on waste related challenges. By developing a policy, providing leadership, conducting awareness campaigns and prioritising environmental challenges such responsible management waste, could improve the image of the institution in the eyes if its stakeholders...|$|R

The main impetus for growth will have to come from the mining and industrial sectors, which will have to {{play a key role in}} the future South African economy. The activities of these sectors markedly influence the quality and quantity of natural resources in the country. Sustainable development should be the ultimate goal of any development strategy. The question is how businesses should organise themselves to achieve the goal of sustainable development, with cleaner and ecologically more efficient production. This study first analyses the unique features of resource economics in South Africa. It then discusses the integration of sustainable development within an excavatory and production environment. Finally an appropriate business management philosophy will be outlined. 1. Resource Economics in South Africa The importance of resource economics in South Africa is acknowledged by a small but rapidly growing group of academics, non-governmental <b>organisations,</b> <b>parastatals</b> and state departments. Numerous workshops*(2) were frequently held in an effort to bolster support for the subject, guide research and develop the approach that should be followed in future. Research was to cover, amongst other things, the valuation of bio-diversification, environmental accounting, market-based incentives and direct command-and-control measures, sustainable water management and the sustainable management of wilderness areas. Unfortunately, not much progress has been made so far beyond the point of discussion and research. The lack of progress is largely due to the fact that the environmental milieu in South Africa is characterised by various unique and even conflicting features. The way in which the features of the environmental milieu are going to be managed determines the success rate of and the course of the future development of resource economics. Six features will be discussed here...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Abstract: Universities {{exist to}} create a forum in which students, {{researchers}} and professors can engage on any issue without fear of official repercussions or judgments. Universities {{are part of the}} bigger picture in any country where technical skills are a prerequisite for economic activity. Higher education institutions should be seen as autonomous and independent of the government, and those associated with it should be able to express their views freely. None of this is possible without the funding that allows Universities {{to create a}}n enabling environment for students and academics. Student funding lies at the core of a University’s existence. Student funding is a key factor in determining whether students attend tertiary institutions or stay at home and look for employment opportunities. It is for these reasons that this researcher seeks to attain a broader understanding of student funding dynamics in the South African context. There are three income sources for Public Higher Universities: firstly, government funds, which take the form of subsidy grants and earmarked grants; secondly, tuition fees that are charged to the student’s account; thirdly, private income which is derived from investments, donations and commercialising research work. The decline in government subsidies is one rationale for Universities increasing their tuition fees. Consequently, some Universities have priced their fees out of the market, resulting in various instability in the higher education sector and University campuses. This dilemma is a justifiable reason for engagement on matters of current student funding allocations. Analysing the trends of student funding in South African Universities provides a clear understanding of whether the current student funding model, as applied by the government, is effective or not. This study seeks to gather ideas on the sustainability of the current student funding model and leverage on the outcomes of the research to improve on the current model. The student funding trends are also applied to other, supplementary sources of student funding, such as external sponsorships from corporate companies, government, <b>parastatals</b> and non-profit <b>organisations.</b> Previous studies have been conducted by the South African government on the form of student funding [...] ...|$|R
