5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to <b>pay.</b> Craig insists that he will <b>pay,</b> as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to <b>pay</b> as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to <b>pay.</b> He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to <b>pay,</b> restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to <b>pay,</b> but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to <b>pay</b> as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E

5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of <b>pay</b> between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry.

50|$|There are six {{regional}} Vins de <b>Pays,</b> which cover {{large areas}} of France. The most voluminous contributor to this category of wines is Vin de <b>Pays</b> d'Oc, from the Languedoc-Roussillon area in Mediterranean France. The second largest volume of Vin de <b>Pays</b> wines is produced as Vin de <b>Pays</b> de la Loire, a designation that applies to wines from the whole Loire Valley. The others are: Vin de <b>Pays</b> du Comté Tolosan (south-west), Vin de <b>Pays</b> de Méditerranée (south-east, Provence and Corsica) and Vin de <b>Pays</b> des Comtés Rhodaniens (Rhone valley). Two further regional Vin de <b>Pays</b> designations, Vin de <b>Pays</b> de l'Atlantique (Bordeaux and Charentes (Cognac)) and Vin de <b>Pays</b> Vignobles de France (all of wine-making France) were approved by French authorities in 2007, but (together with Vin de <b>Pays</b> de Gaules for the Beaujolais region) remain disputed and as of July 2009, they remained unpublished in the Official Journal of the European Union due to actions taken by other French wine producers.

The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's <b>pay</b> on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the <b>pay</b> window and the woman behind Ferguson in the <b>pay</b> line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse <b>pay</b> that day.|$|E
