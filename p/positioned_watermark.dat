40|$|In {{this work}} we propose {{improvements}} to the preliminary investigation on <b>position</b> based <b>watermarking</b> [7] by proposing an informed insertion approach. In addition, we see how these modifications bring even higher fidelity {{in comparison to the}} original work, and how the system may become reasonably robust to some common image processing operations. Regarding robustness, we also show how the proposed system may have an unique approach when dealing with collusion attacks. Usually in watermarking systems, the information to be transmitted is related to the watermark sequence itself. In contrast, in <b>position</b> based <b>watermarking,</b> the information is given by the <b>watermark</b> <b>position</b> in the image. In the informed embedding method for <b>position</b> based <b>watermarking</b> introduced here, an optimization criteria to choose the best among the available positions is suggested, improving considerably the system's performance.

40|$|With the {{development}} of information security, the traditional encryption algorithm for image has been far from ensuring the security of image in the transmission. This paper presents a new image watermarking scheme based on Arnold Transform (AT) and Fuzzy Smooth Support Vector Machine (FSSVM). First of all, improved AT (IAT) is obtained by adding variables and expanding transformation space, and FSSVM is proposed by introducing fuzzy membership degree. The embedding <b>positions</b> of <b>watermark</b> are obtained from IAT, and the pixel values are embedded in carrier image by quantization embedding rules. Then, the watermark can be embedded in carrier image. In order to realize blind extraction of watermark, FSSVM model is used to find the embedding <b>positions</b> of <b>watermark,</b> and the pixel values are extracted by using quantization extraction rules. Through using improved Arnold inverse transformation for embedding <b>positions,</b> the <b>watermark</b> coordinates can be calculated, and the extraction of watermark is carried out. Compared with other watermarking techniques, the presented scheme can promote the security by adding more secret keys, and the imperceptibility of watermark is improved by introducing quantization rules.

According to the basic analysis of digi tal image watermarking the digital watermarking model consists of two modules, which are watermark embedding module and watermark extraction and detection module Since {{it is known that}} digital image transmitted and spread over the network so there is a chance of being polluted by the noise or it may be attacked by the malicious users. The watermark embedded in the digital image may be incorrectly detected due to shortage of algorithms, so to precisely <b>position</b> the <b>watermark</b> is the main issue. A review to Digital watermarking is being presented in the paper and a novel <b>watermark</b> <b>positioning</b> approach is proposed in this paper which uses the statistical characteristics of the pixels to embed the watermark into brightness values of the pixels using image segmentation on the Windows platform using Matlab programming language...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{watermark}} embedding and extracting method for blind watermarking. It uses {{the characteristics of}} a scalar quantizer to comply with the recommendation in JPEG, MPEG series, or JPEG 2000. Our method performs embedding of a watermark bit by shifting the corresponding frequency transform coefficient (the <b>watermark</b> <b>position)</b> to a quantization index according to the value of the watermark bit, which prevents from losing the watermark information during the data compression process. The watermark can be embedded simultaneously to the quantization process without an additional process for watermarking, which means it can be performed at the same speed to the compression process. In the embedding process, a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is used to hide the watermark informations and the <b>watermark</b> <b>positions.</b> The experimental results showed that the proposed method satisfies enough robustness and imperceptibility that are the major requirements for watermarking...|$|R

30|$|When extracting {{watermark}}, {{we decide}} whether watermark is embedded or {{not based on}} the characteristics of bit streams. If the C 6 bit is 0, the watermark is extracted from the lowest position of bits; if the C 6 bit is 1, there is no watermark in bit stream. If reaching the end of the frame but the extracted watermarks are less than 66 bits, then return to a starting point and extract watermark in the C 6 = 1 <b>position</b> until the <b>watermark</b> bits extracted are up to 66 bits.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} in the previous sections, {{the location of the}} watermarked pixel was tested according to the range of each bit-plane. Thus, if the pixel value was located {{at the edge of the}} ranges, any small change by the attacks was found to move the pixel from one range to another, and the watermark could not be extracted. On the other hand, if the watermarked pixel was in the middle of the range, any effect on the pixel by attacks would then make it difficult to move the selected bit to another range, and the bit could be extracted correctly. The balance between robustness and the quality of the watermarked image was accomplished by <b>positioning</b> the <b>watermarked</b> pixel away from the edge of the range. The best bias value (the threshold value) between the middle and the edge of the range was found to survive against different types of attack and, at the same time, to retain the best image quality. Assume that the bias value (X) is the minimum distance from the <b>position</b> of the <b>watermarked</b> pixel P′ to the edge of the range, which is closer to the original pixel. This arrangement means that if the distance from the pixel to the edge of the range is greater than the bias value, the position of the pixel will not change. In contrast, if the distance from the pixel to the edge of the range is smaller than the bias value, the position of the pixel will change to be as far as the bias value. The PSNR and the NCC for the proposed method of all of the possible bias values (X) were calculated after applying the chosen attacks, for all of the eight bit-planes. These calculated values were used to build the first MLPNN model for predicting the limiting values for PSNR and NCC.|$|R

To increase the robustness and imperceptibility, various modifications in LSB technique have been proposed by changing the embedding <b>positions.</b> The time-domain <b>watermarking</b> techniques are found in [5 – 11].

30|$|In [10], genetic {{algorithm}} optimization principles are employed {{and the strength}} of the watermark is controlled locally and according to the visual properties. The scheme is invisible to the human eyes and robust {{to a wide variety of}} common attacks. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is slow and not suited for real-time applications. A blind and highly robust watermarking scheme method for ownership verification and copyright protection has been presented in [11]. Watermarking is performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Laplacian pyramid in contourlet transform. Wherever, it offers low payload. In [12], a novel blind watermarking algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is performed in DCT domain, using the correlation between two DCT coefficients of adjacent blocks in the same <b>position.</b> The <b>watermarking</b> algorithm is tested for some attacks, including JPEG compression, cropping, rotation, contrast enhancement, brightening, and sharpening. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is unable to embed a watermark bit in all the blocks, resulting in low capacity. In order to improve the payload capacity, all the blocks are used for the embedding purpose in [13]. The robustness of the proposed scheme has been examined for various singular and hybrid attacks, and a watermark of good quality is extracted even after various simultaneous attacks on the system.|$|R

The perception layer of IoT {{plays an important}} role as a link between the IoT and the real world; the security has become a bottleneck restricting the further development of IoT.

In this paper, a novel lightweight data integrity protection scheme based on fragile watermark is proposed to solve the contradiction between the security and restricted resource of perception layer. To improve the security, we design a <b>position</b> random <b>watermark</b> (PRW) strategy to calculate the embedding position by temporal dynamics of sensing data. The digital watermark is generated by one-way hash function SHA- 1 before embedding to the dynamic computed position. In this way, the security vulnerabilities introduced by fixed embedding position can not only be solved effectively, but also achieve zero disturbance to the data.

40|$|Digital {{watermarking}} is {{the practice}} of inserting a signal, known as the watermark, into an original signal in an imperceptible manner. The watermark encodes or represents information that can protect the watermarked signal, typically identifying the owner (source) or the intended recipient (destination) of the signal. The embedded watermark may be detected by using a watermark detector, which enables an application {{to react to the}} presence (or absence) of the watermark in a signal. However, the watermarked signal may be processed, or attacked, prior to watermark detection. Attacks may remove the embedded watermark or make the watermark more difficult to detect. ^ One type of attack that has received considerable attention is synchronization attacks. A synchronization attack confuses the watermark detector by re-positioning the embedded watermark. Most watermark detectors will fail to detect the water mark embedded in the attacked signal unless the <b>position</b> of the <b>watermark</b> can be identified. This is a significant vulnerability in robust watermark detection. The process of identifying the <b>position</b> of the <b>watermark</b> is known as watermark detector synchronization. ^ A new framework is developed for temporal synchronization in blind symmetric video watermarking. Embedding and detection models are proposed that encompass the behavior of many video watermarking techniques. These models demonstrate that synchronization is challenging when the watermark lacks redundancy, but also that efficient synchronization can be achieved by designing the watermark with temporal redundancy. The temporal synchronization models are adapted to spatial synchronization in still image watermarks. For spatial synchronization, redundancy is obtained by constructing a watermark which induces a pattern in the auto-correlation. Experimental results support the theoretical foundations for both temporal and spatial synchronization. ^ In addition, earlier exploration in watermarking {{led to the development of}} a semi-fragile watermarking technique for image authentication. The semi-fragile technique is capable of detecting significant alterations to the watermarked image, but is tolerant to lossy JPEG compression and other, more subtle alterations. This earlier work is not related to watermark synchronization. ...|$|R

Swarm intelligence based Fuzzy C-means (SI-FCM) clustering method is employed to determine the motion vectors and the <b>positions</b> of the <b>watermarks.</b> The proposed scheme has two merits. First, the watermarking strategy does not involve manually setting the location of the watermark bits. Second, the proposed special exclusive-OR operation closely relates the watermark bit to the context of video, preventing attackers from discovering the real watermark length of each frame. Therefore, the proposed approach is highly secure. Video watermarking is achieved using swarm intelligence based FCM clustering which provides a different view from the conventional thresholding method of determining watermark embedding for motion vectors. Experimental results reveal that the watermarked video retains satisfactory quality with very low degradation. ...|$|R

30|$|Analogous to the {{embedding}} process, primarily, {{the orientation}} of the feature region is computed and then the tree-split approach is applied to the post-NSCT region. In the tree split process, assuming that if the region is segregated into n blocks, the formula (3) is applied to every block for obtaining the corresponding watermark bit information. Moreover, this process would result in the capturing of n watermark images. Besides, the segregated blocks containing no high-frequency information are utilized for voting the matching bit; and lastly, the block corresponding to the matching bit is found. The standard of voting determines the captured bit, if 0 is voted, so the matching bit would be 0; otherwise, it would be 1. If each block encompasses high-frequency information, so vote for bits is based on no high-frequency information with its matching <b>position.</b> Once the <b>watermark</b> image is obtained, it is scaled to four times larger in size and voting and scaling are repeated as aforementioned, until it reaches the top of the tree. The watermark is obtained, after accomplishing the abovementioned process. Further, the watermark is rotated anticlockwise, depending on {{the orientation of}} that region, which is termed as discrete rotation.|$|R
30|$|Compared with {{transform}} domain methods, the time-domain approach is rather easier to implement and requires less computation. The watermark {{is usually a}} pseudo noise added to the host signal. Alternatively, binary information {{can be converted to}} a noise-like signal through the spread spectrum technique. The existence of the watermark can be verified by measuring the correlation function between the pseudo noise and watermarked signal. The time-domain methods are usually less robust to digital signal processing attacks unless a long segment along with adequate embedding strength is adopted. In contrast, quantization index modulation (QIM) has been proven to be a promising technique [24]. The time-domain data embedding is achieved by quantizing the parameters derived from the time series. Though the QIM generally outperforms the spread spectrum in the time domain, it still needs a long segment for reliable detection. As a consequence, the time-domain QIM was mainly used for frame synchronization in many watermarking systems [14, 20, 21, 24]. Being aware of the limitation of the time-domain approach, many researchers thus turned to the {{transform domain}}s where signal characteristics could be better explored. The embedding intensity as well as <b>position</b> of the <b>watermark</b> can be selected based upon the features extracted in the transform domains [1, 14, 21].|$|R
