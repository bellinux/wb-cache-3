40|$|The {{conception}} of the participation form o f a crime proposed by J. Makarewicz does not answer many fundamental questions. The general stance of the Polish contemporary doctrine of criminal law is that neither incitement nor aiding and abetting is a participation form of a crime, but only a separate and independent type o f a prohibited act, the description o f which (apart from the characteristics typical of incitement or aiding and abetting) also includes the description o f the act to which the inciter has induced, or in which the aider and abettor offered assistance. The conception proposed by J. Makarewicz may be fully applied to the participation forms leading to either the actual commitment o f a crime (committed personally or in conjunction with another) and in a non-executed form (leading, supervising or ordering a crime). What still remains to be solved is a question what charges should be formulated in respect of a <b>person</b> who has <b>supervised</b> a prohibited act that was ordered, i f the “to-be” perpetrator, or performer of the act only realises {{the characteristics of the}} object, without realising (or showing) any characteristics of the subject part. In my opinion, one should never claim that the <b>person</b> <b>supervising</b> a crime has actually managed or supervised the realisation or performance of a prohibited act whose attributes always characterise the subject as well. Under the currently applicable laws, in such cases we could determine the instance of co-perpetration. This solution, however, is not free from imperfections. It is therefore suggested that the scope of article 18 para. 1 of the penal code should be extended on indirect perpetration as well...|$|R

30|$|A {{sample of}} 81 GSU plant {{managers}} was interviewed {{on the status}} of groundwater supply. The number of GSU plants as per the list from WEMC was 394 {{at the time of the}} study. A fifth of this was randomly selected. On the demand side, a sample of 127 GSU users and 233 non-GSU users were interviewed. Four out of twelve districts except two urban districts were selected randomly to conduct the surveys. These were Cai Rang, Long My, Phong Dien, and O Mon. As a first step, a GSU plant was randomly positioned in each district. Based on the number of clients that the GSU manager of the designated plant accounted for, interval sample groups with a minimum of 30 GSU-users and 60 (double the number) non-GSU users was selected in each district. To find out how many households there were in the area where GSU plants were located, the local authority was contacted prior to the interviews. The surveys for all three questionnaires were implemented by face-to-face interviews, each taking about 40 to 50 minutes. To be sure that the sampling procedure was properly followed by the numerators, a team of two experienced field <b>persons</b> <b>supervised</b> the surveys. A quality check resulted in the dropping of seven from 367 questionnaires.|$|R
40|$|Field {{training}} is an indispensable {{component in the}} training of practicing professions since the educational process must involve learning by doing and opportunities to engage in practice so as to learn. Field training in social work education serves as the primary arena for integrating knowledge and values with skills and the socialization of the professional <b>person.</b> <b>Supervised</b> practice, rather than the acquisition of a specified body of theory, was perceived as the primary element {{in the development of}} a social worker (George, 1982; cited in Skolnik, 1989, p. 49). Students also considered field training the one component in their social work education, which has significant impact on them (Anderson, 1979; Roberts, 1973; cited in Raskin, 1989, p. 2). Field training in social work education provides a structure for a student to acquire professional competence by actually doing what a practitioner does on the site of practice. Learning is supported by three arrangements: (a) the selection of practice assignments; (b) planning, reporting and analysing practice in written form; and (c) planning and studying one's practice with a fieldwork instructor in regular supervision sessions. Fieldwork instruction is an area of educational practice, which remains largely unexplored in social work education. In a study of the number and type of reported studies covering field education (Smith...|$|R

Aim: To relate job performance levels with the climacteric period and associated factors in working women aged from 42 to 55 years old. Subjects and Methods: In a cross-sectional and correlative design, 64 secretaries at two public organizations at the Eighth Region of Chile, were assessed using the following instruments: Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (University of Toronto), adapted for Chile by PROSAM, Climacteric Self-care Questionnaire, Perceived Social Support Scale and Biodemographics Variables Questionnaire.

Results: The Department Heads or <b>persons</b> <b>supervising</b> these women, determined that most workers did their work well. The best evaluations were given by older bosses. Most women under study showed a moderate alteration of the Menopause Quality of Life. A deficit of self-care during the climacteric period was detected in 92. 2 %. The perceived social support from friends correlated with job performance. Menopause quality of life in its different domains had no correlation with job performance variable.

40|$|Abstract Background Low Back Pain is a {{major public}} health problem all over the western world. Active {{approaches}} including exercise {{in the treatment of}} low back pain results in better outcomes for patients, but it is not known exactly which types of back exercises are most beneficial or whether general physical activity provide similar benefits. Nordic Walking is a popular and fast growing type of exercise in Northern Europe. Initial studies have demonstrated that persons performing Nordic Walking are able to exercise longer and harder compared to normal walking thereby increasing their cardiovascular metabolism. Until now no studies have been performed to investigate whether Nordic Walking has beneficial effects in relation to low back pain. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether supervised Nordic Walking can reduce pain and improve function in a population of chronic low back pain patients when compared to unsupervised Nordic Walking and advice to stay active. In addition we investigate whether there is an increase in the cardiovascular metabolism in <b>persons</b> performing <b>supervised</b> Nordic Walking compared to persons who are advised to stay active. Finally, we investigate whether there is a difference in compliance between <b>persons</b> receiving <b>supervised</b> Nordic Walking and persons doing unsupervised Nordic Walking. Methods One hundred and fifty patients with low back pain for at least eight weeks and referred to a specialized secondary sector outpatient back pain clinic are included in the study. After completion of the standard back centre treatment patients are randomized into one of three groups: A) Nordic Walking twice a week for eight weeks under supervision of a specially trained instructor; B) Unsupervised Nordic Walking for eight weeks after one training session with an instructor; C) A one hour motivational talk including advice to stay active. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, cardiovascular ability and activity level. Results No results available at this point.

40|$|The {{prestige}} {{attributed to}} an occupation by {{a population is}} assumed to be mainly determined by two occupational characteristics: 1. The difficulty of the occupation, for which the amount of schooling requir-ed is a usable operationalization; 2. The responsibility of the occupation for which several operationalizations will be discussed below. To the extent that information about occupations is generally available, {{and to the extent that}} ideological bias is absent in the population, prestige would be expected to depend only upon difficulty and responsibility. Rela-tive weight to be attributed to each of the two factors would still be problema-tic. The author tends to favor the view that, in general, responsibility is given more weight than is difficulty. It is very difficult to perform the feats of some circus artists, but the occupation &dquo;circus artist&dquo; does not imply much responsibility either in terms of <b>persons</b> <b>supervised,</b> or in terms of material values controlled. Hence, the prestige of the occupation tends to be modest. In contrast, the entrance requirements to top political positions typically do not require university degrees, but the responsibility resting upon a govern-mental minister exceeds by far the responsibility of occupations demanding high educational levels for entrance, e. g. civil service occupations in many countries 1. Because of its high responsibility the prestige of a position as governmental minister tends to surpass that of most other positions, where information is complete and bias absent. 1. On the prestige of the businessman, C. Wright Mills (1956) had this to say: "The pres-tige of the businessman is measured less by his wealth or his income &mdash; although, of course, these are important &mdash; than by the size of his business. He borrows his prestige from the power of his company as measured by its size and from his own position in its hierarchy " (pp. 83 - 84). He also pointed out the higher prestige of the head of a major corporation who earns $ 200 000 a year as compared to that of a small businessman, earning $ 1 000 000 a year...|$|R
