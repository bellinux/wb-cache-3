5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
25|$|The {{familiar}} red H-alpha {{spectral line}} of hydrogen gas, {{which is the}} transition from the shell n=3 to the Balmer series shell n=2, is one of the conspicuous colours of the universe. It contributes a bright red line to the spectra of emission or ionisation nebula, like the Orion Nebula, which are often HII regions found in star forming regions. In true-colour pictures, these nebula have a distinctly <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> from the combination of visible Balmer lines that hydrogen emits.|$|E
25|$|On Great Dodd this {{formation}} {{is represented by}} rocks of the Thirlmere Tuff Member, which covers {{the top of the}} fell with a thick sheet of welded rhyo-dacitic lapilli-tuff in which the individual pieces of semi-molten lava were flattened under the weight of deposits above them. This rock weathers to a white or <b>pink</b> <b>colour,</b> but it is covered by the smooth grassy turf characteristic of Great Dodd, Watson's Dodd and Stybarrow Dodd, all of which are covered by the same sheet.|$|E

25|$|They {{were also}} {{famous for their}} love of nightlife, which {{attracted}} a lot of criticism, especially {{because so many of}} them had international duties with France. All this contributed to the image of Racing Club as an eccentric institution, but these players have also been seen as trail blazers for Stade Français's president Max Guazzini, who a few years later, took up the provocative (such as the use of the <b>pink</b> <b>colour)</b> and imaginative spirit to boost his club's image and shake off the conservative traditionalism of French rugby.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare and pre-hospital-care {{providers}} (EMTs or paramedics) {{often use}} the fingernail beds as a cursory indicator of distal tissue perfusion {{of individuals who}} may be dehydrated or in shock. However, this test is not considered reliable in adults. This {{is known as the}} CRT or blanch test. The fingernail bed is briefly depressed to turn the nail-bed white. When the pressure is released, the normal <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> should be restored within a second or two. Delayed return to pink color can be an indicator of certain shock states such as hypovolemia.|$|E
25|$|Dublin Zoo {{holds the}} European {{studbook}} for Moluccan cockatoos. A studbook {{is a record}} of all the individuals of a particular species that are held in zoos in a region. It contains information such as {{the sex of the}} animal, how old it is and who its parents were. This information is then used to decide which birds should be paired with which to get the best genetic mix. This ensures that the captive population stays as genetically healthy as possible. Moluccan cockatoos are handsome birds, white-with-a-hint-of-pink feathers and a <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> on the crest. This cockatoo is on the endangered species list.|$|E

25|$|Bhagavata Purana {{depicts the}} birth of the narmad. According to the text, Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations {{appeared}} as Vaman in the sacrificial arena of Asur King Mahabali. Then in order to measure the universe, he extended his left foot {{to the end of the}} universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of his big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean (Divine Brahm-Water) entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish saffron, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful <b>pink</b> <b>colour.</b> Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu (Narayana) before descending within this universe, it is known as Bhagavat-Padi or Vishnupadi which means Emanating from the lotus feet of Bhagavan (God). It finally settles in Brahmaloka or Brahmapura, abode of Lord Brahma before descending to planet Earth at the request of Bhagiratha and held safely by Lord Shiva on his head to prevent destruction of Bhumi Devi (Mother Earth). Then, the Ganges was released from Lord Shiva's hair to meet the needs of the country according to Hindu mythology. In other legends, Himavan fathered Parvati and Ganga.|$|E

500|$|On October 29, 1963, two Aeronautical Chart and Information Center cartographers, James Clarke Greenacre and Edward M. Barr, at the Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona, {{manually}} recorded {{very bright}} red, orange, and <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> phenomena {{on the southwest}} side of Cobra Head; a hill southeast of the lunar valley Vallis Schröteri; and the southwest interior rim of the Aristarchus crater. This event sparked {{a major change in}} attitude towards TLP reports. According to Willy Ley: [...] "The first reaction in professional circles was, naturally, surprise, and hard {{on the heels of the}} surprise there followed an apologetic attitude, the apologies being directed at a long-dead great astronomer, Sir William Herschel." [...] A notation by Winifred Sawtell Cameron states (1978, Event Serial No. 778): [...] "This and their November observations started the modern interest and observing the Moon." [...] The credibility of their findings stemmed from Greenacre's exemplary reputation as an impeccable cartographer, rather than from any photographic evidence.|$|E

500|$|On St George's Day in 1684 {{at around}} 10pm, an {{explosion}} in the magazine destroyed the interior of Clifford's Tower entirely. The official explanation was that the celebratory salute from the guns on the roof had set fire to parts of the woodwork, which later ignited the magazine. Most historians, however, believe the explosion was not accidental. At the time, it was common in the city to toast the potential demolition of the [...] "Minced Pie", as the castle was known to locals; suspiciously, some members of the garrison had moved their personal belongings to safety just before the explosion, and no-one from the garrison was injured by the event. The heat of the fire turned the limestone of the tower to its current, slightly <b>pink,</b> <b>colour.</b> The now-ruined tower was returned fully to private ownership, eventually forming part of the lands of the neighbouring house and gardens belonging to Samuel Waud.|$|E
500|$|Pollinated {{primarily}} by honeyeaters, the inflorescences appear from September to December. Prominent flowers, a red or <b>pink</b> <b>colour,</b> a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds. The structure of B.cuneatas flower, with the style end {{functioning as a}} pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. This is countered, however, by protandry: pollen is released well before the pistil becomes receptive; usually {{by the time the}} pistil becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers fertilising themselves, but does nothing to prevent geitonogamy: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter: isozyme studies have observed [...] "intense selection against homozygotes", a fairly common outbreeding strategy in plants that set lots of seed.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} pigments that determine plumage coloration in birds are melanines and carotenoids. [...] The latter are ingested {{in food and}} transformed into colour pigments by enzymes. [...] Aberrations in this pigmentation are mostly caused by food deficiencies and usually {{do not have a}} genetic basis. Well-known examples are flamingos, which owe their distinct <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> to the presence of red carotenoids in their natural food. When these carotenoids are in short supply, these birds appear white after the next moult. [...] Mutations causing changes in carotenoid-based colour pigments are rare; melanine mutations occur much more frequently. [...] Two types of melanin, eumelanin and phaeomelanin, are present in birds. In the skin and eyes, only eumelanin is present. [...] In some bird species, the colour is completely caused by eumelanin, however, both types of melanin are found in most species. [...] In birds, albinism has been defined as [...] "a total lack of both melanins in feathers, eyes and skin {{as a result of an}} inherited absence of tyrosinase", however, this ignores the effects of other pigments and structural colours.|$|E

500|$|After {{working on}} her first {{fragrance}} S by Shakira, Shakira further developed an interest in perfumery and wanted to explore more scents, saying [...] "After working on my debut scent, S by Shakira, I {{became interested in the}} possibilities of expressing emotions through scents." [...] Working closely with perfumer Elisabeth Vidal, she decided to make a [...] "more gentle and romantic" [...] and simpler version of the original fragrance and explored floral scents. S by Shakira Eau Florale is categorized as a [...] "floral musky scent", and according to Shakira's official website, it is a [...] "floral interpretation of the first fragrance by Shakira". The top notes include bergamot and cassis; the heart notes consist of jasmine, heliotropium, and wild red fruits; the base notes consist of musk and vanilla extracts. The packing of the perfume is very similar to the original one, but features a pink and white colour scheme and the [...] "S" [...] logo is surrounded by a bunch of flowers.

2500|$|Today, the {{concentration}} of carotenoids (mainly canthaxanthin and astaxanthin) exceeds 8 mg/kg of flesh, and all fish producers try to reach a level that represents a value of 16 on the [...] "Roche Colour Card", a colour card used to show how pink the fish will appear at specific doses. This scale is specific for measuring the <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> due to astaxanthin and {{is not for the}} orange hue obtained with canthaxanthin. The development of processing and storage operations, which can be detrimental on canthaxanthin flesh concentration, has led to an increased quantity of pigments added to the diet to compensate for the degrading effects of the processing. In wild fish, carotenoid levels of up to 25mg are present, but levels of canthaxanthin are, in contrast, minor.|$|E
2500|$|In life, the stout whiting is {{a creamy}} yellow to sandy <b>pink</b> <b>colour</b> dorsally, with a silvery white with mauve {{reflections}} ventrally.
