5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail.</b> The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail),</b> which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription.

Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail,</b> ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E

The RNA pool tested was extracted from marine sediments of the Yonaguni Knoll IV hydrothermal field in the southern Okinawa Trough. The sequences obtained using the ploy(A) tailing method were compared statistically and phylogenetically with those obtained using conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with published domain-specific primers. Both methods indicated that Deltaproteobacteria are predominant in sediment (> 85 % of the total sequence read). The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tailing</b> method indicated that Desulfobacterales were the predominant deltaproteobacteria, while most of the sequences in libraries constructed using RT-PCR were derived from Desulfuromonadales. This discrepancy may have been due to low coverage of Desulfobacterales by the primers used. A comparison of library diversity indices indicated that the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tailing</b> method retrieves more phylogenetically diverse sequences from the environment. The four archaeal 16 S rRNA sequences that were obtained using the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tailing</b> method formed deeply branching lineages that were related to Candidatus Parvarchaeum and the Ancient Archaeal Group. These results clearly demonstrate that <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tailing</b> followed by cDNA sequencing is a powerful and less biased molecular ecological approach for the study of metabolically active microbial communities...|$|R

40|$|We report {{here on the}} {{identification}} of a novel human nuclear-encoded mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase. Immunocytochemical experiments confirm that the enzyme indeed localizes to mitochondrial compartment. Inhibition of expression of the enzyme by RNA interference results in significant shortening of the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> of the mitochondrial ND 3, COX III and ATP 6 / 8 transcripts, suggesting that the investigated protein represents a bona fide mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase. This is in agreement with our sequencing data which show that <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> of several mitochondrial messengers are composed almost exclusively of adenosine residues. Moreover, the data presented here indicate that all analyzed mitochondrial transcripts with profoundly shortened <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> are relatively stable, which in turn argues against the direct role of long poly(A) extensions in the stabilization of human mitochondrial messengers...|$|R
5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> to a messenger RNA. The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> acts as {{the binding}} site for poly(A)-binding protein. Poly(A)-binding protein {{promotes}} export from the nucleus and translation, and inhibits degradation. This protein binds to the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> prior to mRNA export from the nucleus and in yeast also recruits poly(A) nuclease, an enzyme that shortens the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> and allows the export of the mRNA. Poly(A)-binding protein is exported to the cytoplasm with the RNA. mRNAs that are not exported are degraded by the exosome. Poly(A)-binding protein also can bind to, and thus recruit, several proteins that affect translation, {{one of these is}} initiation factor-4G, which in turn recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit. However, a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> is not required for the translation of all mRNAs. Further, poly(A) tailing (oligo-adenylation) can determine the fate of RNA molecules that are usually not poly(A)-tailed (such as (small) non-coding (sn)RNAs etc.) and thereby induce their RNA decay.|$|E
5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells.

40|$|Picornaviruses have 3 = polyadenylated RNA genomes, but the {{mechanisms}} by which these genomes are polyadenylated during viral replication remain obscure. Based on prior studies, we proposed a model wherein the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3 Dpol) uses a reiterative transcriptionmechanism while replicating the poly(A) and poly(U) portions of viral RNA templates. To further test this model, we examined whether mutations in 3 Dpol influenced the polyadenylation of virion RNA. We identified nine alanine substitutionmutations in 3 Dpol that resulted in shorter or longer 3 = <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> in virion RNA. These mutations could disrupt structural features of 3 Dpol required for the recruitment of a cellular poly(A) polymerase; how-ever, the structural orientation of these residues suggests a direct role of 3 Dpol in the polyadenylation of RNA genomes. Reaction mixtures containing purified 3 Dpol and a template RNAwith a defined poly(U) sequence provided data consistent with a tem-plate-dependent reiterative transcriptionmechanism for polyadenylation. The phylogenetically conserved structural features of 3 Dpol involved in the polyadenylation of virion RNA include a thumb domain alpha helix that is positioned in the minor groove of the double-stranded RNA product and lysine and arginine residues that interact with the phosphates of both the RNA tem-plate and product strands.

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tail</b> are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5000|$|RNA selection/depletion: To analyze {{signals of}} interest, the {{isolated}} RNA {{can either be}} kept as is, filtered for RNA with 3' polyadenylated (<b>poly(A))</b> <b>tails</b> to include only mRNA, depleted of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and/or filtered for RNA that binds specific sequences (Table). The RNA with 3' <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> are mature, processed, coding sequences. Poly(A) selection is performed by mixing RNA with poly(T) oligomers covalently attached to a substrate, typically magnetic beads. Poly(A) selection ignores noncoding RNA and introduces 3' bias, which is avoided with the ribosomal depletion strategy. The rRNA is removed because it represents over 90% of the RNA in a cell, which if kept would drown out other data in the transcriptome.|$|R
40|$|RNA {{polyadenylation}} {{serves a}} purpose in bacteria and organelles opposite from the role it plays in nuclear systems. The majority of nucleus-encoded transcripts {{are characterized by}} stable <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> at their mature 3 � ends, which are essential for stabilization and translation initiation. In contrast, in bacteria, chloroplasts, and plant mitochondria, polyadenylation is a transient feature which promotes RNA degradation. Surprisingly, {{in spite of their}} prokaryotic origin, human mitochondrial transcripts possess stable 3 �-end <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails,</b> akin to nucleus-encoded mRNAs. Here we asked whether human mitochondria retain truncated and transiently polyadenylated transcripts in addition to stable 3 �-end <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails,</b> which would be consistent with the preservation of the largely ubiquitous polyadenylation-dependent RNA degradation mechanisms of bacteria and organelles. To this end, using both molecular and bioinformatic methods, we sought and revealed numerous examples of such molecules, dispersed throughout the mitochondrial genome. The broad distribution but low abundance of these polyadenylated truncated transcripts strongly suggests that polyadenylationdependent RNA degradation occurs in human mitochondria. The coexistence of this system with stable 3 �-end polyadenylation, despite their seemingly opposite effects, is so far unprecedented in bacteria and other organelles.

Silencing of cpPNPase, a chloroplast-localized polynucleotide polymerase known to not only polymerize the <b>poly(A)</b> -rich <b>tails</b> but act as a 3 ׳ to 5 ׳ exoribonuclease, does not change the profile of polyadenylate tails associated with TMV RNA.

Though a handful of WISPY target mRNAs have been identified during both oogenesis and early embryogenesis, it was unknown whether WISP simply regulated a small pool of patterning or cell cycle genes, or whether, instead, cytoplasmic polyadenylation was widespread during this developmental transition. To identify the full range of WISPY targets, we carried out microarray analysis to look for maternal mRNAs whose <b>poly(A)</b> <b>tails</b> fail to elongate in the absence of WISP function.
