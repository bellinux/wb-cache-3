40|$|International audienceHeterogeneous {{reactions}} between organic films, {{taken as}} proxies for atmospheric aerosols, with ozone in presence of simulated sunlight and the photosensitizer 4 -carboxybenzophenone (4 -CB) were observed to alter surface properties as monitored by contact angle during the reaction. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) {{was used in}} addition for <b>product</b> <b>identification.</b> Two <b>types</b> of model surfaces were systematically studied: 4 -CB/ 4 -phenoxyphenol and 4 -CB/catechol. Solid organic films made of 4 -CB/catechol were observed to become hydrophilic by simultaneous exposure to ozone and simulated sunlight, whereas organic films made of 4 -CB/ 4 -phenoxyphenol become hydrophobic under the same conditions. These changes in contact angle indicate that photo-induced aging processes involving ozone (such as oligomerisation) not necessarily favour increased hygroscopicity of organic aerosols in the atmosphere. The ratio between hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups should reflect the chemical property of organic films with respect to wettability phenomena. Contact angles and surface tensions of the exposed organic film made of 4 -CB/ 4 -phenoxyphenol were found to correspond to the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratios obtained from the FTIR-ATR spectra...|$|R

40|$|This work investigates {{properties}} resembling closedness {{that are}} characteristic to some well known <b>identification</b> <b>types</b> in inductive inference of total recursive functions and in language learning. The properties can be formulated as follows: if every union of n- 1 classes out of n classes is identifiable, then {{the union of}} n classes is identifiable, too. It turns out that these properties are crucial for establishing which sets of requirements put on the identifiability of unions of classes are satisfiable and which are not.

40|$|When people {{interact}} with products, all sensory modalities {{are open to}} receive information. To assess each modality’s potential contribution to overall product experiences, we developed a split-modality approach, in which subjects experienced real-life products through only one modality: vision, touch, audition, or olfaction. Responses focused on (1) description of the sensory experience, (2) <b>product</b> <b>identification,</b> and (3) descriptions of associations and memories linked to this experience. Visual and tactual information were most detailed, made <b>product</b> <b>identification</b> easiest, and yielded the clearest memories of past events, associations to persons, and associations with other products.

40|$|This paper investigates {{relations}} between team learning and a quasi-closedness property inherent in many <b>identification</b> <b>types</b> considered in inductive inference. This property is as follows: there exists such n that, if every union of n Γ 1 classes out of U 1; : : :; Un is identifiable, {{so is the}} union of all n classes. This property can be formulated in terms of team learning, but in practice the research in team learning have followed one path, while investigations of the quasi-closedness property have led along another path. Here we investigate the connection between quasi-closedness and team learning more closely. We show that the numbers n for which the quasiclosedness holds determine the largest element of the so-called hierarchy of success ratios of an <b>identification</b> <b>type.</b> We also investigate quasiclosedness of team <b>identification</b> <b>types</b> themselves.

[...] Household textile articles include “wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding”. [...] The goal of the Textile Fiber <b>Product</b> <b>Identification</b> Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the fiber content of textile fiber products.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a state-of-the-art analysis of current systems for <b>product</b> <b>identification</b> utilized within the Swedish sector of construction and facility management. The study also discusses {{the concept of}} object and class identification in information systems development. The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify and define concepts in a common information structure that provides a framework for handling construction product information that utilize the advantages of information technology. The conclusion implies that a common system for <b>product</b> <b>identification</b> with characteristics of being international, nonsector specific, without property or class referencing attributes and with explicit criteria regarding changes of identifiers as a result of property alteration is one of the means for achieving this. Among the systems in current use EAN- 13 is regarded as the most suitable since it is international, non-sector specific, in correspondence with a barcode standard for automatic data capture and has the widest propagation, however the EAN- 13 system, like the other systems, lacks explicit norms that guarantee valid identification in a historical perspective especially required for product information management within facility management processes. EAN- 13 ’s main disadvantage in the construction context is its total focus on trade items, thus its deficient handling in standard product units, which is the common view for actors outside the sector of trading.
