However this is misleading, as [...] "tellura" [...] {{indicates}} that tellurium substitutes for carbon atom, but actually tellurium is substituted for the oxygen atom in <b>pyrilium.</b> In the Hantzsch-Widman system it is called tellurinium. This is the name used by Chemical Abstracts. Replacement nomenclature would call this telluroniabenzene.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, we {{demonstrate}} a greener synthesis of anthocyanidins, which allows facile purification by trituration. This facilitates {{the study of}} the effects of various substituents on the different rings to the properties of anthocyanidins. In this case, we show that altering the location of the methoxy substituent on the B ring results in slight variations in the resultant antioxidant activity, as measured by the FRAP assay. The methoxy substituent on the 2 ′ position of the B ring stabilizes the radical formed in the 7 -OH position by conjugation, and by inductive effects due to the proximity of the the methoxy group to the <b>pyrilium</b> oxygen. These results demonstrate the feasibility of tailoring the redox properties of synthetic anthocyanidins.|$|E
40|$|The {{modes of}} {{catalytic}} action of three squaramide-derived bifunctional organocatalysts {{have been investigated}} using DFT methods. The [5 + 2] cycloaddition between oxidopyrilium ylides and enals {{has been used as}} model reaction. Two primary modes are possible for the different catalysts studied. The preference for one mode over the other is due to the possibility of additional favourable π,π-interactions between the H-bond activated <b>pyrilium</b> ylide and an electron-deficient aromatic ring bonded to a squaramide NH-group. The model can be extended to other reactions catalyzed by the same catalysts such as formal [2 + 2] cycloadditions between nitroalkenes and α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. The computational results are in excellent concurrence with the available experimental reports on the observed total enantioselectivity and differences in diastereoselectivity depending on the substrate and the reactionThis work was supported by Spanish MINECO Contracts CTQ 2013 - 44367 -C 2 - 1 -P (to P.

40|$|Ion-molecule {{reactions}} of the mass-selected distonic radical cation +CH 2 -O-CH 2 (1) with several heterocyclic compounds have been investigated by multiple stage mass spectro- metric experiments performed in a pentaquadrupole mass spectrometer. Reactions with pyridine, 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -ethyl, 2 -methoxy, and 2 -n-propyl pyridine occur mainly by transfer of CH 2 + to the nitrogen, which yields distonic N-methylene-pyridinium radical cations. The MS 3 spectra of these products display very characteristic collision-induced dissociation chemistry, which is greatly affected by {{the position of the}} substituent in the pyridine ring. Ortho isomers undergo a δ-cleavage cyclization process induced by the free-radical character of the N-methylene group that yields bicyclic pyridinium cations. On the other hand, extensive CH 2 + transfer followed by rapid hydrogen atom loss, that is, a net CH+ transfer, occurs not to the heteroatoms, but to the aromatic ring of furan, thiophene, pyrrole, and N-methyl pyrrole. The reaction proceeds through five- to six-membered ring expansion, which yields the <b>pyrilium,</b> thiapyrilium, N-protonated, and N-methylated pyridine cations, respectively, as indicated by MS 3 scans. Ion 1 fails to transfer CH 2 + to tetrahydrofuran, whereas a new α-distonic sulfur ion is formed in reactions with tetrahydrothiophene. Unstable N-methylene distonic ions, likely formed by transfer of CH 2 + to the nitrogen of piperidine and pyrrolidine, undergo rapid fragmentation by loss of the α-NH hydrogen to yield closed-shell immonium cations. The most thermodynamically favorable products are formed in these reactions, as estimated by ab initio calculations at the MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d,p) // 6 - 31 G(d,p) + ZPE level of theory...|$|E
