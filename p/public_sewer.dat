40|$|Abstract—An {{overview}} of the important aspects of managing and controlling industrial effluent discharges to <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> namely sampling, characterization, quantification and legislative controls has been presented. The findings have been validated {{by means of a}} case study covering three industrial sectors namely, tanning, textile finishing and food processing industries. Industrial effluents discharges were found to be best monitored by systematic and automatic sampling and quantified using water meter readings corrected for evaporative and consumptive losses. Based on the treatment processes employed in the public owned treatment works and the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand levels obtained, the effluent from all the three industrial sectors studied were found to lie in the toxic zone. Thus, physico-chemical treatment of these effluents is required to bring them into the biodegradable zone. KL values (quoted to base e) were greater than 0. 50 day- 1 compared to 0. 39 day- 1 for typical municipality wastewater.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{on the production}} and management of hazardous waste by approximately 20 000 small-quantity hazardous-waste generators (SQHWGs) {{in the state of}} Florida. SQHWGs are generators that produce less than 1000 kg of hazardous waste in a calendar month. There were approximately 117 000 metric tonnes of small-quantity-generator (SQG) hazardous waste produced annually. Included in this total are over 43 000 tonnes of waste oils even though they were not regulated as a hazardous waste {{at the time of the}} survey. Approximately half of this hazardous waste is managed using the following methods: recycling, treatment, and disposal in permitted hazardous-waste-management facilities. However, large quanti-ties of this SQG hazardous waste are disposed of in sanitary landfills and discharged to <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> and these facilities are typically not designed to handle hazardous waste. These data indicate that there are potential environmental and human-health problems associated with the management of SQG hazardous waste in Florida as well as throughout the U. S. A.

These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public standpipe, borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water {{to the same extent}} as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and tanker truck water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to <b>public</b> <b>sewer,</b> connection to septic system, or a pit latrine with a slab or water seal.|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength. In {{addition to their}} claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the <b>public</b> <b>sewer</b> system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E

Lack Township has the lowest percentage of houses with full plumbing facilities (72.31%). There are six <b>public</b> <b>sewer</b> companies in the county, the largest of which, the Twin Boroughs Sanitary Authority, is used at a rate of 450,000 gallons per day.

2500|$|Chester Borough {{split from}} Chester Township in 1930 over the {{creation}} of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township {{did not wish to}} financially support the construction and maintenance of a <b>public</b> <b>sewer</b> or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by <b>public</b> <b>sewer</b> and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the NJ State Plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the [...] Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment. The two municipalities currently share a common K-8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services.|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 WHO report {{stated that}} mercury from amalgam was {{approximately}} 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that {{one-third of the}} total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown {{this to be a}} gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries [...] "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent". Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment {{and the vast majority of}} the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the <b>public</b> <b>sewer</b> system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} forest conservation requirements and zoning {{on the value of}} land undergoing subdivision. Land prices are increasing in the percentage of subdivision acreage developers are required to keep in forest, suggesting that forest conservation regulations increase the amounts of forested open space that developers provide. Benefits from open-space amenities remain largely internal to the subdivision, so that land market incentives mitigate the justification for open space preservation policies. Consistent with theoretical predictions that zoning promotes sprawl, we find that minimum-lot-size zoning constrains developers of closer-in subdivisions where <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> are available. ...|$|R
