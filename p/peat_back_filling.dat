40|$|Aluminum {{diffusion}} in silicon {{is normally}} {{carried out in}} a sealed quartz tube under vacuum using elemental a luminum as the dopant source (1). For deep junctions, diffusion temperatures as high as 120 O ~ are often used. When large diameter wafers (~ 50 - 75 mm) are processed at such high temperatures it becomes neces-sary to <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> the quartz tube with a suitable gas which prevents the tube from collapsing. <b>Back</b> <b>filling</b> with argon consistently results in a nonuniform dif-fusion with very low surface concentration. If the sealed tube is maintained relatively free from moisture and oxygen, then the source A 1 remains uncoated with A 1203, and an equil ibrium A 1 vapor pressure is main-tained throughout the diffusion time.

40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>filling</b> of mine voids is {{mandatory}} to avoid subsequent ground stability {{problems in the}} form of subsidence. Mill tailings and river sand are being extensively used since a long time as mine <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> materials. However strict regulation and unavailability of river sand has created a huge problem for mining industry in India. The need to develop alternative engineering material which can substitute sand has gained prominence. Large quantities of fly ash discharged from coal-fired power stations are a major problem {{not only in terms of}} scarcity of land available for its disposal, but also in psychology as well as environmental aspects. Amount of fly ash available can be recycled, mainly by adding fly ash to cement. However, the addition of fly ash to cement is limited because the production rate of cement is limited, and also the concentration of fly ash in cement is limited. In the present study three fly ash composite materials (FCMs) were developed from the fly ash obtained from a nearby captive thermal unit. The main constituent of the composite were fly ash, lime, gypsum and cement. Detailed physical and engineering properties were determined for the FCMs. Significant increases in the compressive strength were obtained after 28 days of curing time and it was observed that the fly-ash composite developed has potential to be used as substitute to sand for <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> the mine voids...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{research}} e↵orts {{are continually}} being directed towards {{the development of}} sensitive and accurate surface plasmon resonance biosensors for sequence specific DNA detection. These sensors hold great potential for applications in healthcare and diagnostics. However, performance of these sensors in practical usage scenarios is often limited due to interference from the sample matrix. This work shows how the co-immobilization of glycol (PEG) diluents or “back filling” of the DNA sensing layer can successfully address these problems. A novel SPR based melting assay {{is used for the}} analysis of a synthetic oligomer target as well as PCR amplified genomic DNA extracted from Legionella Pneumophila. The benefits of sensing layer <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> on the assay performance are first demonstrated through melting analysis of the oligmomer target and it is shown how <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> enables accurate discrimination of Legionella Pneumophila serogroups directly from the PCR reaction product with complete suppression of sensor fouling. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The mining {{technology}} {{is the same as}} the traditional mining. Backfilling and mining work in parallel. Backfill proceeds from the tail to the head of the backfilling conveyor. After the material is accumulated to a certain height the next unloading hole is open and a machine rammer presses a tamping slab to tamp the material. This process would be repeated until the material has been sufficiently tamped and in general, it takes two or three cycles. The first round of backfilling would pause after the face has been fully filled. The backfilling conveyor then moves forward toward the head of the back beam and the compactor pushes all of the material that remains under the backfilling conveyor back and above till solid material reaches the roof. In this way, the material is being pushed toward the roof and compacted. Finally, close the unloading holes to <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> the space below the conveyor headpiece. After the first <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> cycle is completed, the conveyor would be pushed to the end of the back beam to start another cycle.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper describes the tsunami damage to tide walls observed using aerial photographs and field investigations at 13 locations {{along the coast}} of Iwate Prefecture, where significant tsunami damage occurred {{as a result of the}} Great East Japan Earthquake. This paper also summarizes the characteristics of the damage. The tide walls in Iwate Prefecture were constructed on a ria (hilly type) coast, this geographical feature of Iwate being different from that of the other disaster areas, primarily Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures. The tide walls constructed in Iwate Prefecture can largely be classified into two types, i. e. sloping and vertical. The vertical type can be subdivided according to whether or not there is a back slope. The results of our investigations show that all the devastated tide walls suffered from overflow before being damaged. In particular, the sloping and vertical type tide walls with slope protection were damaged by scouring of the infill sand or <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> soil due to the overflow of the tsunami. In the case of vertical type tide walls without slope protection, damage was caused by scouring of the <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> soil...|$|R
