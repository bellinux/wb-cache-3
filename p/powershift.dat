25|$|Ford {{announced}} the US-market {{version of the}} Mark VI Ford Fiesta for 2011 featured a dry-clutch <b>PowerShift</b> transmission. Ford also {{announced the}} introduction of <b>PowerShift</b> transmission to North American market by 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Volvo version will be {{built in}} Koping, Sweden, at Volvo's {{transmission}} plant. The <b>PowerShift</b> gearbox will be introduced on the second-generation Volvo S60, {{and then on to}} the V50 and C30 models. The XC60 is expected to get this Ford <b>PowerShift</b> gearbox along with other new models to make more sporty cars.|$|E
25|$|He and {{his wife}} Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him {{for most of his}} writings, moved on to {{examining}} the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book, The Third Wave in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication. His later focus, via their other best-seller, <b>Powershift,</b> (1990), was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies.|$|E
50|$|The clutch {{is really}} only {{needed to get}} the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar {{disengaged}} until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like <b>powershifting</b> require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a dual clutch transmission.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} interested in the overview of tractor’s gearboxes, which are changing on load. There are reasons, why it has to be costructed and there are requirements for it. There are also described <b>PowerShifts,</b> which allow us gear changing on load. After basic description of concrete gearbox, there is always some example of using in current tractors. In period named Mechanical gearboxes, wchich are changing partly on load there is more space for Zetor tractors and its gearboxes. In one of the last period there is important part about continuously variable transmissions where the driving speed is regulated steplessly. These gearboxes are considered to be modern technology of transfer engine torque...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} {{is a very}} crucial part of a vehicle, especially if the prime mover is a combustion engine, since such a power source has a rather low torque at low engine speeds. There {{would not be enough}} torque to accelerate the vehicle at an acceptable rate while still reaching acceptable top speed. There is a need for several gears to achieve this, thus making the transmission mandatory in such vehicles. Increasing demands on modern vehicles for minimizing the environmental impact are putting high requirements on transmissions. Hybrid solutions integrating electric motors are not only reducing the carbon footprint but also opening up possibilities for improving transmission shift quality. In this thesis a dual clutch transmission propelled by an electric motor is analysed in the simulation software AVL Cruise 2015 and Matlab Simulink 2010 a in order to investigate and improve the shift quality of the transmission using motor torque control. The {{transmission is}} an automatic, <b>powershifting,</b> transmission which means that the torque interruption during the shift procedure is minimal. The four different phases of a shift procedure: filling phase, torque phase, inertia phase and completion phase are studied. A Simulink program was developed including a proportional integrator (PI) controller for comparing the output torque of the transmission to the desired value and control the electric motor torque in order to achieve a smooth torque curve during the power-on upshift procedure. It was found in the results from the simulations that the controller is effective in reducing the torque fluctuations during the power-on upshift procedure both for a low and a high load signal applied to the electric motor. In order to reduce the fluctuations even more, a special strategy aiming to improve the fluctuations during inertia phase, was applied. The result was satisfying but can be further improved and is hence a scope for future development...|$|R
25|$|From June 2002 a factory-approved {{dual fuel}} petrol-liquid {{petroleum}} gas conversion {{was available in}} the UK on 1.8 and 2.5 litre models. The LPG conversion was an after-market undertaking approved by MG Rover. Developed by EcoGas Systems Ltd and Landi Renzo S.R.L. in conjunction with MG Rover Powertrain Limited, the conversion was ordered from Rover dealerships, the cars retaining the three-year factory warranty. The retail price of the conversion was £2,195, but {{in an effort to}} encourage LPG use for transport for ecological reasons the UK Government offered a <b>Powershift</b> Rebate of some 60% of the conversion cost. When running on LPG the Rover 75 suffers only a slight reduction in performance compared to running on petrol; LPG fuel consumption is also slightly higher than when running on petrol but this is more than offset by the greatly reduced cost of the fuel.|$|E

40|$|After many abusive, over-torqued <b>powershifts,</b> {{the venerable}} T 5 is left a little worse for wear. Couple this with no {{built-in}} shift fork limits and sheer age, {{and the frequency}} of failure is quite high in any spirited driven vehicle. Or, in some cases, the high-mileage often seen on Mustangs results in worn out friction linings on the blocker rings. (My first (and only, so far!) failure was a delaminated fourth gear blocker. I could upshift, but had to pause a while to downshift, until it went out altogether, at 125, 000 miles!) Update: July 2, 1999 : Blew input shaft at lunch! Thing sounded like a grenade going off; left with fourth gear only! Now I feel like a real man, LOL! The solution: Why, a thorough rebuild, of course! While going through the rebuild, do you and your trans a favor by spending some of the money saved on upgrades: the two most notable are a steel input shaft bearing retainer and a decent aftermarket shifter (or at least do something about the factory rubber isolators, like remove them!). Besides learning how to do a rebuild to get yourself out of trouble, it’s a great bartering skill when your “friends” blow theirs up! The sources: I have purchased parts from D&D Performance, Hanlon Motorsports, and National Drivetrain. I have received outstanding service from all, and always receive my parts in a timely manner. However, I will not do business with NDT again over a petty issue (actually, not petty; based on principals that they claim but did not uphold; they do have good deals on inputs and clusters from time to time, but their kits, uh, suck, IMHO…). Personally, I prefer to deal with Hanlon; Linda, Bob’s wife, always makes me laugh when I speak with her, and they had the courtesy to call me several months after I placed an order to let me know the Tremec rebuild manuals were in, and overnight a part that they let slip through. You cannot go wrong with D&D or Hanlon...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the social and emotional effects on bilingual Hispanic students as they use language to create meaning in their environment. As students acquire language proficiency, successful communication results. Students who have not reached the linguistic level necessary for successful communication are at greater risk for school failure. This study considers the social and emotional effects of second language learning. ^ Participants were twenty-five Latino students who immigrated or migrated from a variety of different geographical regions in the U. S., Mexico and Central America. These students have reached different levels of English proficiency. The study utilized focus groups as the primary source of information. Individual journals were kept by each of the six students who were selected from these focus groups for in-depth case studies. In addition, observations of the six case study participants were made in a variety of educational settings, to determine how students used language to make meaning in their environment. ^ The significance of this study established the importance of maintaining the primary language while incorporating the acquisition of a second language. In the process of acquiring a second language the individual becomes a different person through the transformation process and acquires a different language and a different way of viewing the world. ^ Five substantive themes evolved and from these themes a grounded theory emerged. This theory states that monolingual users may be indifferent and unaware of their limited language in a bilingual world but once they begin to process both languages disequilibrium occurs. During this disequilibrium state, a metamorphic change in the way they process information and make meaning in their environment transforms them. Some people are caught indefinitely in this metamorphic disequilibrium spin and negativism, chaos, conflict and negative <b>powershifts</b> result. Those fortunate few who are able to transcend this state of disequilibrium become truly bilingual and are empowered with a gift few people are able to achieve, the gift of second language acquisition. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{microprocessor-based}} {{control systems}} on agricultural tractors has eased operator burden by allowing changes to tractor and implement settings {{to be made}} with little physical effort. However, maintaining the optimum tractor-implement settings whilst encountering the variable nature of agricultural conditions still requires {{a high level of}} operator skill, partly due to the need to adjust individual sub-system controllers. CAN-bus communication between electronically controlled vehicle sub. systems provided a new opportunity to enhance vehicle powertrain operation, by intelligently integrating control of the sub-systems. The aim of the project was to develop ways to improve the operational characteristics of a tractor powertrain, by investigating system behaviour, and identifying opportunities for intelligent control. Market research was undertaken which highlighted power-split continuously variable transmissions as a credible alternative to powershift-type transmissions in specific specialist applications where the additional purchase price could be justified. However, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that there are significant improvements in overall vehicle performance to be gained {{through the use of a}} CVT tractor compared to a well operated powershift-type transmission. Improvements to gearshift quality and more intelligent use of the powertrain control features could ensure powershift-type transmissions remain competitive for the foreseeable future. A dynamic mathematical powertrain model was developed for a lOOkW, 16 speed semi-powershift transmission, four wheel drive tractor based on fundamental Newtonian principles. With the addition of implement models, this allowed accurate representation of the tractor-implement system and provided a platform to develop improved vehicle control strategies. Validation of the model with experimental data showed it was an accurate representation of the real system. The steady state and transient field performance of the tractor operating with a mouldboard plough, a power harrow and a laden trailer was determined for a number of tractor-implement configurations across a range of conditions. This provided a David Sayer, 2005 Cranfield University, Silsoe 11 large dataset for this vehicle for use in this, and other investigations. The level of powertrain loading for field experiments was found to be influenced by soil type, implement working width and depth as well as forward speed and engine speed. For the road investigation, the surface quality and terrain were major influencing factors on performance. It was found there was considerable variation in tractor response to the different gearshift types experienced in the semi-powershift transmission: the non-powershift changes being severe, particularly during downshifts; double-swap <b>powershifts</b> were markedly more severe than single-swap shifts. A unique investigation of the tractor driveline torque loss characteristics across the full operating spectrum using the axle dynamometer identified that the torque losses for this transmission are predominantly speed, rather than torque related. A mathematical model was developed to predict driveline torque losses from transmission output speed, flywheel torque and the number of power-transmitting gears in mesh. The axle dynamometer was also used to successfully replicate field loading patterns in real time. Throughout this investigation a number of undesirable powertrain characteristics were identified. Potential improvements to vehicle performance through the development of solutions to these characteristics have been made either through analysis of field data, experiments with the axle dynamometer, or using the developed mathematical model...|$|R
