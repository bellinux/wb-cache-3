40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a <b>plunger</b> limit <b>switch</b> testing {{system based on}} Virtual Instrument Technology with servo control module and data acquisition module. The proposed system is designed for measuring contact resistance, force-displacement curve and voltage-displacement curve. And the product qualification is automatically judged according to the measured result. Field experiment shows that the parameter testing system has a stable and reliable performance with high precision...|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} {{electronic}} keyboards {{in the early}} 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80 to 120USD and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were reed switches (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the <b>switch</b> <b>plunger).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Plastic {{materials}} {{played a}} very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until [...] "monoblocks" [...] came along, GE's [...] "self-lubricating" [...] Delrin was the only plastic material for keyboard <b>switch</b> <b>plungers</b> that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling <b>switch</b> <b>plungers</b> was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. [...] However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75mm to 2.79mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monolocks also made of ABS.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation {{introduced}} keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of {{the first}} keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the <b>switch</b> <b>plunger,</b> and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other [...] "solid-state switch" [...] keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards.|$|R

5000|$|The Tyer's no. 7 tablet {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a wooden case, on top {{of which is a}} metal slide, a <b>switch</b> <b>plunger,</b> a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: [...] "Line Closed"; [...] "Train Approaching" [...] and [...] "Train on Line". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the top slide. The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.|$|R
