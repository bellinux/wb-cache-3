However, by a microspectrofluorometric technique allowing single cell analysis, anti-CD 23 mAb was found to elicit calcium mobilization in these cells. In addition, the treatment induced phenotypic alterations in these cells, as evidenced by the acquisition of the monocyte marker CD 14 and the increase of the alpha-chain (CD 11 a) and of the common beta-chain (CD 18) of the leucocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1) family antigens. Although weaker than in monocytes, CD 23 ligation evoked a small secretion of the pro-inflammatory mediators IL- 6 and thromboxane B 2. These data suggest that a significant maturation of <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells</b> towards a more mature monocytic phenotype can be achieved through successive exposure to IL- 4 and CD 23 ligation...|$|R
40|$|Treatment with 0. 2 mM {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2) or with 0. 5 mM cisplatin caused caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 activation and death by apoptosis in U- 937 human <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells.</b> However, treatment with 2 mM H 2 O 2, or incubation with the glutathione suppressor DL-buthionine-(S,R) -sulfoximine (BSO) prior to treatment with cisplatin, suppressed caspase activation {{and changed the}} mode of death to necrosis. Treatment with 2 mM H 2 O 2 caused a great decrease in the intracellular ATP level, which was partially prevented by 3 -aminobenzamide (3 -ABA). Correspondingly, 3 -ABA restored the activation of caspases and the execution of apoptosis. By contrast, BSO plus cisplatin did not decrease the ATP levels, and the generation of necrosis by this treatment was not affected by 3 -ABA. On the other hand, while all apoptosis inducing treatments and treatment with 2 mM H 2 O 2 caused Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria as well as cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, treatment with BSO plus cisplatin did not. Treatment with cisplatin alone caused Bid cleavage, while BSO plus cisplatin as well as 0. 2 and 2 mM H 2 O 2 did not. Bcl- 2 overexpression reduced the generation of necrosis by H 2 O 2, but not by BSO plus cisplatin.

40|$|AbstractTreatment for 2 h with 200 μM cadmium chloride, {{followed}} by recovery, caused apoptosis and induced heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) expression in U- 937 <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells.</b> However, pre-incubation with the GSH depleting agent l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO, 1 mM for 24 h) caused necrosis instead of apoptosis {{and failed to}} induce HSP 70 expression. This failure was a consequence of necrosis instead of GSH depletion, since BSO allowed or even potentiated HSP 70 induction when used in combination with heat shock (2 h at 42. 5 °C) or with 50 μM cadmium, which caused apoptosis. The administration of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) {{at the beginning of}} recovery after BSO/ 200 μM cadmium treatment prevented the execution of necrosis and restored the execution of apoptosis, but did not restore HSP 70 induction, indicating that the inhibition by BSO of HSP 70 expression is an early regulated event. This contrasted with the capacity of NAC to prevent the alterations caused by BSO/ 200 μM cadmium in other proteins, namely the suppression of Bax expression and the increase in Bcl- 2 and HSP- 60 expression. Finally, it was observed that treatment with 200 μM cadmium rapidly increased the HSP 70 mRNA level and stimulated heat-shock factor 1 (HSF 1) trimerization and binding, and that these effects were prevented by pre-incubation with BSO. Taken together, these results indicate that the stress response is compatible with apoptosis but not with necrosis in cadmium-treated <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells.</b> The suppression of the stress response is specifically due to the early inhibition of HSF 1 activation...|$|R

The catalytic subunit of TAK {{has been identified as}} cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk 9, and its regulatory partner has been identified as cyclin T 1; these proteins are also components of positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. TAK activity is up-regulated upon activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and following macrophage differentiation of <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> lines. We have found that activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes results in increased mRNA and protein levels of both Cdk 9 and cyclin T 1. Cdk 9 and cyclin T 1 induction occurred in purified CD 4 + primary T cells activated by a variety of stimuli. In contrast, phorbol ester-induced differentiation of <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> lines into macrophage-like cells produced a large induction of cyclin T 1 protein expression from nearly undetectable levels, while Cdk 9 protein levels remained at a constant high level. Measurements of cyclin T 1 mRNA levels in a <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line suggested that regulation of cyclin T 1 occurs at a posttranscriptional level.

In the present work, we have analysed the characteristic properties of this NOS isoform in the model of the human <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells</b> U 937 By reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the presence of an mRNA coding for type III NOS was found in U 937 cells and the corresponding protein was detected by immunofluorescence in permeabilized cells with a specific anti-ecNOS monoclonal antibody (mAb). Membrane extracts displayed a NOS activity dependent on the presence of calcium and calmodulin in the reaction medium and that was abrogated in the presence of EGTA. Recombinant soluble CD 23 (25000 MW) was found to trigger an NO-dependent cGMP accumulation in these cells, which was abrogated by calcium chelators and inhibitors of the calcium/calmodulin complex. Moreover, sCD 23 elicited a transient augmentation of intracytoplasmic free calcium concentration [Ca 2 +]i that was dependent on the presence of calcium in the external buffer and was prevented in the presence of EGTA, indicating that it was due to a calcium influx.

Our {{understanding}} of MV replication in monocytic cells is, however, incomplete. In this work we have investigated MV replication in cells of human myelomonocytic lineage with different maturation stages in order to study the effect of cellular maturation on virus infection. MV was able to infect human bone marrow myeloid granulocyte–macrophage colony-forming cells (CFC-GM) as well as monocytes and macrophages, but the replication cycle seemed to be regulated by the maturation stage of the cells. Virus infection in CFC-GM was productive, unlike in monocytes and macrophages, where an extensive viral RNA synthesis occurred and high amounts of proteins were synthesised without a remarkable release of infectious virus. Efficiency of viral macromolecular synthesis in macrophages was comparable to that of <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line U- 937 and human epithelial cell line A 549, but in contrast to macrophages the cell lines highly supported productive infection. On the other hand, chemically induced maturation of the human promyelocytic and <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> lines HL- 60, THP- 1, and U- 937 to more mature macrophage-like forms did not markedly alter the replication cycle of MV in these cell lines. Our results showed that MV replication in myelomonocytic cells varied depending on the maturation stage of the cells. The immature myelomonocytic cells supported productive virus infection, but the maturation process lead to cellular changes that caused a restriction of MV replication cycle partly at posttranscriptional and partly at posttranslational level.

CR 2 was efficiently and consistently expressed on the cell membranes, conferring enhanced susceptibility to EBV infection. The efficient expression of recombinant CR 2 in cell lines of hematopoietic origin allowed for study of the interaction between EBV infection and HIV- 1 gene regulation in suitable cell-culture models.

It is thus crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment, maintenance and reactivation of HIV- 1 latency. Since chromatin remodeling has been implicated in the transcriptional reactivation of the HIV- 1 promoter, we assessed {{the role of the}} histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB) on two HIV- 1 latently infected cell lines (U 1 and ACH- 2) gene expression. Results Analysis of microarrays data led us to select two candidate genes: NCoA 3 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3), a nuclear receptor coactivator and IRF 8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8), an interferon regulatory factor. NCoA 3 gene expression is upregulated following NaB treatment of latently infected cells whereas IRF 8 gene expression is strongly downregulated in the <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line following NaB treatment. Their differential expressions were confirmed at the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, NCoA 3 gene expression was also upregulated after treatment of U 1 and ACH- 2 cells with phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) but not trichostatin A (TSA) and after treatment with NaB of two others HIV- 1 latently infected cell lines (OM 10. 1 and J 1. 1). IRF 8 gene is only expressed in U 1 cells and was also downregulated after treatment with PMA or TSA. Functional analyses confirmed that NCoA 3 synergizes with Tat to enhance HIV- 1 promoter transcription and that IRF 8 represses the IRF 1 -mediated activation through the HIV- 1 promoter Interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Conclusion These results led us to postulate that NCoA 3 could be involved in the transcriptional reactivation of the HIV- 1 promoter from latency and that IRF 8 may contribute to the maintenance of the latent state in the <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line. Implication of these factors in the maintenance or reactivation of the viral latency may provide potential new targets to control HIV- 1 replication in latent viral reservoirs. </p...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} observed that signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, namely STAT 1 and STAT 5, are often constitutively activated in the PBMC {{of most of}} HIV- 1 + individuals; furthermore, most patients are characterized by the dominant expression of a C-ter-minally truncated isoform of STAT 5 (STAT 5 Δ) [1]. STAT 5 Δ is also the prevalent isoform of STAT 5 found in the chronically HIV- 1 infected <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line U 1, characterized by a constitutive state of viral latency and inducibility of virus expression by PMA or several cytokines. We recently reported that activated STAT 5 Δ {{can act as a}} negative regulator of HIV- 1 expression in GM-CSF stimulated U 1 cells and IL- 2 -stimulated PBMCs. Indeed, in U 1 cells we have shown that activated STAT 5 Δ can directly in vivo bind to STAT consensus sequences in th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this report}} {{we discuss the}} role of {{interferon}} regulatory factor 1 (IRF- 1) in the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) transcription during IFNγ human macrophage activation. We show that a binding sequence for the transcription factor IRF- 1 is contained in the first intron of the human ODC gene (from nt + 2711 to nt + 2722) we demonstrate {{that the level of}} expression of IRF- 1 increases in human macrophages and in the human <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cell</b> line, U 937, previously differentiated in monocytes/macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), after 2 h of IFNγ stimulation. We also show that the hamster tk-ts 13 cell line, stably transfected with the IRF- 1 cDNA, over-expresses ODC. In addition, a specific complex was detected, by gel-shift assay after incubating a 20 bp double-stranded oligomer containing the binding sequence for IRF- 1 with nuclear proteins extracted from human macrophages and from (PMA-differentiated) U 937 cells stimulated with IFNγ for 2 h...|$|E
40|$|Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) {{have been}} implicated in {{promoting}} tumor growth and development. Here we present evidence that demonstrates that co-inoculation of male athymic nude mice with PC- 3 prostate cancer cells and U 937 <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells</b> enhances tumor growth and increases tumor angiogenesis. Male athymic nude mice were co-inoculated with PC- 3 and U 937 cells (control or IL- 4 stimulated) and tumor growth was monitored over time. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens was performed for proliferation markers (e. g., Ki 67) {{and the effects of}} IL- 4 stimulation on U 937 cells were analyzed for chemokine expression. The presence of U 937 cells increased the rate of tumor growth in vivo and stimulated increased microvascular density within the tumor bed. Stimulation of U 937 cells with IL- 4 resulted in a significant increase in several pro-angiogenic and pro-tumor chemokines (e. g., CCL 2). Co-inoculation increases prostate cancer growth via upregulation of chemokines that induce angiogenesis within the tumor. J. Cell. Biochem. 103 : 1 – 8, 2008. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe binding subunit of {{pertussis}} toxin (PTX-B) {{has been shown}} recently to inhibit the entry and postentry events in HIV- 1 replication in primary T lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. While the effect of PTX-B on HIV- 1 entry was shown to involve CCR 5 desensitization, the mechanism of postentry inhibition remained unclear. In T lymphocytes, PTX-B affected transcription or stability of Tat-stimulated HIV- 1 mRNAs. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of postentry inhibition of HIV- 1 replication by PTX-B in U- 937 <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells.</b> We demonstrate that in these cells PTX-B inhibits expression of luciferase reporter gene controlled by the HIV- 1 LTR promoter. This effect is Tat-independent and is not restricted to the HIV- 1 LTR promoter. Instead, PTX-B activity is mediated through suppression of the cellular transcription factor, NF-κB. PTX-B inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p 65 subunit of NF-κB. This effect is independent of the cytoplasmic NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, as PTX-B stimulates phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of this protein. The suppressive activity of PTX-B on NF-κB p 65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation is delayed, suggesting that PTX-B signaling might initiate synthesis and cytoplasmic accumulation of a p 65 phosphorylation inhibitor...|$|R
40|$|Activators {{of protein}} kinase C, such as 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA), {{are known to}} {{regulate}} the expression of many genes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) gene, by affecting the level or activity of upstream transcription factors. To investigate the mechanism whereby TPA activates the TNF promoter, a series of 5 '-deletion mutants of the human TNF promoter linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was transfected into U 937 human <b>promonocytic</b> <b>cells.</b> TPA produced a 7 - to 11 -fold activation of all TNF promoters tested, even those promoters truncated to contain only the core promoter with no upstream enhancer elements. The proximal TNF promoter containing only 28 nucleotides upstream and 10 nucleotides downstream of the RNA start site confers TPA activation {{to a variety of}} unrelated upstream enhancer elements and transcription factors, including Sp 1, CTF/NF 1, cyclic AMP-response element, GAL-E 1 a, and GAL-VP 16. The level of activation by TPA depends on the TATA box structure, since the TPA response is greater in promoters containing the sequence TATAAA than in those containing TATTAA or TATTTA. These findings suggest that the core promoter region is a target for gene regulation by second-messenger pathways...|$|R
