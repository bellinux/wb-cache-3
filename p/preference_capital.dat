40|$|The article {{discusses}} Wicksell's {{assessment of}} the controversy between Bohm-Bawerk on one side, and Fisher and Bortkiewicz on the other, {{on the role of}} productivity (the 'third reason') in the determination of the rate of interest. It is shown that in the process of arguing out the third reason Wicksell came remarkably close to Frank Ramsey's view of the determinants of saving in economies with a positive subjective rate of discount. The similarities between Wicksell and Ramsey result from the fact that - in contrast with Fisher and Bohm-Bewerk - they assumed reinvestment, with the corollary that maximum permanent consumption will be reached at zero interest if the subjective rate discount of future utility is zero. Wicksell used his Ramsey-like saving rule to explain the interaction betwen Bohm-Bawerk's three reasons in either dynamic or stationary conditions, which enabled him to reformulate the third reason as the 'marginal productivity of waiting'. Finally, the relevance of Wicksell's savings rule for the perennial debate on 'Wicksell's missing equation' is considered in the last section of the article. rate of interest, saving, technical progress, time <b>preference,</b> <b>capital,...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to answer}} several {{issues on the}} global {{transmission}} effects of the government fiscal policy. In order to address the issues, this thesis builds a two-country overlapping-generations (OLG) model in which there exist different time preferences, different fiscal policies, and different tax schemes between countries. In particular, the model adopt a utility function with a constant inter-temporal elasticity of substitution (LIES), in which saving positively depends on both labor income and the interest rate. In chapter 1, we try to answer the question; How does the difference in time preferences of individuals affect economic variables in an open economy? and have shown that; first, when two economies with different time preferences are integrated, the capital labor ratio along the transition path is higher or lower than its steady-state value; second, {{depending on whether the}} former or the latter happens, the behavior of the balance of payments and the welfare of two countries also differ; third, the less patient country reveals a surplus of current account in spite of an aging population; lastly, economic integration, even if it worsens the current welfare of the less patient country, ultimately improves the future welfare of the country. In chapter 2, we try to answer the question; How is the government debt or budget deficit of a country transmitted to other countries? We have first shown that the crowding out effect of the budget deficit is more pronounced in autarky than in open economy. Second, with an aging population, the current account of the debtor country shows a surplus during the transition path and converges to zero in the steady state. With an increasing population, the current account shows an ambiguous sign during the transition path and reveals a deficit in the steady state; lastly, the government debt lowers the welfare of future generations in both countries. In particular, the welfare of the debtor country continuously declines. In chapter 3, we try to answer the question; Which tax scheme is the best? We have first shown that with respect to capital formation, the consumption tax dominates the capital income tax and the capital income tax dominates the wage tax. Second, the shift to the consumption tax or the capital income tax renders the tax-reformed country a creditor and the other country a debtor. Third, with respect to welfare, the consumption tax is superior to the wage tax but seems not show an advantage over the capital income tax in the tax-reformed country. However, welfare in the other country is somewhat higher under the consumption tax scheme than under other tax schemes of the tax-reformed country; fourth, the tax rate is highest under the capital income tax and is lowest under the consumption tax. Lastly, the transitional analysis shows that the capital income tax can be more rewarding than the consumption tax in the aspect of welfare because the reform to the capital income tax enters its new steady state with a faster speed.

Our empirical analysis is based on a theoretical framework, which explicitly allows the risk preferences of individuals to influence human capital accumulation and, consequently, wage growth. Our findings support a positive relationship between less risk averse behaviour and wage growth with the relationship becoming more pronounced over time.

An axiomatic theory of financial arithmetic was first proposed by Peccati, who introduced an axiomatic definition of future value. This theory has been extensively developed in recent years. The proposed approach to financial arithmetic is based on the concept of the utility of a financial flow. This utility function is defined as a linear extension of a multicriterion comparison determined by an individual's time <b>preference</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>preference.</b> The present value is then defined to be the utility of the financial flow. Therefore, the law of the diminishing marginal utility of wealth has been considered as an additional feature of the present value. The future value is defined as the inverse of the utility function. This definition is a generalization of Peccati's one. The net present value is given as the unique additive extension of the utility of the financial flow.

The literature review was delimited by time and terminology, and orbited about the theoretical foundation of the thesis. The secondary data displayed unusual depth and richness yet was subject to rapid obsolescence and political polarization due to the topical and controversial nature of capital gains tax. The methodological inquiry protocol was positivist and deductive in practice, using vetted and static survey instruments with which strict ethical standards were maintained. Nonparametric tools were employed given the quantitative and categorical nature of the data, and the null hypothesis was rejected. Findings were triangulated via the primary and secondary data. The secondary data proved helpful but inconclusive, as did the minor phenomenology inputs. Reliance on primary data was key to the outcome.
