Also, we eliminate the biases that may caused by extreme organisms in both predicted proteomes and COGs analyses. More basic AAs, His, Lys and Glu were found in eukaryotic proteins compared with prokaryotic proteins by predicted <b>proteomes</b> <b>analysis.</b> By COGs analysis, we found that basic AAs and Lys frequencies are higher in eukaryotic orthologous proteins than their prokaryotic companions, while the trend of Arg frequency is the opposite.

Therefore, {{the formation of}} SICs of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 was investigated by isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic methods in this study for better controlling the SICs induced by HPCD. A total of 2, 446 proteins was identified by iTRAQ, of which 93 and 29 were significantly differentially expressed in the SICs compared with live control cells (CKL) and dead control cells (CKD), respectively. Among the 93 differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the SICs compared with CKL, 65 proteins showed down-regulation and 28 showed up-regulation. According to the comprehensive <b>proteome</b> coverage <b>analysis,</b> the SICs survived under HPCD by reducing carbohydrate decomposing, lipid transport and metabolism, amino acid transport and metabolism, transcription and translation, DNA replication and repair.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{developed}} a method CHOP dissecting proteins into domain-like fragments. The basic {{idea was to}} cut proteins beginning from very reliable experimental information (PDB), proceeding to expert annotations of domain-like regions (Pfam-A), and completing through cuts based on termini of known proteins. In this way, CHOP dissected more than two thirds of all proteins from 62 <b>proteomes.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of our structural domain-like fragments revealed four surprising results. First,> 70 % of all dissected proteins contained more than one fragment. Second, most domains spanned on average over � 100 residues. This average was similar for eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, {{and it is also}} valid—although previously not described—for all proteins in the PDB. Third, single-domain proteins were significant longer than most domains in multidomain proteins. Fourth, three fourths of all domains appeared shorter than 210 residues. We believe that our CHOP fragments constituted an important resource for functional and structural genomics. Nevertheless, our main motivation to develop CHOP was that the single-linkage clustering method failed to adequately group full-length proteins. In contrast, CLUP—the simple clustering scheme CLUP introduced here—succeeded largely to group the CHOP fragments from 62 proteomes such that all members of one cluster shared a basic structural core. CLUP found> 63, 000 multiand> 118, 000 single-member clusters. Although most fragments were restricted to a particular cluster, � 24 % of the fragments were duplicated in at least two clusters. Our thresholds for grouping two fragments into the same cluster were rather conservative. Nevertheless, our results suggested that structural genomics initiatives have to target> 30, 000 fragments to at least cover the multimember clusters in 62 proteomes. Proteins 2004...|$|R

However, a protein's three-dimensional structure may provide functional and evolutionary insight in cases of minimal sequence similarity. In this vein, the structure of STIV F 93 reveals a homodimer with strong similarity to the winged-helix family of DNA-binding proteins. Importantly, an interchain disulfide bond is found at the dimer interface, prompting analysis of the cysteine distribution in the putative intracellular proteins of the viral <b>proteome.</b> The <b>analysis</b> suggests that intracellular disulfide bonds are common in cellular STIV proteins, where they enhance the thermostability of the viral proteome...|$|R
