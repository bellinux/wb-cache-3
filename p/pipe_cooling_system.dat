40|$|The {{energy crisis}} and {{environmental}} issues are the major obstacles for human development. There is ongoing research occurring in order to overcome these obstacles through energy saving initiatives and alternative energy options for a sustainable environment and economy. A passive air cooling strategy {{is seen as a}} viable option to save energy for all hot and humid subtropical climatic zones. An earth pipe cooling technique is one of them which utilises the earth’s near constant underground temperature for cooling a space in a passive process without using any mechanical units, and thus saves energy in buildings with less or no environmental impact. It has mainly been used or studied in Europe and America and never been studied before in any subtropical climate of Australia. The earth <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> involves long buried pipes in which intake air comes through one end and passes through buried underground pipes, then the air is cooled by the cold soil and finally the cooled air is released into the room through the outlet end. In this study, the buried pipes were aligned in horizontal and vertical trenches and thermal performance of the horizontal and vertical earth pipe cooling systems was investigated for a hot and humid climatic zone, Rockhampton, Australia using a new and novel approach with experimental and numerical modelling and parametric investigation. The earth pipe cooling experiment was conducted on two rooms that were fabricated from two shipping containers and installed in the sustainable precinct of Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Australia. One of the rooms was connected to a horizontal earth pipe cooling (HEPC) system and the other to a vertical earth pipe cooling (VEPC) system. Effects of air velocity, air temperature, relative humidity and soil temperature on room cooling performance were investigated through a series of experiments. An integrated thermal model was developed for both the horizontal and vertical earth pipe cooling systems using the simulation program ANSYS Fluent to compare and validate their cooling performance. A temperature reduction of 1. 13 oC was found for the HEPC system while 1. 87 oC was obtained for the VEPC system. The temperature reductions saved an average energy cost of $ 122. 82 (maximum of $ 210. 87) in 3 months of summer 2013 - 2014 using the HEPC system and $ 131. 84 (maximum of $ 275. 58) in 3 months of summer 2014 - 2015 using the VEPC system for a 27. 23 m 3 room. These savings contributed to return the initial investment in 4. 59 years and 4. 27 years (payback period) for the HEPC and VEPC system respectively. To measure the optimum efficiency of the earth <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> a parametric analysis was carried out in ANSYS Fluent. The parameters affecting the earth pipe cooling performance, namely air velocity, pipe length, pipe diameter and thickness, pipe material, and pipe depth were taken into consideration for this analysis.

The parametric study showed that the VEPC system is capable of reducing the room temperature by a further 3. 50 oC.

Analysis of {{literature}} sources {{had shown that}} up-to-date state of miniaturization of electronic devices needs {{the development of new}} small-size cooling systems, which are capable to reject great heat fluxes.

Mathematical model of heat transfer processes in conditions of decreasing inner space in thermosyphones, miniature and oscillating heat pipes was presented. Transfer from large space to small space is determined by the Bond number (Bo). There are some changes in heat transfer conditions when ?? 0, 5 < 1 and, therefore, existing relations are inadequate for calculating heat transfer intensity in conditions of decreasing vapour space. For investigation of this process a couple of miniature heat pipes with outer diameter from 3 mm to 6 mm (inner diameter of vapour space ? from 1, 2 mm to 4 mm) were produced. Was shown, that decreasing of vapour space diameter results in great increasing of thermal resistance and decreasing of transferred heat fluxes. Visualisation of vapour generating processes was carried out on glass miniature thermosyphones and oscillating heat pipes. New data about dependence of pulsations of temperature in heat transfer zones from transferred heat flux were obtained due to such cinematographic investigation of hydraulic characteristics of liquid-vapor mixture flow in thermosyphones and oscillating heat pipes. As a result of heat transfer characteristic investigation new relations between heat transfer coefficients in heat transfer zones and heat flux were obtained at a first time. New data about maximum heat fluxes transferred by miniature heat pipes and thermosyphones were recovered.

40|$|Current water-cooling {{technology}} {{used in the}} metallurgical industry poses a major safety concern. In addition, these systems are expensive to operate and result in significant energy losses. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis {{was to develop a}} viable <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> based on novel heat pipe technology which addresses these problems. This technology employs boiling as the means to store and transfer heat energy. The large heat extraction capacity of the device is owed to two design features: firstly, a separate return line that generates a column of liquid working fluid which drains into the evaporator by gravity, and secondly, a helical flow modifier in the evaporator that stabilizes annular two-phase flow. A full-scale copper tapblock and launder were designed with water-based heat <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems were successfully tested under industrial heat loading conditions, using a gas burner to simulate the heat loads. The tapblock <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> was able to dissipate 142 kW per heat pipe, at heat fluxes as high as 2. 4 MW/m 2. These values are the largest to date using the novel water-based heat pipe technology. The launder system was the first to incorporate horizontal heat pipes, as well as have multiple evaporators feeding a single condenser. The <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> used in both experiments were fundamentally safer than watercooling systems, being operated at low pressures and with only several kilograms of water exposed to the heat source. The cooling water requirements of these systems represent a reduction of 80 - 95 % compared to conventional water-cooling, with increased potential for energy recovery. During the testing, dry-out and film boiling were identified as the main limitations. It was found that film boiling occurs when the flow in the evaporator is not great enough to generate a helical motion. The dry-out limitation was achieved when the velocity of the flow within the evaporator was too great, causing a large pressure gradient that opposes the gravity head of the return line. Both of these limitations are related to the configuration of the evaporator, i. e. the return line and the flow modifier. A methodology was developed to model the evaporator numerically using computational fluid dynamics. This methodology can be used to understand how the design parameters of the evaporator affect the flow patterns during operation...|$|R

The punched-out delta wings in the staggered and in-line arrangements provided enhancements of 30 % and 26 % respectively. Enhancements from the active delta wings were lower (16 %), however as these devices reduce the pressure drop through the fin stack by approximately 19 % in the deactivate position, over the activated position; a reduction in fan operating cost may be achieved for systems operating with inlet air temperatures below the maximum inlet temperature specification for the device.

40|$|The {{permanent}} mold casting process is a relatively popular and effective casting technology that can produce near-net-shape aluminum components with integrity, particularly for the automotive and aerospace industries. It is well recognized by the casting industry that {{it is essential to}} control the cooling of {{permanent mold}} castings in order {{to improve the quality of}} the castings, so there is a considerable incentive to develop a more effective method of mold cooling to control the temperature distribution of the mold and the casting. The current technologies for controlled cooling are air or water cooling passages and chill inserts. Each of these cooling methods presents certain disadvantages, and none offer optimum cooling control. Based on these considerations, a novel, effective and controllable water-based heat pipe has been successfully developed to be used as a new method of permanent mold cooling where high heat fluxes are normally encountered. Heat pipes featuring this design have been incorporated in an experimental permanent mold made of HI 3 tool steel that contains three symmetric steps. Computer modeling for the {{permanent mold casting}} process has been accomplished to predict the effect and potential of heat pipe cooling for permanent mold casting. Castings of A 3 56 alloy have been produced by this permanent mold. The effects of heat pipe cooling on permanent mold castings have been evaluated by analyzing the temperature distribution of the mold and the casting, as well as by measuring the dendrite arm spacing and shrinkage distribution of the castings. The effect of heat pipe cooling on the mold solidification time of castings of A 356 alloy with different coating types was also studied. Industrial trials have been carried out to evaluate this new cooling technology on an industrial scale casting machine. Because the space around the mold installed on a low pressure die casting machine is very limited, it is often very difficult to install the heat pipe in the specific desired location in the mold.

Modeling and experimental results have shown that the water based heat pipe can provide high cooling rates in casting processes.

40|$|Thermal {{cracking}} {{of massive}} concrete structures occurs {{as a result}} of stresses caused by hydration in real environment conditions. The extended finite element method that combines thermal fields and creep is used in this study to analyze the thermal cracking of massive concrete structures. The temperature field is accurately simulated through an equivalent equation of heat conduction that considers the effect of a <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>system.</b> The time-dependent creep behavior of massive concrete is determined by the viscoelastic constitutive model with Prony series. Based on the degree of hydration, we consider the main properties related to cracking evolving with time. Numerical simulations of a real massive concrete structure are conducted. Results show that the developed method is efficient for numerical calculations of thermal cracks on massive concrete. Further analyses indicate that a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and appropriate heat preservation measures can efficiently prevent the occurrence of thermal cracks...|$|R
40|$|As {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} continue to deplete, research for alternate power sources continues to develop. One of these alternate technologies is fuel cells. They are a practical fuel source able to provide significant amounts of power for applications from laptops to automobiles and their only byproduct is water. However, although this technology is over a century old and NASA {{has been working with}} it since the early 1960 s there is still room for improvement. The research I am involved in at NASA's Glenn Research Center is focusing on what is called a regenerative fuel cell system. The unique characteristic of this type of system is that it used an outside power source to create electrolysis of the water it produces and it then reuses the hydrogen and oxygen to continue producing power. The advantage of this type of system is that, for example, on space missions it can use solar power to recharge its gas supplies between periods when the object being orbited blocks out the sun. This particular system however is far from completion. This is because of the many components that are required to make up a fuel cell that need to be tested individually. The specific part of the system that is being worked on this summer of 2004 is the cooling system. The fuel cell stack, that is the part that actually creates the power, also produces a lot of heat. When not properly cooled, it has been known to cause fires which, needless to say are not conducive to the type of power that is trying to be created. In order to cool the fuel cell stack in this system we are developing a heat <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> One of the main components of a heat <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is {{what is known as the}} evaporator, and that is what happens to be the part of the system we are developing this summer. In most heat pipe systems the evaporator is a tube in which the working fluid is cooled and then re-circulated through the system to absorb more heat energy from the fuel cell stack. For this system, instead of a tube, the evaporator is made up of a stack-up of screen material and absorbent membranes inside a stainless steel shell and held together by a film adhesive and epoxy. There is an initial design for this flat plate evaporator, however is has not yet been made. The components of the stack-up are known, so all testing is focused on how it will all go together. This includes finding an appropriate epoxy to make the evaporator conductive all the way through and finding a way to hold the required tight tolerances as the stainless steel outer shell is put together. By doing the tests on smaller samples of the stack-ups and then testing the fill size component, the final flat plate evaporator will reach its final design so that research can continue on other parts of the regenerative fue 1 cell system, and another step in the improvement of fue 1 cell technology can be made...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, {{following}} a major earthquake, a 15 -metre tsunami disabled the power supply and cooling of three Fukushima Daiichi reactors, causing a nuclear accident on 11 March 2011. All three cores largely melted {{in the first}} three days. The accident was rated 7 on the INES (International Nuclear Event Scale) scale, due to high radioactive releases in the first few days. After two weeks the three reactors (units 1 - 3) were stable with water addition but no proper heat sink for removal of decay heat from fuel. By July they were being cooled with recycled water from the new treatment plant, and reactor temperatures had fallen to below 80 ºC at the end of October, and official 'cold shutdown condition ' was announced in mid December. In this paper, the nuclear power plant No. 4 at Fukushima was chosen for the analysis- thermal power 2, 381 MW; electrical power 784 MW; 658 spent fuel bundles (39, 456 spent fuel rods); spent fuel water pool volume 1, 400 tonnes. Detail analysis of various heat pipe design cases to determine the best design concept in terms of cooling power, construction and cost are presented. The best design when considering thermal safety margin and cost is the heat pipe cooling 0. 9 MW; 1, 662 heat pipe modules; water temperature will reach to peak 68 °C after 75 hours, and will be saturated at 50 °C after 2, 000 hours. The estimated cost for complete heat <b>pipe</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is about 2. 16 Millions USD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most of {{refrigerators}} commonly use {{the conventional}} refrigeration system known as Vapor Compression Refrigeration System becoming {{a big issue}} lately due to ozone depleting substance it uses as the refrigerant. This paper will describe systematically of an experiment {{with the objective of}} constructing a refrigeration system based on thermoelectric which is reliable and compete able with the Vapor Compression Refrigeration System. The designs of this refrigeration system give emphasis on the environment that is combined with the knowledge so that the environmentally friendly technology can be applied. The performance of thermoelectric refrigerator was investigated under variation of input power (40 W, 72 W, and 120 W) and operated in ambient temperature and cooling load of water 1000 mL to investigate the characteristic of system and the coefficient of performance, COP. It is found that the COP is decrease by increasing of cooling load, QL. The best actual COP is 0. 182 obtained when the refrigerator operated at input power 40 W. The result shows that decreasing of ambient temperature affects the decreasing of cabin temperature. Thermoelectric and heat <b>pipe</b> refrigerator <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can reach cabin temperature of 10. 63 ˚C for the power of 120 Watt (8. 73 A, 14 V) indicates effective performance work-based thermoelectric applications...|$|R
40|$|Safe, reliable, compact, autonomous, {{long-life}} fission {{systems have}} numerous potential applications, both terrestrially and in space. Technologies and facilities developed {{in support of}} these systems could be useful {{to a variety of}} concepts. At moderate power levels, fission systems can be designed to operate for decades without the need for refueling. In addition, fast neutron damage to cladding and structural materials can be maintained at an acceptable level. Nuclear design codes have advanced to the stage where high confidence in the behavior and performance of a system can be achieved prior to initial testing. To help ensure reactor affordability, an optimal strategy must be devised for development and qualification. That strategy typically involves a combination of non-nuclear and nuclear testing. Non-nuclear testing is particularly useful for concepts in which nuclear operating characteristics are well understood and nuclear effects such as burnup and radiation damage {{are not likely to be}} significant. To be mass efficient, a SFPS must operate at higher coolant temperatures and use different types of power conversion than typical terrestrial reactors. The primary reason is the difficulty in rejecting excess heat to space. Although many options exist, NASA s current reference SFPS uses a fast spectrum, pumped-NaK cooled reactor coupled to a Stirling power conversion subsystem. The reference system uses technology with significant terrestrial heritage while still providing excellent performance. In addition, technologies from the SFPS system could be applicable to compact terrestrial systems. Recent non-nuclear testing at NASA s Early Flight Fission Test Facility (EFF-TF) has helped assess the viability of the reference SFPS and evaluate methods for system integration. In July, 2011 an Annular Linear Induction Pump (ALIP) provided by Idaho National Laboratory was tested at the EFF-TF to assess performance and verify suitability for use in a 10 kWe technology demonstration unit (TDU). In November, 2011 testing of a 37 -pin core simulator (designed in conjunction with Los Alamos National Laboratory) for use with the TDU will occur. Previous testing at the EFFTF has included the thermal and mechanical coupling of a pumped NaK loop to Stirling engines (provided by GRC). Testing related to heat <b>pipe</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>systems,</b> gas <b>cooled</b> <b>systems,</b> heat exchangers, and other technologies has also been performed. Integrated TDU testing will begin at GRC in 2013. Thermal simulators developed at the EFF-TF are capable of operating over the temperature and power range typically of interest to compact reactors. Small and large diameter simulators have been developed, and simulators (coupled with the facility) are able to closely match the axial and radial power profile of all potential systems of interest. A photograph of the TDU core simulator during assembly is provided in Figure 2...|$|R
