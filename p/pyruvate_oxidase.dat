40|$|A {{problem of}} {{paramount}} importance in analytical chemistry is selectivity, particularly at low analyte concentrations and {{in the presence of}} interfering substances. High selectivity, even in trace analysis, has been gained by progress in analytical instrumentation such as high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy. However, these powerful instruments are not applicable for in-situ operation and can only be used in specialized laboratories. The development of highly selective sensors that are easy to handle is therefore an important problem. Biosensors may provide solution to this problem. Biosensors are devices incorporating a biologically active element in intimate contact with a physico-chemical signal transducer and an electronic signal processor. The goal of this combination is to utilize the high selectivity of biological sensing for analytical purposes in various fields of research and technology. Of all types of biosensors, catalytic sensors based on the molecular analyte recognition and conversion by enzymes have been most intensely studied. Enzymes are perfect indicators because they combine selectivity with catalytic power. Enzymes {{play an important role in}} bioanalytical chemistry and biosensorics. There are many commercialized analytical testkits based on enzymatic reactions. With respect to improvements in speed, cost and on-line capabilities, enzyme sensors offer attractive alternatives to existing methods. Furthermore, portable enzyme sensors could be used for monitoring in sports, food and environmental monitoring. The aim of this thesis is to describe novel biosensors with enzymes as the biocomponent, and to apply them in the area of sports monitoring, food production, and environmental monitoring. Chapter 2 decribes the application of biosensors and biotests for fitness and muscle stress in sports, monitoring the plasma creatine kinase (CK), L-lactate, β-D-glucose and Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (FABP) concentration of racing horses and a group of junior rowers. Measurements of CK and FABP were performed with biosensors and biotests with sequential enzymatic reactions and immuno reactions, respectively. Quantification of L-lactate (or β-D-glucose) was undertaken by a biosensor with immobilized L-lactate oxidase (or glucose oxidase) on a Clark oxygen type electrode. The information obtained will be a base for further applications of biosensors and biotests to improve the performance of athletes. In Chapter 3, novel thick film biosensors are used for the determination of L-glutamate and L-lactate in foodstuffs. The sensors were prepared by immobilization of L-glutamate oxidase using polycarbamylsulfonate hydrogel on a thick-film sensor. L-Glutamate oxidases obtained from Streptomyces sp. with different degree of purification were compared with their characteristic response to L-glutamate at different conditions and for their specificity, inhibition behavior, and storage properties. These sensors were applied to determine monosodium glutamate in soy sauce samples that available in food market, and are correlated with calorimetric method. In Chapter 4, a simple and elegant method for determination of both phytate and phytase activity in animal feed will be introduced. Both phytate and phytase are important in animal feed. Sensors using immobilized phytase, acid phosphatase, glucose and <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidases</b> are investigated. These sensors can help to optimize the use of phytase and phytic acid as a feed additive, which can in turn reduce phosphorous pollution of the environment. Chapter 5 describes novel methods to increase the operation stability of enzyme sensors by using crystals of glucose oxidase and catalase. A combined method of crosslinking and hydrogel-entrapment of the enzyme crystals is described. Moreover, a novel technology of encapsulation of the enzyme crystals by polyelectrolytes is developed that keeps the crystal structure intact. In Chapter 6, a novel method of sample pretreatment by enzymatic hydrolysis is introduced for rapid Biochemical Oxygen Demand (sensorBOD) measurements. With this fast, easy-to-handle and safe procedure the sensorBOD values of macromolecules (e. g. starch, cellulose or milk powder) give a close correlation to the traditional 5 -day BOD test (BOD 5). The final chapter, Chapter 7, summarizes and interprets the major findings of the previous chapters and discusses the merits of the research for future development...|$|R

The respiratory control was completely lost from days 3 to 5. During this period mitochondria {{were shown to}} be very leaky, losing about 88 % of their total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to the suspending medium in a short time. The respiratory control was partially recovered by day 7, after which it completely disappeared again. By the use of differential centrifugation, the mitochondria were divided into subfractions by sequential centrifugation: 10, 000 g for 5 minutes, 25, 000 g for 5 minutes, and 40, 000 g for 5 minutes.

Results: Plasmatic levels of lactate and LOX {{were significantly higher}} in autistic patients compared to healthy subjects and that of PK and HK were significantly lower in these patients as compared to controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Aluminum is {{considered}} the most limiting factor for plant productivity in acidic soils, which cover {{large areas of the}} world's potential arable lands. The inhibition of root growth is recognized as the primary effect of Al toxicity. To identify genes associated with Al stress and tolerance, transcriptome analyses of four different wheat lines (2 Al-tolerant and 2 Al sensitive) that differ in their response to Al were performed. Results Microarray expression profiling revealed that 83 candidate genes are associated with Al stress and 25 are associated with tolerance. The stress-associated genes include important enzymes such as <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase, alternative <b>oxidase,</b> and galactonolactone oxidase, ABC transporter and ascorbate oxido-reducatase. The Al tolerance-associated genes include the ALMT- 1 malate transporter, glutathione S-transferase, germin/oxalate oxidase, fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, cysteine-rich proteins, cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase, cellulose synthase, zinc finger transcription factor, disease resistance response protein and F-box containing domain protein. Conclusion In this survey, we identified stress- and tolerance-associated genes that may be involved in the detoxification of Al and reactive oxygen species. Alternative pathways could help maintain the supply of important metabolites (H 2 O 2, ascorbate, NADH, and phosphate) needed for Al tolerance and root growth.

40|$|In Arum and soybean (Glycine max L.) mitochondria, the {{dependence}} of the alternative oxidase activity on the redox level of ubiquinone, with NADH and succinate as substrates, was studied, using a voltametric procedure to measure the ubiquinone redox poise in the mitochondrial membrane. The results showed that when the enzyme was activated by pyruvate {{the relationship between the}} alternative oxidase rate and the redox state of the ubiquinone pool was the same for both NADH and succinate oxidations. In the absence of <b>pyruvate</b> the alternative <b>oxidase</b> had an apparent lower affinity for ubiquinol. This was more marked with NADH than with succinate and was possibly due to pyruvate production during succinate oxidation or to an activation of the alternative oxidase by succinate itself. In Arum spadix (unlike soybean cotyledon) mitochondria, succinate oxidation via the alternative oxidase maintained the ubiquinone pool in a partially reduced state (60 %), whereas NADH oxidation kept it almost completely reduced. Previous data comparing mitochondria from thermogenic and nonthermogenic tissues have not examined the full range of ubiquinone redox levels in both tissues, leading to the suggestion that the activity of alternative oxidase for Arum was different from nonthermogenic tissues. When the complete range of redox states of ubiquinone is used and the oxidase is fully activated, the alternative oxidase from thermogenic tissue (Arum) behaves similarly to that of nonthermogenic tissue (soybean) ...|$|R

This Tn 10 insertion mapped to 95 min on the S. typhimurium chromosome, a location analogous to that of poxA in the Escherichia coli genome. Like the E. coli poxA mutant, this mutant had reduced <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity, reduced cross-reacting material to antiserum to purified E. coli <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> and reduced growth rates. In addition, the following phenotypes were identified for the E. coli and S. typhimurium poxA mutants: hypersensitivity to SM and alpha-ketobutyrate (AKB), deficiency in AKB metabolism, reduced activity of acetolactate synthase, and hypersensitivity {{to a wide range}} of bacterial growth inhibitors, including antibiotics, amino acid analogs, and dyes. An E. coli mutant defective in poxB, the structural gene encoding <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> did not have these phenotypes; therefore, they are not solely a consequence of a <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> deficiency.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the previously characterized <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> PoxB, the Lactobacillus plantarum genome encodes four predicted pyruvate oxidases (PoxC, PoxD, PoxE, and PoxF). Each <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> gene was individually inactivated, and only the knockout of poxF resulted in a decrease in <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity under the tested conditions. We show here that L. plantarum has two major pyruvate oxidases: PoxB and PoxF. Both are involved in lactate-to-acetate conversion in the early stationary phase of aerobic growth and are regulated by carbon catabolite repression. A strain devoid of <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity was constructed by knocking out the poxB and poxF genes. In this mutant, acetate production was strongly affected, with lactate remaining the major end product of either glucose or maltose fermentation. Notably, survival during the stationary phase appeared to be dramatically improved in the poxB poxF double mutant. Acetate is the major fermentation end product of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum when cultivated under aerobic conditions and sugar limitation. It is produced {{at the expense of}} lactate as glucose becomes depleted and cells enter the stationary phase of growth.

40|$|A {{number of}} enzymes require flavin for their {{catalytic}} activity, although the reaction catalyzed involves no redox reaction. The best studied of these enigmatic nonredox flavoproteins are the acetohydroxy acid synthases (AHAS), which catalyze early {{steps in the}} synthesis of branched-chain amino acids in bacteria, yeasts, and plants. Previously, work from our laboratory showed strong amino acid sequence homology between these enzymes and Escherichia coli <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> a classical flavoprotein dehydrogenase that catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetate. We have now shown this homology (i) to also {{be present in the}} DNA sequences and (ii) to represent functional homology in that <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> has AHAS activity and a protein consisting of the amino-terminal half of <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> and the carboxy-terminal half of E. coli AHAS I allows native E. coli AHAS I to function without added flavin. The hybrid protein contains tightly bound flavin, which is essential for the flavin substitution activity.

Moreover, Northern blotting performed at different stages of growth showed that poxB expression is maximal in the early stationary phase when glucose is exhausted. Primer extension and in vivo footprint {{analyses revealed that}} glucose repression of poxB is mediated by CcpA binding to the cre site identified in the promoter region. The functional role of the PoxB enzyme was studied by using gene overexpression and knockout in order to evaluate its implications for acetate production.

The DeltapoxB mutant strain exhibited a moderate (20 to 25 %) decrease in acetate production when it was grown on glucose as the carbon source, and residual <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity that was between 20 and 85 % of the wild-type activity was observed with glucose limitation (0. 2 % glucose). In contrast, when the organism was grown on maltose, the poxB mutation resulted in a large (60 to 80 %) decrease in acetate production.

However, candidate genes for these enzymes were {{not found in the}} draft genome data of L. panis PM 1, with the exception of NADH oxidase. <b>Pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> has been documented in a few species of lactobacilli and is known to convert pyruvate to CO 2 and acetyl phosphate, along with the formation H 2 O 2 (Condon 1987). <b>Pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> has its highest activity during the early stationary phase of growth and is induced and repressed by oxygen and glucose, respectively, in L. plantarum (Saxena et al. 2009; Veiga-da-Cunha and Foster 1992). However, the presence of <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> does not adequately explain the early entry into stationary phase observed during the aerobic culture of L. panis PM 1. Our results showed that most of pyruvate produced during glucose consumption was used to produce lactate in aerobic culture (Figure 1 a), indicating that <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> apparently removed little pyruvate from this pathway. NADH oxidase is the most common enzyme responsible for the {{production of}} H 2 O 2 from oxygen and is highly-active in LAB (Condon 1987; Higuchi et al. 2000; Tachon et al. 2011). LAB are known to possess either a NADH: H 2 O 2 or a NADH: H 2 O oxidase, or sometimes both (Condon 1987; Higuchi et al. 2000). Final products of the reaction of NADH oxidase include either NAD+ and H 2 O 2, or NAD+ and H 2 O, depending on whether two- or four-electrons are transferred by NADH: H 2 O 2 oxidase or NADH: H 2 O oxidase (Condon 1987; Higuchi et al. 2000; Miyoshi et al. 2003). Our results showed that the crude extract from L. panis PM 1 cultured under aerobic and microaerobic conditions could directly produce H 2 O 2 using oxygen as a substrate, and the activity of the enzyme was found to increase with the addition of FAD+ as well as aeration of the assay mixture (approximately 1.5 fold). These results indicated that the NADH oxidase in L. panis PM 1 was a NADH: H 2 O 2 oxidase and a flavoprotein-like NADH oxidase, as seen in other gram-positive bacteria (Komagata 1996; Marty-Teysset et al. 2000; Tachon et al. 2011).|$|E

The continued rough morphology of these encapsulated strains was attributed to a second, since-forgotten, morphology-affecting mutation that was sustained by R 36 A during strain development. We used a new genome-PCR-based approach to identify spxB, the gene encoding <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> as the mutated locus in R 36 A and R 6 that, with unencapsulation, gives rise to rough colony morphology, as we know it. The variant spxB allele of R 36 A and R 6 is associated with increased cellular <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity relative to the ancestral strain D 39. Increased <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity alters colony shape by mediating cell death. R 36 A requires a wild-type spxB allele {{for the expression of}} smooth type 2 morphology but not for the expression of smooth type 3 morphology, the phenotype monitored by Avery et al. Thus, the mutated spxB allele did not impact their use of smooth morphology to identify the transforming principle...|$|E
40|$|The entire {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} poxB (<b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase)</b> gene of Escherichia coli K- 12 has been determined by the dideoxynucleotide (Sanger) sequencing of fragments of the gene cloned into a phage M 13 vector. The gene is 1716 nucleotides in length and has an open reading frame which encodes a protein of Mr 62, 018. This open reading frame was shown to encode <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> by alignment of the amino acid sequences deduced for the amino and carboxy termini and several internal segments of the mature protein with sequences obtained by amino acid sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the oxidase was not unusually rich in hydrophobic sequences despite the peripheral membrane location and lipid binding properties of the protein. The codon usage of the oxidase gene was typical of a moderately expressed protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shares homology with the large subunits of the acetohydroxy acid synthase isozymes I, II, and III, encoded by the ilvB, ilvG, and ilvI genes of E. coli...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> {{is a key}} {{function}} in the metabolism and lifestyle of many lactic acid bacteria and its activity depends {{on the presence of}} environmental oxygen. In Streptococcus pneumoniae the protein has been suggested {{to play a major role}} in metabolism and has been implicated in virulence, oxidative stress survival and death in stationary phase. Under semi-aerobic conditions, transcriptomic and metabolite profiling analysis of a spxB mutant grown on glucose showed minor changes compared to the wild type, apart from the significant induction of two operons involved in carbohydrate uptake and processing. This induction leads to a change in the sugar utilization capabilities of the bacterium, as indicated by the analysis of the growth profiles of the D 39 parent and spxB mutant on alternative carbohydrates. Metabolic analysis and growth experiments showed that inactivation of SpxB has no effect on the glucose fermentation pattern, except under aerobic conditions. More importantly, we show that mutation of spxB results in the production of increased amounts of capsule, the major virulence factor of S. pneumoniae. Part of this increase can be attributed to induction of capsule operon (cps) transcription. Therefore, we propose that S. pneumoniae utilizes <b>pyruvate</b> <b>oxidase</b> as an indirect sensor of the oxygenation of the environment, resulting in th...|$|E
