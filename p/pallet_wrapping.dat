40|$|High {{retention}} {{forces are}} the basic requirements on stretch films for agricultural or <b>pallet</b> <b>wrapping</b> of goods and significantly influenced by cling properties (autohesion) that are essential for a reliable load stability during transportation and storage. Low molecular weight polyisobutylene (PIB) has tacky properties and is immiscible with polyethylene. Blended with ethylene/-olefin copolymers in coextruded stretch films, PIB can migrate to the film surfaces and cause cling properties. Cling and adhesion forces were investigated using the mechanical cling test, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. The molecular weight of the PIB as well as density and crystallinity of the matrix material have strong influences on migration kinetics and therefore, on the cling forces. Cling forces increase with increasing aging time, having a maximum after 2 weeks of production. The following slight decrease of the cling force might be correlated with a beginning degradation process of the UV sensitive PIB. Polyisobutylene with higher molecular weight diffuses slower through a {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) matrix than lower molecular weight PIB, but can cause higher cling forces on the film surfaces...|$|E

40|$|The {{partially}} mummified {{remains of}} a high-status female (ca. 1700 BP, Thessaloniki, Greece) were found inside a Roman-type marble sarcophagus containing a lead coffin. The individual was positioned on a wooden <b>pallet,</b> <b>wrapped</b> in bandages, {{and covered with a}} gold-embroidered purple silk cloth. Besides the clothes, remnants of soft tissue as well as the individual's original hair style and eyebrows were exceptionally well preserved. In addition to the macroscopic examination, microscopic and biochemical analyses were undertaken. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were applied to examine the tissue preservation and probable mechanisms of mummification. The presence of chemical components, such as sesquiterpenes, triterpenoids, and diterpenoids, originating from coniferous and pistacia resins, myrrh, and other spices, verify ancient information on preparation methods of the dead in Greek and Roman times. These chemical components are thought to have played a prominent role in the mummification mechanism in this particular case. The potential effect of the lead coffin in the mummification process was also examined. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis failed to detect lead penetration into the tissues, suggesting that the coffin played a limited role in the preservation of soft tissue...|$|R

5000|$|Atlantis {{was founded}} in 1984 as a holding company, {{initially}} with interests in the insurance and furniture industries. From 1986 to 1994 it acquired various plastics industry holdings. In 1987 it was acquired by the equity firm Trivest, which soon spun Atlantis off as a public company but retained an ownership stake. Atlantis is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and has facilities in fifteen locations within ten U.S. states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas). [...] Atlantis has three business segments: Plastic Films for <b>wrapping</b> <b>pallets</b> of materials, Injection Molding for parts used in products such as appliances and recreational vehicles and Plastics Extrusion used in products such as residential siding. [...] The corporation earned $43.6 million in 2005 and $29.0 million in 2006, on sales of $424.3 and $418.7 million, respectively. The downturn was attributed to the slump in the housing sector.|$|R
40|$|Industrial parks, {{consisting}} of manufacturers and associated {{services such as}} transport and warehousing, have {{played an important role}} in stimulating the economic and industrial development. Enterprises are able to share common facilities, services and infrastructures. It becomes a common practice for manufacturers to use third-party logistics to handle the flow of materials both within and outside the industrial park. This thesis proposed an Auto-ID enabled real-time decision support solution for fleet management in industrial parks. This research investigates a fleet management decision framework that is suitable for industrial parks, and discusses the design and development of Fleet Advanced Planning and Scheduling (FAPS) Shell Platform, which is an innovative framework for different stakeholders in collaborating decisions and operations in industrial parks. The proposed FAPS Shell Platform integrates Auto-ID and telecommunication devices, which are deployed in an operation environment to collect real-time information. Within the service platform, an Agent-based Information Service (AIS) is proposed and developed for managing heterogeneous data sources. The AIS accesses and integrates information from different data sources for supporting upper-level decisions. Finally, a hierarchical transportation planning and scheduling model is proposed for minimizing the use of vehicles in a flexible and practical manner. This research has made the following achievements and contributions. Firstly, the scalable and re-configurable FAPS Shell Platform infrastructure provides a common communication channel for industrial stakeholders in transportation decisions and operations collaboratively. The development of the platform is based on several core technologies to achieve seamless dual-way connectivity and interoperability among enterprise information systems (EISs), Auto-ID devices and other heterogeneous data sources. Secondly, an innovative heterogeneous data sources querying mechanism is designed to access different kinds of data sources, such as web services, databases, Auto-ID devices and EISs. In addition, the AIS provides a platform for users managing their different data sources with several visualization tools. With the use of AIS, comprehensive and real-time information can be gathered easily and those information are able to support upper-level decisions. Thirdly, an Auto-ID enabled operation environment solution is designed and deployed in the industrial park. Items and <b>pallets</b> are <b>wrapped</b> as a smart object (SO) and different types of device gateways are deployed in key value adding points. With the supporting of SOs and devices gateways, real-time operation data can be feedback to the backend server for monitoring and controlling purposes. Finally, a hierarchical transportation planning and scheduling model is proposed for synchronizing material flow between supply hubs and manufacturers. The model can improve the flexibility of the planning and scheduling results. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{disposable packaging}} and returnable packaging with the methods life cycle analysis and life cycle costs analysis. These two different packaging are analyzed through the company Clas Ohlson’s packaging-flow. To {{get a picture}} of how the flow works, a visit at the company and email contact have been done with Clas Ohlson to get relevant information Today Clas Ohlson has a big flow of articles to the stores without larger variations in the demand, with the exception of autumn, which is when customers start shopping for Christmas. Clas Ohlson’s articles are placed on a <b>pallet</b> and are <b>wrapped</b> into plastic-film for protection {{and to make sure that}} nothing will be stolen. In this report Plastic-film is compared to the company Nycopac AB’s product Nyco Sleeve. In Sweden Posten takes care of Clas Ohlson’s transports and is the company’s third party-logistics provider. Nyco Sleeve is a type of pallet box, which is placed on a pallet with the possibility to place three units upon each other. The pallet box is possible to fold, which makes it doable to place pallet boxes upon each other in reverse transportation. Our Life cycle costs analysis shows that Nyco Sleeve is profitable compared to continue using plastic-film as secondary packaging. Nyco Sleeve demands a larger investment, almost seven times larger than the price for plastic-film but the expenses will be recovered relatively fast because of decreasing transportation costs. Posten’s pricing depends on each pallet place that is used which means that Nyco Sleeve’s higher weight does not affect the price. The total costs decreases because Nyco Sleeve increases the fill ratio on each pallet place, which results that less pallet places need to be used in the transport. If Nyco Sleeve is used the total pallet places decrease from about 116 000 to about 93 000 pallets considering 2012 s flow. Due to decreasing costs each year, the pay-off-method shows that the investment reaches break even in about 0. 7 years The life cycle analysis that examines the environmental impact of the packaging shows the same trend as the life cycle cost analysis, it is the transport that has the decisive influence on the environment. Important to note is that the transportations from Clas Ohlson’s warehouse to stores and the reverse transports stand for the largest carbon dioxide emissions and not the transportations from production or to waste disposal. The production phase’s emission is also important especially for Nyco Sleeve, which causes large amounts of emission compared to the plastic film. Decreasing transportations and that it is possible to reuse Nyco Sleeve even out the differences between the two packaging types when it comes to emission in production. The life cycle analysis’ scenario analysis shows that Nyco Sleeve environmental impact reaches break even after about two years compared to break even for the economic costs in 0. 7 years. If only one loop is investigated the calculations show that Nyco Sleeve has larger environmental impact then plastic film but over time and when several loops are considered Nyco Sleeves carbon dioxide emission is economized.  Rapporten analyserar engångs- och returemballage genom de två analysmetoderna, livscykelkostnads- och livscykelanalys. Emballagen analyseras utifrån företaget Clas Ohlsons emballageflöde där studiebesök gjorts för att se hur flödet fungerar.

Clas Ohlson har idag ett stort och jämnt flöde av produkter till deras butiker med säsongstoppar på hösten inför julhandeln. Deras produkter paketeras idag på lastpallar som sedan sveps in i plastfilm för att skydda och säkerställa att ingen stöld har skett.

Livscykelkostnadsanalysen visar att Nyco Sleeve är en ekonomisk lönsam investering i relation till att behålla plastfilmen som sekundärförpackning. Kostnaden att investera i Nyco Sleeve är ca sju gånger högre i jämförelse med inköpskostnaden för plastfilmen, men investeringen blir lönsam relativt snabbt eftersom Nyco Sleeve sänker transportkostnaderna. Posten tar idag betalt per pallplats och därmed gör inte tyngden på en Nyco Sleeve någon påverkan på den ekonomiska kostnaden. Kostnaden minskar genom användning av Nyco Sleeve eftersom fyllnadsgraden ökar och därmed minskar antalet levererade pallplatser. Skulle Nyco Sleeve användas minskas antalet från 116 100 stycken till ca 93 000 pallplatser utifrån Clas Ohlsons flöde under 2012. Genom den stora transportbesparingen per år visar pay-off-metoden att investeringen når break-even efter omkring 0, 7 år. Livscykelanalysen som undersöker emballagens koldioxidutsläpp visar på samma tendens som livscykelkostnadsanalysen, att det är transporten som är den stora miljöboven.
