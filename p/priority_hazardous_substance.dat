30|$|Mercury is {{released}} into the environment during production processes (e.g. chlor-alkali, battery manufacturing, and others) and during the use and removal of products via waste. Mercury is {{regarded as one of}} the most harmful metals found in the environment. Therefore, it is classified by the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) as a <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance.</b> This means that by 2015, no more mercury can be discharged. Flanders defines a maximum discharge limit between 0 and 150 ppb for mercury, depending on the industry, and the quality standard in Flanders is 1 ppb Hg for surface water and ground water. Consequently, removal of mercury from water and wastewater is required.|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a natural}} and {{widespread}} trace metal occurring in the environment but, at high concentrations in environment, it is considered as a <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance</b> because it damages {{the central nervous system}} in severely exposed humans. The case of Hg is quite particular because its bioamplification is different for its different chemical forms. Monoethylmercury (methylmercury) is more easily biomagnified and bioconcentrated than inorganic Hg. The consumption of Hgcontaminated fish is the most common exposure pathway of methylmercury for humans. In aquatic systems, Hg methylation occurs mainly in sediments. Mercury methylation depends on many parameters such as concentrations of sulphide, iron, mercury, organic matter, and, in natural environments, seems {{to be the result of}} sulphate- and iron-reducing bacteria activities (SRB and IRB, respectively). The studies performed to explain methylation investigating only one strain and/or bacteria group revealed that some microorganismgroups were able to methylate Hg as a detoxification process. In general, the studies were based on the cultures, isolation and identification of the strains. Other studies added obligate compounds for one selected metabolic pathway and then the Hg transformation was measured. Finally, added obligate compounds were measured for one selected metabolic pathway (i. e molybdate to inhibit sulphate-reduction) and the bacteria involved in methylation were determined...|$|E
30|$|These three {{directives}} {{are highly}} interconnected. Directive 2013 / 39 /EC {{is a direct}} amendment of the WFD, with direct implications for the chances of achieving the “good chemical status” of surface waters. For each <b>Priority</b> <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Substance</b> newly defined by the directive, EQS values, i.e., effect-based numerical quality criteria for assessing the status of an aquatic system, need to be derived and enforced. The implications of including PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBS {{in the list of}} Priority Hazardous Substances may have wide consequences of our ability to reach the “good chemical status” in many European catchment areas. “Directive 2013 / 39 /EC—policy and science for biota-EQS of DLCs” section summarizes the current legal situation and novel approaches in the context of Directive 2013 / 39 /EC. Furthermore, it has been stated that it is imperative to closely coordinate measures in context of the Floods Directive, the MSFD and the WFD to be able to reach the individual goals of each of the legislations [100, 101]. One particularly illustrative example may be the managed realignment of dikes as a measure to (1) increase the storage capacity of floodwater, which (2) reduces the bed shear stress and the risk of erosion of contaminated sediments {{while at the same time}} (3) increasing the structural diversity of the river ecosystem. “Directive 2007 / 60 /EC—policy and science with special reference to dioxin-like compounds and flood risks” section illustrates the implications of Directive 2007 / 60 /EC in policy and science with a special reference to dioxin-like compounds in context of flood events. Last, sediments and suspended particles can be thought of as a transport vector for lipophilic pollutants and thus represent a direct link between WFD and MSFD, since marine systems are the ultimate recipients of the SPM loads of our rivers; this aspect is particularly important in Elbe river basin as discussed in “Marine strategy framework directive 2008 / 56 /EC—sediments and pollutants” section (e.g., [183]).|$|E

40|$|It is {{now more}} than ten years ago that the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted by the European Parliament. The main {{objectives}} of the WFD are (i) to achieve good ecological and chemical status for inland surface waters, transitional waters and coastal waters in EU Member States, (ii) to assess the ecological and chemical status of these water bodies by means of monitoring programmes, and (iii) to implement programmes of measures to reduce environmental stress to an acceptable level. By adopting the WFD a fundamental change in management objective was introduced in the European Union, from merely pollution control to ensuring ecosystem integrity as a whole [1]. The ecological status of WFD water bodies is assessed by monitoring of biological quality elements (e. g. fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms, phytoplankton), general chemical and physico-chemical quality elements (e. g. pH, alkalinity, nutrients) and hydromorphological quality elements. These quality elements monitored in water bodies are compared with the status of more or less pristine reference ecosystems. If in WFD water bodies the ecological status deviates too much from the reference condition action is needed for achieving the acceptable ecological status. The chemical status of water bodies is assessed by comparing chemical monitoring data with Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances</b> and other relevant <b>substances.</b> Currently, 41 <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances</b> are listed in the European Union, but a regular update of this list with emerging substances is anticipated. If in water bodies exposure concentrations of {{one or more of these}} <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances</b> are not in compliance with the officially published EQS’s for these pollutants a good chemical status is not reached and action is needed to improve this. In contrast to the EU-level <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances</b> the other relevant substances are river basin or Member State specific. These other relevant substances have been selected because they are believed to potentially impair the ecological status of specific WFD water bodies and/or related human health aspects. The methodology to derive the EQS’s for other relevant substances is similar to that of the <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances.</b> This methodology is described in the new Technical Guidance Document for deriving Environmental Quality Standards (will be officially released in 2011). In European river basins the <b>priority</b> (<b>hazardous)</b> <b>substances</b> and river specific pollutants have to be measured on a regular basis. Under the umbrella of the WFD, EQS derivation is primarily based on a single substance toxicity assessment approach. In exceptional cases EQS’s for mixtures may be derived when their qualitative and quantitative composition is well-defined and/or well described (e. g. biocide preparations, PCB’s, dioxins). The concentration addition (CA) concept is used as a default when setting EQS’s for mixtures. Although compliance with good chemical status is primarily based on EQS’s for individual substances, cumulative stress (including mixtures) of toxicants may be identified as a main pressure affecting ecological status. In that case the cumulative risks caused by pollutants have to be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Cadmium is a <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance,</b> {{persistent}} in {{the aquatic}} environment, {{with the capacity}} to interfere with crustacean moulting. Moulting is a vital process dictating crustacean growth, reproduction and metamorphosis. However, for many organisms, moult disruption is difficult to evaluate in the short term, what limits its inclusion in monitoring programmes. N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAGase) is an enzyme acting in the final steps of the endocrine-regulated moulting cascade, allowing for the cast off of the old exoskeleton, with potential interest as a biomarker of moult disruption. This study investigated responses to waterborne cadmium of NAGase activity of Carcinus maenas originating from estuaries with different histories of anthropogenic contamination: a low impacted and a moderately polluted one. Crabs from both sites were individually exposed for seven days to cadmium concentrations ranging from 1. 3 to 2000 μg/L. At {{the end of the}} assays, NAGase activity was assessed in the epidermis and digestive gland. Detoxification, antioxidant, energy production, and oxidative stress biomarkers implicated in cadmium metabolism and tolerance were also assessed to better understand differential NAGase responses: activity of glutathione S-transferases (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) glutathione reductase (GR), levels of total glutathiones (TG), lipid peroxidation (LPO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Animals from the moderately polluted estuary had lower NAGase activity both in the epidermis and digestive gland than in the low impacted site. NAGase activity in the epidermis and digestive gland of C. maenas from both estuaries was sensitive to cadmium exposure suggesting its usefulness for inclusion in monitoring programmes. However, in the digestive gland NAGase inhibition was found in crabs from the less impacted site but not in those from the moderately contaminated one. Altered glutathione levels were observed in cadmium-treated crabs from the contaminated site possibly conferring enhanced tolerance to these animals through its chelator action. Investigation of enhanced tolerance should thus be accounted for in monitoring programmes employing NAGase as biomarker to avoid data misinterpretation...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) {{is a new}} instrument, that {{inter alia}} has replaced, {{harmonized}} and further developed the control and reduction of point and diffuse discharges of dangerous substances according to Council Directive 76 / 464 /EEC. Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive set out a 'Strategy against pollution of water' which demands specific measures against pollution of water by individual pollutants or groups of pollutants presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment (e. g. by drinking water consumed). For these priority substances community-wide water quality standards and emission controls have to be established. On the basis of Article 16 of Directive 2000 / 60 /EC a list of 33 priority substances has been adopted by {{the decision of the}} European Parliament and of the Council of November 2001. This list identifies 11 priority hazardous substances, 14 substances subject to a review for identification as possible <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substance</b> and 8 priority substances. The Commission will make a proposal for the final classification of the 'substances subject to a review' (priority hazardous or priority substances) not later than 12 months after adoption of this list. The planned measures aim at the cessation or phasing out of discharges, emissions and losses to the aquatic environment within 20 years for the priority hazardous substances and at the progressive reduction for the priority substances. In this project the available data for these 33 substances resp. groups of substances for the Federal Republic of Germany were put forward and described in a standardized pattern. This pattern includes the following items: nomenclature and properties of the substances, monitoring data, production and fields of application of these substances, existing regulations in Germany, releases to environment and possibilities to reduce discharges to the aquatic environment.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD), Directive 2000 / 60 /EC, was {{introduced}} in 2000 {{with the aim of}} member countries attaining ‘good status’ in water bodies that are below good status at present, as well as retaining good or better status where it already exists by 2015. According to WFD [1] 41 priority substances and a further 25 <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> were identified to be included in water monitoring programmes. These substances can be divided into four main groups: pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metals and trace elements. A standardised, reliable and efficient method, incorporating both sample preconcentration and analysis steps, is required to facilitate these monitoring programmes.

30|$|Using {{the example}} of the {{specific}} toxicological endpoint genotoxicity the potential of bio-analytical instruments as tools in effect-directed analysis is demonstrated. Genotoxic potentials of sediments from different river basins such as the Rhine, Elbe, Danube and Oder were analyzed with the Ames-fluctuation test in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In sediment pore waters of the investigated rivers a low mutagenic potential could be measured occasionally when standard test strains were used. However, the fractionation of sediment extracts showed that particle bound genotoxic substances are detectable especially in the medium polar fractions. PAH, including several that are listed as <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> compounds in Annex X of the EU WFD, contribute significantly to the mutagenic potential. Nevertheless, many compounds that were previously not defined as <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> play an important role. As an example Dibenzopyrene isomers were identified, some of which have a high genotoxic (and carcinogenic) potential. The extention of the test battery to metabolically competent test strains which express enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism pathways, broadened significantly the range of detectable genotoxins in direction of medium polar to polar compounds. These test strains also showed mutagenicity in pore waters of fresh sediments. In a contaminated site in the Elbe catchment area, many heterocyclic and N-substituted compounds were detected, possibly determining the high mutagenic potential of the site.|$|R

Prioritisation is, therefore, a central operational concept in the management of polluting chemicals in the water environment in line with the WFD. Several different approaches for prioritisation are available, with different combinations of methods for risk assessment and ranking [11]. Risk assessment and prioritisation in the WFD currently are a site-specific- and retrospective approach and are, thus, based on concentrations of chemicals already present in the environment. For future development of the WFD, {{there is a need to}} develop more comprehensive methods to evaluate hazards and risks of chemicals and their mixtures as well as options to reduce and manage these risks.|$|R

Toxicity tests proved strong enantiomer-specific toxicity in the case of Tetrahymena thermophila, protozoa that are utilized during activated sludge treatment ((R) -FL is 30 × more toxic than (S) -FL; (S) -NFL is 10 × more toxic than (S) -FL). This is of paramount importance as preferential degradation of (S) -FL in activated sludge microcosms leads to the enrichment of FL with 30 × more toxic (R) -FL and formation of 10 × more toxic (S) -NFL. It is commonly assumed that a decreased concentration of FL leads to decreased biological impact. Our study proves that despite the overall decrease in FL concentration, accumulation of toxic (R) -FL and formation of toxic (S) -NFL leads to much higher than presumed toxicological effects...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute {{a large group}} of organic compounds that make constant threat to the environment. Their contents from natural sources are low. The processes of incomplete organic fuel combustion are the main sources of PAHs. In Upper Silesia (Poland), large amounts of PAHs are emitted into the air as a result of coal combustion in home furnaces and liquid fuel burning in combustion engines (low emission). PAHs get into surface water because of the surface runoff and point source wastewater discharges from certain industries. The following study presents PAHs concentrations in raw municipal wastewater. The tests were performed out of the heating season. The samples were collected from the combined sewer system. The analyses of PAHs were carried out with gas chromatography coupled with a mass detector (GC-MS). The concentrations of 16 PAHs sum (EPA list) ranged between 1. 025 and 3. 056 μg/L. Phenanthrene dominated in nearly all the analysed samples. The contents of PAHs, which are <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> according to the directive, were high in the analysed samples. The obtained results and the analysis of diagnostic ratios for the emissions of PAHs into the air helped to reach the conclusion that traffic emissions were the main source of PAHs in the examined wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} ScorePP {{project is}} to develop {{comprehensive}} and appropriate source control strategies that authorities, cities, water utilities and the chemical industry can employ to reduce emissions of priority pollutants (PPs) from urban areas into the receiving water environment. Focus is on the 33 <b>priority</b> and <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> and substance groups identified in the European Water Framework Directive. However, this list may be expanded to include emerging pollutants or reduced if appropriate model compounds can be identified. The initial work focuses on 67 substances, including substances identified in the proposed European environmental quality standard (EQS) directive {{as well as the}} defined example compounds and several organometallic derivatives. Information on inherent properties, environmental presence and fate, and legislative issues is made available in open database format, and a data management system combining chemical identification (CAS#), NACE economic activity classifications and NOSE-P emission source classifications has been developed as a basis for spatial characterisation of PP sources using GIS. Further work will focus on dynamic urban scale source-flux models, identifying emission patterns and optimising monitoring programmes in case studies and multi-criteria comparison of source control versus end-of-pipe mitigation options in relation to their economic, social and environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|The Water Framework Directive {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pieces of European environmental legislation in recent years, requiring all inland and coastal waters to achieve good status by 2015. Article 16 of the Directive describes how and by when Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for pollutants should be developed, and states that pollutants presenting a significant risk to or via water should be identified by the European Commission and classified as priority substances, with the most hazardous of these classified as <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances.</b> Generation of ecotoxicity test data is one option for filling gaps when deriving EQS but there are also options that avoid testing, such as the use of (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationships ([Q]SARs), Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPRs), Activity-Activity Relationships (AARs), Quantitative Structure Activity-Activity Relationships, or read-across from similar substances. All of these non-testing methods are based on the idea that properties (including biological activities) of a chemical substance depend on its intrinsic nature and can be directly predicted from its molecular structure and inferred from the properties of similar compounds whose activities are known. This report explores application of the widely used and freely available EPIWIN suite of QSARs, particularly the ecotoxicity software ECOSAR, for derivation of EQS under the WFD. The predictive ability of these QSARs is examined using the 33 priority substances in the Water Framework Directive Daughter Directive on Priority Substances, plus the additional substances recommended for inclusion by the European Parliament, as representative substances for EQS derivation. We also investigated use of the OECD QSAR Application Toolbox version 1 for read across of data. We address the following questions: 1. 	How effective are the QSARs in EPIWIN at identifying the selected substances as Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) or very Persistent and very Bioaccumulative (vPvB) ? These substances would potentially be classifiable as <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> and would also require consideration of sediment toxicity and secondary poisoning through the food chain. 2. 	How accurate and precise is ECOSAR at estimating acute and chronic toxicity for fish, invertebrates and algae for these substances? 3. 	How similar are EQS for these substances based on measured data and ECOSAR estimates? 4. 	To what extent is the most sensitive trophic group accurately predicted by ECOSAR for acute or chronic exposure? 5. 	Can a formal approach for defining similarity for read-across help to group substances in a defensible way that increases the amount of data available overall for EQS derivation? The following conclusions and recommendations apply generally on the assumption that the substances analysed in this report are representative of the types of substances for which EQS may also need to be set in the future.

40|$|Mercury and cadmium are {{considered}} by the water framework directive <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances.</b> In this work, the capacity of crab carapace and clam shell wastes to remove mercury and cadmium from water was evaluated under batch conditions, for realistic contamination scenarios in monometallic and binary solutions. The results evidenced that in monometallic solutions and under studied operational conditions, both biosorbents can achieve Hg 2 + removal efficiencies higher than 80 % and the kinetic process is well described {{by two of the}} most widely used equations, the pseudo-second order and the Elovich model. In terms of biosorption equilibrium, crab carapace and clam shell wastes displayed very distinct behaviours. While clam shells achieve the complete monolayer coverage and the isotherm is well described by the Langmuir model, crab carapace powder display a more unusual behaviour, that is well described by the BET isotherm, and is characterized by an almost convex shape to the concentration axis, with an infinite slope for an Hg 2 + concentration in solution around 25 mu g/L. In binary solutions, both wastes are able to uptake simultaneously Hg 2 + and Cd 2 +, however the uptake of Hg 2 + was inhibited in some extent, attributed to the high kinetic and equilibrium selectivities of the bio-wastes for cadmium.

40|$|Nonylphenols {{are very}} {{important}} environmentally relevant substances in {{the focus of the}} world-wide endocrine disrupter research for over 25 years. Thus, they are among the 10 <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> of the new European Union Water Framework Directive. They consist of a very complex mixture of isomers representing therefore a multi-component problem like dioxins or PCBs. As estrogenic effect and degradation behavior in the environment of individual 4 -nonylphenols are heavily dependent on the structure and bulkiness of the side chain, it is absolutely necessary to consider the nonylphenol problem from an isomer-specific viewpoint. Therefore a range of 28 differently branched nonylphenol isomers were synthesized for biological and environmental studies. Nonylphenols with a quaternary alpha-carbon, like 4 -(1, 1, 3, 4 -tetramethylpentyl) phenol (4 -NP(95)) and 4 -(1 -ethyl- 1, 3, 3 -trimethylbutyl) phenol (4 -NP(170)), were obtained by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of anisole with tertiary nonyl bromides and demethylation with BI(3). Nonylphenols with a tertiary alpha-carbon, such as 4 -(1, 2 -dimethylheptyl) phenol (4 -NP(10)) and 4 -(1, 2, 4 -trimethylhexyl) phenol (4 -NP(41)), were accessible via coupling of p-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide with ketones. Nonylphenols bearing a quaternary beta-carbon, like 4 -(2, 2 -dimethylheptyl) phenol (4 -NP(15)) and 4 -(1, 2, 2 -trimethylhexyl) phenol (4 -NP(39)), were synthesized starting from 4 '-methoxyisobutyrophenone. The compounds were characterized by GC-MS and NMR-spectroscopy. The individual isomers were designated according to the Juelich Nomenclature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnder the German {{environmental}} {{specimen bank}} programme bream (Abramis brama) were sampled in six German rivers and analysed for the <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> dicofol, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD), heptachlor + heptachlor epoxide (HC + HCE), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCDD/Fs + dl-PCBs), and {{perfluorooctane sulfonic acid}} (PFOS). The aim was to assess compliance with the EU Water Framework Directive environmental quality standards for biota (EQSBiota) for the year 2013, and to analyse temporal trends for those substances that are of special concern. General compliance was observed for dicofol, HBCDD and HCBD whereas PBDEs exceeded the EQSBiota at all sites. For all other substances compliance in 2013 varied between locations. No assessment was possible for HC + HCE at some sites where the analytical sensitivity was not sufficient to cover the EQSBiota. Trend analysis showed decreasing linear trends for HCB and PFOS at most sampling sites between 1995 and 2014 indicating that the emission reduction measures are effective. Mostly decreasing trends or constant levels were also observed for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. In contrast, increasing trends were detected for PBDEs and HBCDD which were especially pronounced at one Saar site located downstream of the industries and conurbation of Saarbrücken and Völklingen. This finding points to new sources of emissions which should be followed in the coming years...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} results of {{different}} monitoring programs regarding spatial and temporal trends of <b>priority</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Fish monitoring data for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), mercury (Hg), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sampled in German freshwaters between the mid- 1990 s and 2014 were evaluated according to {{the recommendations of the}} 2014 adopted WFD guidance document on biota monitoring, i. e., normalization to 5 % lipid content (HCB) or 26 % dry mass (Hg, PFOS) and adjustment to trophic level (TL) 4. Data of the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) (annual pooled samples of bream) were compared to monitoring data of the German federal states (FS), which refer to individual fish of different species. Significant decreasing trends (p < 0. 01) were detected for Hg in bream (Abramis brama) sampled by both, the ESB and the FS between 1993 and 2013 but not for FS samples comprising different fish species. Data for HCB and PFOS were more heterogeneous due to a smaller database and gave no consistent results. Obviously, normalization could not compensate differences in sampling strategies. The results suggest that the data treatment procedure proposed in the guidance document has shortcomings and emphasize the importance of highly standardized sampling programs in trend monitoring or whenever results between sites have to be compared...|$|R
