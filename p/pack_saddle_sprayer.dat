50|$|The modern <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> {{is usually}} not {{intended}} to support a human rider. The upper side of the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> resembles a rack to let its load rest on and be tied on with ropes, straps, a surcingle or other devices. One historical exception was a <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> used in feudal Japan by non-samurai class commoners who {{were not allowed to}} use riding saddles (kura) for transportation.|$|R

They include Deerwood, <b>Pack</b> <b>Saddle</b> Prairie, Blackhawk Estates, <b>Pack</b> <b>Saddle</b> Farms, Seven Winds, and <b>Pack</b> <b>Saddle</b> Meadows.|$|R

Pack horses (ni-uma or konida-uma) carried a variety of merchandise and the baggage of travelers using a <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> that ranged from a basic wooden frame to the elaborate <b>pack</b> <b>saddles</b> used for the semi-annual processions (sankin kotai) of Daimyo.

Pack horses also carried the equipment and food for samurai warriors during military campaigns. With the end of the samurai era and beginning of the Meiji period (1868-1912), non-samurai were allowed to openly ride horses and eventually the Japanese adopted saddles of styles seen in the occidental world. Saddles used by Japanese officers during the Russo-Japanese war (1904-1905) are described as being based on civilian English saddles.|$|R
50|$|Ideally the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> {{rests on}} a saddle blanket or saddle pad to spread {{the weight of the}} saddle and its burden on the pack animal's back. The {{underside}} of the <b>pack</b> <b>saddle</b> is designed to conform well to the shape of the pack animal's back. It is typically divided into two symmetrical parts separated by a gap at the top to ensure that the weight being carried does not rest on the draft animal's backbone and to provide good ventilation to promote the evaporation of sweat.|$|R
