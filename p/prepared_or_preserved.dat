40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trade performance for thirteen commodities in {{the fruit and}} vegetable industry in relation to that of selected ASEAN countries (Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand), based on Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) indicator. The analysis shows that Singapore has comparative advantage in 5 commodities (ground-nuts, hazelnuts, plums, apricots and walnuts), Philippines has comparative advantage in 3 commodities (tomatoes nes <b>prepared</b> <b>or</b> <b>preserved,</b> tomatoes whole or in peaces and cherries), Thailand and Malaysia has comparative advantage in 2 commodities (citrus fruits, fruit and vegetable juice, and tomatoes and apple juice, respectively) while Indonesia has comparative advantage in 1 commodity (cashew nuts). Malaysia has comparative advantage only in tomatoes and apple juice but comparative disadvantage in other commodities such as cashew nuts, walnuts and fruit and vegetable juice. The RCA index for apple juice in Malaysia is increasing over the years 2000 to 2006 indicating improvement in comparative advantage. However, the comparative advantage of tomatoes is constant. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{intended}} to assist people making a submission to the Productivity Commission 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry into the import of processed fruit products. About the inquiry On 21 June 2013, the Australian Government asked the Commission to inquire into whether safeguard action under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules is justified against imports of selected processed fruit products falling within subheading 2008 of the Australian Customs Tariff. The subheading is defined as: Fruit, nuts and other edible parts of plants, otherwise <b>prepared</b> <b>or</b> <b>preserved,</b> {{whether or not containing}} added sugar or other sweetening matter or spirit, not elsewhere specified or included. As specified in the terms of reference, the inquiry covers products under the following tariff classifications: 	 2008. 30. 00 (citrus) 	 2008. 40. 00 (pears) 	 2008. 50. 00 (apricots) 	 2008. 70. 00 (peaches) 	 2008. 97. 00 (mixtures) 	 2008. 99. 00 (other). The terms of reference are reprinted {{at the beginning of this}} report. Safeguard action is temporary, ‘emergency action’ (using tariffs, tariff-quotas or quotas) implemented in situations where a surge of imports causes or threatens to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. Safeguard measures may be applied for up to four years, and may be extended for a further four years, subject to several conditions. The Commission is to provide a report to the Australian Government by 20 December 2013 on whether safeguard measures are justified. In addition, the Commission is to provide an ‘accelerated report’ by 20 September 2013, as to whether provisional safeguard measures should be put in place...|$|E

40|$|Trade with Latin American {{countries}} is {{an increasingly important}} issue, as negotiations progress for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze U. S. agricultural trade with Latin American countries, determine factors influencing agricultural trade with these countries, and estimate possible effects of trade liberalization under the FTAA on U. S. agricultural trade. This study analyzes U. S. exports of wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, soybean meal, beef, pork, and poultry meat to 16 Latin American countries; U. S. imports of bananas, coffee, grapes, fruit and vegetable juice, sugar, pineapples, avocados, mangos, <b>prepared</b> <b>or</b> <b>preserved</b> meat, crustaceans, and fish fillets or meat from these countries are also analyzed. An econometric model is developed and estimated to determine factors influencing U. S. agricultural trade with these countries. Results from the model show that there is a negative relationship between U. S. exports and foreign tariffs, price, exchange rates, and foreign production, while there is a positive relationship between U. S. exports and foreign real GDP. U. S. imports have a negative relationship with U. S. tariffs and price and a positive relationship with the exchange rate. U. S. tariffs on imports of agricultural products from Latin American countries, though, are small or nonexistent in many cases. This would suggest that trade liberalization could have a larger effect on U. S. exports than on imports. Trade creation and trade diversion effects of tariff removal under the FTAA are calculated. Trade creation effects, overall, are higher for U. S. exports to these countries than they are for U. S. imports. The trade diversion effects, especially for exports, are small because most agricultural imports in the hemisphere are from other countries within the hemisphere, indicating that the FTAA will not significantly affect trade of the agricultural commodities under analysis with third-party, non-member countries. The United States could significantly increase exports of meat products, corn, and rice, and imports of fruit juice and grapes, under the FTAA.
