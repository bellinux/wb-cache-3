5000|$|TrueType {{was known}} during its {{development}} stage, {{first by the}} codename [...] "Bass" [...] and later on by the codename [...] "Royal". The system was developed and eventually released as TrueType with the launch of Mac System 7 in May 1991. The initial TrueType outline fonts, four-weight families of Times Roman, Helvetica, Courier, and the <b>Pi</b> <b>font</b> replicated the original PostScript fonts of the Apple LaserWriter. Apple also replaced some of their bitmap fonts used by the graphical user-interface of previous Macintosh System versions (including Geneva, Monaco and New York) with scalable TrueType outline-fonts. For compatibility with older systems, Apple shipped these fonts, a TrueType Extension and a TrueType-aware version of Font/DA Mover for System Software 6. For compatibility with the Laserwriter II, Apple developed fonts like ITC Bookman and ITC Chancery in TrueType format.|$|E
40|$|January 1 st {{came and}} went, and we survived the {{introduction}} of the Euro, the planet’s ugliest-named currency. I can now write cheques in �, do electronic transactions, and even lodge credits, should anyone be generous enough to send me money. As aLATEX user, I have discovered the € command in the textcomp package (which I should have mentioned last time, but mea culpa, I am a recent convert to LATEX and am still finding stuff squirrelled away that I didn’t know about). And, I’m pleased to say, LATEX’s is a much more suitable design to go with those serif fonts which have none of their own than the strange C-like designs put out by Microsoft in their TrueType replacement fonts (designed by and licensed from Monotype, of all people!). But € uses PostScript fonts (the T 1 encoding) and while that’s fine by me, it’s not for everyone. Full marks, therefore to Henrik Theiling for his eurosym package, which implements the original EU (sans-serif) design in roman, bold, italic, and outline using METAFONT, so it’s usable in TEX-based systems anywhere. No seriffed version yet, but the following table shows some of the glyphs available. n=sc sl=it ol m � � � bx � � � Adobe also has the Euro in PostScript fonts available for download, including sans and serif versions (with serifs top and bottom, too!), and there’s already a Euro in the china 2 e package (a METAFONT font). Bitstream sells a standalone <b>pi</b> <b>font</b> with the Euro symbol, and will customize your existing fonts for you (for a charge). Linotype sells nearly 200 Euro symbols for DM 100 but makes the same mistake as Monotype in pretending the E is a C in the serif versions. The EU has laid down that the official design is to be used regardless of the surrounding font (in both style and colour, se...|$|E
5000|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} differently-sized master character images (as implemented in Monotype’s Monophoto system, for instance), proportional scaling was implemented: the larger the type size specified, the tighter the spacing (an automatic feature). (For <b>pi</b> <b>fonts</b> and connecting scripts this was over-ridden by implementing a font number beginning with the figure 5, cancelling auto letterspacing.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} Unicode and the {{universal}} character set it provides allowed commonly used dingbats {{to be given}} their own character codes. Although fonts claiming Unicode coverage will contain glyphs for dingbats in addition to alphabetic characters, fonts that have dingbats in place of alphabetic characters continue to be popular, primarily for ease of input. Such fonts are also sometimes known as <b>pi</b> <b>fonts.</b>|$|R
