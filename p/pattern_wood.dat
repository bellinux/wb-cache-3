5000|$|Eichler {{homes are}} {{examples}} of Modernist architecture {{that has come to}} be known as [...] "California Modern", and typically feature glass walls, post-and-beam construction, and open floorplans in a style indebted to Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Eichler home exteriors featured flat and/or low-sloping A-framed roofs, vertical 2-inch <b>pattern</b> <b>wood</b> siding, and spartan facades with clean geometric lines. One of Eichler's signature concepts was to [...] "bring the outside in", achieved via skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows with glass transoms looking out on protected and private outdoor rooms, patios, atriums, gardens, and swimming pools. Also of note is that most Eichler homes feature few, if any, front-facing (i.e., street-facing) windows; instead house fronts have either small, ceiling-level windows or small, rectangular windows with frosted glass. Many other architectural designs have large windows on all front-facing rooms.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2008, the 126-year-old stone {{farm was}} {{dismantled}} rock by rock. The ground has been leveled {{to reconstruct the}} building and engineers will be consulted for depth of piles needed for support. 5 acre of land was acquired from the RM of Indian Head. The town of Indian Head will own the reconstructed site, picnic, and parking facilities. A sheet metal roof with 30 square air vents for light and ventilation, surrounds an 8 sided cupola in the center which was the upper extension of the silo and look out tower. [...] The original barn had a unique herringbone <b>pattern</b> <b>wood</b> frame on trusses extending from the center to the stone walls. [...] Reconstruction of the barn alone is estimated at $1 million. [...] An 1883 Bell Farm cottage has been preserved at the Indian Head museum. [...] The provincial and federal governments won't commit to designating the barn with heritage status as it won't be re-constructed on its precise original site. [...] The original site of the Bell Farm will be preserved with the lower one foot of the original building for archaeological findings.

40|$|The {{emotional}} and psychological activities {{associated with the}} visual perception of macroscopic and microscopic structure <b>patterns</b> of <b>wood</b> were investigated. The macroscopic and microscopic structure patterns of 18 different timber tree species of northeast China were selected as the research objects, and these were divided into eight categories for event-related potential analysis. The 30 effective subjects’ tasks were to watch the <b>wood</b> structure stimuli <b>patterns</b> and evaluate them on a 7 -point bipolar scale. The {{results showed that the}} emotional valence of the <b>wood</b> structure stimuli <b>patterns</b> of the eight categories evoked P 2 and late positive potential (LPP) composition in a specific area of the brain. P 2 refers to an early perception analysis processing for visual perception of the <b>wood</b> stimuli <b>patterns,</b> while LPP refers to late processing and reflects evaluations when people face different <b>wood</b> stimuli <b>patterns.</b> The results also indicated that people prefer to connect the understanding of macroscopic and microscopic <b>patterns</b> of <b>wood</b> with their own mood. Evaluation processing for macroscopic and microscopic structure <b>patterns</b> of <b>wood</b> were based on visual perception analyses, which were judged by personal feelings and decisions. People made active emotional assessments of the macroscopic and microscopic structure <b>patterns</b> of <b>wood...</b>|$|R

The second story features two bedrooms, each with its own private balcony. Designed based on a seven-foot square grid, the house is visually anchored to a single mass of windowless concrete block forming the walls of the small basement and kitchen and extending beyond the roofline, obscuring various vents and the large skylight to the kitchen ("workspace") below. The house is constructed of cedar and painted cinder block and continues Wright's tradition of custom <b>patterned</b> <b>wood</b> cutout window lattice known as fretwork.|$|R

50|$|This second {{house was}} more imbued with {{integral}} ornament than the first. A simple, first floor bay {{window in the}} east elevation was exchanged for one with a Gothic motif. Each side featured paired lancet windows and a facing of intricately adorned terracotta. While half-timbering {{was limited to the}} peaks of three gables, the remaining surfaces were replaced by banding of terracotta and heavily carved, geometrically <b>patterned</b> <b>wood.</b> In these details, Wright not only drew inspiration from English Tudor, but also from Mayan architecture and the elaborate, organic style of Louis Sullivan. The result showed similarities to other Wright designs of the period, including Midway Gardens (1913), the Imperial Hotel (1915-23), the Hollyhock House (1917-1921), and the four textile block houses (1923). The stables and garden house, which both survived the fire and retained original detailing, serve as a comparison between the styles of the earlier and later designs.|$|R

Stratton, architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an asymmetrical façade; dominant front-facing gable, often cantilevered out beyond {{the plane of the}} wall below; overhanging eaves; round, square, or polygonal tower(s); shaped and Dutch gables; a porch covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; pedimented porches; differing wall textures, such as <b>patterned</b> <b>wood</b> shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, terra cotta tiles, relief panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; dentils; classical columns; spindle work; oriel and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted balustrades; and wooden or slate roofs.

40|$|Warning (aposematic) and cryptic colorations {{appear to}} be {{mutually}} incompat-ible because the primary function of the former is to increase detectability, whereas {{the function of the}} latter is to decrease it. Disruptive coloration is a type of crypsis in which the color pattern breaks up the outline of the prey, thus hindering its detection. This delusion can work even when the prey’s pat-tern elements are highly contrasting; thus, it is possible for an animal’s col-oration to combine both warning and disruptive functions. The coloration of the wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) is such that the moth is conspicu-ous when it rests on vegetation, but when it feigns death and drops to the grass- and litter-covered ground, it is hard to detect. This death-feigning behav-ior therefore immediately switches the function of its coloration from signaling to camouflage. We experimentally tested whether the forewing <b>patterning</b> of <b>wood</b> tiger moths could function as disruptive coloration against certain back-grounds. Using actual forewing <b>patterns</b> of <b>wood</b> tiger moths, we crafted artifi...|$|R
