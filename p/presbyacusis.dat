50|$|Presbycusis (also spelled <b>presbyacusis,</b> from Greek presbys “old” + akousis “hearing”), or age-related hearing loss, is the {{cumulative}} effect of aging on hearing. It is a progressive and irreversible bilateral symmetrical age-related sensorineural hearing loss resulting from degeneration of the cochlea or associated structures of the inner ear or auditory nerves. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging (nosocusis and sociocusis) is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of multiple causes of hearing loss can be difficult.|$|E
40|$|People with <b>presbyacusis</b> {{commonly}} report {{difficulties in}} conversation in everyday settings. Although {{previous research has}} focused on self-report inventories concerning conversation difficulties in age related hearing difficulties, {{there is a lack of}} published work describing the interactions between people with <b>presbyacusis</b> and their conversational partners. The aim of this study is to describe conversational interactions between people with <b>presbyacusis</b> and their main everyday conversational partner and to determine whether there is evidence of change in interaction before and after the fitting of hearing aids. Ten participants recruited from a larger cohort were included in this study, consisting of 5 participants with diagnosed <b>presbyacusis</b> and 5 frequent conversation partners. A battery of audiological assessments was completed for each participant with <b>presbyacusis.</b> Each participant with <b>presbyacusis</b> was videotaped in conversation at home with their main everyday conversational partner: once before hearing aid fitting and once two months following hearing aid fitting. The conversational interactions before and after hearing aid fitting were analysed using Conversation Analysis. The results of the study revealed that both the people with <b>presbyacusis</b> and the conversation partners used patterns of interaction in instances of mishearings in conversation. The person with <b>presbyacusis</b> shifted gaze direction to show a need for repair. In addition, the conversation partner used physical prompting to gain gaze directed attention from the person with <b>presbyacusis.</b> The person with <b>presbyacusis</b> also made verbal requests for a repair as a result of mishearings. These patterns in interaction showed co-ordination and timing of the repair recognition, initiation and completion by both parties. The phenomena uncovered in this study indicate that the responsibility to monitor and maintain conversation was increasingly placed on the conversation partner of the person with <b>presbyacusis.</b> This could explain why people with <b>presbyacusis</b> and their conversation partners frequently complain of frustration in conversation activities. In the postamplification conversations, no mishearings occurred, suggesting a trend towards fewer mishearings on conversation as a result of amplification of hearing. The research findings contribute to the evidence base concerning the real benefit of digital hearing aids to these elderly clients. The findings of this study can be used to design assessment and intervention tools in the future. Dissertation (M (Communication Pathology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Abstract- The {{acceptability}} of hearing aids {{in people with}} <b>presbyacusis</b> has been improved but assessment of {{whether there is a}} need for more counseling to increase the number of regular hearing-aid users seems to be important. The aim of this study was to determine if the hearing aid was worn regularly and over a long period of time in people with <b>presbyacusis.</b> A questionnaire survey of patients with <b>presbyacusis</b> who had been fitted with a monaural behind the ear hearing aid for the first time was undertaken. The patients were divided into four groups ranging from 6 months to 3 years after fitting. Overall regular long-term use of the hearing aid was found in the majority of patients with <b>presbyacusis.</b> The main dropout point was within the first year after fitting the hearing aid.

40|$|Age-related hearing loss, {{known as}} <b>presbyacusis,</b> is {{characterized}} by the progressive deterioration of auditory sensitivity associated with the aging process and {{is the leading cause of}} adult auditory deficiency in the USA. <b>Presbyacusis</b> is described as a progressive, bilateral, high-frequency hearing loss that is manifested on audiometric assessment by a moderately sloping pure tone audiogram. Approximately 23 % of the population between 65 and 75 years of age, and 40 % of the population older than 75 years of age are affected by this condition. It was estimated in 1980 that 11 % of the population was 76 years or older and this number is expected to almost double by the year 2030. When one considers that the population over 65 years of age is experiencing the most accelerated development of hearing loss, the potential socioeconomic ramifications are staggering. Curiously, the frequency of <b>presbyacusis</b> varies across different societies. This discrepancy has been attributed to many factors including genetics, diet, socioeconomic factors, and environmental variables.

40|$|Background: More {{than half}} of the elderly (65 - 84 years) in Sweden have {{problems}} with hearing. In some studies it’s discussed if age related hearing loss or <b>presbyacusis</b> is a part of natural aging or if it depends on underlying factors. The purpose of this literature study was to analyse scientific papers which have investigated correlations between less known underlying factors to <b>presbyacusis,</b> defined from psychoacoustic and/or neurofysiological tests.

40|$|Hearing {{thresholds}} in elderly humans {{without a}} history of noise exposure commonly show a profile of a flat loss at low frequencies coupled with a loss that increases with frequency above � 2 kHz. This profile and the relatively robust distortion product otoacoustic emissions that are found in elderly subjects challenge the common belief that age-related hearing loss (<b>presbyacusis)</b> is based primarily on sensory-cell disorders. Here, we examine a model of <b>presbyacusis</b> wherein the endocochlear potential (EP) is reduced by means of furosemide applied chronically to one cochlea of a young gerbil. The model results in an EP that is reduced from 90 to � 60 mV, a value often seen in quiet-aged gerbils, with no concomitant loss of hair cells.

40|$|<b>Presbyacusis</b> is {{one among}} the many socio-medical problems, which is {{considered}} as a hidden disability. The hearing impairment in elderly people is described as <b>presbyacusis.</b> Hearing problem among elderly people is a major issue and a person with hearing loss {{may be unable to}} hear doorbells and alarms, to respond while talking with anyone, etc. All this can make them feel frustrated, lonely, and depressed. It is the third most common chronic condition after arthritis and hypertensive diseases among elders. Hearing loss can be improved by using the hearing aids.

40|$|In the {{presented}} model, electrical, acoustical, {{and mechanical}} {{elements of the}} cochlea are explicitly integrated into a signal transmission line where these elements convey physiological interpretations of the human cochlear structures. As a result, this physiologically-motivated model enables simulation of specific cochlear lesions such as <b>presbyacusis.</b> The hypothesis is that high-frequency hearing loss in older adults {{may be due to}} metabolic <b>presbyacusis</b> whereby age-related cellular/chemical degenerations in the lateral wall of the cochlea cause a reduction in the endocochlear potential. The simulations quantitatively confirm this hypothesis and emphasize that even if the outer and inner hair cells are totally active and intact, metabolic <b>presbyacusis</b> alone can significantly deteriorate the cochlear functionality. Specifically, in the model, as the endocochlear potential decreases, the transduction mechanism produces less receptor current such that there is a reduction in the battery of the somatic motor. This leads to a drastic decrease in cochlear amplification and frequency sensitivity, as well as changes in position-frequency map (tuning pattern) of the cochlea. In addition, the simulations show that the age-related reduction of the endocochlear potential significantly inhibits the firing rate of the auditory nerve which might contribute to the decline of temporal resolution in the aging auditory system...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} and {{distinguish the}} types of sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) that occur in hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Type 1 a (HMSN- 1 a) and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), which are caused by deletion or frameshift mutation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Ambulatory patients in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients with HMSN- 1 a due to a duplication of the PMP 22 gene on chromosome 17 p 11. 2, 16 patients with HNPP due to the common PMP 22 deletion (HNPP del), and 11 HNPP patients with a frame shift mutation (heterozygous PMP 22 G-insertion) (HNPP mut), all confirmed by molecular genetic analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Pure-tone audiograms and speech audiograms were obtained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of cross-sectional analysis comprising linear regression of hearing threshold on age. RESULTS: Pure-tone audiograms showed mild to moderate SNHI, predominant at the low and the high frequencies. SNHI showed significant progression by approximately 0. 4 dB per year at 0. 25 to 4 kHz and up to 1 to 2 dB per year at 4 to 8 kHz. Patients with HMSN- 1 a had substantial, presumably congenital, SNHI but did not show significant progression beyond <b>presbyacusis.</b> Patients with HNPP showed postnatal onset at age 11 years with progression of SNHI in excess of <b>presbyacusis</b> by 0. 4 dB per year. All three types of neuropathy showed normal speech recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All three types of neuropathy showed SNHI with normal speech recognition. HMSN- 1 a showed stable SNHI without progression beyond <b>presbyacusis.</b> HNPP showed progression beyond <b>presbyacusis</b> with postnatal onset. The differences in SNHI {{may be explained by}} the differences in PMP 22 expression.

40|$|Age-related {{hearing loss}} (<b>presbyacusis)</b> {{is the most}} common type of hearing impairment. One of the most {{consistent}} pathological changes seen in <b>presbyacusis</b> is the loss of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Defining the cellular and molecular basis of SGN degeneration in the human inner ear is critical to gaining a better understanding of the pathophysiology of <b>presbyacusis.</b> However, information on age-related cellular and molecular alterations in the human spiral ganglion remains scant, owing to the very limited availably of human specimens suitable for high resolution morphological and molecular analysis. This study aimed at defining age-related alterations in the auditory nerve in human temporal bones and determining if immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP) can be used as an alternative approach to electron microscopy for evaluating myelin degeneration. For comparative purposes, we evaluated ultrastructural alternations and changes in MBP immunostaining in aging CBA/CaJ mice. We then examined 13 temporal bones from 10 human donors, including 4 adults aged 38 – 46 years (middle-aged group) and 6 adults aged 63 – 91 years (older group). Similar to the mouse, intense immunostaining of MBP was present throughout the auditory nerve of the middle-aged human donors. Significant declines in MBP immunoreactivity and losses of MBP + auditory nerve fibers were observed in the spiral ganglia of both the older human and aged mouse ears.

Investigations performed to date have generally been carried out with the aid of self-reporting questionnaires, without the support of objective findings. Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze an extensive series of elderly people from different areas of the Veneto region to obtain an epidemiological descriptive analysis, as detailed as possible, of their <b>presbyacusis,</b> considering their hearing thresholds at various frequencies, distinguishing findings according to sex and age in classes and the geographical area where the survey was performed. Methods: The survey was carried out collecting information from the audiometric reports on 13, 710 subjects of both sexes aged 60 years and over, with a proportion of males (M/F ! 100) of 92. 02 %, referred spontaneously for hearing examination to the ENT departments of eight hospitals between 1986 and 1994. The catchment area includes three provincial capitals and five mainly rural municipalities. Results: The results show that the hearing threshold rises progressively with age in both sexes. The hearing loss is milder in women than in men, especially at the higher frequencies. No important differences emerged among findings recorded in their 80 s and in their 90 s or among findings in the different geographical areas considered.

Despite intensive research, age-related changes are still poorly understood and, given the continuous aging of the population, it is desirable to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of <b>presbyacusis.</b> Consequently we decided to study age-related changes that appear in the structure and function of the central auditory system in the brain of experimental animals. In the first experiment we tested the hypothesis that during aging there is substantial decline of GABA-mediated inhibition in the central auditory system of the rat. We evaluated levels of both isoforms of glutamatedecarboxylase (GAD 65, GAD 67), a key enzyme in GABA synthesis. Western blot analysis revealed an overall decrease in levels of both isoforms in the inferior colliculus as well as the auditory cortex in aged rats. The same pattern was found when we used immunohistochemistry analysis; there was a decrease in the number of GAD 65 and GAD 67 -ir neuronal bodies and a decrease in the density of the labeling.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{delineate}} the phenotype and genotype of an autosomal dominant low-frequency sensorineural nonsyndromic hearing impairment trait {{in relation to}} similar traits. STUDY DESIGN: Family study, including retrospective case reviews. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Hearing impairment was documented in 11 family members in five generations, 8 of whom were alive and participated in this study. INTERVENTION: Diagnostic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical study: medical and otologic history and examination, retrieval of previous audiograms, pure-tone audiometry, and statistical analysis of audiometric data. Genetic study: linkage analysis of blood samples in 18 clinically affected and nonaffected family members. RESULTS: Hearing impairment had been present since early childhood, mainly affecting the low frequencies (mean threshold 45 dB HL at 0. 25 - 1 kHz); speech recognition was hardly affected {{during the first three}} decades of life. Higher frequencies became involved with increasing age, thus causing a flat-type audiogram at middle age and down-sloping audiograms after age 60 years. Progression was mild but significant at all frequencies (0. 5 dB/year at 0. 25 kHz to 1. 3 dB/year at 8 kHz) and persisted after correction was applied for normal <b>presbyacusis.</b> The trait was linked to chromosome 4 p 16. 3, in a region comprising both the previously located, closely adjacent DFNA 6 and the DFNA 14 loci for low-frequency hearing impairment. CONCLUSION: A third family (designated Dutch II) was identified with a low-frequency hearing impairment trait showing linkage to chromosome 4 p 16. 3 (DFNA 6 / 14).

40|$|A {{total of}} 64 loci for {{autosomal}} dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment have been described, and the causative genes {{have been identified}} for 24 of these. The present study reports on the clinical characteristics of an autosomal dominantly inherited hearing impairment that is linked to a region within the DFNA 60 locus located on chromosome 2 in q 22. 1 - 24. 1. A pedigree spanning four generations was established with 13 affected individuals. Linkage analysis demonstrated that the locus extended over a 2. 96 Mb region flanked by markers D 2 S 2335 and D 2 S 2275. The audiograms mainly showed a distinctive U-shaped configuration. Deterioration of hearing started at a wide age range, from 12 to 40 years. Cross-sectional analysis showed rapid progression of hearing impairment from mild to severe, {{between the ages of}} 40 and 60 years, a phenomenon that is also observed in DFNA 9 patients. The results of the individual longitudinal analyses were generally in line with those obtained by the cross-sectional analysis. Speech recognition scores related to the level of hearing impairment (PTA 1, 2, 4 kHz) appeared to be fairly similar to those of <b>presbyacusis</b> patients. It is speculated that hearing impairment starting in mid-life, as shown by DFNA 60 patients, could {{play a role in the}} development of <b>presbyacusis.</b> Furthermore, speech recognition did not deteriorate appreciably before the sixth decade of life. We conclude that DFNA 60 should be considered in hearing impaired patients who undergo a rapid progression in middle age and are negative for DFNA 9.

ObjectiveTo study the prevalence and determinants of impaired hearing in Itajaí/SC. MethodsA population-based survey based on a World Health Organization protocol. Field research was carried out from July 2008 to 2011. Procedures for evaluating hearing in households: questionnaire, measurement of noise, otoscopy, pure tone audiometry at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes: individuals above 4 years; children under 4 years: evoked otoacoustic emissions (OAE), cocleo-palpebral reflex(CPR), tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes. In the elderly population a questionnaire of perception of hearing loss was applied. ResultsThe study sample consisted of 379 individuals – 45. 38 % were males and 54. 62 % were females. Age-range: 11. 34 % up to 10 years; 64. 39 % 10 to 60 years, 24. 27 % over 60 years. Evaluation of the best hearing ear showed that 74. 1 % of residents had normal hearing, 18. 9 % had mild hearing loss, 5. 1 % had moderate hearing loss, 1. 9 % had severe hearing loss.

How is hearing impairment perceived by the elderly? How great is the need for audiological rehabilitation for elderly people with hearing impairments?Study I is a cross-sectional study {{within the framework of the}} age study H 70 where a comparison was made between a) tone audiometry and self-assessments of hearing, b) tone audiometry and the prescription of hearing aids and c) self- assessments of hearing and the prescription of hearing aids. Three age cohorts were studied: 1) year of birth 1901 - 1902 (n= 210 : 133 f and 77 m), 2) year of birth 1915 - 16 (n= 168 : 94 f and 74 m) and 3) year of birth 1922 - 23 (n= 237 : 129 f and 108 m). Study II is a prevalence study of tinnitus where the H 70 cohort born in 1901 - 02 was followed up on three occasions, at the ages of 70 (n= 377 : 197 f and 180 m), 75 (n= 266 : 140 f and 126 m) and 79 (n= 158 : 89 f and 69 m). A strict longitudinal study was also made of this material which was studied on each of the three occasions. A cohort comparison was also made of those born 1901 - 02 and those born 1906 - 07 (n= 297 : 171 f and 126 m) as to the prevalence of tinnitus in relation to the duration of exposure to noise. Study III is a selected hearing study of people living in Johanneberg (n= 154 : 95 f and 59 m). The aim of this selection was to study a group with more "pure presbyacusis" in relation to psychosocial problems. The participants were divided into three hearing groups according to severity of their hearing impairment and were studied according to a self-assessment form with 20 different psychosocial statements about hearing. Study IV is a qualitative study. Its direction is phenomenographic. The inclusion criteria for participation were those from H 70 born in 1922 and with a slight to moderate hearing impairment of the <b>presbyacusis</b> type in both ears when tested in 1992 - 93. Exclusion criteria were other types of hearing impairments than <b>presbyacusis,</b> and dementia. In all, 14 individuals participated. The in-depth interview consisted of an informal conversation about how it is to live your daily life with impaired hearing. The interviews were taped, transcribed word by word and analyzed according to the phenomenographic approach. The results of the study showed that there is a tendency for the elderly to make light of the problems associated with <b>presbyacusis,</b> tinnitus, psychosocial conditions and the need for a hearing aid. The 88 -year-old group in particular assessed their hearing problems as less severe than those in the younger groups (70 and 75 years). At the same degree of hearing impairment, the younger groups reported more problems. The prevalence of tinnitus was 8 - 42 % at the ages 70, 75 and 79 years. Tinnitus did not increase significantly with increasing age. Tinnitus was, however, correlated with hearing impairment and duration of exposure to noise. In study IV, three people were found to have tinnitus and they described an inhibition of sounds. The effect of <b>presbyacusis</b> on the psychological situation was found to be less than expected. In spite of their fear of worsening hearing, few wanted a hearing aids. The situations which posed the greatest problems were conversation with several people and hearing sounds from another room. When elderly people with hearing impairments themselves described their experiences, it, however, appears that hearing was important not only for communication and spatial ability but also for affirmation of identity and existence. Conclusion: The elderly with hearing difficulties tone down the importance of factors related to themselves as individuals and in relation to their surroundings. They believe that it is normal to hear less well as you get older. The explanation for such reasoning may be that <b>presbyacusis</b> develops slowly and you have time to adapt to your impaired hearing, e. g. by avoiding situations which are communicatively demanding. This is made clear in study IV where the elderly people's own experiences are described. It is important that elderly people with impaired hearing are identified at an early stage, so that their enthusiasm for dealing with their hearing problem does not have time to ebb. When the ability to hear is seen as important not only for being able to participate in a social context but also for the experience of existence there is motivation to do something more radical about the situation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Aging {{process is}} {{associated}} with degeneration in {{different part of the}} body There is scarcity of literature on the otological diseases in the elderly black African especially Nigerian which is the largest African nation. Thus this study is done with the aim of highlighting the pattern of otological diseases in elderly for careful cost-effective health care plans and to make the aging period more fulfilling and tolerable to the elderly. It is therefore hope that the information {{will go a long way}} to assist other African countries as well. Method: The study is a ten year hospital-based retrospective study between January, 1999 and December, 2008 at the ENT Department of Unilorin Teaching Hospital Ilorin. All patients aged 65 years and above with otological complaints were included in the study. Results: A total of 740 Elderly patients were included in the study. The male to female sex ratio was 1. 5 : 1. 0. Petty Traders accounted for 300 (40. 5 %) of cases; 87 (11. 8 %) were Farmers; 250 (33. 8 %) were Retired Civil Servants; 68 (9. 2 %) were Unskilled Laborers and 35 (4. 7 %) were full-time Housewives. Aural wax impaction was the commonest otological disease found, accounting for 360 (48. 7 %) of cases, Hearing loss (<b>presbyacusis),</b> 158 (21. 4 %); Tinnitus, 78 (10. 5 %) and Otomycosis, 64 (8. 5 %). Other conditions were CSOM, 34 (4. 6 %);Foreign body Impaction, 32 (4. 3 %); Vertigo, 10 (1. 4 %) and Aural Tumours, 5 (0. 6 %). Conclusion: Aural wax impaction was the commonest disease found, thus it is important to always do full audiologic evaluation after aural syringing to rule out other conditions such as <b>presbyacusis</b> and aural tumours in elderly. Continuing medical education is recommended for the general practitioners for early recognition and referral...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To perform linkage {{analysis}} and to outline hearing loss characteristics {{in a family}} exhibiting a nonsyndromic, autosomal dominant type of progressive sensorineural hearing loss. DESIGN: Genetic analysis was performed using microsatellite markers. Audiometric data were collected and analyzed longitudinally. Sigmoidal dose-response curves enabled us to perform nonlinear regression analysis per frequency and on phoneme recognition scores. Speech recognition scores were {{compared with those of}} DFNA 2, DFNA 5, DFNA 9, and <b>presbyacusis</b> subjects. SUBJECTS: Affected family members of a Dutch family (W 99 - 060). RESULTS: We revealed linkage of hearing loss to the DFNA 20 / 26 locus (maximum logarithm of odds score, 3. 1 at theta= 0. 04) and reduced the critical region from 12 to 9. 5 centimorgans. Patients younger than 15 years already showed gently downsloping audiograms. At ages 15 to 20 and 25 to 40 years, hearing loss was profound at 8 kHz and 1 to 4 kHz, respectively. The 0. 25 - to 0. 5 -kHz thresholds showed more gradual progression by about 1. 5 to 2 dB/y. From about age 40 years onward, hearing was residual. Hearing impairment took a more severe course than in a known DFNA 20 family. Score recognition in DFNA 20 / 26 subjects was better than in DFNA 9 subjects at any pure-tone average (1 - 4 kHz) threshold. Compared with subjects having DFNA 2 and DFNA 5, speech recognition in those with DFNA 20 / 26 scored better at threshold levels below 85 dB hearing level, but worse at levels above 90 dB. Compared with <b>presbyacusis</b> subjects, those with DFNA 20 / 26 scored better in speech recognition at levels below 100 dB and worse at levels above 100 dB. CONCLUSIONS: Autosomal dominant hearing loss is linked to the DFNA 20 / 26 locus in this Dutch family. The critical region is reduced from 12 to 9. 5 centimorgans. Phenotypically, patients are more severely affected than those of a known DFNA 20 family...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Presbyacusis</b> {{refers to}} {{sensorineural hearing loss}} {{associated}} with age. Although endocochlear changes undoubtedly contribute to <b>presbyacusis,</b> peripheral changes alone cannot fully explain the hearing problems elderly face. There is increasing evidence that also changes in central auditory processing are involved. One aspect of central auditory processing is binaural hearing. Psychoacoustic research suggests that age-related hearing problems are partly due to degraded binaural processing. The main goal {{of the present study}} is to investigate age-related changes in binaural processing at its very primarily level: the auditory brainstem. Methods: Nineteen young adults (mean age 24. 1 years), 25 middle-aged adults (mean age 45. 3 years) and eight older adults (mean age 64. 9 years) volunteered in this study. All subjects had air-conduction thresholds better or equal to the 95 th percentile values for their age and sex. Binaural interaction was assessed by means of the binaural interaction component derived from the auditory brainstem response (ABR-BIC). ABR-BICs were derived by subtracting the binaural response from the sum of the monaural responses. Age-related changes in the presence, latency and amplitude of the ABR-BIC were investigated. P-values < 0. 05 were considered significant. If a Bonferrni correction was required, a signifcance level of 0. 017 was used. Results: The presence of the ABR-BIC was significantly lower in the oldest group compared to the youngest group (Fisher’s Exact test, p < 0. 017). Latencies were significantly different between the three groups (single factor ANOVA, p < 0. 05). From pairwise comparison, it follows that the older group had longer latencies compared to the younger and middle-aged group (Scheffé-test, p < 0. 05). No significant difference in amplitude was found (single factor ANOVA, p = 0. 20). Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that age affects binaural processing. It {{should be noted that the}} oldest group includes only eight subjects. Results of more subjects will be presented. Moreover, pure age-effects will be assessed by redoing the analysis including only normal-hearing older adults...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of diagnostic methods for cerebellopontine angle lesions (auditory nerve electrophysiology, computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging) {{has increased in}} recent years. Paradoxically, in our experience this has not led to an increased percentage of tumors detected at an early stage. In 1975 20 % of tumors were confined to the internal auditory canal, whereas only 6. 6 % were intercanalicular in 1988. A detailed analysis of 120 recent cases included first symptoms, time between first symptoms and diagnosis, symptoms at diagnosis, and size of tumor. We conclude the low percentage of intracanalicular tumors in the recent series results from: (1) rapid growth in some cases; (2) slow enlargement of the tumor over a long time without compression of adjacent cranial nerves leading to a paucity of symptoms; (3) misleading clinical pictures, including sudden hearing loss and hydrops; and (4) tumor symptoms masked by unrelated pathologic processes (otosclerosis, <b>presbyacusis,</b> trauma) ...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Populations are becoming progressively older thus presenting symptoms of diminished organ function due to degenerative processes.

40|$|Atrophy of the {{stria vascularis}} and spiral {{ligament}} and an associated {{decrease in the}} endocochlear potential (EP) are significant factors in age-related hearing loss (<b>presbyacusis).</b> To model this EP decrease, furosemide was delivered into the round-window niche of young adult gerbils by osmotic pump for seven days, chronically reducing the EP by 30 – 40 mV. Compound action potential (CAP) thresholds were correspondingly reduced by 30 – 40 dB SPL at high frequencies. Two weeks after withdrawal of furosemide, the treated ears showed an EP recovery of up to 20 – 30 mV along with a similar recovery of CAP thresholds. The influence of cell division on furosemide-induced and age-related decline of the EP was examined using a mitotic tracer, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell proliferation was examined in three groups: young control, furosemide-treated, and aged cochleas. Sections immunostained for BrdU were bleached with H 2 O 2 to eliminate ambiguities with melanin pigment in the inner ear. Cell types positively labeled for BrdU in all three groups included Schwann cells in Rosenthal's canal; glial cells in the osseous spiral lamina; fibrocytes in the limbus, sacculus, and spiral ligament (SL); epithelial cells in Reissner's and round-window membranes; intermediate cells in the stria vascularis; and vascular endothelial cells. Quantitative analysis showed that {{the mean number of}} BrdU-positive (BrdU+) intermediate cells in the stria did not differ significantly among the three groups. In contrast, there was a significant increase of BrdU + fibrocytes in the SL of furosemide-treated animals as compared to the young control group. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in labeled fibrocytes in the aged versus the young ears, particularly among the type II and type IV subtypes. The results suggest that the increased fibrocyte turnover in the SL after furosemide treatment {{may be related to the}} recovery of EP and CAP thresholds, supporting the hypothesis that fibrocyte proliferation may be essential for maintaining the EP and cochlear function in normal and damaged cochleas. Moreover, the decreased turnover of SL fibrocytes with age may be a contributing factor underlying the lateral wall pathology and consequent EP loss that often accompanies <b>presbyacusis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Turner Syndrome is {{a common}} {{chromosomal}} disorder and affects approximately one in every 2000 newborn girl. The syndrome {{is defined as a}} total (45,X) or partial loss of the second sex chromosome in combination with the typical characteristic features, which are short stature (less than 150 cm), absent estrogen production due to ovarian dysgenesis, with failure to enter puberty spontaneously and infertility. Among other associated anomalies ear and hearing problems are common, involving both the middle and inner ear. In childhood repeated attacks of acute otitis media and serous otitis media are frequent, sometimes leading to chronic middle ear diseases. Also a sensorineural hearing loss is common, usually described as a typical dip in the mid-frequencies. Later in life, an early aging is seen, with a progressive sensorineural high frequency hearing loss (<b>presbyacusis).</b> When added to the dip, it results in a rapid onset of social hearing impairment, often requiring hearing aid use. The cause of the related hearing problems is not known. Children with Turner syndrome were examined otologically and audiometrically. Also immunomarkers and autoantibodies were investigated. A high incidence of recurrent otitis media was found with eardrum pathology and conductive hearing loss as frequent sequelae. An immunodeficiency could not explain the repeated attacks of otitis media. The audiometric data confirm that the dip is progressing over time and show that the dip may be present as early as at the age of six, making it possible to predict a future hearing loss early. It is therefore important to have an early audiometric evaluation of every girl with Turner syndrome, including the testing of both air and bone conduction with absolute values, in order to discover the dip. In addition, a questionnaire, elucidating the influence of the hearing impairment on every day life in 113 girls and women with Turner syndrome, was evaluated. The need for initiation of rehabilitative intervention is apparent, when the patient first begins to notice difficulty, as the hearing problems develop rather rapidly, leading to communication problems and tiredness due to intensive listening. Moreover it is established that the hearing problems are perceived {{as one of the most}} important problems associated with Turner syndrome. An animal model, the Turner mouse, lacking the X-chromosome was investigated. The inner ear morphology was examined using light microscopy (agar and paraffin sections and phalloidin stained surface preparations), transmission- and scanning electron microscopy. The hearing was tested using auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. The "Turner mouse" appears to have ear and hearing problems quite similar to humans with Turner syndrome and can therefore be used in the future as a model to determine the auditory pathology underlying the syndrome. The results indicate that hearing problems in the "Turner mouse" are of cochlear origin, with an eight-nerve component. Furthermore, to examine whether one of the reasons for the early <b>presbyacusis</b> in Turner syndrome can be due to the defect endogenous estrogen production, mapping of estrogen receptors in the inner ear was accomplished. Paraffin embedded inner ear sections from mouse, rat and human, both adult and fetal (normal and affected with Turner syndrome), were immunostained with antibodies against estrogen receptors a and b. For the first time estrogen receptors are shown to be present in the inner ear at specific locations important for hearing functions and inner ear homeostasis, implying that estrogens may have an effect on the hearing. If the lack of estrogens are important for development of <b>presbyacusis</b> in the normal population and patients with Turner syndrome can only be speculated upon. Maybe estrogens have certain protective effects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{phenotype}} in a 5 -generation DFNA 13 {{family with a}} missense mutation in the COL 11 A 2 gene that causes autosomal dominant, presumably prelingual, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment. DESIGN: Family study. SETTING: University hospital department. PATIENTS: Twenty mutation carriers from a large American kindred. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis using pure-tone threshold measurements at 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. The audiometric configuration was evaluated according to an existing consensus protocol. The significance of features relating to audiometric configuration was tested using 1 -way analysis of variance. Progression was evaluated with linear regression analyses of threshold-on-age. RESULTS: Most individuals showed midfrequency (U-shaped) characteristics. The mean threshold in generations IV and V was 44 dB at 1, 2, and 4 kHz (midfrequencies); it was 29 dB at the other frequencies (0. 25, 0. 5, and 8 kHz). There was no significant progression beyond <b>presbyacusis.</b> CONCLUSION: The trait in this family {{can be characterized as}} autosomal dominant, nonprogressive, presumably prelingual, midfrequency sensorineural hearing impairment...|$|E
