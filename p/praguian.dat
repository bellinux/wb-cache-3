40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to map the}} area of infinitives {{and the way they}} are used as {{secondary}} predicates in Russian, Czech and German, and to make a typological classification of infinitives based on the way these exist and operate in language. Part One gives an overview of the basic conception of the <b>Praguian</b> typology with other language typologies in the background. The overview is followed by a list of characteristic features of particular language types (according to the <b>Praguian</b> typology) with the emphasis put on syntactic realizations of these types. At the level of syntax, the <b>Praguian</b> typology has focused on the following topics: possible ways of expressing sentence relations (esp. that of predication), the issue of congruence, which is closely connected to the previous topic, the questions of noun clauses (noun + noun), the use of copula, the questions related to "a second verb" in the sentence and to the role of infinite and nominal forms of verbs and how they compete with other forms (since there is a link between these two topics), and the connection between congruence and fixed word order. In the <b>Praguian</b> typology the way of looking at secondary predication has changed. In the beginning, Skalička was convinced that using an infinitive as a second verb in a sentence is a manifestation of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore a {{generative}} model for recovering surface syntax and strings from deep-syntactic tree structures. Deep analysis has been proposed {{for a number of}} language and speech processing tasks, such as machine translation and paraphrasing of speech transcripts. In an effort to validate one such formalism of deep syntax, the <b>Praguian</b> Tectogrammatical Representation (TR), we present a model of synthesis for English which generates surface-syntactic trees as well as strings. We propose a generative model for function word insertion (prepositions, definite/indefinite articles, etc.) and subphrase reordering. We show by way of empirical results that this model is effective in constructing acceptable English sentences given impoverished trees. ...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} a preparatory {{research}} for building a language corpus annotation scenario capturing the discourse relations in Czech. We primarily focus on {{the description of the}} syntactically motivated relations in discourse, basing our findings on the theoretical background of the Prague Dependency Treebank 2. 0 and the Penn Discourse Treebank 2. Our aim is to revisit the present-day syntactico-semantic (tectogrammatical) annotation in the Prague Dependency Treebank, extend it for the purposes of a sentence-boundary-crossing representation and eventually to design a new, discourse level of annotation. In this paper, we propose a feasible process of such a transfer, comparing the possibilities the <b>Praguian</b> dependency-based approach offers with the Penn discourse annotation based primarily on the analysis and classification of discourse connectives. ...|$|E
40|$|Firmly {{anchored}} in the <b>Praguian</b> theory of functional sentence perspective (FSP), the present paper discusses the prototypical type of sentences implementing the so–called Presentation Scale (i. e., that containing a rhematic subject in preverbal position) within fiction narrative discourse. Special {{attention is paid to}} the semantic affinity operating between the subject and the predicate; in such distributional fields (cf. A bird chirped on the twig) the verbs seem to semantically support the character of their subjects. Thus, the S–V affinity appears to {{play a significant role in}} enabling the English verb to express existence or appearance on the scene in an implicit way. The phenomenon of semantic affinity is discussed on the basis of FSP investigation of a sample corpus of narrative texts compiled and processed by the author. Apart from the syntactic–semantic analysis, S–V affinity is also examined through the prism of eminent Czech representatives of the Prague School legacy, such as Vilém Mathesius, Jan Firbas, Aleš Svoboda and Libuše Dušková...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} the {{following}} organization. In Sections 2 and 3 we summarize the basic {{notions of the}} functional generative framework, and {{the principles of the}} TFA-based approach to modelling salience in monologues, respectively. Section 4 overviews some characteristics of the dialogue which require a modification of the TFA-based approach. Subsequently, we introduce the modified version of the TFA-based approach in Sections 5 and 6. Section 7 comprises our final remarks and suggestions for future research. 2. The initial framework We work within the <b>Praguian</b> framework of Functional Generative Description (FGD) (cf. Sgall 1967, Sgall et al. 1986). FGD works with several levels of representation of the sentence, ranging from the phonemic (graphemic) level which represents the external shape of a sentence, to the tectogrammatic level which represents its linguistic meaning. The representation of a sentence at the tectogrammatic level (TR) consists of nodes, corresponding to semantemes, carrying complex labels encoding various kinds of information. The TR has three further ingredients: the structural relations between semantemes (reflecting their dependency and coordination relationships), the scale of communicative dynamism (reflecting "deep word order") and the distinction between contextual boundness and non-boundness for each semanteme (reflecting its position in the linguistic patterning of the opposition between "given" and "new"...|$|E
40|$|Since it is {{difficult}} to define language, an effective method of proceeding is by deepening and strengthening the knowledge of its properties, in particular through comparisons. This paper aims to clarify the well known property of human languages, which are characterized by having a centre and a periphery. The notions of centricity-peripherality, developed within the Prague linguistic tradition, apply to many other entities, both cultural and natural: towns first of all, but also physiological systems (the circulatory and nervous systems), and physical phenomena (the formation of crystals, the propagation of circles in the water resulting from the impact of a water droplet…). The lines followed are twofold: i. the primacy of the linguistic activity of the community of speakers over metalinguistic considerations; ii. the identification of three layers of the metalinguistic enterprise: the system (lexicon and grammar) and the inner form of its structuring; the sentence and its syntagmatic structure; the utterance and its indexical origin. The <b>Praguian</b> linguistic tradition finds itself in conversation with authors from outside its ranks, from Aristotle to Wittgenstein, through Humboldt and Marty. If science needs metaphors and can’t do without them, constitutive metaphors have to be preferred. The metaphor of centre and periphery proves to be one of these...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{linguistic}} phenomena at suprasentential level. In particular, it looks into how textual analysis {{can be enhanced}} by supplementing the Parisian programme of interpretive semantics, as devised by François Rastier, namely his theory of isotopies, with elementary aspects of topic-focus articulation (TFA), as well as contextual boundness (CB) and contextual non-boundness (CN), as elaborated within the <b>Praguian</b> linguistic tradition (V. Mathesius, P. Sgall, E. Hajičová, F. Daneš, J. Firbas), and how the descriptive power of the former can be increased by the latter. In this respect, {{it is argued that}} two types of TFA phenomena interact during any process of textual interpretation: those of topic-focus articulation at the level of sentence, conceiving lexical morphs as thematic (T) and/or rhematic (R), as well as contextually bound (CB) and/or contextually non-bound (CN), and those of topic-focus articulation at the level of isotopy, with each isotopy being conceived as structured around a center (an abstract semantic unit) and periphery (a span of concrete utterances). Two types of such interaction are described, each defined by either correlation, or non-correlation of the CB and CN semes at the levels of isotopy and sentence, respectively: thematic-rhematic isotopy, induced by co-occurrence of the CB seme of the center and the CB seme of the periphery; and thematic-rhematic allotopy (i. e. non-isotopy), induced by co-occurrence of the CB seme of the center and the CN seme of the periphery. Since topic-focus isotopies and allotopies can be perceived as members of privative oppositions, a tentative system of such oppositions is presented, based on linguistic analyses of selected European Commission texts drafted in English and their Czech translations. The author’s ultimate intention is to show that the semantic features of topic-focus articulation at the sentential and suprasentential levels are both structurally parallel and functionally complementary...|$|E
40|$|Modern functionalist {{approaches}} to syntax were pioneered in the 1920 s by the scholars {{associated with the}} Linguistic Circle of Prague and Prague-based functionalism is a dynamic force today. Nevertheless, citations of this work by North American functionalists {{are few and far}} between. This paper sets out to explain that state of affairs. It pinpoints the profound theoretical differences between mainstream North American and Czech approaches that have led to partisans of the former losing interest in the latter. The paper argues that, on the other hand, <b>Praguian</b> functional syntax has a great deal in common with more ‘ formal ’ functionalist approaches and with much work in formal semantics. Not surprisingly, then, recent years have seen increasing productive collaboration between North American and Western European practitioners of these approaches and members of the Prague School. 1. Overview A compelling problem for linguistic historiography is the apparent lack of influence of the work of the Prague School linguists on North American functional syntax. It is not only true, but also a truism, that the first major call for a ‘functionalist ’ approach to language came from scholars associated with the Linguistic Circle of Prague in the 1920 s. It is also well known that after an interruption created by the Second World War and the ensuing period of extreme Stalinism, Czech and Slovak linguists were in the late 1950 s again developing functional {{approaches to}} syntax. And yet, in most major functionalist syntactic work of the past decade written or edited by North American (and many Western European) scholars, one searches in vain for discussion, favorable or critical, of ideas put forward by the Praguians. One’s first thought might be that we have here a classic case of (mostly) American linguists ignoring anything published outside the 50 states. But I [1] I {{would like to thank the}} following individuals for their comments on a pre-final versio...|$|E
40|$|The term {{structuring}} is here used as {{an equivalent}} of various meanings of terms sentence perspective or sentence articulation found in terms Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), or Actual Sentence Articulation, or in phrases {{used in the present}} paper as l’articulation ordinaire or l’articulation poétique. The introductory sections of the paper deal with the typological and diachronic aspects of word order, and with the proposal to use permutation as a promising procedure preparing to obtain a complete list of meaningful sequences to be further explored. There is also a brief note on contextuality, on the spoken and written norms of language and on the poetic and specialized languages/styles, all as related to word order. The FSP is seen as one type of structuring sentence linearity. As such, the FSP is considered to be an important, more recent parallel to the contemporary varieties of what is here called ordinary structuring (articulation), i. e. types of grammatical subject-predicate structuring (articulation). In contrast to ‘ordinary’ approaches, the FSP structuring is supported by communicatively oriented pragma-psycho-linguistic foundations, i. e. using key terms like situation of communication, addresser intention, addressee response, etc. That is why {{the next step is to}} compare the two conceptions (FSP and ordinary structuring). The main result of the comparison is the parallel nature of the two : They share texts to analyze and, to do so, they use different principles and terminologies (see the table of terms in section 8). The successful contemporary development of FSP, as well as its pioneerig steps in the pre- 1945 period, have been made mainly by Prague linguists, who, together with a number of interested scholars from abroad, work out its theory trying to make of it a standard component of syntactic research. The problem of a certain tension between the original <b>Praguian</b> functional-structural and later communicative approach motivates some programs planning to elaborate a closer synthesis of the two. Since a hexameter was {{used as an}} important example for word order analysis and, mainly, because it is felt that poetic structuring of sentences is an intriguing theoretical problem, the final section of the paper, in a sort of appendix, is devoted to a look at the specific structuring of Virgil’s hexameter in book VIII, verse 596 of the Aeneid...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{contribution}} is to present several hypotheses that may help to characterize and identify contrast as such and degrees of its intensity, and to point out how the phenomena connected with contrast can be handled in a descriptive framework that uses a dependency based syntax and includes {{a description of the}} topic-focus articulation (TFA) as one of the aspects of the underlying sentence structure. We also illustrate how the chosen descriptive framework is tested in a syntactic annotation of a large corpus. First we examine the chosen description of TFA (Section 1), then the means of expression of contrast are discussed (Section 2), as well as issues of contrast in focus (Section 3), and especially in topic (Section 4). 1 Topic-focus articulation 1. 1 Topic, focus, and contextual boundness in a linguistic description In the theoretical framework of the <b>Praguian</b> Functional Generative Description (FGD, see Sgall et al. 1986, Hajičová et al. 1998), the semantic basis of the articulation of the sentence into T(opic) and F(ocus) is understood as the relation of aboutness: a prototypical declarative sentence asserts that its F holds (or, with negation, does not hold) about its T. Thus, the core of the semantico-pragmatic interpretation of a declarative sentence might be based on a formula such as F(T) or, for a negative sentence, as non-F(T), if for the {{aim of the}} present discussion issues such as those of intension, lambda calculus and type theory are put aside. Within both T and F, an opposition of contextually bound (CB) and non-bound (NB) nodes is distinguished, which is understood as a grammatically patterned opposition, rather than in the literal sense of the term. In the underlying left-to-right order, NB dependents follow and CB dependents precede their heads. In unmarked cases, the main verb (V) and those of its direct dependents that on the surface follow it belong to F, and the items preceding V are parts of T. In marked (non-prototypical) cases, V can be CB, i. e. in T, or (a part of) F may precede V; usually the intonation centr...|$|E
