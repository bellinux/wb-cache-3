40|$|Abstract. <b>Prewhitening</b> is a {{standard}} step for the processing of noisy signals. Typically, eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the sample data covariance matrix {{is used to calculate}} the whitening matrix. From a computational point of view, an important problem here is to reduce the complexity of the EVD of the complex-valued sample data covariance matrix. In this paper, we show that the computational complexity of the <b>prewhitening</b> step for complex-valued signals can be reduced approximately by a factor of four when the real-valued EVD is used instead of the complex-valued one. Such complexity reduction can be achieved for any axis-symmetric array. The performance of the proposed procedure is studied in application to a blind source separation (BSS) problem. For this application, the performance of the proposed <b>prewhitening</b> scheme is illustrated by means of simula-tions, and compared with the conventional <b>prewhitening</b> scheme.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Suppression of strong, {{spatially}} correlated back-ground interference is {{a challenge}} associated with electroen-cephalography (EEG) source localization problems. The most com-mon {{way of dealing with}} such interference is {{through the use of a}} <b>prewhitening</b> transformation based on an estimate of the covari-ance of the interference plus noise. This approach is based on strong assumptions regarding temporal stationarity of the data, which do not commonly hold in EEG applications. In addition, <b>prewhitening</b> cannot typically be implemented directly due to ill conditioning of the covariance matrix, and ad hoc regularization is often necessary. Using both simulation examples and experiments involving real EEG data with auditory evoked responses, we demonstrate that a straightforward interference projection method is significantly more robust than <b>prewhitening</b> for EEG source localization.

40|$|In {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (FMRI) statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilised temporal ltering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations, or remove them. Shaping, or "colouring", attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening" gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for <b>prewhitening</b> when compared with colouring. However, {{it has been suggested that}} sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give <b>prewhitening</b> acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in <b>prewhitening.</b> Having performed high-pass filtering, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type.
