Thermolyn Rigid and Orfitrans Stiff check socket materials produced significantly lower tensile strength and impact resistance than <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> <b>glycol</b> (PETG). Copolymer socket materials exhibited greater resistance to impact forces than the check socket materials but lower tensile strengths than PETG. The heated molding processes, for the check socket and copolymer materials, reduced both tensile strength and elongation at break. Definitive laminated sockets were sorted according to fabrication techniques. Nyglass material had significantly higher elongation, indicating a more ductile material than carbon-based laminations. Carbon sockets with pigmented resin had higher tensile strength and modulus at break than nonpigmented carbon sockets. Elongation at yield and elongation at break were similar for both types of carbon-based laminations.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination revealed different morphologies such as dispersed, cocontinuous and phase inverted depending on the composition, which indicates that the binary blends are immiscible and form a two-phase structure. Tensile properties decreased with increase in the ABS content while the impact strength reached an optimum at ca. 70 % ABS. Influence of a triblock co-polymer based on styrene and butadiene (SBS) on morphology, mechanical measurements and failure topography was used as criterion of the compatibilization effect. The compatiblizing action of SBS was evidenced by the sharp decrease in domain size of the dispersed phase followed by an increase at higher concentrations. The conformation of the compatibilizer at the interface was further analyzed based on the area occupied by the compatibilizer at the blend interface. The results were in agreement with the theoretical predictions of Noolandi and Hong. The extent of interface adhesion in these blends was analyzed by examination of the fracture-surface morphology. Addition of SBS also improved notched impact, elongation-at-break, tensile strength and modulus of elasticity. These results confirm that SBS is an effective compatibilizer for ABS/PET-G blends.

40|$|Uniaxial {{compression}} {{tests were}} performed on amorphous <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> (PET), amorphous <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> - <b>glycol</b> (PETG), semi-crystalline PET, and semicrystalline PET with various amounts of nano-fibers added. The stress-strain behavior for each material at several strain rates is presented. A typical stress-strain curve consists of a relatively steep rise in stress at small strains where the slope is the Young's Modulus. Then, the stress reaches a maximum before decreasing. This stress is called the yield stress. It is the stress at which plastic deformation begins. As the strain continues to increase, the stress begins to rise gradually because of strain hardening. The {{results show that the}} initial addition of 1 % nanofibers by weight to semi-crystalline PET increases the yield stress by nearly thirty percent. As the amount of nano-fibers increases, the yield stress remains relatively unchanged. This could be due to aggregation of the nano-fibers at higher weight percent as seen in micrographs. For each material, the yield stress was found to be rate-dependent, scaling with the log of the strain rate at low rates and transitioning to a different rate dependence at high rates. The slope of the yield stress versus In(strain rate) for each material was approximately parallel. This shows that the addition of nano-fibers does not affect rate sensitivity. The semi-crystalline PETs with nanofibers did not show any signs of strain hardening up to the strain magnitude tested and needs to be further explored. The maximum stiffness was found to be in the amorphous PET followed by the semi-crystalline PET with 2 % by weight nano-fibers blended in. The semi-crystalline PET alone has a much lower stiffness than amorphous PET, but this stiffness increases as nano-fibers are added up until they reach 3 % by weight at which the stiffness decreases. by Ellann Cohen.

In the above researches, the helical nanofibers obtained are described as three-dimensional and spring-like structures with nano- to microscale helix diameters. The authors attributed the generation of helical fibers {{to the fact that}} the two components involved in co-electrospinning display different shrinkages after electrospinning. But there is no detailed analysis and explanation of the formation mechanism of helical fibers. Based on the concept that an elastomeric and a stiff polymer in co-electrospinning may introduce longitudinal stress and result in coiled shapes of the bicomponent fibers, our previous studies [12] reported the fabrication of helical nanofibers via co-electrospinning. We compared three component systems, Nomex/TPU, PAN/TPU, and PS/TPU, which represent three kinds of polymer composition arrangements in co-electrospinning, and explored the role of polymer chain rigidity, miscibility, and hydrogen bonding on the formation of helical fibers. It has been experimentally verified that Nomex/TPU system can form fine helical fibers.
