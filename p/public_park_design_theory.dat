They are public spaces designed to attract all races and cultures and to provide places for attention to the integration of uses. The spaces affect many people and their design could be replicated in several other <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> A major problem faced by designers in Malaysia {{is the fact that}} there are three major communities, each with their own distinctive culture.

40|$|Urban <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> play a {{vital role}} in the social life of the communities. However, hot weather during the days due to the effect of global warming discourages {{community}} activities in the urban <b>public</b> <b>parks.</b> Furthermore, the urbanites' daily life is affecting the lack of time and opportunities for leisure and recreational activities. These constraints have changed the behaviour of the urban communities, preferable to carry out their leisure time activities in the urban <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> after the sun has set. It is important to promote leisure in outdoor spaces because most of the community’s activities during night time take place indoor leading to a passive urban lifestyle.

One instance of such counter-culture reaction is the Chicanos, as opposed to the generic notion of Hispanics. Chicanos have recovered, from the very social set they are immersed in, inhabitation-enabling elements for their urban environment, by means of factors which supply for cultural identity, hence citizenship awareness. Attention is brought to "Barrio Logan", a mostly Mexican-populated working class neighborhood in San Diego, CA. in the US: Cultural expressions in the Barrio's own urban environment have provided specific contributions to its Culture identity (which his neither Mexican nor WASP, but something distinct: Chicano) inside the United States, by retrieving Mexican items into activities like <b>public</b> <b>park</b> <b>design,</b> as well as in houses, restaurants, churches, mercados (flea-markets), etc. Chicanos, Cultural Identity, USA...|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1913 by Edward Gardner Lewis and {{incorporated}} in 1979, the Atascadero Colony {{as it was}} known {{at the time was}} originally envisioned as a model community. Little evidence of Atascadero's original architecture and urban design remain, as historic buildings and homes have been torn down to make way for more modern developments and the Sunken Gardens bisected by U.S. Route 101. One of the few surviving examples of original urban design can be found, however, in the Rotunda Building located near the Junior High School on Palma Avenue in the Sunken Gardens <b>public</b> <b>park.</b> <b>Designed</b> by Walter D. Bliss of San Francisco, construction was completed in 1918 at a cost of $180,000.

Location: 6500 Palma Ave, Atascadero. This building was purchased by San Luis Obispo County in the 1950s as a Memorial Building.
