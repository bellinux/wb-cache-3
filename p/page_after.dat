James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover <b>page.</b> <b>After</b> taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning.

On the October 22, 2001 edition of Raw, Bradshaw defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship. When Faarooq returned, Bradshaw lost the European Championship to Christian on the November 1, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. At No Way Out, the APA won a Tag Team Turmoil match to win a WWF Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania X8.

25|$|When {{the seal}} is pressed onto the {{printing}} surface, the procedure differs according to plant or silk based paste. For silk based paste, the user applies pressure, {{often with a}} specially made soft, flat surface beneath the paper. For plant based paste, the user simply applies light pressure. As lifting the seal vertically away from its imprint may rip or damage paper, the seal is usually lifted off one side at a time, as if bent off from the <b>page.</b> <b>After</b> this, the image may be blotted {{with a piece of}} paper to make it dry faster, although this may smudge it. Usually {{there needs to be a}} pile of soft felt or paper under the paper to be imprinted for a clear seal impression.|$|E
25|$|The popular idea {{seems to}} be that the Title is among the ranking factors and the {{description}} is more of an advertising for the searcher looking at the search results. In other words, while the Title tag is one of the factors determining if a page will rank for a certain keyword, the meta description will only help a search result stand out (or not, depending upon how well-written it is). If more people click on a result with a good description, it may reasonably be expected that Google will reward that same result with a higher ranking. This, of course, if visitors to the link do not immediately leave the <b>page</b> <b>after</b> visiting - that would indicate misleading or poor content. This, in fact, would be likely to demote the result on SERP (Search Engine Results Page).|$|E
25|$|Users {{were able}} to {{purchase}} and form clubs. There were four clubhouse designs available to purchase – the Basic Clubhouse, the Desert Haven, nDream's War Room Clubhouse, and the Crystal Seashores Clubhouse. Each club had a leader, who was the user that purchased the club. The leader could elect up to 4 sub-leaders and could have up to 32 members in total, including the owner. A user could only {{be a member of}} up to five clubs, including the club that the user may have been the leader of. Though the user could own multiple clubhouse designs, they could only be the leader of one club and decided which clubhouse design would be used as the meeting place for their club. In a similar way to personal spaces, the club's owner was able to set up and decorate a private clubhouse as a meeting point for club members, and the club members could enter the clubhouse at any time. The clubhouses also featured a notice board where the leader or sub-leaders could post messages and announcements to other members. Japan's Basic Clubhouse's video screen had the option to access a Home member's <b>page</b> <b>after</b> they had entered their PSN information. Users could block other users from being a member of their club. In addition to all the standard features of the clubhouses, the War Room Clubhouse helped club owners or sub-leaders get their message across during club meetings or discussions. It also included a special access point allowing users to teleport from the War Room to other set locations.|$|E
