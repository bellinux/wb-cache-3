40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} the issues of <b>purchase</b> <b>undertaking</b> in musharakah mutanaqisah home {{financing}} as practised by Islamic banks in Malaysia. This aim can only be achieved by analysing and examining its features {{in order to determine}} its inclination either towards shirkat al-milk (co-ownership) orshirkat al-'uqud (contractual partnership). On closer examination, the study also examines the legitimacy of first and second promises (wa'd) by the customer to gradually purchase the bank’s portion, and to give rights to the bank in the event of default: either to sell the bank’s portion in credit to the customer or to purchase the customer’s portion. The study applies the qualitative research method comprising document analysis and interviews with practitioners. The study shows that the home financing is a shirkat al-milk in its initial stage, but it cannot be considered permanently as shirkat al-milk as it does not comply with all the features of shirkat al-milk. The study also found that scholars were in dispute as to whether firstly, to allow a pre-determined price of the bank’s portion or share in the house and secondly, to stipulate a second promise in the event of default...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{issuances}} of sukuk {{were confronted}} with wide criticism from, both by Islamic scholars and investors. The {{part of the}} problems arise due to the agency relations in sukuk structures that have a distinctive nature with great complexity and various features. Due to the higher complexity of the responsibilities undertaken by the agent, greater exposure to agency costs results. This research aims to examine sukuk associated risks, agency costs and Sharia issues. Specifically, it analyses asset-backed sukuk structures from financial and Sharia viewpoints. This is achieved by adopting a case study strategy and inductive approach to examine the legal and financial issues arising in three different types of asset linked sukuk structures. The data is collected using content analyses of sukuk prospectuses, AAOIFI Sharia standards and publications issued by international agencies {{with the aim of}} enabling the study to achieve insights into the market. Furthermore, information is gathered from Sharia scholars using semi structured interviews to generate some specific information on the issues involved. The objectives of this study are to analyse three key issues: based on theoretical discussions identify the risks arising in securities in general and sukuk in particular; to carry out a comparative analysis of the principle/agent conflicts which arise in different cases of sukuk investment; and {{to determine the extent of}} adherence to Sharia rules. The dissertation discusses in depth the agency costs that arise in asset-backed sukuk structures. It determines how these costs are minimized and conflicts managed in the applications. Among the strategies and tools used to reduce agency costs is to apply the concept of co-ownership. Under this type of agreement between the originator and investors, the sukuk structure becomes more competitive and shows a better allocation of the risks. Although the issuance of sukuk are reviewed and approved by eminent scholars, they show different levels of contradictions with AAOIFI Sharia standards. The study identifies the status of different stipulations of different contracts in terms of Sharia requirements. The research then shows the extent to which the compatibility of the sukuk cases differ with key Sharia principles. The analysis found that the key requirements are mostly related to the guarantee, ownership, principle, return and maintenance costs. It found out that SEC sukuk are far away from the spirit of Sharia as most of the essential requirements are not fulfilled. Sadara sukuk show better harmonious with AAOIFI requirements because of their unprecedented feature involved in their structure, which highlighted some of the distinctive nature of sukuk. Zamzam sukuk achieved the best harmonious with Sharia among the three applications. This positive result is attributed to the real ownership to the investment, meaning that there is no guarantee for the principle or the return. The results show that there is a higher exposure to risks related to liquidity legality in sukuk cases than in conventional bonds. More importantly is that the credit risk in sukuk cases are higher than in bond investments. The three cases were more exposed to the credit risks since any loss in the assets has to influence both the distribution amounts and the <b>purchase</b> <b>undertaking.</b> The critical point found is that despite SEC and Sadara sukuk cases involve higher exposure to credit risk as required in Islamic finance, they do not provide in turn a recourse to the assets according to the concept of sukuk. The cases also show that the <b>purchase</b> <b>undertaking</b> solves the agency conflicts, caused by the originator being the servicer. The undertaking device has reduced the incentive asymmetries from different perspectives. ...|$|E
40|$|As shelter is one {{of basic}} needs for the human beings, the {{financing}} for housing need is also an essential need. Since individuals {{are not in a}} position to pay for their houses in one go, the availability of mortgage is an imperative in ensuring homeownership. Islamic mortgage as being the housing finance tool of Islamic banking and finance offers a home ownership for those who seek for halal alternative. There are indeed various type of instruments used as an underlying contract for Islamic mortgage, which comprise of debt based financing (murabaha, istisna’, ijarah, bay’bithaman ajil) and equity based financing (musharakah mutanaqisah). As the debt based products of Islamic mortgage are criticised for mimicking the conventional counterparts, the introduction of equity product of home financing based on musharakah mutanaqisah (MM home financing) is deemed to become a better alternative, which capable of fulfilling the true spirit of Shari’ah and overcome the shortcomings of debt based products. As MM based Islamic mortgage has just been in the Malaysian market for seven years, there are many issues surrounding its implementation. This study, therefore, aims to explore and critically analyse the supply and demands side issues related to MM home financing by paying particular attention to challenges and prospects of MM home financing in Malaysia. In particular, this study explores legal and Shari’ah related operational issues associated with the implementation of MM home financing and also examine the prospects of this product through customers’ perceptions and expectations. In achieving the aims, this study employed mixed method whereby the data obtained from the questionnaire survey and interviews. The sample size of the questionnaire survey is 260 respondents who have either Islamic or conventional mortgage and are from Klang Valley area of Malaysia. The interviews were conducted with 19 individuals who are actively involved in the implementation of MM home financing in Malaysia including Islamic bankers, Islamic economists, Shari’ah advisor and regulator. The interview finding revealed that besides several legal issues such as inadequate of legal framework, treatment in the event of default, non-standardised agreement, issue of ownership and Shari’ah issues such as use of <b>purchase</b> <b>undertaking</b> or wa’d, there are number of other issues involved in MM home financing. These include takaful and its maintenance, issue of rental benchmarking. All these together are believed to hinder and ‘pollute’ the MM home financing operation. The study also noted the problems that also arose from the banks and customers itself. The finding of the survey, also, revealed that the customers’ awareness on Islamic mortgage products is still very low, particularly for MM home financing. In addition, take-up reason for Islamic mortgage is mainly due to religious factor and non take-up reason is due to the price. However, it is very interesting to note that the majority of the respondents expected Islamic mortgage to be capable of safeguarding their interest. In other words, majority of the respondents expect Islamic mortgage could realise the inherent advantages associated in it which capable of serving the individual but also social interest. This factor is crucial to the Islamic banks, as this position seems generally agreed and expected by majority of the respondents. Therefore, capable of fulfilling this factor will ensure a promising future for MM home financing as the price for MM home financing is as competitive as the conventional counterparts making Islamic mortgage having extra advantages for the customers to opt for. Based on the findings of the study, several recommendations are also proposed in order to revive the soul and spirit of Shari’ah which ultimately portray the efficiency and effectiveness of Islamic finance particularly in dealing with home financing for the benefit of all the stake holders.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{illustrate}} the need for both upstream and downstream social marketing in relation to condom merchandising in the Vietnamese context. Design/methodology/approach: A mystery shopper audit of condom merchandising practices and retail outlets was undertaken {{in a number of}} locations throughout Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In addition to the audits, a series of depth interviews with retailers of condoms on barriers and facilitators for <b>purchase</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> Findings: The research highlighted some very interesting dynamics in relation to condom retailing in Vietnam. Condoms are not always made easy to purchase, through both the merchandising and other choices made by the retailers. While accessibility to condoms is no longer an issue in urban Vietnam considering the increase of condom retailing outlets, lack of easy access is highly problematic and may interfere with actual condom obtainment. As sex is still a taboo topic in Vietnam, this is a serious concern for social marketing in the sexual and reproductive health domain. Practical implications: Given the capacity to portray taboo topics in Vietnamese media context, social marketing will be challenging. The development of a social marketing strategy for macro-, meso and microlevels will be necessary for successful social marketing. Stigma associated with safe-sex practices and condom use may require a consideration of a social norms social marketing campaign. Originality/value: This research is {{the first of its kind}} in the Vietnamese context. While there are a large number of non-governmental organisations campaigning in the region, safe-sex practices and condom use within the general population remains a concern.
