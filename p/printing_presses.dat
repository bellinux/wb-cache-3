5|$|New Western Tower (or the Great Tower), {{built in}} 1544 and {{which served as}} a bastion. The tower {{contained}} one of the castle's <b>printing</b> <b>presses,</b> and also provided an artillery platform to cover the vast fields surrounding it. It was damaged in a severe storm in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed <b>printing</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|E

5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination. The government has previously tried {{to crack down on}} opposition papers before elections. In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the <b>Printing</b> <b>Presses</b> and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, {{although}} he had to back down from a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E
50|$|The Trinity Monastery was reconstructed by {{the famed}} Ukrainian {{architect}} Lazar Baranovych in 1649. In the neighbouring city of Novhorod-Siverskyi, Baranovych founded a <b>printing</b> <b>press,</b> which were rare at the time. He later transferred the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> to the Trinity Monastery. The monastery's adjacent <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> was famed for their production of engravings, and its library — for containing more than 11,000 books.|$|R
25|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> revolutionized communication and book production, leading {{to the spread of}} knowledge. Printing was rapidly spread from Germany by emigrating German printers, but also by foreign apprentices returning home. A <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> was built in Venice in 1469, and by 1500 the city had 417 printers. In 1470 Johann Heynlin set up a <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> in Paris. In 1473 Kasper Straube published the Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474 in Kraków. Dirk Martens set up a <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> in Aalst (Flanders) in 1473. He printed a book about the two lovers of Enea Piccolomini who became Pope Pius II. In 1476 a <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> was set up in England by William Caxton. The Italian Juan Pablos set up an imported press in Mexico City in 1539. The first <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> in Southeast Asia was set up in the Philippines by the Spanish in 1593. The Rev. Jose Glover intended to bring the first <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> to England's American colonies in 1638, but died on the voyage, so his widow, Elizabeth Harris Glover, established the printing house, which was run by Stephen Day and became The Cambridge Press.|$|R

5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|The {{two largest}} {{underground}} publishers were the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of Armia Krajowa and the Government Delegation for Poland. Tajne Wojskowe Zakłady Wydawnicze (Secret Military Publishing House) of Jerzy Rutkowski (subordinated to the Armia Krajowa) {{was probably the}} largest underground publisher in the world. In addition to Polish titles, Armia Krajowa also printed false German newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying German forces (as part of Action N). The majority of Polish underground presses were located in occupied Warsaw; until the Warsaw Uprising {{in the summer of}} 1944 the Germans found over 16underground <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> (whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps). The second largest center for Polish underground publishing was Kraków. There, writers and editors faced similar dangers: for example, almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper Na Ucho was arrested, and its chief editors were executed in Kraków on 27May 1944. (Na Ucho was the longest published Polish underground paper devoted to satire; 20issues were published starting in October 1943.) The underground press was supported by a large number of activists; in addition to the crews manning the <b>printing</b> <b>presses,</b> scores of underground couriers distributed the publications. According to some statistics, these couriers were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> {{industry}} {{position in}} the product life cycle is very important. This {{is to determine the}} right strategy for the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> in order to be exist and profitable. When we see the condition of the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> which is facing tough competition with internet-based media beside the uncertain challenge ahead, the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> industry is in the maturity phase. In this position is required precise product development strategy. The strategy can be done by creating new products with expands in a press online and by improving the quality, either by changes in product design or improvement of product quality print journalism...|$|R
50|$|Realising {{the need}} for a <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> to produce quality handbills and other materials, he {{promoted}} the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> (around 1916) that was located in a house near his theatre. He expanded the activities of the press by installing additional machinery, types and printing accessories in another building. Called Electric Printing Works, he used the cinema house's electric power plant to run the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> too and created history of sorts.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{task of the}} College was printing the Bible and other religious publications with its own <b>printing</b> <b>press.</b> In 1853, the first Chinese newspaper, The Chinese Serial, was published by the College's <b>printing</b> <b>press.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing <b>printing</b> <b>presses,</b> producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling {{for an end to the}} state monopoly on <b>printing</b> <b>presses.</b> The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. Its character was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding of <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 the <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> was {{established}} in the Abbey. It was the first <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> in Banja Luka and was in use until 1946, when the communist authorities prohibited its activities restricting so freedom of the press.|$|R

5|$|Under Moses Annenberg, The Inquirer turned around. Annenberg added new features, {{increased}} {{staff and}} held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 Inquirers weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During {{that same period}} the Records circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg's death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over. Not long after, in 1947, the Record {{went out of business}} and The Philadelphia Inquirer became Philadelphia's only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the Evening Bulletin, The Inquirer continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> for The Inquirer and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg's other properties, Seventeen and TV Guide. In 1957 Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Daily News and combined the Daily News facilities with The Inquirers.|$|E
