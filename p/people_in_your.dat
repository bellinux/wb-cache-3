Ochi was inspired to write the lyrics for the song after reading the scrift for the drama, and decided to sing about rebirth, around a mofit {{of the sun and}} the moon. Ochi described the song as being like a letter of thanks to important <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> lives. The song's release as a double A-side single was announced on June 21, 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire in My Heart" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Heartburn", a name which the group's singer Gruff Rhys felt was more poignant {{and gave the}} song [...] "a twist", but {{other members of the}} band were not happy with the title so the name was changed. Rhys has described the track as a country and western song which was written with absolute sincerity despite featuring clichéd lyrics. The song is [...] "soul advice" [...] and is about [...] "all kinds of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life". The track was recorded in the middle of 1998 at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, {{along with the rest of}} Guerrilla, and was produced by the Super Furry Animals. B-side [...] "The Matter of Time" [...] was considered for inclusion on Guerrilla, but the band felt the album would be too self-indulgent if the song were added to the record's track listing. The group instead opted to include the [...] "stupid" [...] song [...] "The Teacher", a decision which Rhys has called a decisive moment in the creation of the record.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise me. When you have got <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got a clue what it takes to get success".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's {{a lot of}} {{talk about}} negotiating distance from <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning what it means to be alone, learning what it means to be close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but there's also this great fear of being alone, and there's this constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' There's this need for space, but there's also this, 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|E

Other {{civilian}} awards {{included the}} Balzan Prize for promoting humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples (1978) and the Albert Schweitzer International Prize (1975). In April 1976 Teresa visited the University of Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania, where she received the La Storta Medal for Human Service from university president William J. Byron. She challenged {{an audience of}} 4,500 to [...] "know poor <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own home and local neighbourhood", feeding others or simply spreading joy and love, and continued: [...] "The poor will help us grow in sanctity, for they are Christ {{in the guise of}} distress". In August 1987 Teresa received an honorary doctor of social science degree, in recognition of her service and her ministry to help the destitute and sick, from the university. She spoke to over 4,000 students and members of the Diocese of Scranton about her service to the [...] "poorest of the poor", telling them to [...] "do small things with great love".|$|E
2500|$|Kurstin {{produced}} the eighth track, [...] "Let Your Tears Fall", which was co-written with Sia. It {{was the first}} song Clarkson recorded for Piece by Piece; she had recorded while still touring with Maroon 5. The song was finished just as Sia and Kurstin had completed work for 1000 Forms of Fear. Clarkson {{fell in love with}} the song's lyrical message of [...] "having that person in your life—or <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life—who can be a shoulder to cry on." [...] Co-writing with Clarkson, Kurstin also {{produced the}} ninth song, [...] "Tightrope". Originally penned as a simple piano ballad, Clarkson wrote the song about feelings people are unable to prove by themselves in a relationship; Kurstin added an orchestral element with its production. Produced by Halbert, the tenth track, [...] "War Paint", was written by Julia Michaels, Joleen Belle, and Sir Nolan. Clarkson described the song as a record about letting someone's guard down, saying: [...] "We build this wall but at our core we all want the same thing — you want to be loved, and you want to be a part of something." [...] Dan Rockett wrote the eleventh track, [...] "Dance with Me", which was produced by Kurstin. Although it was originally intended to be included on Greatest Hits – Chapter One (2012), Clarkson deemed the song too progressive to be included on it. Rockett also revealed that he imagined the track as a David Bowie/Lady Gaga duet when presenting the song to Polow da Don, who then pitched the song to Clarkson. Written by Justin Tranter, Ryland Blackinton, Dan Keyes, and Vaughn Oliver, the twelfth track, [...] "Nostalgic", was produced by Halbert. Clarkson recorded the song, an uptempo electronic rock song, as an ode to the 1980s. The closing track on the standard edition, [...] "Good Goes the Bye", was written by Shane McAnally and Natalie Hemby. Originally pitched as a country demo, Clarkson remarked that Halbert produced the record to resonate like a Eurythmics-style song. In addition, three tracks were included in the deluxe edition of the album. The fourteenth, [...] "Bad Reputation", written by Clarkson, Kelly Sheehan, Kurstin, and Bonnie McKee, was produced by Kurstin. The fifteenth track, [...] "In the Blue", was produced by Shatkin, who co-wrote it with Clarkson, Anjulie Persaud, and Fransisca Hall. Produced by Chris DeStefano, [...] "Second Wind" [...] closes the album as the final track, which he had co-written with McAnally and Maren Morris.|$|E

2500|$|By early 2002, the long-simmering {{feud with}} Martin {{came to a}} head. A {{particular}} concern that had badly strained relations between the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister by early 2002 was Martin's control of the Liberal Party apparatus, especially his control over the issuing of membership forms, which he reserved largely for his own supporters. In January 2002, Brian Tobin complained to Chrétien that the Liberal Party machinery had been [...] "captured" [...] by Martin's followers {{to the extent that}} it was now virtually impossible for anyone else to sign up their own followers. This posed a major problem for Chrétien as the Liberals were due to hold a leadership review in February 2003 and owing to Martin's control of the party machinery that it was quite possible that Chrétien would win by such a slim margin that it would be humiliating or even lose the leadership review. In January 2002, an incident occurred which was to greatly damage Chrétien's relations with the Liberal caucus. After Chrétien reorganized the Cabinet in late January 2002, the Liberal M.P. Carolyn Bennett criticised Chrétien at a caucus meeting for not appointing more women to the Cabinet. Chrétien exploded with rage at Bennett's criticism, saying that as a mere backbencher she did not have the right to criticise the Prime Minister in front of the caucus, and attacked her with such fury that Bennett collapsed in tears. Health Minister Anne McLellan recalled in an interview that: [...] "He just blew up. Right off the Richter scale!". Even after Bennett had broken in tears and was so distraught that she could no longer stand, Chrétien gave no mercy and continued to shout abuse at her, leading Intergovernmental Affairs minister Stéphane Dion to conclude that Chrétien wanted to stop his outburst, but was so angry at Bennett that he could not bring himself to do so. Bennett claimed that the Prime Minister's outburst was due to the influence of his communications director, Françoise Ducros, saying that [...] "Francie was probably telling him what a bitch I was" [...] in pressing for more female ministers (Ducros and Bennett were known to very much dislike each other). After the meeting had ended, much of the Grit caucus went over to offer support for Bennett while pointedly ignoring Chrétien while the same night Paul Martin and his wife took Bennett and her husband out to dinner at one of Ottawa's more expensive restaurants as consolation. The Liberal M.P. Bonnie Brown was one of the few MPs who defended Chrétien's tongue-lashing of Bennett, saying [...] "at every single cocktail party she was at, Carolyn Bennett was bad-mouthing the Prime Minister", suggested that Bennett only criticised Chrétien because he refused to appoint her to the Cabinet, and that [...] "You can't have <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> Cabinet who don't have respect. He's very big on respect". The Bennett incident convinced much of the Liberal caucus that Chrétien had become a power-crazed bully, and that it was time for the Liberals to have a new leader. Reflecting their displeasure with Chrétien, in early February 2002 the Liberal caucus elected as their chairman, the outspoken pro-Martin M.P. Stan Keyes (who had already openly mused in 2001 about how it was time for Chrétien to go), who defeated the pro-Chrétien M.P. Steve Mahoney. Chrétien had expected Mahoney to win, and was reported to be shocked when he learned of Keyes's victory, which now given Martin control of the caucus.|$|E
