5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E

5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them that they had to win the match in order to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, {{he was out of the}} group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{visual art}} has been {{dominated}} by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.|$|E

5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield a home field nor any players, coaches, or equipment. Harry March, who was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that convinced Mara to buy the team from the league, helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary. March guiding him through the team's early years, handling the personnel decisions. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring college stars such as Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and although he signed with the team, his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early portion of the season, until he got into shape, at which point he would play full games. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E

5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who was a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear to be a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
