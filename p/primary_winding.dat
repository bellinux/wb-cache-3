Eta Car is enshrouded by the dusty Homunculus nebula, which scatters light emitted by the central binary and provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study a massive binary system from different vantage points. We investigate the latitudinal and azimuthal dependence of Hα line profiles caused by the presence of a wind-wind collision (WWC) cavity created by the companion star. Using two-dimensional radiative transfer models, we find that the wind cavity can qualitatively explain the observed line profiles around apastron. Regions of the Homunculus which scatter light that propagated through the WWC cavity show weaker or no H alpha absorption. Regions scattering light that propagated through {{a significant portion of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>wind</b> show stronger P Cygni absorption. Our models overestimate the H alpha absorption formed in the <b>primary</b> <b>wind,</b> which we attribute to photoionization by the companion, not presently included in the models. We can qualitatively explain the latitudinal changes that occur during periastron, shedding light on the nature of Eta Car's spectroscopic events. Our models support the idea that during the brief period of time around periastron when the <b>primary</b> <b>wind</b> flows unimpeded toward the observer, H alpha absorption occurs in directions toward the central object and Homunculus SE pole, but not toward equatorial regions close to the Weigelt blobs.

A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level.

This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

Most X-ray emission in the 2 - 10 band results from the shocked secondary stellar wind. The observed rise in X-ray luminosity just before minimum is due to increase in density and subsequent decrease in radiative cooling time of the shocked fast secondary wind.
