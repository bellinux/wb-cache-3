25|$|A {{number of}} antiemetics are {{effective}} and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), and phenothiazines (such as <b>promethazine).</b> With respect to effectiveness, {{it is unknown}} if one is superior to another for improving nausea or vomiting. Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pharmacological}} treatments {{which are}} effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions {{may not be}} effective for motion sickness. For example, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This {{is due to the}} physiology of the CNS vomiting centre and its inputs from the chemoreceptor trigger zone versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as <b>promethazine</b> work quite well for motion sickness, although they can cause significant drowsiness.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, <b>promethazine,</b> selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and <b>promethazine.</b> These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E

2500|$|Codeine is also {{available}} {{in conjunction with the}} anti-nausea medication <b>promethazine</b> {{in the form of a}} syrup. Brand named as Phenergan with Codeine or in generic form as <b>promethazine</b> with codeine. In the 1990s it started to be used as a recreational drug and was called [...] 'syrup', 'lean', or 'purple drank'. Rapper Pimp C, from the group UGK, died from an overdose of this combination.|$|E
2500|$|Over-the-counter and {{prescription}} medications are readily available, such as Dramamine/Gravol (dimenhydrinate), scopolamine, Bonine/Antivert (meclizine), <b>promethazine,</b> cyclizine, and Stugeron (cinnarizine). Cinnarizine {{is not available}} in the United States, as it is not approved by the FDA. As these medications often have side effects, anyone involved in high-risk activities while at sea (such as SCUBA divers) must evaluate the risks versus the benefits. <b>Promethazine</b> is especially known to cause drowsiness, which is often counteracted by ephedrine in a combination known as [...] "the Coast Guard cocktail.". There are special considerations {{to be aware of}} when the common anti-motion sickness medications are used in the military setting where performance must be maintained at a high level.|$|E
2500|$|Itching and {{flushing}} {{and other}} effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release {{in response to}} the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. [...] First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine <b>promethazine</b> (Phenergan) may also {{have a positive effect on}} hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of <b>promethazine</b> may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs {{that have}} been {{introduced}} for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management. [...] Both first-generation (such as amitriptyline) and newer anti-depressants (such as duloxetine) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems. [...] Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using hydroxyzine, <b>promethazine,</b> carisoprodol, or tripelennamine to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, the French {{pharmaceutical}} company Laboratoires Rhône-Poulenc began {{to search for}} new anti-histamines. [...] In 1947, it synthesized <b>promethazine,</b> a phenothiazine derivative, which {{was found to have}} more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs. A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used <b>promethazine</b> together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing [...] "artificial hibernation", and described this state as [...] "sedation without narcosis". He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties. In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine. Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to aversive stimuli in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as [...] "Laborit's drug", chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rhône-Poulenc and given the trade name Largactil, derived from large [...] "broad" [...] and acti* [...] "activity.|$|E
2500|$|Adaptation to {{weightlessness}} involves {{not just}} the Sensory-motor coupling functions, but some autonomic nervous system functions as well. Sleep disorders and orthostatic intolerance are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no hydrostatic pressure in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect muscle viscosity and compliance. An increase in intracranial pressure may also be responsible for a decrease in near visual acuity. In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease {{as a result of}} the reduced loading in weightlessness. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience space motion sickness to some degree during the first days. [...] The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness, such as scopolamine and <b>promethazine,</b> have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic fatigue. The challenge of integrative space medicine and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are connected and interact with each other.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also {{alleges that}} Gosnell's former office staff at Family and Women's Medical Society (WMS) ran a {{prescription}} [...] "pill mill." [...] From June 2008 through February 18, 2010, Gosnell allegedly {{engaged in a}} continuing criminal enterprise by writing and dispensing fraudulent prescriptions for thousands of pills of the frequently-abused tablets OxyContin, Percocet, and Xanax, and the frequently-abused syrups Phenergan and <b>Promethazine</b> with Codeine. [...] Authorities further allege that Gosnell and his staff allowed customers to purchase multiple prescriptions under multiple names. For the first office visit, Gosnell allegedly charged $115, but that increased around December 2009 when he allegedly increased the initial office visit fee to $150. Staff at the clinic went from writing several hundred prescriptions for controlled substances per month filled at pharmacies in 2008 to over 2,300 filled at pharmacies in January 2010. [...] Gosnell, {{with the assistance of}} his staff, is said to have distributed and dispensed more than 500,000 pills containing oxycodone; more than 400,000 pills containing alprazolam; and more than 19,000 ounces of cough syrup containing codeine.|$|E
