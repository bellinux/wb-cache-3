A model sequence, :formula: (see text), is compatible with the properties of all known promoter and operator mutations, predicts base positions for the initiation of RNA synthesis coinciding with those determined experimentally, is compatible with current models for the regulation of transcription, suggests that RNA polymerase could recognize the DNA double helix firstly in the B conformation then in the A...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a 1132 bp {{sequence of the}} cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa containing the rpl 3 gene. This gene, which is not chloroplast encoded in plants, {{is the first of}} a long cyanelle ribosomal operon whose organization resembles that of the S 10 operon of E. coli. We have shown that the rpl 3 gene is transcribed in cyanelles as a 7500 nucleotide precursor and that the 5 '-end of the mRNA starts approximately 90 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon. However, no typical <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter</b> could be found for this gene. We have detected, using anti E. coli L 3 antibodies, the cyanelle L 3 protein in cyanelle extracts and in E. coli cells transformed with the cyanelle rpl 3 gene...|$|E
40|$|The {{promoter}} and the amino-terminal {{region of}} phoA, the structural gene for alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli K 12, was cloned {{by using a}} promoter cloning vector pMC 1403. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment has been determined. A sequence encoding the amino-terminal portion of mature alkaline phosphatase is found and it is preceded by a sequence encoding the signal peptide. The signal peptide consists of 21 amino acids; Met-Lys-Gln-Ser-Thr-Ile-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu-Phe-Thr-Pro-Val-Thr-Lys-Ala. The translation initiation codon is GUG, which is preceded by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence GGAG. Upstream to these sequences, there is a typical <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter.</b> TATAGTC for the Pribnow box. Around the Pribnow box, there are several dyad symmetrical sequences, which may probably be concerned with the regulation of this gene...|$|E

The AIS possesses an adaptive learning mechanism which enables antibodies to emerge which can be used for classification tasks. In this paper, we describe how the AIS has been used to evolve antibodies which can classify promoter containing and promoter negative DNA sequences. The DNA sequences used for teaching were 57 nucleotides in length and contained <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters.</b> The system classified previously unseen DNA sequences with an accuracy of approximately 90 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|Specific binding {{sites of}} BAL 31 RNA {{polymerase}} on PM 2 DNA have been mapped by protection against HincII and HindIII cleavage and by observation of enzyme-DNA complexes by electron microscopy. Nine specific binding sites were observed at map units 0. 19, 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 54, 0. 63, 0. 65, 0. 71, 0. 72, and 0. 75 {{by the first}} method. All these sites were confirmed by electron microscopy which, in addition, revealed another site at 0. 05 map unit. Published nucleotide sequences of the region surrounding sites at 0. 71 and 0. 75 map units show the presence of consensus sequences for <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{mechanism}} by which 5 '-flanking sequences modulate the in vitro transcription of eucaryotic tRNA genes. Using deletion and linker substitution mutagenesis, {{we have found that}} the 5 '-flanking sequences responsible for the different in vitro transcription levels of three Drosophila tRNA 5 Asn genes are contained within a discrete region centered 22 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site. In conjunction with the A-box intragenic control region, this upstream transcription-modulatory region functions in the selection mechanism for the site of transcription initiation. Since the transcription-modulatory region directs the position of the start site and the actual sequence of the transcription-modulatory region determines the level of tRNAAsn gene transcription, the possibility is raised that the transcription-modulatory region directs a transcription initiation event similar to open complex formation at <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters...</b>|$|R
40|$|The metY-nusA-infB operon of Escherichia coli encodes {{functions}} {{involved in}} both transcription and translation. Previous studies {{have identified a}} single promoter, P 0, that directs transcription of the entire operon. We have identified a second promoter, P- 1, that also is positioned to transcribe the complete operon. P- 1 is located 50 base pairs upstream of and oriented {{in the same direction}} as P 0. Sequences associated with P- 1 have features suggestive of regulatory elements. P- 1 differs from any previously described naturally occurring E. coli promoter by having - 35 and - 10 sequences that perfectly match the <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter</b> consensus hexamer sequences, although the spacing between the two elements is 1 base pair more than optimal. We demonstrate that P- 1 is active in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a search}} in the {{respective}} literature this study summarizes the promoters used in transgenic assays. They are categorized into viral, bacterial and plant promoters (table 1 - 4). The tables {{can be used}} as a reference list, containing (i) presently used promoters in plant transformations and (ii) information on features and effects influencing the specificity of the promoters. The most frequently used <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter</b> is derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). Often a promoter fragment length of 800 bp or 420 bp and seldom of 900 bp or 250 bp was used, the minimal promoter is 50 bp or 100 bp long. In summary it can be stated that this promoter is not able to confer tissue and developmental stage specificity. Furthermore, environmental influences are also not mediated by this promoter but by the transgene itself. The CaMV promoter therefore is categorized as unsensitive regarding these three parameters. The same is true for the TEV and the 34 S promoter from FMV, while other viral promoters (SCBV, CsVMV and RTBV) exhibit tissue specificity. (orig.)

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{directed against}} the major Borrelia burgdorferi flagellar protein, the 41 -kilodalton (kDa) protein flagellin, were used to monitor cloning and expression of the flagellin gene from a Borrelia burgdorferi genomic library. The structure of the gene was analyzed, and recombinant nonfusion flagellin was produced in Escherichia coli. A DNA sequence analysis of the 41 -kDa flagellin gene revealed {{the presence of an}} open reading frame that encoded a protein having 336 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 35. 8 kDa, indicating that there was posttranslational modification of the natural 41 -kDa flagellin protein. Upstream from the AUG start codon sequence we identified motifs corresponding to consensus <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter</b> elements which could be utilized by the cloned flagellin gene when it was expressed in E. coli MC 1061. The deduced flagellin protein sequence exhibited high levels of homology to sequences of flagellin proteins from Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium. The levels of sequence similarity for the amino- and carboxy-terminal portions were about 65 and 56 %, respectively. DNA sequence information on the flagellin gene was used to design oligonucleotides for gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction method, and by using this method 0. 01 pg of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA could be detected. Our results provide a basis for further biochemical analysis of the 41 -kDa flagellin protein, investigation of the role of this protein in host-pathogen interactions, and development of a standardized reagent for diagnostic systems for Borrelia burgdorferi infections...|$|E
40|$|The catB and catC genes encode cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme I (EC 5. 5. 1. 1) and muconolactone {{isomerase}} (EC 5. 3. 3. 4), respectively. These enzymes {{are required}} for the dissimilation of benzoate to beta-ketoadipate by Pseudomonas putida and are under coordinate transcriptional regulation. By deletion analysis {{and the use of}} pKT 240 as a promoter probe vector, we located a single promoter region for the catBC operon upstream of catB. RNA-DNA hybridization studies, together with reverse transcriptase mapping, demonstrated that this promoter must be activated in the presence of an inducer molecule for effective transcription of the operon. In addition, the transcription initiation site was located 64 base pairs upstream of the catB initiation codon, and sequences upstream of - 43 were required for promoter function. The catBC promoter was compared with other positively regulated <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters</b> to identify possible consensus sequences...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} and determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1, 626 -base-pair fragment from R-plasmid R 483 which encodes a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment revealed {{the presence of}} two open reading frames, each sufficient to encode polypeptides of approximately 17, 000 daltons. Both open regions are preceded by sequences conforming closely to the canonical description of <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters.</b> A 490 -base-pair HpaI fragment spanning one of the potential coding regions was inserted into a plasmid vector under the transcriptional control of the trp promoter. Cells transformed with this plasmid were trimethoprim resistant and produced dihydrofolate reductase activity which in vitro was resistant to moderate levels of trimethoprim. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein indicated that the R 483 -encoded trimethoprim-resistant enzyme was distantly related to the trimethoprim-sensitive bacterial homologs. The conserved amino acids were localized primarily to {{the region of the}} enzyme previously shown to comprise the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrated}} previously {{that the}} 0. 4 -kilobase DNA fragment from Micromonospora echinospora contains multiple tandem promoters, P 1 a, P 1 b, P 1 c, and P 2, {{which are also}} functional when cloned into Streptomyces lividans. We now show by in vitro transcription with Streptomyces RNA polymerase {{that each of these}} promoters is an authentic initiation site, rather than a processing site for transcripts which initiate further upstream. The DNA sequence requirements for the closely spaced promoters P 1 a, P 1 b, and P 1 c, which are coordinately induced during stationary phase in M. echinospora, were examined by deletional analysis in S. lividans. The P 1 a and P 1 b promoters were functional despite deletion of native sequences 5 and 17 base pairs upstream of each initiation site, respectively. Thus, P 1 a and P 1 b had greatly reduced upstream DNA sequence requirements compared with typical <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters.</b> In contrast, transcription from promoter P 1 c was significantly decreased when native sequences 34 base pairs upstream were replaced...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} plasmids, {{containing}} maize transposable element Activator (Ac), has been constructed. These constructs {{have been introduced}} into tobacco and soybean via Agrobacterium- mediated transformation to study the basic problems of Ac transposition, and plant cell lineages;An Ac element between a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and a bacterial [beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene inactivates the reporter gene, and restores the reporter gene after its excision. Each sector histochemically stained arises from a single cell in which excision of the Ac element has restored GUS gene activity. Phloem and phloem parenchyma cells within vascular tissue of transgenic tobacco seedlings were analyzed using this system. Ac was introduced into the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) 2 ̆ 7 Peking 2 ̆ 7 cultivar, and shown {{to be capable of}} transposition. Transposition was detected using GUS gene expression as a reporter and southern blot analysis of Ac sequences. The frequency of Ac transposition in soybean was shown to be similar to the frequency observed in other species;A set of artificially defective Ac elements was constructed and used for characterization of terminal sequences of the element using in vitro mutagenesis. Both 5 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 and 3 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 ends of Ac element were found to contain <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoter</b> activity. The 3 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 end was shown to have a functional origin of DNA replication (ARS function) when it was introduced into yeast cells. In addition, the 3 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 end contains dnaA protein binding sites which was shown to function as a transcription terminator in transgenic tobacco cells similar to that of procaryotes. Complementary analysis of in vitro deletion mutants of the defective Ac element shows that a minimal sequence of 71 -bp, plus a short internal sequence at 3 [superscript] 2 ̆ 7 end of the element are required for transposition. This suggests two domains involved in transposition: the first corresponds to the transposase-binding sites; and the second possibly corresponds to cellular protein factors. Evidence is presented that promoter activity identified {{at both ends of the}} element may correlate with transposition, and that dnaA protein binding sites, as well as ARS sequences may correlate with regulation of transposition frequency...|$|E
40|$|Human {{mitochondrial}} DNA is transcribed {{from two}} distinct, strand-specific promoters {{located in the}} displacement loop region of the genome. The transcriptional control sequences identified by deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies span short regions surrounding the initiation sites and bear no obvious sequence homology to any nuclear or <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters.</b> In vitro transcription analyses also revealed several minor initiation sites that are characterized by a pyrimidine-rich region followed by a purine-rich region, a feature that is shared by the two major promoters. In this paper, we report {{a new class of}} minor promoters in human mitochondrial DNA. These minor promoters were localized to the same duplex DNA sequences that direct major transcriptional events, but they had transcriptional polarity opposite to that of the major promoters. Furthermore, nucleotide changes that affected the major form of transcription similarly affected transcription in the opposite direction. For one of these minor promoters, a corresponding in vivo RNA species initiating from the same site was identified. These observations indicate that the major transcriptional promoters in human mitochondria can function bidirectionally both in vivo and in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The {{nitrogen}} fixation promoters of Klebsiella pneumoniae are atypical <b>procaryotic</b> <b>promoters</b> lacking the usual - 10 and - 35 elements, requiring instead conserved sequences around - 12 and - 24 for transcriptional activation. By constructing {{a set of}} five deletions between the - 12 and - 24 elements in the nifH promoter, the spacing between the conserved GC and GG motifs at - 12 and - 24, respectively, has been reduced from the wild-type 10 bases to 9, 8, 6, 5, and 4 bases. The deletion of a single nonconserved nucleotide was sufficient to eliminate transcriptional activation by either nifA or ntrC (glnG). All deletions relieved the multicopy inhibition of chromosomal nif expression normally shown by the nifH promoter. These results demonstrate a stringent requirement for the 10 -base spacing found in ntr-activated promoters. In addition, specific sequences around the invariant GG at - 24 were shown to be necessary for activation by either nifA or ntrC, with a minimal requirement for nucleotides through to position - 27 for this activation...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role played}} by DNA promoters as dynamical activators of transport processes of the RNA polymerase along DNA macromolecules, by introducing an effective potential for the kink of a discrete sine-Gordon chain. At any given moment of its life, a cell of a living organism does not express the totality of its genes (the whole genoma of the organism) but only the genes that are needed for its functioning. This is a consequence of a complicated controlling process which involves specific proteins (RNA polymerase) which selectively bind to specific DNA sequences called promoters, which determine both the site and the frequency of transcription initiation of the genes they control. In <b>procaryotic</b> cells <b>promoters</b> and genes are almost contiguous (with the gene located downstream of it), while in eucaryotic cells the promote...|$|R
