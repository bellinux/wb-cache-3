During excavation of the bench, additional loads will be imposed onto the vault lining due to ground displacements. In order to minimise the number of ties, the previously completed linings of the PX 14 and PX 16 access shafts will be used to support some of the load. Three-dimensional modelling has been undertaken to design the structures and determine the expected behaviour of this complex support system.

40|$|The South African housing {{programme}} is acclaimed internationally and has achieved important successes {{since its inception}} in 1994. However, there are also concerns about its negative impacts. The ambiguity of this achievement is underlined when the programme is viewed from different perspectives. To consider the complex picture of positive and negative outcomes, this paper takes the viewpoints of the nation, the city and the household and reveals a range of problems that suggest the need to reform the {{housing programme}}. It then uses these three viewpoints to reveal the constraints that hold back reform. The paper argues {{that it is necessary to}} understand the 'competing rationalities' reflected in the three viewpoints. Although this is not the only factor holding back fundamental transformation, recognising it does help to explain the persistence of significant problems in the housing programme.

40|$|Recently the Master <b>Constraint</b> <b>Programme</b> for Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) was {{proposed}} as a classically equivalent way {{to impose the}} infinite number of Wheeler – DeWitt constraint equations {{in terms of a}} single Master Equation. While the proposal has some promising abstract features, it was until now barely tested in known models. In this series of five papers we fill this gap, thereby adding confidence to the proposal. We consider a wide range of models with increasingly more complicated constraint algebras, beginning with a finite dimensional, Abelean algebra of constraint operators which are linear in the momenta and ending with an infinite dimensional, non-Abelean algebra of constraint operators which closes with structure functions only and which are not even polynomial in the momenta. In all these models we apply the Master <b>Constraint</b> <b>Programme</b> successfully, however, the full flexibility of the method must be exploited in order to complete our task. This shows that the Master <b>Constraint</b> <b>Programme</b> has a wide range of applicability but that there are many, physically interesting subtleties that must be taken care of in doing so.

40|$|An 8 · 2 m diameter, 37 · 5 m deep shaft {{has been}} {{successfully}} constructed from within {{the basement of a}} new development, Moorhouse, near Moorgate in the City of London. <b>Programme</b> <b>constraints</b> led to the shaft being constructed after completion of the foundations, basements and most of the superstructure for the development.

The depth of the shaft is such that it penetrates through stiff London Clay and is founded {{at the bottom of the}} Lambeth Group. The paper describes the contingency measures to deal with potentially difficult ground conditions, including the water-bearing layers of the Lambeth Group. The construction processes included a complex temporary works dewatering system around the shaft, with the option to carry out additional dewatering from within the shaft during excavation. Provision was also made for radial grouting to ‘restress’ the ground, to prevent long-term settlement of the Moorhouse piles, should the need arise.

40|$|The {{title of}} the present volume is {{somewhat}} misleading, {{as the focus of}} the various contributions is almost exclusively on French and German literature. An introductory article claims that <b>programme</b> <b>constraints</b> precluded adequate coverage of Mesmerism in other continental and in Anglo-Saxon literatures. Any conference organizer would sympathize, but one wonders whether some of the fifteen essays in this collection might not have been sacrificed (or severely edited) to facilitate the broader perspective, if, as is implied, there were more proposals on other literatures. So what advantage has been gained from depth of coverage? The tome opens with an account by Bertrand Meheust of what Mesmerism was (or what authors understood it to be) and of its intellectual roots. This will prove invaluable to the uninitiated. The collection closes with two studies by Sonja Vanderlinden and Jean Dierkens that set Mesmerism in a durable tradition of faith in alternative remedies. The latter considers how justified modern Western medical science is in equating Mesmerism's techniques with quackery. He notes that hypnosis has acquired a certain respectability in the treatment of psychosomatic illness. The sceptic is less likely to be won over by the case made for taking seriously the relevance of astrology to medicine. Between these bookends there are surveys of Mesmerism in German and French literature of the early nineteenth century (Jurgen Barkhoff, Tanguy Loge), analysis of contemporary accounts of seances (Roland Mortier, Bettina Gruber), essays on Mesmerism and Goethe and E. T. A. Hoffmann (Lauren van Eynde), Kleist (Hans-Jurgen Schrader), Jung-Stilling, Kerner, Schelling, and Schopenhauer (Leonardy), Immermann (Hubert Roland), Bellini (Marie-France Renard), Nerval (Michel Brix), Balzac and Dumas pere (Georges Jacques), and Flaubert (Claudine Gothot-Mersch). A number of these contributions are rather descriptive, listing references to Mesmerism in the works of the author in question, usually nuanced by some indication of scepticism concerning its efficacy; these are often attributed to some Romantic interest in the mysterious, the paranormal. Most will be of interest primarily to specialists on the particular authors. Brix and Schrader may prove of more general relevance. The former explores the influence of Neoplatonistic mysticism on contemporary European culture and points out that Nerval's reflections on madness, informed by his travels in the east, in some ways anticipate Foucault in their awareness that it is a culturally determined concept. Schrader challenges what he sees as an over-comfortable perception of Kleist as a modern writer, situating him instead in a pre-modern intellectual world...|$|R

The presence of female teachers is recognised as one factor positively impacting on girls’ enrolment and learning success but in many rural areas in Malawi there are few qualified female teachers working in primary or secondary schools. This paper contributes to the current debates on how to address this gap in qualified female teacher recruitment and retention in rural areas. We suggest one solution to break the cycle of low female achievement in rural areas is through use of distance education to prepare local women to take on teaching roles within their own communities. In the programme reported here aspiring female teachers are supported to take on the role of ‘learning assistants’ in their local community primary school whilst studying to achieve the qualifications necessary for application to a formal primary teacher training course.
