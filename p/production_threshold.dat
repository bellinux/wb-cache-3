At high energies (above a few MeV, below which photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are dominant), photons interact with matter primarily via pair production [...] - [...] that is, they convert into an electron-positron pair, interacting with an atomic nucleus or electron {{in order to}} conserve momentum. High-energy electrons and positrons primarily emit photons, a process called bremsstrahlung. These two processes (pair production and bremsstrahlung) continues until photons fall below the pair <b>production</b> <b>threshold,</b> and energy losses of electrons other than bremsstrahlung start to dominate.The characteristic amount of matter traversed for these related interactions is called the radiation length [...] Which is both the mean distance over which a high-energy electron loses all but 1/e of its energy by bremsstrahlung and 7/9 of the mean free path for pair production by a high energy photon.

5000|$|In 2011-12, the LHC {{discovered}} a Higgs boson {{with a mass}} of about 125 GeV, and with couplings to fermions and bosons which {{are consistent with the}} Standard Model. The MSSM predicts that the mass of the lightest Higgs boson should not be much higher than the mass of the Z boson, and, in the absence of fine tuning (with the supersymmetry breaking scale on the order of 1 TeV), should not exceed 135 GeV. The LHC result seemed problematic for the minimal supersymmetric model, as the value of 125 GeV is relatively large for the model and can only be achieved with large radiative loop corrections from top squarks, which many theorists had considered to be [...] "unnatural" [...] (see naturalness and fine tuning). The naturalness crisis turned out to be premature in that one set of naturalness calculations were performed in multi-parameter effective theories which didn't allow for intrinsic cancellations which must occur in a more fundamental theory. Other calculations, indicating the need for light top squarks, neglected terms in the renormalization group equations that could lead to radiatively-driven naturalness (wherein radiative corrections drive certain SUSY breaking terms from unnatural high scale values to natural values at the weak scale). It is now understood that top squarks can range up to 3 TeV and gluinos up to 5 TeV with little cost to naturalness so that LHC searches have only begun to explore the natural SUSY parameter space. On the other hand, it is also understood that higgsinos, the superpartners of Higgs bosons, are required to lie between 100-300 GeV, the closer to 100 GeV the better. Such light higgsinos are difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to see at LHC. However, they would easily be seen at an e+e- collider operating at energies above higgsino pair <b>production</b> <b>threshold</b> (such as the International Linear Collider, or ILC, proposed for construction in Japan).|$|E

40|$|Humans {{have the}} {{abilities}} to perceive, produce, and synchronize with a musical beat, {{yet there are}} widespread individual differences. To investigate these abilities and {{to determine if a}} dissociation between beat perception and production exists, we developed the Harvard Beat Assessment Test (H-BAT), a new battery that assesses beat perception and production abilities. H-BAT consists of four subtests: 1) music tapping test (MTT), 2) beat saliency test (BST), 3) beat interval test (BIT), and 4) beat finding and interval test (BFIT). MTT measures the degree of tapping synchronization with the beat of music, whereas BST, BIT, and BFIT measure perception and <b>production</b> <b>thresholds</b> via psychophysical adaptive stair-case methods. We administered the H-BAT on thirty individuals and investigated the performance distribution across these individuals in each subtest. There was a wide distribution in individual abilities to tap in synchrony with the beat of music during the MTT. The degree of synchronization consistency was negatively correlated with thresholds in the BST, BIT, and BFIT: a lower degree of synchronization was associated with higher perception and <b>production</b> <b>thresholds.</b> H-BAT can be a useful tool in determining an individual’s ability to perceive and produce a beat within a single session...|$|R
