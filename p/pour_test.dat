40|$|The Rudin, NIBEM, lacing index, {{cylinder}} pour {{and shake}} foam quality tests were comprehensively compared {{to evaluate their}} utility and responsiveness to beer components that are regarded to influence foam quality. It was found {{that each of the}} tests responded differentially to beer characteristics that influence beer foam quality. The Rudin and shake tests were found to respond positively to the level and content of foam promoting proteins (i. e., protein Z 4) and also to the level of isomerised hop-a-acids in beer. However, the shake test did not differentiate between isomerised and hydrogenated hop-a-acids while the Rudin test did. Lacing index was found to respond positively to isomerised hop acids, hydrogenated in particular, but negatively to alcohol. Hydrogenation of hop acids and protein Z 4 increased foam stability as measured by the cylinder <b>pour</b> <b>test</b> while alcohol, higher pH and CO 2 level tended to reduce foam stability. A positive association was not observed with the level of isomerised hop acid, but further investigation is required to clarify this. Finally, the NIBEM test results were influenced positively by the level of isomerised hop acids and protein Z 4, while negatively correlated with viscosity and final gravity. Hop acid hydrogenation substantially improved NIBEM foam stability compared to isomerised hop acids. The NIBEM test was positively correlated with the Rudin, cylinder pour, lacing index and shake (foam quality generated) tests. These comparisons and observations suggest how these foam quality evaluation tests may be best used for quality control/assurance and beverage development...|$|E
40|$|Saltstone Disposal Unit 2 {{contains}} a sheet drain fabric intended to separate solids from drain water {{to be returned}} to the Salt Feed Tank. A similar system installed in Vault 4 appears to be ineffective in keeping solids out of the drain water return lines. Waste Solidification Engineering is considering installation of an additional fabric membrane to supplement the existing sheet drain in SDU 2. Amerdrain 200 is the product currently installed in SDU 2. This product is no longer available, so Sitedrain 94 was used as the replacement product in this testing. Fabrics with apparent opening sizes of 10, 25, 50 and 100 microns were evaluated. These fabrics were evaluated under three separate test conditions, a water flow test, a solids retention test and a grout <b>pour</b> <b>test.</b> A flow test with water showed that installation of an additional filter layer will predictably reduce the theoretical flux through the sheet drain. The manufacturer reports the flux for Sitedrain 94 as 150 gpm/ft{sup 2 } by ASTM D- 4491. This compares reasonably well with the 117 gpm/ft{sup 2 } obtained in this testing. A combination of the 10 micron fabric with Sitedrain 94 could be expected to decrease flux by about 10 times as compared to Sitedrain 94 alone. The different media were used to filter a slag and fly ash mixture from water. Slag historically has the smallest nominal particle size of the premix components. Cement was omitted from the test because of its reactivity with water would prohibit accurately particle size measurements of the filtered samples. All four media sizes were able to remove greater than 95 % of particles larger than 100 microns from the slurry. The smaller opening sizes were increasingly effective in removing more particles. The 10 micron filter captured 15 % of the total amount of solids used in the test. This result implies that some insoluble particles may still be able to enter the drain water collection system, although the overall solids rejection is significantly improved over the current design. Test boxes were filled with grout to evaluate the performance of the sheet drain and fabrics in a simulated vault environment. All of the tests produced a similar amount of drain water, between 8 - 11 % of the amount of water in the mix, which is expected with the targeted formulation. All of the collected drain waters contained some amount of solids, although the 10 micron filter did not appear to allow any premix materials to pass through. The solids collected from this box are believed to consist of calcium carbonate based on one ICP-AES measurement. Any of the four candidate fabrics would be an improvement over the sheet drain alone relative to solids removal. The 10 micron fabric is the only candidate that stopped all premix material from passing. The 10 micron fabric will also cause the largest decrease in flux. This decrease in flux was not enough to inhibit the total amount of drain water removed, but may lead to increased time to remove standing water prior to subsequent pours in the facility. The acceptability of reduced liquid flux through the 10 micron fabric will depend on the amount of excess water to be removed, the time available for water removal and the total area of fabric installed at the disposal cell...|$|E

The Tobias tool has been developed during the thesis to help to the testing schemas generation, to unfold them in abstract test cases, and then to concretise these test cases. The second contribution of our work aims to restrain the problem of combinatorial explosion of the tests number, relative to the principles of the language of tests schema. So, we propose various techniques, rst to control the number of generated tests and then to optimize the execution time of these tests. We have integrated these various techniques into the Tobias tool and realized two case studies that validate our work.

This study aimed to use the three shape descriptors available in the literature to describe the shapes of six compounds, and evaluate whether angle of repose might predict the flowability of a powder sample {{the same as those}} made by compressibility index and Hausner ratio. Images of cephalexin monohydrate, niacin, nystatin, sodium chloride, rifampin, triclosan were taken by a Raman Microscopy. Since the existing particle shape system could not characterize all six compounds, a new system is proposed. The powders of Rifampin and hydralazine hydrochloride were found to possess bimodal distribution during the study. Compressibility index and Hausner ratio predicted rifampin as poorly flowable, and predicted hydralazine hydrochloride as fairly flowable. But when either powder was <b>poured</b> through a <b>test</b> funnel, a dome formed {{in the middle of the}} horizontal base instead of the expected cone-like pile. This led to the question as to how the angles of repose should be measured. Our suggestion is that the angle of repose of a bimodal particle distribution powder be considered from the dome base in addition to the traditional approach, from the horizontal base, to avoid false prediction of flowability. Key words: Bimodal particle distribution, flowability, hydralazine hydrochloride, Rifampin. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1959 - 1961, {{subcritical}} hydronuclear safety {{experiments were}} conducted at Technical Area (TA) 49 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). These underground experiments were designed and conducted to investigate safety issues. Seventy hydronuclear safety, tracer, and containment test experiments {{were conducted in}} 1 -m or 2 -m diameter shafts at depths ranging between 9 m and 33 m. The subsurface radiological and metals inventory consists of about 40 kg of plutonium, 93 kg of uranium- 235, 170 kg of uranium- 238, 11 kg of beryllium, and possibly more than 90, 000 kg of lead. Explosives used in the experiments consisted largely of TNT, RDX, HMX, and barium nitrate. It is highly likely that the explosives, except for the barium component, were completely consumed by the detonations. Hydronuclear safety test shafts were drilled, test materials were placed {{at the bottom of}} the shafts, shafts were backfilled with sand or local crushed tuff, tests were detonated, subsidence in the shafts were backfilled, and cement caps were <b>poured</b> over the <b>test</b> shafts. The diameter of the affected detonation zones is believed to be less than 6 m. Most test shafts were drilled on an 8 -m grid spacing in four main areas within TA- 49...|$|R
30|$|Foam {{concrete}} mixtures {{were prepared}} at 1, 200 -kg/m 3 density by using stable foam concrete compositions, which were designed {{based on the}} investigation of Kearsley and Mostert (2005). Properties of the foam concrete were analyzed for density and compressive strength based on the standard testing methods for physical and mechanical properties (ASTM C 495 and ASTM C 39). Experiments showed that by using the theoretical design method of Kearsley and Mostert (2005), {{it is possible to}} predict the compressive strength and density for the concrete mixtures. Ordinary Portland Cement was used for the foam concrete mixtures. To prepare the foam, ultrafoam was used as the foaming agent and Quick-Gel (Baroid, Houston, TX, USA) as the viscosifier. These were mixed with water in the foam generator until the foam bubble size was uniform and stable (usually 2 min). Then, the foam was added to the cement matrix while stirring, with continual mixing for 1 to 2 min. When the mixture of foam and cement matrix was uniform, the prepared foam concrete was <b>poured</b> into the <b>test</b> mold with slight vibrations to fill up the mold completely. Specimens were demolded after 24 h and then moist cured in a standard curing room for a further 28 days in order to test the samples with a standard testing machine.|$|R
