The bands present below 800  cm− 1 were finger <b>print</b> <b>zone</b> of phosphate and sulfur functional groups and N-containing bioligands. The appearance of new peaks at 1431.37, 1736.09 and 2850.35 Cm− 1 was probably due to the modification of the surface functional groups by the interaction of Cd+ 2 ions. These band positions revealed the functional groups C=O carboxylic acid of amide, C=O carboxylic acid of alcohol and CH 2 stretching, respectively. The analysis of the FTIR spectra showed the presence of ionizable functional groups (i.e., carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino) that are able to interact with metal ions Cd+ 2.|$|R

40|$|The most {{realistic}} way {{to represent}} the topography of the Earth is by using a globe; this fact was known as early as in ancient Greece. The biggest contribution to the making of these reduced models of our planet was made by Gerardus Mercator, who split {{the surface of the}} globe into zones in the 16 th century This gave rise to a revolution in the development of cartography, which also sparked the beginning of the mass production of globes. The principle for the production of this instrument has remained the same to this day; {{the only difference is that}} the major part of the process is now automated. However, globes of individual countries are still quite unusual and rare; this is why we decided to take on the project of designing the globe of Slovenia, which was performed within the Cartography III study course at the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering. The making of the globe of Slovenia includes the production of a general map of the country at the scale of I: 1, 000, 000, the projection of a flat map on the globe and the pasting of <b>printed</b> <b>zones</b> on the supporting medium, in our case a table lamp...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel method for extracting {{handwritten}} and <b>printed</b> text <b>zones</b> from noisy document images with mixed content. We use Triple-Adjacent-Segment (TAS) based features which encode local shape characteristics of text in a consistent manner. We first construct two codebooks of the shape features extracted from a set of handwritten and printed text documents respectively. We then compute the normalized histogram of codewords for each segmented zone {{and use it to}} train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The codebook based approach is robust to the background noise present in the image and TAS features are invariant to translation, scale and rotation of text. In experiments, we show that a pixel-weighted zone classification accuracy of 98 % can be achieved for noisy Arabic documents. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for document page classification and show that a high precision can be achieved for the detection of machine printed documents. The proposed method is robust to the size of zones, which may contain text content at line or paragraph level...|$|R
50|$|By 1984, Steve Schanes {{decided to}} bring back 3-D to comics, a {{fleeting}} trend in the 1950s that had then been stymied by poor <b>printing</b> separations. Ray <b>Zone</b> was hired to do the production, after he had successfully converted a Kirby image for Honeycomb cereal. Steve Schanes decided the 3-D book would be Alien Worlds 3-D, featuring the first published work of Art Adams, alongside John Bolton, Bill Wray and others. Sales on the expensively-produced comic, however, were poor, and sales all round were following suit. One-shots became more common, and tolerable sales on Elric of Melniboné stumbled when First Comics acquired the rights, putting Pacific in the awkward position of continuing as distributor on a comic from a rival publisher that they had helped promote.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a method for {{classifying}} handwritten and <b>printed</b> Arabic text <b>zones</b> in noisy document images. We use Three-Adjacent-Segment (TAS) [8] based features which capture properties of a script. We construct two different codebooks of the local shape features extracted from a set of handwritten and printed Arabic documents {{and use it to}} train both Support Vector Machine and Fisher’s linear discriminant classifiers using normalized histograms. Due to robustness of TAS features to noise the proposed classification scheme is suitable for noisy document images where performance of other methods degrades drastically. Our experiments show that we can achieve 90 – 95 % classification accuracy. This method is also robust to segmentation results which may contain segments at word, line or paragraph level.

40|$|A {{low-cost}} paper-based {{microfluidic device}} (PAD) for the multiplex electrochemical determination of glucose, uric acid, and dopamine in biological fluids was developed. Using wax printing, PAD containing a central zone, six channels, and six detection zones was fabricated, and the electrodes were <b>printed</b> on detection <b>zones</b> using pre-made electrodes template. For each analyte, two detection zones were used. The carbon working electrode was coated with chitosan-BSA (and enzymes for glucose and uric acid). To detect glucose and uric acid, enzymatic reactions were employed. These reactions involve enzyme-catalyzed redox {{reactions of the}} analytes and produce free electrons for electrochemical measurement. Calibration curves were linear (R² > 0. 980) {{in the range of}} 0 - 80 mM for glucose, 0. 09 – 0. 9 mM for dopamine, and 0 – 50 mM for uric acid, respectively. Blood samples were successfully analyzed by the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{describes}} a device for electro-chemical {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) designed for low-resource settings and diagnostics {{at the point of}} care. The device is fabricated entirely in hydrophobic paper, produced by silanization of paper with decyl trichlorosilane, and comprises two zones separated by a central crease: an embossed microwell, on the surface of which the antigen or antibody immobilization and recognition events occur, and a detection zone where the electrodes are <b>printed.</b> The two <b>zones</b> are brought in contact by folding the device along this central crease; the analytical signal is recorded from the folded configuration. Two proof-of-concept applications, an electrochemical direct ELISA for the detection of rabbit IgG as a model antigen in buffer and an electrochemical sandwich ELISA for the detection of malarial histidine-rich protein from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf HRP 2) in spiked human serum, show the versatility of this device. The limit of detection of the electrochemical sandwich ELISA for the quantification of Pf HRP 2 in spiked human serum was 4 ng mL− 1 (102 pmol L− 1), a value within the range of clinically relevant concentrations...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{event in}} abscission is {{the breakdown of}} cell wall material in a discrete zone of cells known as the separation layer. Three dimensional images produced by viewing tissue <b>prints</b> of abscission <b>zones</b> on nitrocellulose (NC) membranes with incident illumination showed changes in the tissue integrity {{taking place in the}} separation layer as the process of abscission proceeded. The cell softening which occurs due to the dissolution of the cell wall appeared in the tissue prints as a diffuse line at the anatomical transition between the pulvinus and petiole and was easily observed on NC tissue prints of either longitudinal or serial cross-sections through abscission zones. In bean leaf abscission the dissolution of cell walls has been correlated with the appearance of a form of cellulase with an isoelectric point of pH 9. 5. Antibodies specific for this enzyme were used to study the localization of 9. 5 cellulase in the distal abscission zone of Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv Red Kidney after tissue printing on NC. It was found that 9. 5 cellulase was localized in the separation layer but also occurred in the vascular tissue of the adjacent pulvinus. No antibody binding was observed in nonabscising tissue or preimmune controls. These results confirm previous biochemical studies and demonstrate that immunostaining of nitrocellulose tissue prints is a fast and reliable method to localize proteins or enzymes in plant tissue...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{types and}} {{varieties}} of ball games exist. Several cultures have created forms of ball games. For example, the Maya and Aztec peoples played {{a ball game}} using a rubber ball. The Yanoama people in northwest Brazil played a game using a ball made from the bladder of a monkey, in which the ball would be hit upwards by participants, who would play the game in a circle. Bocce is typically played on a bocce court, and involves rolling a ball {{on the ground in}} efforts to place it near a smaller ball. Bowls involves rolling a ball toward a smaller target ball to make the rolled ball stop {{as close as possible to}} the target. Croquet involves hitting wooden or plastic with a mallet through a series of hoops. Croquet became popular in England in the 1860s. In the United States, the game is governed by the National Croquet Association, which coordinates annual tournaments. Several variations of the game exist. Pétanque is a form of bowls and boules where the goal is to throw hollow metal balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet (literally [...] "piglet") or jack, while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground. Pétanque has been described as [...] "the world's most played form of bowls." [...] Backyard golf is a game played in the United States that involves elements of golf. Golf balls or whiffle balls may be used, and targets may include lawn furniture, buckets and tree branches, among others. Sholf is a game that is a cross between table shuffleboard and golf.
