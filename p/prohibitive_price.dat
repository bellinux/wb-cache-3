5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its <b>prohibitive</b> <b>price</b> of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as ultramarine, and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with ultramarine blue was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, almost as a decorative glaze. The <b>prohibitive</b> <b>price</b> of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (azurite, smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E

Justin Davis of IGN criticized the episodic structure of the game however [...] "Players can't fully explore the game world until they're almost at the end – over 30 hours in!", however also praises the gameplay stating, [...] "What Dimensions lacks in scenario & story flexibility it makes up for with sheer depth and flexibility in its job system.

[...] Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the gameplay but criticized the lack of fanfare stating, [...] "Despite the fun job system and classic vibe to the combat, Dimensions seems like it was set up to fail. It released to little fanfare at a <b>prohibitive</b> <b>price</b> point for mobile games." [...] Tof Eklund of TouchArcade praised the games features stating, [...] "There's an epic, high fantasy plot with lots of twists, a large cast of characters whose appearance and abilities vary wildly, tons of random combat, lots of leveling-up and abilities to unlock, a gradual opening up of the world, secret items, bonus dungeons, and a lot of looking inside pots and barrels in order to pilfer the worldly goods of the townspeople you run across."

According to Chaudhury (1995), residential land values in Dhaka has increased more than thirty times during 1970 – 1980. Particularly, the land for housing in any available urban land in Dhaka {{has given rise to}} the soaring land prices during the last few decades and resulted in diminishing patches of empty lands within city limits. The unusual price increases had immensely facilitated the proliferation of land and housing development projects in periphery of Dhaka including the restricted areas (Fig.  4). The land price hike has also contributed to land speculations among buyers and developers. However, the <b>prohibitive</b> <b>prices</b> of land in Dhaka restrict the majority of population with low and middle income to have access to land markets.|$|R

40|$|The {{concepts}} of value and {{price and the}} connection between those categories are important problems of economic considerations and disputes, both {{with respect to the}} essence of those concepts as well as to their role in the economy. The present article offers an attempt to investigate basic views of the representatives of various schools of political economy, with the attention paid to those aspects which might prove useful from the viewpoint of the rational shaping of the economic processes. Starting from the theoretical system of the classic English economy, the considerations are focused on theoretical problems of value and price in both explanatory and evaluative approaches. In particular, the author tries to prove a gradual disappearance from economic theories of the process of linking together prices and value in view of particular conditions of carrying out economic activity and in effect, in view of particular economic policy both in Western and Marxist economy. The considerations allow to say that the theory of value based on market price and the theory of value based on labour correspond with the stage of development when resources and goods were considered practically unlimited. However, we are more and more {{aware of the fact that}} it was only in the XlXth or partly XXth centuries stage of "abundance" and relatively little dangerous pollution of the natural environment that prices and their total level might be considered the reflection of value. The rejection of those assumptions and the recognition of not only relative but also absolute scarcity of the growing number of goods, the need of protecting them through <b>prohibitive</b> <b>prices</b> mark the end of the period of explaining prices exclusively in terms of the input of labour. One should therefore keep in mind that the growing degree of scarcity of resources will inevitably lead to the rise in their prices, i. e. to the economic impediment to their availability.
