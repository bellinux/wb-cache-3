2500|$|Private gifted {{assessment}} is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents {{take advantage of}} online screening tests to give a <b>preliminary</b> <b>indication</b> of potential giftedness. Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological {{assessment is}} to do a curriculum-based assessment. [...] Curriculum-based assessment {{is a form of}} achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.|$|E

Using the rise time information, we examine the behavior of the data compared to monte carlo predictions.

40|$|Coherent {{states can}} be used for diverse {{applications}} in quantum physics including the construction of coherent state path integrals. Most definitions make use of a lattice regularization; however, recent definitions employ a continuous-time regularization that may involve a Wiener measure concentrated on continuous phase space paths. The introduction of constraints is both natural and economical in coherent state path integrals involving only the dynamical and Lagrange multiplier variables. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>indication</b> of how these procedures may possibly be applied to quantum gravity is briefly discussed. ...|$|E

The pathfinding process involves utilizing the full state space {{information available to}} agents to find the least expensive route to the goal.

This paper replaces part of the search with a direct geometrical solution. We provide some <b>preliminary</b> <b>indication</b> of the potential merit of the approach. 1...|$|E
