5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} <b>prokaryote</b> and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical <b>prokaryote,</b> but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, {{and the presence of}} endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the <b>prokaryote</b> to the eukaryote.|$|E
5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A <b>prokaryote</b> {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the <b>prokaryote</b> domain.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several <b>prokaryote</b> serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prokaryotes</b> lack membrane-bound organelles, such as {{mitochondria}} or a nucleus. Instead, most <b>prokaryotes</b> have {{an irregular}} region that contains DNA, {{known as the}} nucleoid. Most <b>prokaryotes</b> have a single, circular chromosome, which {{is in contrast to}} eukaryotes, which typically have linear chromosomes. Nutritionally, <b>prokaryotes</b> have the ability to utilize a wide range of organic and inorganic material for use in metabolism, including sulfur, cellulose, ammonia, or nitrite. <b>Prokaryotes</b> as a whole are ubiquitous in the environment and exist in extreme environments as well.|$|R
50|$|The International Committee on Systematics of <b>Prokaryotes</b> (ICSP), {{formerly}} the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB), {{is the body}} that oversees the nomenclature of <b>prokaryotes,</b> determines the rules by which <b>prokaryotes</b> are named and whose Judicial Commission issues Opinions concerning taxonomic matters, revisions to the Bacteriological Code, etc.|$|R

5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether <b>prokaryote</b> genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
25|$|The {{eukaryotic}} cell {{seems to have}} evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, respectively, which were endosymbiosed by an ancestral archaean <b>prokaryote.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the {{evolution}} of sex dates to the <b>prokaryote</b> or early eukaryote stage, the origin of chromosomal sex determination may have been fairly early in eukaryotes (see Evolution of anisogamy). The ZW sex-determination system is shared by birds, some fish and some crustaceans. XY sex determination is used by most mammals, but also some insects, and plants (Silene latifolia). X0 sex-determination is found in certain insects.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSynonymous codon usage {{analysis}} between thermophilic and mesophilic <b>prokaryotes</b> {{has gained}} wide attention in recent years. Although {{it is known}} that thermophilic and mesophilic <b>prokaryotes</b> use different subset of synonymous codons, no reason for this difference is known so far. In the present communication, by analyzing a large number of thermophilic and mesophilic <b>prokaryotes,</b> we provide evidence that bias in the selection of synonymous codons between thermophilic and mesophilic <b>prokaryotes</b> is related to differential folding pattern of mRNA secondary structures. Moreover, we observe that error-minimizing property has significant influence in differentiating the synonymous codon usage between thermophilic and mesophilic <b>prokaryotes.</b> Biological implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Prokaryotes</b> have diversified greatly {{throughout}} their long existence. The metabolism of <b>prokaryotes</b> {{is far more}} varied than that of eukaryotes, leading to many highly distinct prokaryotic types. For example, in addition to using photosynthesis or organic compounds for energy, as eukaryotes do, <b>prokaryotes</b> may obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide. This enables <b>prokaryotes</b> to thrive in harsh environments as cold as the snow surface of Antarctica, studied in cryobiology or as hot as undersea hydrothermal vents and land-based hot springs.|$|R
50|$|Some {{differences}} exist between eukaryotes and <b>prokaryotes.</b> The conversion of D-threo-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD+-dependent EC 1.1.1.41, while <b>prokaryotes</b> employ the NADP+-dependent EC 1.1.1.42. Similarly, {{the conversion of}} (S)-malate to oxaloacetate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD+-dependent EC 1.1.1.37, while most <b>prokaryotes</b> utilize a quinone-dependent enzyme, EC 1.1.5.4.|$|R
25|$|An {{organism}} may {{be either}} a <b>prokaryote</b> or a eukaryote. Prokaryotes are represented by two separate domains—bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic organisms are characterized {{by the presence of}} a membrane-bound cell nucleus and contain additional membrane-bound compartments called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plants and plastids in plants and algae, all generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). Fungi, animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms within the eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|A major {{addition}} {{to the understanding of}} CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the <b>prokaryote</b> repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or cas genes. Four cas genes (cas 1 to 4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed helicase and nuclease motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci. In this publication the acronym CRISPR was coined as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.|$|E
25|$|Chloroplasts {{are one of}} {{many types}} of organelles in the plant cell. They are {{considered}} to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell. Mitochondria {{are thought to have}} come from a similar event, where an aerobic <b>prokaryote</b> was engulfed. This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905 after Andreas Schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts are only found in plants, algae, and the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora.|$|E
50|$|Tubulin-like {{proteins}} are tubulin in eukaryotes and FtsZ, TubZ, RepX in <b>prokaryotes.</b> Actin-like proteins are actin in eukaryotes and MreB, FtsA in <b>prokaryotes.</b> An {{example of}} a WACA-proteins, which are mostly found in <b>prokaryotes,</b> is MinD. Examples for intermediate filaments, which have almost exclusively been found in animals (i.e. eukaryotes) are the lamins, keratins, vimentin, neurofilaments, desmin.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} <b>prokaryotes</b> {{actively}} contribute to lignin degradation {{in nature and}} their activity could be of interest for many applications including the production of biogas/biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass and biopulping. This review compares the reliability and efficiency of the culture-dependent screening methods currently used for the isolation of ligninolytic <b>prokaryotes.</b> Isolated <b>prokaryotes</b> exhibiting lignin-degrading potential are presented according to their phylogenetic groups. With the development of bioinformatics, culture-independent techniques are emerging that allow larger-scale data mining for ligninolytic prokaryotic functions but today, these techniques still have some limits. In this work, two phylogenetic affiliations of isolated <b>prokaryotes</b> exhibiting ligninolytic potential and laccase-encoding <b>prokaryotes</b> were determined {{on the basis of}} 16 S rDNA sequences, providing a comparative view of results obtained by the two types of screening techniques. The combination of laboratory culture and bioinformatics approaches is a promising way to explore lignin-degrading <b>prokaryotes...</b>|$|R
40|$|These {{authors have}} contributed equally to this work. As {{revealed}} by genome sequencing, {{the biology of}} <b>prokaryotes</b> with reduced genomes is strikingly diverse. These include free-living <b>prokaryotes</b> with ∼ 800 genes as well as endosymbiotic bacteria with as few as ∼ 140 genes. Comparative genomics is revealing the evolutionary mechanisms that led to these small genomes. In the case of free-living <b>prokaryotes,</b> natural selection directly favored genome reduction, while {{in the case of}} endosymbiotic <b>prokaryotes</b> neutral processes played a more prominent role. However, new experimental data suggest that selective processes may be at operation as well for endosymbiotic <b>prokaryotes</b> at least during the first stages of genome reduction. Endosymbiotic <b>prokaryotes</b> have evolved diverse strategies for living with reduced gene sets inside a host-defined medium. These include utilization of host-encoded functions (some of them coded by genes acquired by gene transfer from the endosymbiont and/or other bacteria); metabolic complementation between co-symbionts; and forming consortiums with other bacteria within the host.

25|$|<b>Prokaryote</b> species {{generally}} have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies. For example, Buchnera, a symbiont of aphids has multiple copies of its chromosome, ranging from 10–400 copies per cell. However, in some large bacteria, such as Epulopiscium fishelsoni up to 100,000 {{copies of the}} chromosome can be present. Plasmids and plasmid-like small chromosomes are, as in eukaryotes, highly variable in copy number. The number of plasmids in the cell is almost entirely determined by the rate of division of the plasmidnbsp&– fast division causes high copy number.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that of this multiplicity of protocells, only one line survived. Current phylogenetic {{evidence suggests that the}} last universal ancestor (LUA) lived during the early Archean eon, perhaps 3.5Ga or earlier. This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. It was probably a <b>prokaryote,</b> possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Like modern cells, it used DNA as its genetic code, RNA for information transfer and protein synthesis, and enzymes to catalyze reactions. Some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor, there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by lateral gene transfer.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, {{but one of the most}} common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the <b>prokaryote</b> E. coli when cultured in different conditions. In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a chemostat or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E

25|$|The prokaryotic {{cytoskeleton}} is {{the collective}} name for all structural filaments in <b>prokaryotes.</b> It was once thought that prokaryotic cells did not possess cytoskeletons, but {{recent advances in}} visualization technology and structure determination have shown that filaments indeed exist in these cells.

25|$|If, as {{evidence}} indicates, sexual reproduction arose {{very early in}} eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in bacterial transformation. For example, recA recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination (see Wikipedia articles RecA, RAD51 and DMC1). Both bacterial transformation and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA. If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge {{to the survival of}} early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the <b>prokaryote</b> to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.|$|E
500|$|In some proteins, {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine became {{to be seen}} [...] as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd. Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may {{be present in the}} same organism. Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal <b>prokaryote</b> Acetohalobium arabaticum can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, {{along with other}} eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a <b>prokaryote</b> by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular [...] "predator". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, {{on the basis of}} observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Once {{regarded}} as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as <b>prokaryotes.</b> Unlike cells {{of animals and}} other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles.

40|$|After our {{analysis}} {{of the distribution of}} predicted intrinsic curvature along all available complete prokaryotic genomes, the genomes were divided into two groups. Curvature distribution in all <b>prokaryotes</b> of the first group indicated a substantial fraction of promoters characterized by intrinsic DNA curvature located within or upstream of the promoter region. We did not find this peculiar DNA curvature distribution in <b>prokaryotes</b> in the second group. Remarkably, all bacteria of the first group were mesophilic, whereas many <b>prokaryotes</b> of the second group were hyperthermophilic.

Electron micrographs of microparticles from filtered modern brine (Saline Valley), dissolved modern halite crystals (Saline Valley), and dissolved ancient halite crystals (Death Valley) support in situ microscopic observations that <b>prokaryotes</b> are present in fluid inclusions in ancient halite. In the Death Valley salt core, <b>prokaryotes</b> in fluid inclusions occur almost exclusively in halite precipitated in perennial saline lakes 10, 000 to 35, 000 years ago.
