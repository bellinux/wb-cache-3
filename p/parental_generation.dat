40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} factors that may have {{negatively}} affected the results of many oral sensitization studies in animals has been unscheduled dietary preexposure of the test animals or their <b>parental</b> <b>generations</b> to the antigen under investigation. Objective: The influence of dietary preexposure to soy protein on oral sensitization studies with soy protein in Brown Norway rats was investigated. Methods: Brown Norway rats bred on a soy protein-containing diet for several generations (routine bred [RB] animals) were placed on a soy protein-free diet during and for at least 6 months before breeding (F 0 group). Four generations of offspring were bred on a soy protein-free diet (F 1, F 2, F 3, and F 4 groups). RB and F 4 animals were exposed to soy protein either ad libitum through drinking water or parenterally with an adjuvant. Results: In the F 0 and F 1 animals soy protein-specific IgG antibodies were still detectable, whereas no soy protein-specific IgG was detectable in the other generations tested. In RB animals no significant increase in soy protein-specific IgG titers occurred after exposure to soy protein. Enteral exposure of the F 4 animals to soy protein resulted in sensitization to soy protein, with increased soy protein-specific IgG titers. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate {{that there is a}} continued expression of anti-soy protein antibodies in rats bred and raised on a soy protein-free diet for one generation. Not only must the test animals be bred and raised on a specified antigen-free diet, but their <b>parental</b> <b>generations</b> must also be bred in the same manner to avoid any problems in oral sen-sitization studies.

2500|$|Females begin ovipositing the {{day after}} {{copulation}} and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which {{are directly related to}} female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. [...] They then cover their eggs with a foamy substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. [...] Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs. Although cold tolerant, they are susceptible to freezing in extreme cold temperatures, with the risk of mortality varying seasonally with changes in temperature and physiology.

This paper first establishes some basic facts about the prevalence and magnitude of marriage payments. It then discusses how such patterns vary across countries depending upon economic conditions, societal structures, institutions, and family characteristics. Marriage payments have evolved within societies over time: in some periods, payments have risen sharply; in some cases, payments have shifted from the grooms' side to the brides', and vice versa; sometimes, property rights over such payments shift between marrying partners and <b>parental</b> <b>generations.</b> The second part of this paper discusses the economic literature devoted to explaining these facts. ...|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the impact of {{migration}} upon health and wellbeing of stay-behind parents, Zhang et al. (2005) found that household support and emotional support were effective in reducing mortality when delivered at closer proximity, implying that geographic distance has a negative impact upon the delivery of old age support (also see Cong and Silverstein 2011). With {{respect to the}} changes in the structure of intergenerational support after migration, Guo et al. (2009) found that support from out-migration, adult children became parent-need oriented; that is, parents in greater financial and instrumental need were associated with higher probability of receiving support. Luo and Zhan (2012) found that after adult children migrated, parents adjusted traditional expectations of filial piety and confined old age care to financial support. Cong and Silverstein (2011) found financial support (enhanced by migration) could have positive effects on financial security and the welfare of <b>parental</b> <b>generations,</b> to some degree offsetting the disadvantage of living at a distance. Going beyond unidirectional support flows from the migrant to their stay-behind family, Cong and Silverstein (2012) adopted a gendered extended family perspective to examine how older parents’ involvement in grandchild care affected adult children’s support for older parents, finding a two-way transfer between generations in the context of migration.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of public-private partnerships (PPPs) into the educational sphere {{has opened up}} the sector {{to a wide range}} of new private providers in India and Pakistan. The global literature has indicated that the growth in partnerships that provide targeted programmes for girls, in locations where parents prefer to enrol their daughters in these new private schools rather than state schools, will further reduce any existing gender gap. A specific focus on gender equality considerations within PPP programmes is necessary to analyse new evidence on gender equality. A review of national documents on education for India and Pakistan indicates that the concept of gender equality was not included in the original education policy documents, and gender concerns were introduced through a particular institutional history of engagement between international and national policy interventions. District and village data show that there was very little gendered difference in how <b>parental</b> <b>generations</b> studied viewed the educational pathways of their sons and daughters. The younger generation studied are not confident that they will be able to enter gainful employment, which raises policy concerns that the lack of employment for this younger generation could undo any reduction in the gender gap as increased poverty pushes girls out of school in the next two decades...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{survival}} between familial and sporadic cancers {{have been}} inconclusive and only recent {{data on a}} limited number of cancers are available on the concordance of survival between family members. In this review, we address these questions by evaluating the published and unpublished data from the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database and a total of 13 cancer sites were assessed. Using sporadic cancer as reference, HRs were close to 1. 0 for most of the familial cancers in both the offspring and <b>parental</b> <b>generations,</b> which suggested that survival in patients with familial and sporadic cancers was equal, with an exception for ovarian cancer with a worse prognosis. Compared to offspring whose parents had a poor survival, those with a good parental survival had a decreased risk of death for most cancers and HR was significantly decreased for cancers in the breast, prostate, bladder, and kidney. For colorectal and nervous system cancers, favorable survival between the generations showed a borderline significance. These data are consistent in showing that both good and poor survival in certain cancers aggregate in families. Genetic factors are likely to contribute to the results. These observations call for intensified efforts to consider heritability in survival as one mechanism regulating prognosis in cancer patients...|$|R

We examined the early size and yield heterosis in 32 F 1 hybrids of Chinese cabbage. There was a moderate correlation in mid-parent heterosis between leaf size at 21 days after sowing and harvested biomass but not in best-parent heterosis. In contrast there was no correlation between genetic distance and mid-parent or best-parent heterosis, indicating that genetic distance does not predict the heterosis phenotype...|$|R

Remaining offspring comprised the non-exposed and pre+postnatal exposed groups. After 90 days, the animals were sacrificed for testis collection and weighing. Optical microscopy was used for the morphometric analyses of the cell counts, spermatogenic cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. Prenatally exposed animals presented reduced body and testicular weight with an increased gonadosomatic index (GSI). Testicular volume also decreased, as well as the tubular diameter in testes of the same animals. Proliferation, apoptosis, and spermatogenic cycle analyses showed no significant differences among groups. However, the tubules at stage VII of pre- and postnatal animals presented a reduced number of elongated spermatids. Pre+postnatal group presented higher spermatid head retention at stages VIII-XII.

In the following year, parents and their progenies were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replications, and 10 traits were measured. The analysis of variance showed significant differences (p≤ 0. 01) between cultivars. Furthermore, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) for parents and hybrids were significant. Therefore, additive and non-additive gene effects on controlling traits were demonstrated. According to the analysis based on the second and fourth Griffing methods, additive gene effects were more than non-additive gene effects on controlling growth period, plant height, panicle length, number of panicles/plant and brown rice length, while other studied traits were more controlled by non-additive gene effects. Comparison of the second and fourth Griffing methods showed that the proportions of additive and non-additive variances in two methods were different.

Although Jugendweihe emerged in the mid- 19 th century {{as a substitute for}} ecclesiastical coming-of-age rituals, and was adopted by various movements, it is closely associated with the former GDR (German Democratic Republic/East Germany). Under the GDR, young people aged thirteen to fourteen prepared for their Jugendweihe ceremony in ten ‘youth lessons’, which aimed to craft ‘socialist personalities’. Between 1955 and 1989 more than seven million adolescents pledged allegiance to the GDR state during the public ceremony, which was followed by a family celebration. With the demise of state socialism in 1989 - 90, western observers and the Churches assumed the ritual would vanish, but Jugendweihe continues to be celebrated in contemporary eastern Germany – without a pledge of allegiance. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between November 2012 and January 2014 in Thuringia, this thesis investigates the changed social relations between individuals, families, and the state in eastern Germany after the political caesura of 1989 - 90. It explores the ritual’s abiding relevance within a different socio-political context, and considers how the ritual’s metamorphosis is mediated both through the local Jugendweihe Association and the grandparental and <b>parental</b> <b>generations.</b> The research examines what values grandparents and parents, who were socialised under the GDR, seek to transmit to their offspring born after the GDR state’s demise.

The effective population size was in 1993 N e = 114. 00 and 2003 N e = 140. 36. The increment of N e during the 10 -year period was 26. 36 animals. The average heterozygosity estimated on the frequencies of blood types, biochemical markers and microsatellites was enough large and was connected with a low coefficient of inbreeding. Linear type evolutions of 494 horses of the Old Kladrub breed for 32 traits were used to analyse the effect of variety and stud. The data {{were used for the}} estimation of population parameters and heritability coefficients. The specific properties and variation of the Old Kladrub horse in its current state were characterized by the overall mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, number of utilized scores and heritabilities. The highest coefficient of variation showed the forelimbs-side view (40. 14 %), chest girth (36. 25 %) and height at withers (30. 97 %). The 8 traits showed heritabilities within the interval of 0. 20 to 0. 68. These traits are candidates as selection criteria. Significant differences between both varieties were found in 13 from 32 traits. Significant differences were found in 12 of 32 traits between the Kladruby stud and the private studs...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} trophic niches of sympatric and allopatric {{populations of}} the isopods Asellus aquaticus and Proasellus coxalis were compared in laboratory. Sixteen microfungi were singly offered as the sole food resource for 50 days to young animals born in the laboratory. Furthermore, six of all tested fungi were again offered to young of the F 1 and F 2 generations of P. coxalis from populations living sympatrically. Animals and microfungi were collected in three woodland streams that were similar in geographic location and hydrogeologic, physical and chemical features. The microfungi were {{selected on the basis}} of their constant presence throughout six months of sampling in each of three habitats. The results indicate first, that A. aquaticus and P. coxalis from populations living sympatrically have a potential trophic niche much more differentiated than do the populations living allopatrically. In particular, progeny of the two species when sympatric showed similar survival on only 25 % of the tested fungal resources. Second, the two species when sympatric are specialized for microfungi not very common in nature; more common microfungi are used without distinction by individuals of both species. Third, the exclusiveness of each resource for the sympatric populations increases inversely with the abundance in nature of the resource itself. Fourth, in P. coxalis, the number of survivors eating a particular fungus increases in the F 1 and F 2 vs. <b>parental</b> <b>generations.</b> The results emphasize a possible effect of co-occurrence on character displacement and support the hypothesis of coevolutionary trophic partitioning between the two species. It appears that the importance of microfungi in the co-occurrence relationships of A. aquaticus and P. coxalis is much more than appears from the low estimates of the biomass of the microfungi...|$|R
