40|$|ARIES {{consists}} of a 6 -wheeled K 3 A mobile platform, a compact subturret, a sonar imaging system, a laser-based {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) navigation beacon system, and a camera positioning system. It has a sonar imaging system used in navigation and collision avoidance and an automatic docking/charging system. Drum-referencing algorithms and camera-positioning algorithms have been included in the primitive instruction set for the robot. The robot`s navigation is based on Synchro-Drive, a patented design that utilizes concentric shafts to distribute drive and steering power to the six wheels simultaneously. ARIES uses a virtual path concept in which only a limited amount of information needs to be provided to the control computer {{in order to get the}} vehicle moving. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, found several areas of concern including ergonomics, laser hazards, tripping hazards, fall-from-above and struck-by hazards, electrical hazards, and decontamination of the system. BOA is a self-propelled automated mini-enclosure, able to remove insulation from installed pipes, primarily of 4 inch nominal outside diameter. The system is designed for two operators: one oversees the abatement head operation from a distance of 10 or 15 feet using a <b>pendant</b> <b>control</b> and the other bags the debris at a cyclonic bagging station that is attached by a vacuum hose to the cutting head. Since the abatement head is its own enclosure, there may be no need for further enclosures to be built. The system wets and removes asbestos insulation automatically, cutting the debris into consistent chunks and moving the wave under a strong vacuum to a bagging machine. Prior to reaching the bagging operation, the material passes through a water separator which greatly reduces the weight of the debris and allows recirculation of water, after sufficient filtration. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, focused on: noise, dust concentrations, ergonomics, and computer software. Industrial hygiene sampling indicated that worker exposures may be kept low enough during normal operation of BOA to eliminate the need for respiratory or heating protection while working around the cutting head and bagging operation. Airborne particulate measurements showed a slight rise over background levels during the operation of BOA, but the average of all the readings during operation was 1. 6 % of the OSHA respirable dust standard. Air sampling and noise monitoring showed dust to be negligible. Noise was shown to be a potential exposure hazard depending on worker location...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the microenvironment of chains on their self-organization has been studied using styrene-based linear polymers having two different pendant groups on every repeat unit. The noncovalent cross-linking of a polymer containing both carboxylic acid and alkyl (n-C 10 H 21 −) pendant groups with a multifunctional amine (PMDETA) in a nonselective solvent (DMF) resulted in thermally reversible supramolecular aggregates that were stable without interparticle cross-linking. The size of the aggregates was controlled on a sub-micrometer level by varying concentration. In {{the absence of the}} alkyl <b>pendant</b> group, <b>control</b> over the structure and properties of the aggregates was lost.

40|$|The most {{important}} tool for controlling an industrial robotic arm is a teach <b>pendant,</b> which <b>controls</b> the robotic arm movement in work spaces and accomplishes teaching tasks. A good teaching tool {{should be easy}} to operate and can complete teaching tasks rapidly and effortlessly. In this study, a new teaching system is proposed for enabling users to operate robotic arms and accomplish teaching tasks easily. The proposed teaching system consists of the teach pen, optical markers on the pen, a motion capture system, and the pen tip estimation algorithm. With the marker positions captured by the motion capture system, the pose of the teach pen is accurately calculated by the pen tip algorithm and used to control the robot tool frame.

50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{also known}} as a bridge crane, is a type of crane where the hook-and-line mechanism runs along a horizontal beam that itself runs along two widely separated rails. Often it is in a long factory building and runs along rails along the building's two long walls. It is similar to a gantry crane. Overhead cranes typically consist of either a single beam or a double beam construction. These can be built using typical steel beams or a more complex box girder type. Pictured on the right is a single bridge box girder crane with the hoist and system operated with a <b>control</b> <b>pendant.</b> Double girder bridge are more typical when needing heavier capacity systems from 10 tons and above. The advantage of the box girder type configuration results in a system that has a lower deadweight yet a stronger overall system integrity. Also included would be a hoist to lift the items, the bridge, which spans the area covered by the crane, and a trolley to move along the bridge.|$|R
40|$|Hierarchical {{assembly}} of materials has attracted significant interest, since it provides opportunities to fabricate novel materials. In this thesis, we investigated three different systems where polymer chains organize hierarchically. ^ First, a semicrystalline triblock copolymer, poly(L-lactic acid- b-ethylene oxide-b-L-lactic acid) (PLLA- b-PEO-b-PLLA), was prepared {{and the effect}} of the block-wise construction on the sequential crystallization was investigated by comparison to the corresponding homopolymer blend. In the resultant spherulitic morphology, the crystallization of PEO occurred within the framework established by the PLLA crystals. The preformed PLLA crystals biased the PEO chain orientation and the effect was more significant in the block copolymer system, where PEO chains were covalently anchored to PLLA. ^ Secondly, the influence of the microenvironment of multifunctional chains on their organization was studied. For this investigation, styrene-based linear polymers having two different pendant groups, a carboxylic acid and a neutral group, on every repeat unit were prepared. With alkyl (n-C 10 H 21 -) groups as the neutral pendant, the linear macromolecules assembled into thermally reversible globular aggregates through non-covalent interaction with multifunctional tertiary amines. The aggregates had a structural hierarchy and remained stable without inter-particle crosslinking. In the absence of the alkyl <b>pendant</b> groups, <b>control</b> over the structure and properties of the aggregates was lost. ^ In a third system, the coupled self-{{assembly of}} bionanoparticles and block copolymers was investigated. A simple way to incorporate bionanoparticles into a thin film of water-insoluble block copolymer was developed by combining the bionanoparticle adsorption on a polymer film and subsequent annealing under solvent vapor. Through the use of a block copolymer having a positively charged component, the loading of bionanoparticles increased significantly. When highly loaded, a hierarchical co-assembly of the block copolymer and the bionanoparticle was observed where the microphase separation of the block copolymer forced a segregation of bionanoparticles to the grain boundaries, forming a much larger scale structure. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{commissioned}} for Saimaa University of Applied Sciences {{with the aim}} of understanding the control system for a robotic arm. The Robotic Arm in this case was from Saimaa University of Applied Sciences. The main objective of this thesis was to understand a control system for the Robotic Arm using a programmable logic controller (PLC) along with gripper. The control system consisted of the electronic components (the PLC, a motor controller, a voltage regulator, a control pendent and a bride board circuit). The Robotic Arm works manually using potentiometers and also with the help of PLC. At the beginning, studies were carried out to define the design constraints for finding the best options among components that are most suitable for this application. A control system with a PLC needs additional electronic components, such as a DC motor controller and <b>control</b> <b>pendant.</b> The parts selected are those that met the specifications requirements.

40|$|Dimensional {{measurement}} of the subassemblies {{at the beginning of}} the assembly line is a very crucial process for the eyeglasses industry, since even small manufacturing errors of the components can lead to very visible defects on the final product. For this reason, all subcomponents of the eyeglass are verified before beginning the assembly process either with a 100 % inspection or on a statistical basis. Inspection is usually performed by human operators, with high costs and a degree of repeatability which is not always satisfactory. This paper presents a novel on-line measuring system for dimensional verification of small metallic subassemblies for the eyeglasses industry. The machine vision system proposed, which was designed to be used {{at the beginning of the}} assembly line, could also be employed in the Statistical Process Control (SPC) by the manufacturer of the subassemblies. The automated system proposed is based on artificial vision, and exploits two CCD cameras and an anthropomorphic robot to inspect and manipulate the subcomponents of the eyeglass. Each component is recognized by the first camera in a quite large workspace, picked up by the robot and placed in the small vision field of the second camera which performs the measurement process. Finally, the part is palletized by the robot. The system can be easily taught by the operator by simply placing the template object in the vision field of the measurement camera (for dimensional data acquisition) and hence by instructing the robot via the Teaching <b>Control</b> <b>Pendant</b> within the vision field of the first camera (for pick-up transformation acquisition). The major problem we dealt with is that the shape and dimensions of the subassemblies can vary in a quite wide range, but different positioning of the same component can look very similar one to another. For this reason, a specific shape recognition procedure was developed. In the paper, the whole system is presented together with first experimental lab results...|$|R
