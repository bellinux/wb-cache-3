25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1200Hz, followed by 7 data bits (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even <b>parity</b> <b>bit</b> follows, then a stop bit at 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E

Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen [...] "bits". If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a <b>parity</b> <b>bit</b> was used to verify the correctness of each sequence.

30|$|Generally, the encoder lacks {{a priori}} {{knowledge}} {{about the number of}} <b>parity</b> <b>bits</b> required at the decoder to reconstruct X.

Based on the side information X′ generated from Ŷ, the decoder requests <b>parity</b> <b>bits</b> packet by packet via a feedback channel until the success of channel decoding of X. This indicates a delay, and channel decoding is performed iteratively with newly requested <b>parity</b> <b>bits.</b> Such procedures inevitably result in a huge computing load at the decoder. Several works suggest realizing bit rate estimation at the encoder [16 – 19]. A rate estimation based on the residue between the current frame and the side information is proposed [16], where the <b>parity</b> <b>bits</b> are allocated dynamically according to the motion activity. An entropy-based encoder rate estimation in transform domain is also proposed [17], where the Laplacian correlation model is used to estimate the entropy.
