5|$|Later, when {{technological}} advances allowed {{the use of}} <b>pressurization</b> of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, compressed air illness, the bends, and decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The two Lights {{took off}} out of Kalamazoo in September 1937 in a Bellanca monoplane. Its cabin lacked heat or <b>pressurization.</b> To survive, {{they were forced}} to breathe oxygen from a tank out wooden mouthpieces. Wearing a fur coat and boots, Meader took {{photographs}} out of a window frame.|$|E
5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical <b>pressurization,</b> hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E
5|$|Tank {{bursting}} due to overpressure may {{be prevented}} by a pressure-relief burst disc fitted to the cylinder valve, which bursts if the cylinder is overpressurised and vents air {{at a rapid}} controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also occur during filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated <b>pressurization</b> cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank <b>pressurization</b> and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroc missile used {{liquid oxygen}} as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile very fragile because it required continuous <b>pressurization.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Braathens SAFE {{started looking for}} a {{replacement}} for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin <b>pressurization.</b> Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo–Trondheim, once daily Oslo–Ålesund, twice daily Oslo–Stavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and {{were used for the}} first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and Tønsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank <b>pressurization</b> system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2003, Kato Air {{took over}} the Bodø–Røst route, using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The new airline had a troubled start with the {{passenger}} numbers dropping by 27 percent. On 4 December, a flight from Røst to Bodø was hit by lightning, and received severe damage during the landing at Bodø. The choice of the operator was criticized by the Røst Municipal Council following the incident, stated that the ministry had prioritized price over safety. The council stated {{that they did not}} feel that Kato Air provided the same service as Widerøe and that the aircraft were a safety hazard. Among the complaints were lack of accessibility for disabled people, no cabin <b>pressurization,</b> no weather radar, more expensive tickets, no discounted tickets and no possibility for carry-on baggage. In February 2006, there was a wave of cancellations by Kato Air, due to technical problems with both the airline's aircraft. In June, the airline's pilots started selling tickets themselves at the airport. The company stated that this was because they had declined Widerøe to do this because of higher costs. The Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air's concession in 2008 due to lack on maintenance. On an interim basis, the helicopter airline Lufttransport, that operated the route to the nearby island of Værøy, {{took over the}} route from 5 September to 29 October, when Widerøe started flying again.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aircraft}} require compressors {{to maintain}} cabin <b>pressurization</b> at altitude.|$|E
25|$|Five Trans World 307Bs were {{pressed into}} service with the USAAF as {{military}} transports; the cabin <b>pressurization</b> was removed to save weight.|$|E
25|$|Because Mercury-Redstone had larger {{propellant}} tanks {{than the}} Redstone missile, an additional nitrogen bottle was added for tank <b>pressurization,</b> {{and an extra}} hydrogen peroxide tank for powering the turbopump due to the longer burn time.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, a CF6-6 fan {{assembly}} disintegrated, {{resulted in the}} loss of cabin <b>pressurization</b> of National Airlines Flight 27 over New Mexico, United States. In 1989, a CF6-6 failed, causing United Airlines Flight 232 to crash in Sioux City, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, if {{positive}} pressures are required, standard glassware {{can not be}} used, energy must be used for <b>pressurization</b> {{and there is a}} higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating {{bleed air}} {{increases}} the electric load, as cabin <b>pressurization,</b> anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions {{need to be}} powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-power power distribution boards and more sophisticated backup and control systems.|$|E
25|$|A3D-2P (RA-3B): 30 photo-reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{with weapons}} bay package {{for up to}} 12 cameras plus photoflash bombs. Increased <b>pressurization</b> allowed camera operator to enter the bay to check the cameras. Some retained tail guns, but most were later converted to ECM tail of late A-3Bs.|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine <b>pressurization</b> can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of <b>pressurization</b> is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with <b>pressurization</b> since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, {{bleed air}} used for air-conditioning, and <b>pressurization</b> can be {{contaminated}} by chemicals {{such as oil}} or hydraulic fluid. This {{is known as a}} fume event. While those chemicals can be irritating, such rare events have not been established to cause long term harm.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates (polymeric C6H10O5) {{releases}} H2 in a bioreformer {{mediated by}} the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild <b>pressurization</b> and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Junkers Ju 49 was a German {{aircraft}} {{designed to}} investigate high-altitude flight and {{the techniques of}} cabin <b>pressurization.</b> It was the world's second working pressurized aircraft, following the Engineering Division USD-9A which first flew in the United States in 1921. By 1935, it was flying regularly to around 12,500m (41,000ft).|$|E
25|$|One {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on}} the Monospar ST-25 Universal. A new fuselage was built containing a pressurized section with two seats. Its purpose was to test possible <b>pressurization</b> systems for a proposed airliner, the GAL.40. The GAL.41 flew {{for the first time}} 11 May 1939, and was grounded in 1941.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the elegant {{appearance}} of the aircraft was the fuselage shape—a continuously variable profile with no two bulkheads the same shape. Unfortunately, this construction was very expensive and was replaced by mostly tube-shaped modern airliners. The tube is more resistant to <b>pressurization</b> changes and cheaper to build.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} aircraft was rolled out in December 1958 incorporating de-rated AI-20D engines, (the initial production AI-20D {{was found to}} be incapable of delivering the specified power), modified undercarriage control systems, fuel vents, <b>pressurization</b> and de-icing systems, as well as thicker gauge skin in the propeller plane of rotation and increased rudder range of movement.|$|E
25|$|Greywater systems reuse drained {{wash water}} to flush toilets or to water lawns and gardens. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most {{residential}} buildings; however, they require {{the purchase of}} a sump, greywater <b>pressurization</b> pump, and secondary plumbing. Some builders are installing waterless urinals and even composting toilets that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.|$|E
25|$|Paul Bikle {{flew the}} sole 1-23E {{to a world}} {{absolute}} altitude record of 46,267feet for a record gain of 42,300feet on 25 February 1961. The records were set in the Sierra Nevada lee wave between Mojave, California and Inyokern, California. Bikle flew the record flights without cabin <b>pressurization</b> or a pressure suit. His record stood for many years.|$|E
25|$|When {{used for}} cabin <b>pressurization,</b> the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was investigated {{and the following}} probable cause statement was issued:The aircraft sustained a hit or hits which caused loss of <b>pressurization</b> and {{a fire in the}} heater compartment. The aircraft broke up in mid-air due to explosion caused by bullets hitting the right wing and probably the left wing together with a projectile or projectiles of large calibre in the rear end of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|On an earning revision, JSAT {{disclosed}} {{that they had}} confirmed container deformation after Superbird-8 arrived to its launch site. On July 2016, it was published that a May 25 mishap during air transport had delayed the satellite launch by an estimated two years. A dislodged tarpaulin had blocked the bleed valve on the satellite container and the spacecraft had suffer from over <b>pressurization</b> damage.|$|E
25|$|The ALF 502 has {{experienced}} multiple issues. Its internal electronics could overheat, triggering an automatic shutdown of an engine with no option for inflight restart, and certain rare atmospheric conditions {{could cause a}} loss of engine thrust due to internal icing. Additionally, the BAe 146 experienced some issues with its bleed air and cabin <b>pressurization</b> systems, leading {{to a number of}} fume events where irritant fumes were introduced into the cabin via the pressurizing system.|$|E
25|$|The Beechcraft Model 65 Queen Air and Model 90 King Air {{are both}} direct descendents of the Model 50 Twin Bonanza. All three {{aircraft}} {{share the same}} basic wing design, as well as landing gear, flaps, instrument panels, fuel cells, and more. The Queen Air added a larger cabin to the design, while the later King Air added turbine power and <b>pressurization.</b> Twin Bonanza production ended in 1963 while the King Air was under development.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 1967, another LM {{under test}} {{failed in the}} Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation ascent stage {{manufacturing}} plant. A window in LM-5 (Apollo 11's LM Eagle) shattered during its initial cabin <b>pressurization</b> test, designed to pressurize the cabin to 39 kilopascals (5.7pounds per square inch) above the external pressure. Both inner and outer windows and the acrylic glass cover of the right-hand window shattered when the pressure reached 35 kPa (5.1pounds per square inch).|$|E
25|$|From 1940 to 1941, {{work was}} done on the P series of rockets, which used {{propellant}} turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no <b>pressurization</b> tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude {{of only a few}} hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and <b>pressurization</b> lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, {{and are more likely}} to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a <b>pressurization</b> problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin <b>pressurization,</b> resulting in hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|The Air Corps {{tested and}} {{employed}} {{a profusion of}} pursuit, observation, and bomber aircraft during its 15-year history. The advent of {{the new generation of}} monoplanes and the emergence of strategic bombardment doctrine led to many designs in the mid and late 1930s that were still in use when the United States entered World War II. Among the key technology items developed were oxygen and cabin <b>pressurization</b> systems, engine superchargers (systems essential for high-altitude combat), advanced radio communication systems, such as VHF radios, and the Norden bombsight.|$|E
25|$|The Bhopal UCIL {{facility}} housed three underground 68,000 liters liquid MIC storage tanks: E610, E611, and E619. In {{the months}} leading up to the December leak, liquid MIC production was in progress and being used to fill these tanks. UCC safety regulations specified that no one tank should be filled more than 50% (here, 30 tons) with liquid MIC. Each tank was pressurized with inert nitrogen gas. This <b>pressurization</b> allowed liquid MIC to be pumped out of each tank as needed, and also kept impurities out of the tanks.|$|E
