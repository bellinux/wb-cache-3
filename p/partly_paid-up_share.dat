50|$|The late 1970s brought two {{important}} changes. First, the old nationalists, {{who had run}} the newspaper {{as a kind of}} public trust, began to disappear. Second, the economic climate in India and in Kerala began to become more unapologetically capitalist. Mathrubhumi, which under its old regime was a Kerala institution and also an effectively run business, came {{to be seen as a}} valuable asset. Its control could provide wealth - and certainly provided influence and prestige. Shares in Mathrubhumi began to be traded in a way that was inconceivable 10 years earlier. Indeed, when the share book was tidied up in the mid-1980s, it was found that there were dozens of <b>partly</b> <b>paid-up</b> <b>shares</b> whose owners were long dead or unknown. Such shares were forfeited, making the remaining valid shares even more valuable.|$|R
40|$|Those {{investing}} in mining companies were, wisely, warned to tread warily {{to avoid being}} duped by ‘wild cat’ promotions, for many companies were blatant speculations and most would fail. The three main causes of failures were misrepresentation {{of the value of}} the ore, over-capitalization combined with insufficient working capital, and mismanagement. Mining investment was a form of gambling, with professional speculators seeking quick profits not long-term rewards. Companies were floated on the basis of inadequate prospecting, and some flotations were unquestionably fraudulent. Laws creating no or limited liability companies were designed to protect investors, but they encouraged floating companies with inadequate capital. Issuing <b>partly</b> <b>paid-up</b> <b>shares</b> required shareholders to pay calls, but often they preferred to forfeit their interests; and sometimes dummies were used to avoid payment. Despite claims of having found good ore, much unproven ground was floated, and share prices fluctuated depending on the latest reports of ore values. Fraudulent or at best exaggerated assay results were produced, for often samples did not reflect the general values. Examples are cited of how to salt mines or provide misleading assays and of companies shepherding their properties in the hope of nearby companies making good discoveries and enabling them to sell their ground for an unearned profit. Management was an expensive cost, especially in overseas companies, but insufficient money was provided to prospect and develop ground. Press ‘puffery’ was condemned, but newspapers relied on information provided by mine managers. Surveyors sometimes produced plans showing reefs that did not exist, and many ‘experts’ imported from overseas were selected to produce the optimistic reports that company promoters required. Examples are cited of deliberately false reports and dubious prospectuses listing carefully selected shareholders’ names to attract investors. And in some cases companies even had either no title or an insecure one to the ground being floated. As stockbrokers could not be trusted, there was opposition to brokers being directors. Nor could miners always be trusted, as they played the market also. Overselling and forward selling of shares were problems, but the main ones were that under-capitalized companies had insufficient working capital: several examples are cited. Some companies were over-capitalized, and it was common to erect expensive plants prematurely. Because only a small percentage of the nominal capital was paid up, companies had to rely on calls to increase their capital. And vendors and company promoters made excessive profits from floating mines. In short, company flotation was more a form of gambling than a way of enabling honest mining...|$|R

40|$|Insufficient {{institutional}} {{credit is}} {{a major contributor to}} the persistent poor performance of the Nigerian agricultural sector. To encourage financial institutions to increase lending to the sector, a partial credit guarantee scheme was instituted. The scheme commenced operations in 1978 with an authorized capital of 100. 00 million of nigerian naira, subscribed to 60 % and 40 % by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Central Bank of Nigeria, respectively.

The results revealed that there has been continuous growth in <b>paid-up</b> <b>share</b> capital, total fund resources, maximum amount of loan obtainable by farmers, number and value of loans guaranteed, volume and value of loans fully repaid and volume and value of default claims settled. There was a long-run convergence between the number and volume of guaranteed loans and the agricultural GDP. This finding indicates the need to expand the quantum of funds available for guaranteeing agricultural loans to increase performance of the agricultural sector in the long run.

The loan can not replace the entrepreneurs own resources, it is only complementary to it.
