Reef fishery stocks are under increasing threat from factors such as climate-related habitat degradation, land use practices, and resource extraction related to human population growth, direct consumption and increasing connectivity between the in situ fishery and fish markets. This study investigates how reef fish stocks are related to environmental, localised resource use and market <b>proximity</b> <b>indicators</b> across 51 sites in the Solomon Islands. Hard coral cover is the best indicator of total target fishery biomass, with cover of less than around 31 % associated with significantly less biomass than sites with higher coral cover. Direct resource use indicators such as fish consumption and fish sale pressure were poor predictors of target fish biomass. Distance of the fishery resource from community, provincial sub-station, provincial capital and national capital are all significantly and positively correlated with biomass for four key fishery families: Acanthuridae (surgeonfish), Scaridae (parrotfish), Lethrinidae (emperor), Lutjanidae (snapper). Multiple spatial scale relationships are evident between market <b>proximity</b> <b>indicators</b> and Lutjanidae and Scaridae families. Thus, while pooled target fishery biomass is constrained by environment, analysis at fishery family resolution reveals the effects of anthropogenic impact through market proximity on constraining fishery biomass distribution in the Solomon Islands.

This paper reviews the quantitative and qualitative aspects relevant for accessibility metrics and empirical studies addressing these aspects in relation to health.

Structure and location data for 292 residential property sales in Redwood and Renville Counties, excluding the cities of Olivia and Redwood Falls, were linked to the location and physical characteristics of every larger feedlot within three miles of each sale. The basic approach was to ask, "Does the addition of information about feedlot proximity help us explain observed house prices beyond the explanatory power of statistical models that use only the house's structure and other location characteristics?" We examined this overall question with respect to a series of constructed <b>proximity</b> <b>indicators</b> that capture the effects of feedlot size, direction, distance, and types of animals, among others. We found statistically significant evidence of a link between feedlot location and house prices in the study area. That relationship was positive in sign, not negative as initially expected. Houses closer to feedlots appear to have sold for more than expected from knowledge of the characteristics of the houses alone. The effect was most pronounced for houses that are older, relatively lower in price, or located in small towns. ...|$|R
40|$|Fluency in (or ease {{to quickly}} learn) the {{language}} of the destination country {{plays a key role in}} the transfer of human capital from the source country to another country and boosts the immigrant’s rate of success at the destination’s labor market. This suggests that the ability to learn and speak a foreign language might be an important factor in the migration decision. We use a novel dataset on immigration flows and stocks of foreigners in 30 OECD destination countries from 223 source countries for the years 1980 – 2009 and a wide range of linguistic indicators to study the role of language in shaping international migration. Specifically, we investigate how both linguistic distance and linguistic diversity, as a proxy for the “potential” ease to learn a new language and to adapt to a new context, affect migration. We find that migration rates increase with linguistic proximity and the result is robust to the inclusion of genetic distance as a proxy for cultural proximity and to the use of multiple measures of linguistic distance. Interestingly, linguistic proximity matters more for migrants moving into non-English speaking destinations than to English-speaking countries. The likely higher proficiency of the average migrant in English rather than in other languages may diminish the relevance of the linguistic <b>proximity</b> <b>indicators</b> to English speaking destinations. Finally, destinations that are linguistically more diverse and polarized attract fewer migrants than those with a single language; whereas more linguistic polarization at origin seems to act as a push factor.

40|$|Abstract — It {{is always}} a good idea that a bus {{commuter}} waiting at a stop gets to know how far a bus is. If his route of travel happens to be common for more than one bus- route number, it is even better for him to know which is the nearest bus or the earliest arriving bus.

This becomes very useful for the physically challenged commuter, as after knowing in advance the bus arrival s/he will be ready to accommodate in the bus.

40|$|Problem statement: In the {{operation}} of an Electric Power System (EPS), it has been usual to provide reactive power injection to avoid an under-voltage bus condition. In some situations an adequate voltage profile {{will not be a}} guarantee against Voltage Collapses (VCs) that may cause blackouts as seen in many occurrences around the world. The repeatedly injection of reactive power can turn a bus into a characteristic too much capacitive. Under this condition and {{in the presence of a}} considerable percentage of the constant power load type, there will be a high risk of a VC. Any of the indices proposed in the literature as VC <b>Proximity</b> <b>Indicators</b> (VCPIs) may alert the operator about the risk. Approach: In order to elucidate the problem stated, simulations were performed using MatLab/SimPowerSystems. It was used a basic example system composed by an infinite-bus feeding, through a large impedance line, a bus load whose power could be increased in ramp manner. It is also included a shunt capacitive compensation at the load bus every time the voltage value reaches 0. 9 pu. Therefore, the VC risk increase could be shown by means of graphic results and the indications of some VCPIs sensitivity indices (including the new proposed index). Results: The graphics obtained in this study is a contribution to illustrate the voltage collapse risk problem when dealing with adjustments of voltage profile to meet the system requirements. Also, a VCPI sensitivity indicator using apparent load power was tested. The results have shown that all VCPI responses are very similar for a given case and electric system. Conclusion/Recommendations: Any VCPI information can help in the decision stage between either more reactive power injection or load shedding. A routine can also be developed for a supervisory program in order to alert the operator about VC risks...|$|R
40|$|Soil sealing (loss of soil {{resources}} due to extensive land covering for {{the purpose}} of house building, road construction etc.) and subsequent soil landscape pattern changes constitute typical environmental problems in many places worldwide. Previous studies concentrated on soil sealing in urbanized regions, whereas rural areas have not been given sufficient attention. Accordingly, this paper studies soil landscape pattern dynamics (i. e., landscape pattern changes in response to rural anthropogenic activities) in the Tiaoxi watershed (Zhejiang province, eastern China), in which surface sealing is by far the predominant component of human forcing with respect to environmental change. A novel approach of quantifying the impacts of rural anthropogenic activities on soil resources is presented. Specifically, quantitative relationships were derived between five soil landscape pattern metrics (patch density, edge density, shape index, Shannon's diversity index and aggregation index) and three rural anthropogenic activity indicators (anthropogenic activity intensity, distance to towns, and distance to roads) at two landscape block scales (3 and 5 km) between 1985 and 2010. The results showed that the Tiaoxi watershed experienced extensive rural settlement expansion and high rates of soil sealing. Soil landscapes became more fragmented, more irregular, more isolated, and less diverse. Relationships between soil landscape pattern changes and rural anthropogenic activities differed with the scale (spatial and temporal) and variable considered. In particular, the anthropogenic activity intensity was found {{to be the most important}} indicator explaining social development intensity, whereas the other two <b>proximity</b> <b>indicators</b> had a significant impact at certain temporal interval. In combination with scale effects, spatial dependency (correlation) was shown to play a key role that should be carefully taken into consideration in any relevant environmental study. Overall, the findings of this work suggest that soil sealing can be a critical human forcing issue with considerable consequences deserving serious attention by the experts, the public and the government alike...|$|R

Power system voltage stability indices (VSIs) including the line stability index (LQP), the voltage collapse <b>proximity</b> <b>indicator</b> (VCPI), and the line stability index (Lmn) are employed to identify the most suitable locations in the system for UPFCs. In this study, the locations of the UPFCs are identified by dynamically varying the loads across all of the load buses to represent actual power system conditions. Simulations were conducted in a power system computer-aided design (PSCAD) software using the IEEE 14 -bus and 39 - bus benchmark power system models. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. When the UPFCs are placed in the locations obtained with the new approach, the voltage stability improves. A comparison of the steady-state VSIs resulting from the UPFCs placed in the locations obtained with the new approach and with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE), which are static methods, is presented.

50|$|The {{red kite}} {{has been known}} to {{successfully}} hybridize with the black kite in captivity where both species were kept together, and in the wild on the Cape Verde Islands and infrequently in other places. The red kites on the Cape Verde Islands are (or rather were) quite distinct in morphology, being somewhat intermediate with black kites. The question whether the Cape Verde kite should be considered a distinct species (Milvus fasciicauda) or a red kite subspecies has not been settled. A mitochondrial DNA study on museum specimens suggested that Cape Verde birds did not form a monophyletic lineage among or next to red kites. This interpretation is problematic: mtDNA analysis is susceptible to hybridization events, the evolutionary history of the Cape Verde population is not known, and the genetic relationship of red kites is confusing, with geographical <b>proximity</b> being no <b>indicator</b> of genetic relatedness and the overall genetic similarity high, perhaps indicating a relict species. Given the morphological distinctness of the Cape Verde birds and that the Cape Verde population was isolated from other populations of red kites, it cannot be conclusively resolved as to whether the Cape Verde population was not a distinct subspecies (as M. migrans fasciicauda) or even species that frequently absorbed stragglers from the migrating European populations into its gene pool. The Cape Verde population became effectively extinct since 2000, all surviving birds being hybrids with black kites.|$|R
