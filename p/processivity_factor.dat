5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication <b>processivity</b> <b>factor</b> PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E

In the second chapter, I focus on the role of D 4, which also functions as a uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) repair enzyme.

Additionally, Nf double-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP) greatly stimulated the in vitro formation of the TP-dAMP initiation complex by decreasing the Km value for dATP of the Nf DNA polymerase by > 20 -fold.

40|$|Due to {{the limited}} processivity of replicative DNA polymerases (replicases), {{as well as to}} their {{incapacity}} to unwind parental duplex DNA to allow replication fork progression, their replication efficiency depends on the functional assistance of accessory proteins as <b>processivity</b> <b>factors</b> and helicases. In addition, the inability of DNA polymerases to start de novo DNA synthesis requires the use of a short RNA/DNA molecule to provide the 3 ’-OH group required to initiate DNA replication. This requisite for a primer creates a dilemma to replicate the ends of linear genomes: once the last primer for the lagging strand synthesis is removed, a portion of ssDNA {{at the end of the}} genome will remain uncopied. Bacteriophage φ 29 has overcome these issues by means of the unique catalytic features of an outstanding enzyme, the φ 29 DNA polymerase. This replicase belongs to the family B (eukaryotic-type) of DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and has served as model to understand the enzymology of these polymerases. As most of the family B members, φ 29 DNA polymerase contains both 3 ´- 5 ´ exonuclease and polymerization activities residing in two structurally independent domains. During two decades, site-directed mutagenesis studies of individual residues contained in regions of high amino acid similarity have provided the functional insights of this enzyme, extrapolative to other family B members. However, φ 29 DNA polymerase is endowed with two distinctive features: high processivity and strand displacement capacity that allow it to replicate the viral genome from a single binding event, without requiring the assistance of unwinding and <b>processivity</b> <b>factors.</b> Recent crystallographic resolution of the structure of the apo and binary/ternary complexes of φ 29 DNA polymerase, together with the biochemical studies of site-directed mutants, have given insights into the structural basis responsible for the coordination of the processive polymerization and strand displacement. In addition, such structures have provided the mechanism of translocation of family B DNA polymerases. Another difference with respect to the rest of replicases is the ability of φ 29 DNA polymerase to use a protein (terminal protein, TP) as primer, circumventing the end replication problem. Recent resolution of the structure of the φ 29 DNA polymerase/TP heterodimer, together with the biochemical analysis of chimerical DNA polymerases and TPs, have given the clues of the specificity of the interaction between both proteins, suggesting a model for the transition from initiation to elongation. We will also discuss how the basic research on the φ 29 DNA polymerase properties have led to the development of DNA amplification technologies based on this outstanding enzyme. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In the absence of <b>processivity</b> <b>factors</b> (PCNA, RF-C, and ATP), pol δ elongated primers on single-stranded DNA templates in a distributive manner. However, the enzyme was capable of processive synthesis by filling gaps of 5 – 9 nt in DNA duplexes.

Interaction of pol δ with the proximal 5 ′-terminus restricting the gap was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Analysis of the enzyme binding to DNA duplexes containing gaps of various sizes showed a much higher affinity of pol δ for duplexes with gaps of about 10 nt than for DNA substrates with primers annealed to single-stranded templates. The most efficient pol δ binding was observed in experiments with DNA substrates containing unpaired 3 ′-tails in primers.

With respect to transfer to the next generation, many marks are removed as described above. Emerging studies are finding patterns of epigenetic conservation across generations. For instance, centromeric satellites resist demethylation. The mechanism responsible for this conservation is not known, though some evidence suggests that methylation of histones may contribute.

What are the evolutionary solutions for DNA replicases associated with smaller genomes? Are there some general principles? To address these questions we analyzed DNA replicases of double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. In the process we discovered highly divergent B-family DNA polymerases in phiKZ-like phages and remote sliding clamp homologs in Ascoviridae family and Ma-LMM 01 phage. The analysis revealed a clear dependency between DNA replicase components and the viral genome size.

In addition to processivity, the PF BMRF 1 of Epstein–Barr virus can function as a transactivator to activate the BHLF 1 promoter within the lytic origin of replication (oriLyt), which is assumed to facilitate DNA replication through remodelling viral chromatin structure. BMRF 1 {{is known to be}} phosphorylated by the viral BGLF 4 kinase, but its impact on BMRF 1 function is unclear. Seven candidate BGLF 4 target sites were predicted within a proline-rich region between the DNA-processivity and nuclear-localization domains of BMRF 1. We show that four of these residues, Ser- 337, Thr- 344, Ser- 349 and Thr- 355, are responsible for the BGLF 4 -induced hyperphosphorylation of BMRF 1. In functional analyses, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of BMRF 1 shows similar nuclear localization, as well as DNA-binding ability, to the wild type; however, it displays stronger synergistic activation of the BHLF 1 promoter with Zta. Notably, BGLF 4 downregulates BMRF 1 transactivation and enhances the transactivation activity of Zta and the synergistic activation of BMRF 1 and Zta on the BHLF 1 promoter.

At a site of lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication.

Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot.

By screening a λgt 11 HHV- 7 cDNA library, the gene encoding the protein was identified as the U 27 open reading frame previously reported [J. Virol. (1996) 70, 5975 – 5989]. Immunofluorescent studies showed a punctate nuclear localization of the protein in both HHV- 7 -infected cells and transfected cells. A computer program predicted two classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant of the protein could not enter the nucleus, whereas green fluorescent protein or maltose binding protein fused to the C-terminal region of the protein was transported into the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that the predicted C-terminal, but not middle, NLS of the protein actually function as NLS. In addition, nuclear transport of a maltose binding protein-fusion protein containing the C-terminal NLS of the U 27 protein was inhibited by both wheat germ agglutinin and a Q 69 L Ran-GTP mutant, indicating that the U 27 protein is transported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm by means of classic nuclear transport machinery.

The Pol γ structure also provides a context for interpreting the phenotypes of disease-related mutations in the polymerase and establishes a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity of anti-retroviral drugs targeting HIV reverse transcriptase...|$|E
40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} DNA polymerase {{consists of}} a catalytic subunit, UL 54, and a presumed <b>processivity</b> <b>factor,</b> UL 44. We have solved the crystal structure of residues 1 - 290 of UL 44 to 1. 85 A resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion. The structure reveals a dimer of UL 44 {{in the shape of}} a C clamp. Each monomer of UL 44 shares its overall fold with other processivity factors, including herpes simplex virus UL 42, which is a monomer that binds DNA directly, and the sliding clamp, PCNA, which is a trimer that surrounds DNA, although these proteins share no obvious sequence homology. Analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration measurements demonstrated that UL 44 also forms a dimer in solution, and substitution of large hydrophobic residues along the homodimer interface with alanine disrupted dimerization and decreased DNA binding. UL 44 represents a hybrid <b>processivity</b> <b>factor</b> as it binds DNA directly like UL 42, but forms a C clamp that may surround DNA like PCNA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sliding DNA clamps are <b>processivity</b> <b>factors</b> {{that are}} {{required}} for efficient DNA replication. DNA polymerases maintain proximity to nucleic acid templates by interacting with sliding clamps that encircle DNA and thereby link the polymerase enzyme to the DNA substrate. Although the structures of sliding clamps from Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), eukaryotes, archaea, and T 4 -like bacteriophages are well-known, {{the structure of a}} sliding clamp from Gram-positive bacteria has not been reported previously. Results We have determined the crystal structure of the dimeric β subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes. The sliding clamp from this Gram-positive organism forms a ring-shaped dimeric assembly that is similar in overall structure to that of the sliding clamps from Gram-negative bacteria, bacteriophage T 4, eukaryotes and archaea. The dimer has overall dimensions of ~ 90 Å × ~ 70 Å × ~ 25 Å with a central chamber that is large enough to accommodate duplex DNA. In comparison to the circular shape of other assemblies, the S. pyogenes clamp adopts a more elliptical structure. Conclusion The sequences of sliding clamps from S. pyogenes and E. coli are only 23 % identical, making the generation of structural models for the S. pyogenes clamp difficult in the absence of direct experimental information. Our structure of the S. pyogenes β subunit completes the catalog of clamp structures from all the major sequence grouping of sliding clamps. The more elliptical rather than circular structure of the S. pyogenes clamp implies that the topological nature of encircling DNA, rather than a precise geometric shape, is the most conserved aspect for this family of proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|PMCID: PMC 1635332 Article {{available}} at [URL] paper {{shows that the}} protein-primed DNA polymerases encoded by bacteriophages Nf and GA- 1, unlike other DNA polymerases, do not require unwinding or <b>processivity</b> <b>factors</b> for efficient synthesis of full-length terminal protein (TP) -DNA. Analysis of their polymerization activity shows that both DNA polymerases base their replication efficiency on a high processivity and on the capacity to couple polymerization to strand displacement. Both enzymes are endowed with a proofreading activity that acts coordinately with the polymerization one to edit polymerization errors. Additionally, Nf double-stranded DNA binding protein (DBP) greatly stimulated the in vitro formation of the TP-dAMP initiation complex by decreasing the Km value for dATP of the Nf DNA polymerase by > 20 -fold. Whereas Nf DNA polymerase, as the 29 enzyme, is able to use its homologous TP as well as DNA as primer, GA- 1 DNA polymerase appears to have evolved to use its corresponding TP as the only primer of DNA synthesis. Such exceptional behaviour is discussed {{in the light of}} the recently solved structure of the DNA polymerase/TP complex of the related bacteriophage 29 This investigation was aided by research grant BFU 2005 - 00733 from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and by an institutional grant from Fundación Ramón Areces to the Centro de Biología Molecular ‘Severo Ochoa’.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus DNA {{polymerase}} {{consists of}} a catalytic subunit, Pol, and a processivity subunit, UL 42, that, unlike other established <b>processivity</b> <b>factors,</b> binds DNA directly. We used gel retardation and filter-binding assays to investigate how UL 42 affects the polymerase-DNA interaction. The Pol/UL 42 heterodimer bound more tightly to DNA in a primer-template configuration than to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), while Pol alone bound more tightly to ssDNA than to DNA in a primer-template configuration. The affinity of Pol/UL 42 for ssDNA was reduced severalfold relative to that of Pol, while the affinity of Pol/UL 42 for primer-template DNA was increased ∼ 15 -fold relative to that of Pol. The affinity of Pol/UL 42 for circular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was reduced drastically relative to that of UL 42, but the affinity of Pol/UL 42 for short primer-templates was increased modestly relative to that of UL 42. Pol/UL 42 associated with primer-template DNA ∼ 2 -fold faster than did Pol and dissociated ∼ 10 -fold more slowly, resulting in a half-life of 2 h and a subnanomolar Kd. Despite such stable binding, rapid-quench analysis revealed that the rates of elongation of Pol/UL 42 and Pol were essentially the same, ∼ 30 nucleotides/s. Taken together, these studies indicate that (i) Pol/UL 42 is more likely than its subunits to associate with DNA in a primer-template configuration rather than nonspecifically to either ssDNA or dsDNA, and (ii) UL 42 reduces the rate of dissociation from primer-template DNA but not the rate of elongation. Two models of polymerase-DNA interactions during replication that may explain these findings are presented...|$|R
