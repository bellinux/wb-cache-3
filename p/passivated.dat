5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is <b>passivated</b> by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. <b>Passivated</b> chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is <b>passivated</b> by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be <b>passivated</b> by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
30|$|After {{using the}} <b>passivating</b> layer, the {{recombination}} {{at the surface}} {{can be reduced to}} a very low value. The <b>passivating</b> layer can also work as ARC. Thus, paraboloid structure combined with the <b>passivating</b> layer can be used in PV devices for better performance.|$|R
50|$|Metals passivation: Certain {{materials}} {{can be used}} as additives which can be impregnated into the catalyst or added to the FCC feedstock in the form of metal-organic compounds. Such materials react with the metal contaminants and <b>passivate</b> the contaminants by forming less harmful compounds that remain on the catalyst. For example, antimony and bismuth are effective in <b>passivating</b> nickel and tin is effective in <b>passivating</b> vanadium. A number of proprietary passivation processes are available and fairly widely used.|$|R
40|$|Ion-implanted <b>passivating</b> {{contacts}} {{based on}} poly-crystalline silicon (polySi) are enabled by tunneling oxide, optimized, {{and used to}} fabricate interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells. Both n-type (phosphorous doped) and p-type (boron doped) <b>passivating</b> contacts are fabricated by ion-implantation of intrinsic polySi layers deposited via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and subsequently annealed. The impact of doping profile on the passivation quality of the polySi doped contacts is studied for both polarities. It was found that an excellent surface passivation could be obtained by confining {{as much as possible}} the implanted-and-activated dopants within the polySi layers. The doping profile in the polySi was controlled by modifying the polySi thickness, the energy and dose of ion-implantation, and the temperature and time of annealing. An implied open-circuit voltage of 721 [*]mV for n-type and 692 [*]mV for p-type <b>passivating</b> contacts was achieved. Besides the high <b>passivating</b> quality, the developed <b>passivating</b> contacts exhibit reasonable high conductivity (Rsh[*]n-type[*]=[*] 95 Ω/□ and Rsh[*]p-type[*]=[*] 120 [*]Ω/□). An efficiency of 19. 2 % (Voc[*]=[*] 673 [*]mV, Jsc[*]=[*] 38. 0 [*]mA/cm 2, FF[*]=[*] 75. 2 %, and pseudo-FF[*]=[*] 83. 2 %) was achieved on a front-textured IBC solar cell with polySi <b>passivating</b> contacts as both back surface field and emitter.

25|$|Although {{chromium}} (Cr), iron (Fe), and aluminium (Al) readily dissolve in dilute nitric acid, the {{concentrated acid}} forms a metal-oxide layer {{that protects the}} bulk of the metal from further oxidation. The formation of this protective layer is called passivation. Typical passivation concentrations range from 20% to 50% by volume (see ASTM A967-05). Metals that are <b>passivated</b> by concentrated nitric acid are iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and aluminium.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, many metal ions {{react with}} hydrogen sulfide {{to give the}} corresponding metal sulfides. This conversion is widely exploited. For example, gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metal sulfides. In the purification of metal ores by flotation, mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation. Metal parts are sometimes <b>passivated</b> with hydrogen sulfide. Catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide, and the behavior of metallic catalysts used {{in other parts of}} a refinery is also modified using hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
40|$|Although redox {{shuttles}} {{have been}} demonstrated to provide overcharge protection for up to 200 cycles, {{the existence of the}} solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI), a <b>passivating</b> film on the negative electrode, seems to be inherently incompatible with a successful shuttle reaction. In this work, the kinetics of ferrocene is measured in the presence and absence of <b>passivating</b> films using rotating-disk-electrode voltammetry. The steady-state current-voltage curve is described by a simple model of Butler-Volmer kinetics and a through-film limiting current. The presence of a <b>passivating</b> film decreases both the limiting current and the effective rate con-stant. Both parameters decrease with increased passivation time; a decreasing porosity is a possible explanation for the latter obser-vation. The characterization method developed in this work allows direct measurements of the effect of <b>passivating</b> films, thus contributing to understanding of passivation phenomena in nonaqueous electrolytes...|$|R
40|$|The <b>passivating</b> {{ability of}} surface film derived from vinylene {{carbonate}} (VC) is addressed on tin (Sn) negative electrode after a comparative {{study on the}} thickness, film growth pattern, chemical composition, and mechanical flexibility of the surface films gen-erated from VC-free and VC-added electrolytes. The surface film derived from the former electrolyte is enriched by inorganic fluo-rinated and carbonate species, and shows a poor <b>passivating</b> ability to cause a continued electrolyte decomposition, film growth and eventual electrode failure. In contrast, organic carbon-oxygen species are dominant in the film derived from the VC-added electrolyte. Even if this film is thinner than the other, it <b>passivates</b> the Sn electrode surface more effectively. As a result, the film growth and electrode polarization are less significant. The superior <b>passivating</b> ability of organic-rich surface film has been ascribed to a uniform coverage and higher mechanical flexibility...|$|R
40|$|Since most commercially {{available}} solar cells are still made from silicon, we are exploring {{the introduction of}} <b>passivating</b> qualities in oxides, {{with the potential to}} serve as an antireflection coating. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was used to deposit TiO 2 and SrTiO 3 coatings on silicon substrates. Introduction of <b>passivating</b> qualities was achieved by changing the deposition ambient and/or deposition set-up (not placing the substrate in the customary position parallel to the target surface but perpendicular to it). This change in deposition set-up resulted in a remarkable increase in <b>passivating</b> qualities for TiO 2 coatings. The plasma shape and place of the substrate in the plasma influenced greatly properties as smoothness, thickness distribution and <b>passivating</b> quality. The particle energy on arrival at the substrate and the oxygen content at the surface appeared to be key parameters in achieving surface passivation of silicon...|$|R
25|$|The {{alkaline}} {{chemical environment}} {{provided by the}} alkali reserve (KOH, NaOH) and the portlandite (calcium hydroxide) contained in the hardened cement paste causes a passivating film to form {{on the surface of}} the steel, making it much more resistant to corrosion than it would be in neutral or acidic conditions. When the cement paste is exposed to the air and meteoric water reacts with the atmospheric CO2, portlandite and the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) of the hardened cement paste become progressively carbonated and the high pH gradually decreases from 13.5 – 12.5 to 8.5, the pH of water in equilibrium with calcite (calcium carbonate) and the steel is no longer <b>passivated.</b>|$|E
25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other nanostructure. In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was <b>passivated</b> with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E
25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in <b>passivated</b> alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the transition of an iron electrode from active to passive state in a sulphuric acid solution. It {{was found that the}} active-passive transition was an auto-catalytic process in which a pre-passive film grew on the electrode surface. The growing pre-passive film had a fractal edge whose dimension was affected by the applied <b>passivating</b> potential and the presence of chlorides in the solution. Applying a more positive <b>passivating</b> potential led to a faster active-passive transition and resulted in a more irregular pre-passive film. If chlorides were introduced into the sulphuric acid solution, the active-passive transition became more rapid and the pre-passive film more irregular. Apart from the influence on the growth of the pre-passive film, the presence of chlorides in the <b>passivating</b> solution was found to deteriorate the stability of the final passive film. All these phenomena can be understood if the <b>passivating</b> iron electrode is regarded as a dissipative system. To explain these results, a fractal pre-film model is proposed in this paper.
