A special situation relative to Puerto Rico also contributed to the imbalance at that time before the passage of the ACA.

2500|$|One of Symonds' {{biological}} parents was of West Indian {{background and the}} other was believed to be of Danish or Swedish descent. Symonds' adoptive parents Ken and Barbara moved to Australia shortly after his adoption, when he was three months old. [...] Of the adopted siblings, Louise Symonds participated in Gladiators.

40|$|Under the new fee schedule, Medicare {{physician}} {{fees are}} 76 percent of <b>private</b> <b>fees.</b> Consistent {{with the intent}} of pay-ment reform, Medicare physician fees more closely approximate <b>private</b> <b>fees</b> for visits (93 percent) than for surgery (51 per-cent) and in rural areas as compared with large metropolitan areas. Variation in pri-vate fees across the country is consider-ably greater than it is for Medicare fees. Consequently, Medicare fees are most generous in areas that compare least favorably with the private market because <b>private</b> <b>fees</b> in these areas are well above average. These results shed light on the impact of the fee schedule and on the im-plications of using Medicare payment methods as part of a broad-based health reform...|$|R

40|$|<b>Private</b> {{transfer}} <b>fee</b> covenants against {{real property}} are increasingly {{under fire from}} Congress, federal regulators, and state legislatures. This fire has been fueled by strong advocacy from the National Association of Realtors. It will only {{be a matter of}} time before <b>private</b> transfer <b>fees</b> will also be challenged in state courts as not meeting the common law requirements for a servitude. As these bodies take aim at the <b>private</b> transfer <b>fee,</b> they literally must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. A <b>private</b> transfer <b>fee</b> that benefits conservation and environmental stewardship is consistent with the traditional use of a servitude and can provide a valuable benefit to property owners and the public. This article argues that <b>private</b> transfer <b>fees,</b> when used to fund conservation and environmental stewardship, meet the historical and modern requirements for a valid servitude, that courts should hold them enforceable, and that policymakers should exempt them from general <b>private</b> transfer <b>fee</b> restrictions...|$|R

'But for that Cosway,' she said (I spare you the epithet which she put before your name), 'with my money and position, I might have married a needy lord, and sunned myself in my old age in the full blaze of the peerage.' Do you understand how she hated you, now? Enough of the subject! The moral of it, my dear Cosway, is to leave this place, and try what change of scene will do for you.
