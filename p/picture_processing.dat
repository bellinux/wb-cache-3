25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the <b>Picture</b> <b>Processing</b> Unit). To keep costs down, suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion port connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E

All {{variations of the}} PPU feature 2kB of video RAM, 256bytes of on-die [...] "object attribute memory" [...] (OAM) to store the positions, colors, and tile indices of up to 64 sprites on the screen, and 28bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and sprite colors. The console's 2kB of onboard RAM {{may be used for}} tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The standard display resolution of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.|$|E

40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis {{can be employed}} as an exploratory method in electroencephalographic (EEG) data analysis. However, the assumption of statistical independence among the estimated components is not always fulfilled by ICA-based numerical methods. Furthermore it may happen that one physiological source can be split in two or more components. As a consequence, the estimated components must be further investigated to assess the existence of reciprocal similarities. In this work a method for finding residual dependency subsets of component is proposed. Firstly a hierarchical clustering stage is carried out to classify ICA results. Then the hierarchical tree is investigated at each level by two indices to evaluate the tightness of all clusters. At the same time clustered scalp projections are compared with a template, which is shaped by applying ensemble ICA to a training dataset. Results are shown on EEG data acquired in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) studies for emotional <b>pictures</b> <b>processing.</b> In this kind of experiment ERPs are measured whilst unpleasant and neutral images are shown to a subject. The clustering procedure and the performance indices succeeded in isolating compact groups of components. These components, taken together, reflect the brain's biopotentials related to emotional processing at different cortical areas...|$|R

We examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and expertise (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a conjunction approach to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert meditative state. Additionally, exclusive masking techniques revealed distinct interactions between state and group during LKM and FAM. Specifically, we demonstrated {{that the practice of}} FAM was associated with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural activation differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of state LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance.
