25|$|The annals give a brief {{individual}} {{description of}} events {{for each year}} (a few omitted), {{with a focus on}} the actions of the Carolingian monarchy, beginning with the account of Pepin the Short’s ascension through the dethronement of the Merovingian king Childeric III. The annalists <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the military campaigns of the Carolingian kings, justifying their actions in terms of a grand narrative of Carolingian peacekeeping and conquest in the name of expanding the Christian faith. The overthrow of the Merovingians is also portrayed {{in such a way as}} to legitimize the transfer of royal power between dynasties, emphasizing Carolingian adherence to Frankish traditions and the approval of Pope Zacharias in the matter.|$|E
25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} GR innovation, later {{adopted by}} Pinyin, {{was to use}} contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants from Latin to represent aspirated and unaspirated sounds in Chinese. For example b and p represent [...] and [...] (p and p‘ in Wade). [...] Another distinctive feature of GR {{is the use of}} j, ch, and sh to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by i these letters correspond to the alveolo-palatal sounds [...] (Pinyin j, q, and x); otherwise they correspond to the retroflex sounds (Pinyin zh, ch, and sh). Readers used to Pinyin need to <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> these spellings: for example, GR ju, jiu, and jiou correspond to Pinyin zhu, ju, and jiu respectively.|$|E
500|$|Maxwell's {{interests}} ranged {{far beyond}} the school syllabus {{and he did not}} <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> examination performance. He wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of twine, and the properties of ellipses, Cartesian ovals, and related curves with more than two foci. His work [...] "Oval Curves" [...] was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by James Forbes, a professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University, but Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself. The work was not entirely original, since René Descartes had also examined the properties of such multifocal ellipses in the seventeenth century, but he had simplified their construction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spelling}} of Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR) can {{be divided}} into its treatment of initials, finals and tones. [...] GR uses contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants to represent aspirated and unaspirated initials in Chinese: for example b and p represent IPA [...] and [...] [...] The letters j, ch and sh represent two different series of initials: the alveolo-palatal and the retroflex sounds. [...] Although these spellings create no ambiguity in practice, readers more familiar with Pinyin should <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> them: GR ju, for example, corresponds to Pinyin zhu, not ju (which is spelled jiu in GR).|$|E

2500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Hobson {{regarded}} Russell as a temporary capital only. On 18 April 1840, he sent Mathew on a second journey south; the Surveyor General was instructed to explore the harbours of Whangarei, Mahurangi, and Waitematā, and to <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a location on the southern shore of the Waitematā. Mathew spent two months exploring the various locations and rejected Whangarei and Mahurangi, but also rejected the site favoured by Hobson that later became known as Hobsonville. In his words, it was [...] "totally unfit for the site of the principal settlement, and indeed ill adapted for a settlement at all". Mathew recommended the Panmure Basin for the settlement, which had numerous advantages, but he conceded that access from the harbour was difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{was born}} at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. He joined Nottinghamshire in 1865 and played every {{consecutive}} Notts game over a ten-year period. He also made numerous appearances in representative teams such as the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series, the North of England cricket team and the All-England Eleven. [...] He played against W G Grace many times and had some successes, including twice dismissing him for nought in 1871. [...] Grace said after the second of these that he [...] "would <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> J C Shaw". [...] In the next innings, Grace scored a double-century. [...] Shaw's comment afterwards was famous for its ruefulness and {{it has often been}} quoted: [...] "I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes".|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{the provincial}} {{government}} of Gordon Campbell appointed Hughes to examine British Columbia's method of reviewing child deaths, following the violent death of an aboriginal girl in foster care. [...] In his report, Hughes blamed a constant turnover in leadership, major policy shifts, and the Campbell government's budget cuts for undermining the system. [...] He recommended {{the creation of a}} new, independent body to oversee provincial child welfare, and advised that the government <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the needs of aboriginal communities. [...] Hughes added that if the government did not take steps to improve the situation, he would conduct a speaking tour of the province to shame it into action. [...] The following month, Attorney-General Wally Oppal tabled legislation to establish a new, independent watchdog organization for children's services.|$|E

2500|$|Proof {{that the}} Church is {{persistently}} striving {{to strengthen its}} political influence in socialist countries is witnessed {{by the fact that}} Pope John Paul II gives his support to the emigre hierarchy of the so-called Ukrainian Catholic Church [...] [...] [...]. The current tactic of Pope John Paul II and the Roman Curia lies in the attempts to strengthen the position of the Church in all socialist countries as they have done in Poland, where the Vatican tried to raise the status of the Catholic Church to a state within a state. In the last few years, the Vatican has paid particular attention to the question of Catholicism of the Slavonic nations. This is poignantly underscored by the Pope when he states that he is not only a Pope of Polish origin, but the first Slavic Pope, and he will <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Christianization of all Slavic nations.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014 the FCA {{found that}} Wonga's debt {{collection}} practices were unfair and ordered that they compensate affected customers. The FCA found that between October 2008 and November 2010, Wonga had sent their customers letters purporting {{to be from}} non-existent law firms [...] "Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon" [...] and [...] "Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries", described as [...] "fake" [...] in reports, to collect money from them. In some cases, customers were charged for the supposed lawyers' fees for these letters; Labour MP Stella Creasy asked why the police were not investigating. This practice had been uncovered by the OFT in 2011, after Wonga was asked to disclose information about its debt collection practices. [...] "Wonga's misconduct was very serious because it {{had the effect of}} exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears," [...] said Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA. He added: [...] "The FCA expects firms to <b>pay</b> <b>particular</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting their loan repayments". Richard Lloyd of Which? described the findings as [...] "a shocking new low for the payday industry that is already dogged by bad practice and Wonga deserves to have the book thrown at it." [...] Wonga UK managing director, Tessa Cook, said: [...] "Today is not a proud day for Wonga and I'd like to apologise". As the misconduct happened before the FCA took over the regulation of payday lenders, it is unable to fine Wonga. It also said there would be no criminal investigation as it wanted to set up a compensation scheme (of about £2.6 million) as quickly as possible and a criminal probe would take time. However, the issue was later passed onto the police for potential criminal investigation.|$|E
