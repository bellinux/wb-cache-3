40|$|Airlines network {{choices are}} {{analysed}} {{to describe the}} co-existence of alternative business models: the full service model based on the hub-and-spoke (HS) system and the low cost model based on point-to-point (PP) system. The analysis is carried on both theoretically and empirically. In the theoretical part, we show that {{the rise of the}} low costs business model can be the consequence of a simple two-player game. When two carriers compete in designing their network configurations (HS or PP), asymmetric equilibria emerge, i. e. one carrier will choose HS and the other PP. Full service carriers are stuck to a HS configuration to serve intercontinental destinations, whilst non-flag carriers implement a point-to-point network. In the second part, the recent network evolution in Europe is empirically evaluated by means of different spatial measures of concentration, such as Gini index, Freeman centrality index and Bonacich centrality. In addition, we also provide an airline-specific measure <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> based on scheduled time comparison of direct to one-stop services. Spatial measures <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> capture a reduction <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> in non-flag carriers and small changes in the network <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> flag carriers. Indeed, the time-based measure <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> suggests an increase <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> flag carriers. ...|$|R

The problem <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> The idea <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> as applied to human communication was introduced by Bavelas in 1948.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative methodological procedure for determining settlement centrality {{in the form}} of the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centralities,</b> expressed through numerical values. It offers easy-to-process data for further research. The calculated values <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> agree with the spirit of W. Christaller’s "classical" theoiy of central settlements. The simple sum of tertiary and quaternary contents of a settlement expresses no more than the wealth of its offer and only if we evaluate the importance of this offer can we reach the degree of the settlement’s potential centrality. Up to the moment when we determine the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a settlement, we remain in the domain of its nodal importance. The concept of nodality and the concept <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> <b>of</b> a settlement are two hindered concepts. The first may be called the concept of importance and the second the concept of relative importance of a settlement. In real life there is a whole range of transitive situations, from the good supply of the central settlement with tertiary and quaternary functions, whose capacities exceed the needs of the population in the gravitational area of the settlement, to the opposite situation, which is reflected in positive and negative values of the relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality.</b> Therefore, the balance between the supply of the settlement and the demand of the gravitational area can be defined as "ideal centrality". A comparative analysis of systems of central settlements on the basis of relative importance <b>of</b> <b>centrality</b> shows some inter-regional relations. The poor capacity of tertiary and quaternary activities in several larger settlements of the Osijek macroregion is especially prominent. An analysis shows that their specific position also means their satellite character. The system of central settlements in the Lika association of communes, on the other hand, is very well supplied...|$|R
