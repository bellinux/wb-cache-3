25|$|The BfR {{responded that}} IARC {{reviewed}} only {{a selection of}} what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called Agricultural Health Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished industry-funded studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader, Aaron Blair, who stated that agency policy required that he not consider this study. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of carcinogenicity, since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed agrochemical corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their <b>profit</b> <b>motives.</b> Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted it to be retracted. The corporation started a case against California's carcinogen classification in 2016, and lost the suit in March 2017.|$|E

This study examines the <b>profit</b> <b>motive</b> in some detail with particular reference to selected methods which have been developed to harness it in defense contracting.

Second, they enable doctors and scientists to receive and to analyze medical studies before the general public does, enabling them to be better informed when called upon to comment or to react by journalists or by patients.

50|$|Economic {{planning}} is not synonymous with production for use. Planning {{is essential in}} modern globalised production both within enterprises and within nation states. Planning to maximize profitability (i.e., within industries and private corporations) or to improve the efficiency of capital accumulation in the capitalist macro-economy (i.e., monetary policy, fiscal policy, industrial policy) {{does not change the}} fundamental criteria and need to generate a financial profit to be reinvested into the economy, lest it go into a crisis. A more recent critique of production for profit is that it fails spectacularly to address issues such as externalities which the board and management of a for profit enterprise are often under a fiduciary responsibility to ignore if they harm or conflict with the shareholders' <b>profit</b> <b>motives.</b>|$|E
