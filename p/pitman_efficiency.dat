Our numerical and theoretical results indicated that the optimal designs for the bivariate sign test are the alternative designs with quantifying order statistics with labels {((r+ 1) / 2, (r+ 1) / 2) }, when the set size r is odd and {(r/ 2 + 1, r/ 2), (r/ 2, r/ 2 + 1) } when the set size r is even.

40|$|A {{class of}} affine-invariant test statistics, {{including}} a sign test and a related family of signed-rank tests, is proposed for randomized complete block designs with one observation per treatment. This class is obtained {{by using the}} transformation-retransformation approach of Chakraborty, Chaudhuri and Oja along with a directional transformation due to Tyler. Under the minimal assumption of directional symmetry of the underlying distribution, the null asymptotic distribution of the sign test statistic is shown to be chi-square with p- 1 degrees of freedom. The same null distribution is also proved for the family of signed-rank statistics under the assumption of symmetry of the underlying distribution. The <b>Pitman</b> asymptotic relative <b>efficiencies</b> of the tests, relative to Hotelling-Hsu's T 2 are established. Several score functions are discussed including a simple linear score function and the optimal normal score function. The test based on the linear score function is {{compared to the other}} members of this family and other statistics in the literature through efficiency calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. This statistic has an excellent performance over a wide range of distributions and for small as well as large dimensions.

40|$|Classical {{univariate}} {{measures of}} asymmetry such as Pearson’s (mean-median) /σ or (mean-mode) /σ often measure the standardized distance between two separate location parameters {{and have been}} widely used in assessing univariate normality. Similarly, measures of univariate kurtosis are often just ratios of two scale measures. The classical standardized fourth moment and the ratio of the mean deviation to the standard deviation serve as examples. In this paper we consider tests of multinormality which are based on the Mahalanobis distance between two multivariate location vector estimates or on the (matrix) distance between two scatter matrix estimates, respectively. Asymptotic theory is developed to provide approximate null distributions as well as to consider asymptotic <b>efficiencies.</b> Limiting <b>Pitman</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for contiguous sequences of contaminated normal distributions are calculated and the efficiencies are compared to those of the classical tests by Mardia.

40|$|New test {{statistics}} are proposed for testing whether two random vectors are independent. Gieser and Randles, {{as well as}} Taskinen, Kankainen, and Oja have introduced and discussed multivariate extensions of the quadrant test of Blomqvist. This article serves as a sequel to this work and presents new multivariate extensions of Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho statistics. Two different approaches are discussed. First, interdirection proportions are used to estimate the cosines of angles between centered observation vectors and between differences of observation vectors. Second, covariances between affine-equivariant multivariate signs and ranks are used. The {{test statistics}} arising from these two approaches appear to be asymptotically equivalent if each vector is elliptically symmetric. The spatial sign versions are easy to compute for data in common dimensions, and they provide practical, robust alternatives to normal-theory methods. Asymptotic theory is developed to approximate the finite-sample null distributions as well, as to calculate limiting <b>Pitman</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Small-sample null permutation distributions are also described.

40|$|We {{consider}} the multivariate location problem with cluster-correlated data. A family of multivariate weighted sign tests is introduced for which observations from different clusters can receive different weights. Under weak assumptions, the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared random variable {{as the number}} of clusters goes to infinity. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is also given for a local alternative model under multivariate normality. Optimal weights maximizing <b>Pitman</b> asymptotic <b>efficiency</b> are provided. These weights depend on the cluster sizes and on the intracluster correlation. Several approaches for estimating these weights are presented. Using <b>Pitman</b> asymptotic <b>efficiency,</b> we show that appropriate weighting can increase substantially the efficiency compared to a test that gives the same weight to each cluster. A multivariate weighted t-test is also introduced. The finite-sample performance of the weighted sign test is explored through a simulation study which shows that the proposed approach is very competitive. A real data example illustrates the practical application of the methodology. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} analysis in an observational study determines {{the magnitude of}} bias from nonrandom treatment assignment that {{would need to be}} present to alter the qualitative conclusions of a naïve analysis that presumes all biases were removed by matching or by other analytic adjustments. The power of a {{sensitivity analysis}} and the design sensitivity anticipate the outcome of a sensitivity analysis under an assumed model for the generation of the data. It is known that the power of a sensitivity analysis is affected by the choice of test statistic, and, in particular, that a statistic with good <b>Pitman</b> <b>efficiency</b> in a randomized experiment, such as Wilcoxon’s signed rank statistic, may have low power in a sensitivity analysis and low design sensitivity when compared to other statistics. For instance, for an additive treatment effect and errors that are Normal or logistic or t-distributed with 3 degrees of freedom, Brown’s combined quantile average test has <b>Pitman</b> <b>efficiency</b> close to that of Wilcoxon’s test but has higher power in a sensitivity analysis, while a version of Noether’s test has poor <b>Pitman</b> <b>efficiency</b> in a randomized experiment but much higher design sensitivity so it is vastly more powerful than Wilcoxon’s statistic in a sensitivity analysis if the sample size is sufficiently large. A new exact distribution-free test is proposed that rejects if either Brown’s test or Noether’s test rejects after adjusting the two critical values so the overall level of the combined test remains at α, conventionally α = 0. 05. In every sampling situation, the design sensitivity of the adaptive test equals the larger of the two design sensitivities of the component tests. The adaptive test exhibits good power in sensitivity analyses asymptotically and in simulations. In one sampling situation—Normal errors and an additive effect that is three-quarters of the standard deviation with 500 matched pairs—the power of Wilcoxon’s test in a sensitivity analysis was 2 % {{and the power of the}} adaptive test was 87 %.
