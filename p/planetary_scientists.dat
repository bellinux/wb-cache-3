5|$|The Nibiru cataclysm is a {{supposed}} disastrous encounter between the Earth {{and a large}} planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) which certain groups believe {{will take place in}} the early 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Planet X or Nibiru. The idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax.|$|E

5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context, but later work superseded his proposals.|$|E

5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> {{their first}} view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|At one time, {{theories}} {{advocating the}} lunar origin of tektites enjoyed considerable support {{as part of}} a spirited controversy about the origin of tektites that occurred during the 1960s. Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that are vastly uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of hypervelocity impacts. In addition, various studies have shown that hypervelocity impacts are likely quite capable of producing low volatile melts with extremely low water content. The consensus of Earth and <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> regards the chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk composition evidence as decisively demonstrating that tektites are derived from terrestrial crustal rock, i.e. sedimentary rocks, that are unlike any known lunar crust.|$|E
25|$|Infrared spectra {{taken by}} NASA's Galileo {{spacecraft}} show distinct absorptions on Jupiter's moon Europa {{that have been}} attributed to one or more sulfuric acid hydrates. Sulfuric acid in solution with water causes significant freezing-point depression of water's melting point, down to , and this would make the existence of liquid solutions beneath Europa's icy crust more likely. The interpretation of the spectra is somewhat controversial. Some <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> prefer to assign the spectral features to the sulfate ion, perhaps as part of one or more minerals on Europa's surface.|$|E

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{consensus of}} Earth and <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during {{the formation of}} an impact crater. During the extreme conditions created by an hypervelocity meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.|$|E

NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode.

25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> were not at all sure what to expect when observing Uranus.|$|E

500|$|The thin-ice model {{suggests}} that Europa's ice shell {{may be only}} a few kilometers thick. [...] However, most <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of Europa's crust that behave elastically when affected by Jupiter's tides. One example is flexure analysis, in which Europa's crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load. Models such as this suggest the outer elastic portion of the ice crust could be as thin as [...] If the ice shell of Europa is really only a few kilometers thick, this [...] "thin ice" [...] model would mean that regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface could occur through open ridges, causing the formation of areas of chaotic terrain.|$|E

500|$|The Moon used {{to rotate}} {{at a faster}} rate, but early in its history, its {{rotation}} slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation {{as a result of}} frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth. With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to the Earth. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the [...] "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once per lunar day, during the new moon phase we observe on Earth when the near side is dark. In 2016, <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists,</b> using data collected on the much earlier Nasa Lunar Prospector mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas {{on opposite sides of the}} Moon, probably in the form of water ice. It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago, before it was tidally locked to Earth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advent of}} {{unmanned}} spaceflight in the 1950s and 1960s {{provided an opportunity}} to observe Io up-close. In the 1960s the moon's effect on Jupiter's magnetic field was discovered. [...] The flybys of the two Pioneer probes, Pioneer10 and 11 in 1973 and 1974, provided the first accurate measurement of Io's mass and size. Data from the Pioneers also revealed an intense belt of radiation near Io and suggested {{the presence of an}} atmosphere. In 1979, the two Voyager spacecraft flew through the Jupiter system. Voyager1, during its encounter in March 1979, observed active volcanism on Io {{for the first time and}} mapped its surface in great detail, particularly the side that faces Jupiter. The Voyagers observed the Io plasma torus and Io's sulfur dioxide (...) atmosphere for the first time. NASA launched the Galileo spacecraft in 1989, which entered Jupiter's orbit in December 1995. Galileo allowed detailed study of both the planet and its satellites, including six flybys of Io between late 1999 and early 2002 that provided high-resolution images and spectra of Io's surface, confirming the presence of high-temperature silicate volcanism on Io. Distant observations by Galileo allowed <b>planetary</b> <b>scientists</b> to study changes on the surface that resulted from the moon's active volcanism.|$|E
