As such, {{they are designed to}} detect inter-trace drifts only, i. e. drifts that occur between complete process executions (traces), as recorded in event logs. However, <b>process</b> <b>drift</b> may also occur during the execution of a process, and may impact ongoing executions. Existing methods either do not detect such intra-trace drifts, or detect them with a long delay. Moreover, they do not perform well with unpredictable processes, i. e. processes whose logs exhibit a high number of distinct executions to the total number of executions. We address these two issues by proposing a fully automated and scalable method for online detection of <b>process</b> <b>drift</b> from event streams. We perform statistical tests over distributions of behavioral relations between events, as observed in two adjacent windows of adaptive size, sliding along with the stream.

Early detection of business process changes enables managers to identify and act upon changes that may otherwise affect process performance. Business <b>process</b> <b>drift</b> detection refers to a family of methods to detect changes in a business process by analyzing event logs (or event streams) extracted from the systems that support {{the execution of the}} process.

This paper proposes an automated and statistically grounded method for detecting sudden and gradual business process drifts under a unified framework. An empirical evaluation shows that the method detects typical change patterns with significantly higher accuracy and lower detection delay than existing methods, while accurately distinguishing between sudden and gradual drifts...|$|E

40|$|Bayesian {{nonparametric methods}} have {{recently}} transformed emerging areas within data science. One such promising method, the infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM), generalizes the HMM which itself {{has become a}} workhorse in single molecule data analysis. The iHMM goes beyond the HMM by self-consistently learning all parameters learned by the HMM in addition to learning the number of states without recourse to any model selection steps. Despite its generality, simple features (such as drift), common to single molecule time traces, result in an over-interpretation of drift {{and the introduction of}} artifact states. Here we present an adaptation of the iHMM that can treat data with drift originating from one or many traces (e. g. FRET). Our fully Bayesian method couples the iHMM to a continuous control <b>process</b> (<b>drift)</b> self-consistently learned while learning all other quantities determined by the iHMM (including state numbers). A key advantage of this method is that all traces -regardless of drift or states visited across traces- may now be treated on an equal footing thereby eliminating user-dependent trace selection (based on drift levels), pre-processing to remove drift and post-processing model selection on state number...|$|E

We consider all the cases. (1) The eigenvalues of F are in the right half space (i. e., eigenvalues with positive real parts). In this case the process grows exponentially fast. (2) The eigenvalues of F are on the left half space (i. e., the eigenvalues with negative or zero real parts). The process where all eigenvalues of F have negative real parts is called a stable process and has a unique invariant (i. e., stationary) distribution. In this case the process does not grow. When the eigenvalues of F have zero real parts (i. e., the case of zero eigenvalues and purely imaginary eigenvalues) the process grows polynomially fast. Considering (1) and (2) separately, we first show that an estimator, ˆ F, of F is consistent. We then combine them to present results for the general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic having properties similar to the commercial PZT- 5 A has been selected as the sensor material. A PZT piezoelectric sensor is installed on an appropriate location on the transducer in order to measure the ultrasonic amplitude and bonding time during the bonding process. This sensor has dimensions 1 mm × 1 mm × 0. 245 mm to avoid excessive loading on the transducer and to obtain a flat frequency response. A bond quality monitoring system has been developed to process and record the non-linear signal detected by the sensor.

In a typical matrix-based SPM image, drift is mainly seen in the slow scanning axis, leading to image distortion as seen in Figure 6 B. Note that the coordinate system origin in this simulation is in the top left corner of the image. Based on the analysis of the known surface structures or based on repetitive scans, we can determine the drift rate, which is usually a time-dependent decaying function, with a maximum right after the instrument start-up or a sample exchange [10]. If we use the scanning approach presented in this work, the data in the image are not measured successively, so the straightforward drift determination from AFM image is not possible as the drift influences interleaved values significantly (see Figure 6 C). However, drift can still be evaluated. As in each refinement level, we measure on the same area as was already measured in the previous iteration, and we even obtain data at exactly the same points (at row/column crossings); we can determine the drift rate already during refinement process for areas that are being refined.
