5|$|As of July 2016, Capital Bikeshare has two payment options: swiping {{a credit}} card at a dock or signing up online. At any dock, riders may {{purchase}} a single trip ($2), a 24-hour pass ($8), or a 3-day pass ($17), swiping {{a credit card}} at the station's kiosk to receive a code to unlock a bike. Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> one lump; $96 if <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID key that can unlock bikes without a code.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of the rank pyramid were the common soldiers: pedes (infantryman) and eques (cavalryman). Unlike his 2nd-century counterpart, the 4th-century soldier's food and {{equipment}} was not deducted from his salary (stipendium), but was provided free. This is because the stipendium, <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> debased silver denarii, was under Diocletian worth far less than in the 2nd century. It lost its residual value under Constantine and ceased to be paid regularly in mid-4th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Lottery offered {{its first}} Millionaire Raffle; 330,000 tickets were sold at $20 each, after which numbers were {{randomly}} drawn to win up to $1 million. The Lottery has held Millionaire Raffles irregularly: some during spring; but most {{have been drawn}} on New Years Day. Rules vary with each raffle; the top prize is usually $1million; generally, raffle prizes are <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> lump sum.|$|E

50|$|The Heritage Foundation {{estimates}} that the average household in the bottom quintile received $29,015 <b>in</b> benefits and <b>paid</b> $4,251 <b>in</b> Federal, state and local taxes.

In the top quintile, the average household received $21,515 in benefits and services and <b>paid</b> $69,704 <b>in</b> Federal, state and local taxes.

5|$|In the January 2003 {{transfer}} window, Albacete {{attempted to}} arrange his transfer to Celta Vigo, but the deal foundered on Albacete's {{need for a}} significant part of the fee to be <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> cash. A few weeks later, sports agent Alejandro Camaño bought half the rights to the player, thus enabling the club to pay the wages and complete the season successfully.|$|E
5|$|Kartodikromo {{was born}} in Blora, Central Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1890 to a low-ranking priyayi (noble) family. At the age of fifteen, he took up {{a job at the}} Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg, the {{national}} railway company of the Indies, in Semarang. In 1911 he chose to leave the company as he was disgusted by its racist policies, including the use of race as a basis for the amount <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> wages.|$|E
5|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of reparations were ever <b>paid.</b> <b>In</b> fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.|$|E

2500|$|Sistrom and Wilder's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Phyllis Dietrichson was Barbara Stanwyck. At the time, Stanwyck was not only the highest <b>paid</b> actress <b>in</b> Hollywood, but the highest <b>paid</b> woman <b>in</b> America. (Her {{eventual}} co-star MacMurray matched Stanwyck's prominence at the pay window: in 1943, he was the highest <b>paid</b> actor <b>in</b> Hollywood, and the fourth highest-paid American.) [...] Given the nature of the role, Stanwyck was reluctant to take the part, fearing it would have an adverse effect on her career. According to Stanwyck, ...|$|R
5|$|The $500,000 and $1,000,000 prizes were {{initially}} lump-sum payments, but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication. Contestants winning {{either of these}} prizes receive $250,000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> equal annual payments. The $500,000 prize consists of $25,000 per year for 10 years, while the $1,000,000 prize consists of $37,500 per year for 20 years.|$|E
5|$|The city spent a {{total of}} $30 million on its {{employee}} payroll, including various taxes, benefits and employee withholding.

5|$|The {{crossing}} {{had always}} been tolled, and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge, though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An automatic number plate recognition charging scheme (Dart Charge) began in November 2014. As a result, the charge {{can no longer be}} <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> cash and the old toll booths have been removed. A residents' scheme is available, offering further discounts for people living near the crossing.|$|E

5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E
5|$|At the time, it made Orr {{the highest-paid}} player in league history. But beyond that, the signing {{became one of}} the most {{important}} in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{left behind}} $15,000 in debts, {{and with the}} nation still {{in the throes of}} the Panic of 1819, his assets were not enough to pay off the obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> full in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling the treasury and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; the treasury contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
