30|$|Finally, if {{teachers}} {{are going to}} be successful curriculum designers, it might be necessary for them to learn about alternative skill sets (e.g., Ertmer et al. 2008) or frameworks (Hong and Choi, 2011) that get used and drawn upon by expert designers. Expert designers, for example, as opposed to engaging in “brainstorming” sessions often divert their energy towards identifying frames that might link the potential known variables and unknown variables in the generic equation: WHAT + HOW = VALUE. Discovering a new frame is not accomplished directly, but rather tangentially by searching for clues within the “broader problem context” (Dorst, 2011). The many contexts, concepts, and “themes” of STEM-integrated curriculum design could similarly be searched for clues via <b>purposeful</b> <b>discussions</b> (Binkhorst et al. 2015) with the aim being to discover new frames “that allow the central paradox to be approached in a new and interesting way” (Dorst, 2011; p. 528). Ultimately, if innovative learning experiences that make sense pragmatically {{are going to be}} included in STEM-integrated curriculum, it might be necessary to drive teachers towards moments of “insightful invention, discovery and disclosure” (Dorst, 2011; p. 528) rather than just expecting it will happen.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} a twofold journey of {{professional}} learning. Firstly, it endeavoured to engage Foundation Phase (FP) teachers in a participatory action learning and action research (PALAR) design, in order to adapt the study material of a distance Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) programme in Learner Support and, concurrently, to develop a scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} in order to improve the implementation of inclusive education of a wider body of FP teachers. Secondly, it endeavoured to improve my own scholarship of teaching and learning in my academic practice as a teacher of inclusive education at a Higher Education Institution (HEI) through facilitation and participation in the PALAR design. The study is epistemologically embedded in a critical, transformative paradigm to generate data through open-ended questionnaires, reflective diaries, <b>purposeful</b> <b>discussions</b> and classroom observations. The qualitative research took place in two phases and four cycles. Phase 1 of the study was explorative by nature to determine how the FP teachers who were enrolled in the ACE programme conceptualise inclusive education as well as to understand the problems they face in practice on a daily basis regarding the implementation of inclusive education. Fifty FP teachers enrolled for an ACE in Learner Support took part in phase 1. Phase 2 occurred with eight participants, all FP teachers from the same school. The researcher and participants formed an action learning set. The action learning set worked in four iterative cycles. These cycles led us from a vision of how to improve an ACE in Learner Support programme from a predominantly theory-based content to include a more practical element by emphasising the application of the theoretical knowledge in order to enact a more inclusive classroom. Congruently, a scholarship of teaching and learning was developed. Since these transformations resulted in the adaptation of the study material of the ACE in Learner Support, it could {{have a positive impact on}} a wider body of in-service teachers enrolling for further studies in a similar programme. The experience of the action learning set made the participants aware of the value of collaboration as well as of their own critical reflection skills, with the aim to develop scholarship in teaching and learning for life-long learning and, consequently, to become better at the implementation of inclusive education. Limitations of the research were the small sample and the qualitative mode of data gathering, which limited the findings in the sense that it cannot necessarily be generalised to other contexts. A further initial challenge was for the participants to accept me as not their lecturer, but a participant in the action learning set. The limited literature on inclusive education within a South African context also served as a limitation in this research. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to investigate classroom strategies focused on language that would facilitate cognitive processing and improve mathematical understanding along with examining {{the link between}} the strategies and elaborated, extended learning conversations. This involved developing strategies in the mathematics classroom for students to engage in extended learning conversations (elaborated discourse) to develop and demonstrate their understanding of mathematical concepts. The theoretical base for developing the strategies was grounded in the theories of Halliday, Bernstein and Vygotsky and influenced by those working in language development. The foundation for the study was an examination of teacher language usage in the classroom {{based on the belief that}} with language being effectively used one could actually make a difference to students’ understanding of mathematics. The study was conducted using a Participatory Action Research design with teacher as researcher working to improve the learning/teaching classroom practice and was carried out with two groups of students in a rural district high school. The first group consisted of year 8, 9 and 10 students and the second group consisted of year 6 and 7 students both in multi– aged classes. Data analysis was undertaken using a Grounded Theory approach. The study commenced early in Term 1 of 2010, with a follow up in the latter stages of Term 2 and was completed with collection of student responses late in Term 4. The learning/teaching strategies that were identified and developed were the Shared Experience, <b>Purposeful</b> <b>Discussion,</b> Blended Instruction and Student Peer Teaching strategies. The identification of these strategies presented a strong case for a Mathematical Linguistic Pedagogy combining elements of mathematical content knowledge and linguistic pedagogy. The strategies presented an approach to teaching and learning that combined elements of constructivist philosophy alongside elements of traditional teaching practice that focus on elaborated use of language. The use of the strategies enabled diagnosis of misconceptions as well as enhancing learning, providing for deep understanding and empowering students to share reflections of their own thought development and processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{description}} is provided of children's concepts and conceptions {{of time and}} the processes by which these are learned. Learning is approached from a phenomenological frame of reference in which the main concepts are intentionality, meaning, the creation of meaningful relationships and learning experiences. This philosophical and theoretical approach also draws attention to language and action and to cognitions and emotions in connection with learning. The empirical analysis of meaningful relationships and learning experiences is based on encounters between the individual and various factors in the learning environment such as the teacher, other pupils and learning tasks. The descriptive problems addressed here were focused on the products of learning, the learning process and the context. The intentions of the individual with regard to his or her situation are examined in the contexts of environmental inquiry, activity and voluntary working. The material was compiled in three stages. A preliminary survey was conducted in 1993 - 1994 with 22 second-grade pupils, after which the data acquisition proper took place in the didactic process laboratory of the Department of Teacher Education in Kajaani in 1994 and 1995 with a group of 10 first-grade pupils. The early stages comprised largely basic research, while the final stage of data acquisition performed {{in the light of the}} previous experiences resembled action research. Video recordings of the learning process were transcribed and analysed to produce content analysis. Material from the last round of data acquisition were analysed using a computerized observation program. The concepts and conceptions acquired by the pupils were deduced from the learning tasks and their experiences were gathered from pupil and teacher evaluations. The longitudinal study was monitored by means of field notes. All the pupils achieved conceptualization after the teaching period in accordance with the goals of the learning event. The principal nodes in the inquiry process were described as being formulation of the problem to be studied and conceptualization of the information. A meaningless problem would be reflected in direct copying of another pupil's question or of text from a source of information. The teacher occupied an important position in supporting conceptualization and sharing experiences in all the contexts, while the guiding process was structured by symbols recorded by the pupils. The girls in particular expressed a desire to share their experiences with others, although this sociability did not always imply sharing the meanings. The most important aids in the boys' meaningful learning experiences were computers, while the girls favoured concrete activities such as drawing or modelling. The tasks differed in the kinds of discussions that they aroused, with the investigatory tasks and demonstrations leading to the greatest amounts of <b>purposeful</b> <b>discussion.</b> Language had an important function for coping with the learning environment and for the expression of learning intentions. On the other hand, linguistic expressions alone tended to convey misleading impressions of either the progress of the pupil's conceptualization process or his or her meaningful experiences...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} change in societal values and economic structures is required to address increasing pressures on ecosystems and natural resources. Transition research has developed in the last decades to analyze the co-dynamics of technological, institutional, social and economic elements {{in the provision of}} key functions such as energy, water and food supply. This doctoral dissertation provides conceptual and methodological contributions to the pro-active governance of sustainability transitions. Three research gaps are identified that are addressed in this dissertation. First, a comprehensive conceptualization of learning in sustainability transitions is currently missing that comprises learning at multiple societal levels (ranging from individuals to policy-actors). Learning concepts are often not explicitly discussed in transition research even though learning is considered as fundamental for innovation processes, niche formation and development as well as breakthrough and diffusion of innovations. Second, methods for the analysis and design of transition governance processes are lacking that specify case-specific intervention points and roles of actors in the implementation of innovations. Third, participatory modeling approaches are only applied to a limited extent in transition research despite a high potential for supporting communication and learning. The conceptualization of multi-level learning developed in this doctoral research conceptualizes learning at different societal levels as specific learning contexts ranging from individual and group contexts to organizational and policy contexts. The conceptual framework further differentiates between learning processes, intensity, objects, outcomes, subjects and factors, allowing for a more detailed analysis of learning within and across learning contexts. Thus, learning contexts can be linked by processes that involve actors from different learning contexts (e. g., community groups and policy-makers), as well as exchanges of physical aspects, institutions and knowledge (in the form of "learning factors"). This research has also provided a classification of model uses in transition research that supports a <b>purposeful</b> <b>discussion</b> of the opportunities of modeling and promising future research directions. The methodology developed in this doctoral research aims at the analysis and design of transition governance processes by specifying the various opportunities to contribute to sustainability transitions through purposeful action at different societal levels, as well as related roles of stakeholders in implementing such processes of change. The methodology combines different streams of previous research: 1) a participatory modeling approach to identify problem perceptions, case-specific sustainability innovations as well as related implementation barriers, drivers and responsibilities; 2) a systematic review to identify supportive and impeding learning factors from the general literature that can complement case-specific factors; and 3) a method for the analysis and design of case-specific transition governance processes. Three case studies in Canada (topic: sustainable food systems), Cyprus (water-energy-food nexus) and Germany (sustainable heating supply) have been selected to test and iteratively develop the methodology described above. The results for each case study reveal that there are learning objects (i. e., learning requirements) in all learning contexts, which underscores the importance of multi-level learning in sustainability transitions, ranging from the individual to the group, organizational and policy levels. Actors have various opportunities to actively facilitate societal transformations towards sustainable development either directly through actions at their particular societal levels (i. e., context-internal learning) or indirectly through actions that influence learning at other societal levels. In fact, most of the learning factors require cooperation across learning contexts during the implementation process. The comparing of learning factors across case studies underline the importance of several factor categories, such as "physical a disturbance or crisis", "information and knowledge". Of the 206 factors identified by stakeholders, 40 factors are case-specific and not contained in the general, review-based factor list. This underscores the value of participatory research, as general, top-down analyses might have overlooked these case-specific factors. The methodology presented in this dissertation allows for the identification and analysis of case-specific intervention points for sustainability transitions at multiple societal levels. The methodology furthermore permits the analysis of interplay between individual, group, organizational and policy actions, which is a first step towards their coordination. The focus on sustainability innovations links the broad topic of sustainability transitions to a set of opportunities for practical interventions and overcoming their implementation barriers. The methodology presented allows for the analysis and design of these interlinkages between learning contexts. While the methodology cannot provide any "silver bullets" for inducing sustainability transitions, it is flexible enough to identify an appropriate abstraction level for analyzing and designing transition governance processes. The methodology developed in this doctoral research also provides several contributions for the development of participatory modeling methods in transition research. Thus, the participatory method supports an integrated analysis of barriers and drivers of sustainability innovations, and allows application in practice and education. The concepts and methods developed in this research project allow for reflection on transition governance processes from a systemic viewpoint. Experiences in the case studies underline the applicability of the concepts and methods developed for the analysis of case-specific transition governance processes. Despite substantial differences in the geographic location, culture and topics addressed, all case studies include promising sustainability innovations and the engagement of multiple actors in their implementation. The diversity and multitude of initiatives in the case study regions provides an optimistic outlook on future opportunities for large-scale sustainability transitions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Clinical {{competency}} committees (CCCs) are {{now required}} in graduate medical education. This study examined how residency programs understand and operationalize this mandate for resident performance review. Method In 2013, the investigators conducted semistructured interviews with 34 residency program directors at five public institutions in California, asking about each institution's CCCs and resident performance review processes. They used conventional content analysis to identify major themes from the verbatim interview transcripts. Results The purpose of resident performance review at all institutions was oriented {{toward one of}} two paradigms: a problem identification model, which predominated; or a developmental model. The problem identification model, which focused on identifying and addressing performance concerns, used performance data such as red-flag alerts and informal information shared with program directors to identify struggling residents. In the developmental model, the timely acquisition and synthesis of data to inform each resident's developmental trajectory was challenging. Participants highly valued CCC members' expertise as educators to corroborate the identification of struggling residents and to enhance credibility of the committee's outcomes. Training in applying the milestones to the CCC's work was minimal. Participants were highly committed to performance review and perceived the current process as adequate for struggling residents but potentially not for others. Conclusions Institutions orient resident performance review toward problem identification; a developmental approach is uncommon. Clarifying the purpose of resident performance review and employing efficient information systems that synthesize performance data and engage residents and faculty in <b>purposeful</b> feedback <b>discussions</b> could enable the meaningful implementation of milestones-based assessment...|$|R

DNP, a cellular metabolic poison causes thermogenesis resulting in fat burning and weight loss. Whilst extensively available for purchase online, research on user experiences of DNP is limited. 	 Methods A netnographic approach was used to describe user experiences of DNP via online public websites. Public websites discussing DNP were identified and a <b>purposeful</b> sample selected. <b>Discussion</b> threads were downloaded and a textual qualitative analysis conducted. Four themes containing 71 categories were generated. Results There exists a plethora of communal folk pharmacological advice and recommendations for DNP manufacture and use, together with associated harms and outcomes. The efficacy and untoward effects of DNP were described and discussed alongside the notion that DNP should only be used by experienced bodybuilders. Dosage and regimes for optimal use were also described. Conclusion This unique study provides a rich examination of the knowledge, attitudes and motivations of DNP users, illustrating the significant role of online public websites in sharing information. Further understanding of DNP users and the online communities in which they reside is warranted to facilitate engagement and formulate appropriate and effective policy responses...|$|R
40|$|Teachers‟ {{capacity}} to use classroom discourse to deepen student learning through sustained conversation is considered crucial to increasing students‟ intellectual development. Learners actively construct knowledge and develop understandings from their shared experiences and via interaction with others (Driver, Asoko, Leach, Mortimer 2 ̆ 6 Scott, 1994). However, talk that fosters students‟ {{capacity to}} reason {{is lacking in}} many classrooms (Alexander, 2006) and, what is more, teachers tend to control the discourse by asking a predominance of closed questions and using a question-answer recitation script which limits the exploration of students‟ ideas (Nystrand, Gamoran, Kachy, 2 ̆ 6 Prendergast, 1997). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how teachers‟ beliefs and knowledge about managing classroom discourse and their teaching practice was influenced by their participation in an action-research based professional learning intervention. The guiding framework for the teachers‟ professional learning drew on Mortimer and Scott‟s communicative approaches, which were matched to the phases of scientific inquiry. This study was a part of a larger research project entitled: Enhancing Classroom Discourse in Primary Science Education which utilised mixed methods and interpretive approaches, combining pre- and post-intervention observations and data collections involving a cohort of 12 teachers as well as a set of embedded case studies involving more extensive collection of data with five of the participants. These case studies provided the focus for this study. Analysis of classroom video as well as teacher questionnaire and interview data gathered before, during and after the professional learning intervention provided insights into the impact of the intervention on teachers‟ understandings about: quality talk; the classroom culture needed to support whole-class talk; and, the skills of using puppets to engage students in discourse. A more detailed analysis and coding of the transcripts of whole-class discussions revealed changes to the way the teachers used questioning, discourse moves and communicative approaches to orchestrate sustained conversations and the resultant impact this had on level of students‟ engagement and the quality of their talk. Following the professional learning intervention, the case study teachers gained a deeper understanding of substantive talk and of the complex role of the teacher in managing classroom discourse to sustain a culture for talk. They made significant gains in confidence and self-efficacy for managing classroom discourse and developed a greater understanding of the conventions that are supportive of substantive talk. The case study teachers increased their capacity to conduct more <b>purposeful</b> <b>discussions</b> and they developed sophisticated understandings about how to use teacher questioning and discourse moves to elicit, explore and probe their students‟ ideas and to develop cumulative talk. Ultimately, the teachers developed a repertoire of discourse moves to support their questioning and differentiate their management of class discussions in order to match their communicative approach to the instructional focus of the lesson and phase of inquiry. Consequently, their students participated more readily in discussion and they gave increasingly elaborated responses. Furthermore, they were able to generate cumulative talk and to give progressively more complex descriptions, explanations and reasons. Some teachers also used puppets effectively to establish a supportive culture for talk, set up convincing investigations, and elicit elaborated responses and explanations from their students. The findings of this research may be transferable to teachers who work in settings similar to those of the case study teachers. The set of codes that were developed to describe the teacher-student interactions will be useful for future researchers wishing to investigate classroom discourse. These codes along with the video footage and professional learning resources developed for this study will be used as the basis for future research and teacher professional learning. Further studies might investigate how changes to the teachers‟ discourse practice were sustained over time and what impact this had on students‟ learning outcomes. It would also be useful to understand how the improvements seen in whole-class discourse translate to the student-to-student interactions in both whole-class and small group discussions and whether students are able to manage the talk so that they use „talking for thinking‟. This study developed new approaches to and resources for teacher professional learning as well as new insights into teachers‟ discourse practices, which have informed an elaborated theoretical model that shows the variables impacting on quality classroom discourse...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Anatomy is an {{essential}} basic science for safe and effective medical practice. In 2006 the UK Anatomy Act was changed to allow the use of surgical procedures on cadavers. This has unlocked opportunities for new methods of teaching clinically relevant anatomy. This study explores how surgical procedures may provide a purposeful and memorable way for undergraduates to learn anatomy, compared with conventional teaching methods. METHODS Under supervision, a group of third-year medical students prepared for and then performed a shoulder hemi-arthroplasty after identifying key anatomical structures and surgical objectives. The procedure was performed in a simulated theatre environment. A focus group was used to collect qualitative data based on the learning experience. RESULTS The surgical approach and implant insertion were successfully completed, and the educational objectives of identifying and learning surrounding structures were met. The focus group found that the exercise presented a relaxed introduction to surgery, enabled learning by association, and provided a learning experience that was both <b>purposeful</b> and complete. <b>DISCUSSION</b> The preparation and completion of the procedure enabled the students {{to focus on the}} anatomy of the shoulder, by identifying and forming associations with surrounding structures. Uniquely, the surgical nature of this project also allowed undergraduate students to practice key surgical skills and principles. CONCLUSION The authors believe that learning anatomy via a surgical approach provides a relevant, in-depth, purposeful and enjoyable learning experience. This technique also provided a valuable insight into surgery...|$|R
40|$|American {{trademark}} law is expanding. The expansion {{began with}} {{the adoption of the}} Lanham Act in 1947. At that time and ever since, commentators and law makers alike referred to the Lanham Act as a codification of the existing common law. In fact, this codification was a selection and expansion of the common law. The United States has continued to expand trademark jurisprudence: from incontestability, to cybersquatting, to dilution - the notion {{of what it means to}} protect a trademark has continued to expand. During this time, the Commerce Clause on which American federal trademark protection is based has not changed. The result of this inextricable expansion is that trademark jurisprudence in the United States is becoming muddled. Originally, trademark protection was justified as a right of exclusion that was granted to the user of a sign for their exclusive use for as long as they used it and to the extent they used it. Now, the trademark right has come to resemble the moral right of attribution andlor integrity of civil law copyright systems. This may be appropriate if the nation had a <b>purposeful</b> debate or <b>discussion</b> on turning the United States trademark system into a system of moral rights. However, no such discussion has taken place. Rather, Congress has enlarged the trademark right at the behest of special interests without paying attention to the consequences. One consequence is that trademark jurisprudence now has a striking resemblance to that of the protection offered by moral rights in civil law countries...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{despite the}} lack of {{research}} focusing on socioscientific discussions in elementary schools some studies indicate that elementary students can, and are willing to, engage in <b>purposeful</b> science-based <b>discussion</b> (e. g. Naylor, Keogh & Downing, 2007), and that providing the opportunity for discussion among students can improve their reasoning and discussion skills without specialised teacher intervention (Kuhn, Shaw & Felton 1997). This study adds to this field of knowledge by exploring how elementary students handle a complex, environmental issue within the context of their everyday lives and in relation to society at large. Objectives: the overall objective of the study is to explore the nature of students’ talk and their use of general knowledge and personal experiences when they discuss the tension between everyday needs and combatting climate change. The research questions guiding the study are: •	What interpretative repertoires do 9 - 10 year old students employ when they discuss how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions? •	How are these interpretative repertoires used to understand the issue and legitimise, or question their everyday lifestyle? •	What role does science play in the students’ discussions? •	What role does conflict between students play in the discussion? Methodology: the work draws on Potter & Wetherell’s (1987) framework for discourse psychology, which maintains that individuals use interpretative repertoires to construct their own versions of reality in relation to the social context, in order to legitimise their opinions and action. Repertoires {{can be seen as the}} result of a discourse filtered through students’ own experience, interests and attitudes. The student participants (99 from Sweden and 72 from England) came from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. After a 10 -minute class introduction about the generation of carbon dioxide and its role in climate change, the students, in small groups of 4 - 6 people, were then asked to discuss and come to an agreed position about four suggestions that a government might consider for reducing CO 2 production (e. g. parents should not be allowed to drive their children by car to school. Not even when it rains). Each discussion was audio-recorded and transcribed, student utterances were categorised as interpretive repertoires, and these repertoires explored to see how they were used to legitimise opinions and negotiate/maintain social patterns. Overview of the findings: seven distinct repertoires were most frequently used by the students: i) everyday life, ii) science & technology, iii) society, iv) justice, v) environment, vi) self-interest, and vii) health. Health was so entwined with other repertoires that it could be regarded as a ‘superior’ repertoire pervading and outranking all the other repertoires. Science and technological solutions were often used as ‘magic bullets’ to maintain or improve things. The science & technology repertoire was commonly offered as ‘truth’ which cannot be questioned, and students did not think it possible to oppose such arguments. There are claims that more meaningful learning during discussion is likely through conflict than through agreement (Mercer & Littleton, 2007). This study shows that a wide range of repertoires were used when students were in both conflict and agreement. Agreement between the students was as productive as conflict - both approaches bringing in several perspectives on a complex issue. Conclusions: student-student discussions indicated that 9 - 10 year olds can use a range of repertoires and work creatively together on decision-making about climate change in relation to lifestyle, but they adopted two very different successful approaches – conflict and agreement. Health repertoires hold sway over others and science repertoires were often viewed as uncontestable. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify medical students awareness of “patients” as human beings and to see if they were conscious of the lack of information provided that would address the patient as “human being” including lack of statistics for various cultures, removal of information on complementary medicine as well as providing medical information that was without “heart. ” Background. The role of compassion is usually not well addressed in medical education. The authors were keenly interested in finding out how medical students would respond to the omission of pertinent patient information that would create a holistic model of a “person” including mind, body and spiritual concerns. Several scenarios of breast cancer and the use of medical informatics were presented to the participants without referring to any of the progression of the disease as anything but stages without identifiable human beings. We were especially interested in knowing if medical students would notice this blatant lack of concern. Dr. Roseman is a specialist in Spirituality and Medicine and Compassionate Care. Dr. Rana is a specialist in Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education. Both Assistant Professors share an interest in the development of humanistic physicians. Methods. Two presentations were given to the participants. The first half of 41 the presentation by Dr. Rana was on the “Role of Informatics in Detecting Breast Cancer”. The second half of the presentation was on the topic of “The Compassionate Physician” by Dr. Roseman. After the informatics section of the presentation, the 40 second year medical students were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire with 9 questions. Participation in the questionnaire was anonymous. The questionnaire was later analyzed to find out students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of whether the informatics portion of the presentation ignored cultural and compassionate aspects of case studies. Results. Two presentations were given to the participants. The first half of the presentation by Dr. Rana was on the “Role of Informatics in Detecting Breast Cancer”. The second half of the presentation was on the topic of “The Compassionate Physician” by Dr. Roseman.

The questionnaire was later analyzed to find out students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of whether the informatics portion of the program ignored cultural and compassionate aspects of case studies. Conclusion. We believe that most medical students are so used to scientific presentations that it is a deeply instilled philosophy that is often supported by the medical educational culture to view their patients as “their disease”. Although, medical students indicate a keen awareness of the importance of “compassion” for patients, they were not able to identify the lack of “compassion”. Results of the questionnaire from the medical students indicated the lack of identifiable cultural statistics and the <b>purposeful</b> lack of <b>discussion</b> of any integrative/complementary medicine treatments. We find this to be problematic particularly because it is not unique to the prominent model of medicine. However, we were pleased to read the humanistic themes identified by most participants relating to the importance of compassion. Grants. N/...|$|R
