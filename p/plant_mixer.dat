40|$|AbstractThe road {{construction}} sector {{has made a}} big research effort in recent decades, mostly aimed at better understanding the behaviour of the asphalt mixes contained in most such pavements. Hence {{the introduction of new}} binders, all based on bitumen as in the past but featuring polymers and reinforcements of various nature as well as innovative pavements. Moreover, newer regulations allow better predicting the behaviour of materials and their mixtures once laid, thanks to more rational testing methods. However both asphalt binder and asphalt-aggregate mixture show temperature and time-dependent behaviour. Rutting or permanent deformation is therefore the leading cause of pavement deterioration in temperate and warm climatic regions of the world while low-temperature cracking is a common problem in cold regions. The paper illustrates that the proposed innovative fiber/polymer compound may be potentially considered from now on as a relevant solution for sustainable long life pavements that do not deteriorate structurally, needing only timely surface maintenance and allowing reduced base course thickness (due to enhanced stiffness and fatigue properties) lead to a cost- effective and eco-friendly perpetual pavement design. Polymer Modified Asphalt (PMA) are modified asphalt concrete manufactured by feeding the fiber and/or the polymeric compound into the asphalt <b>plant</b> <b>mixer</b> after the aggregate has been loaded in to the mixer immediately before the bitumen is added. Fiber/polymeric compound asphalts may be preferable technology whenever a pavement is required to perform structural resistance, stiffness and resistance to rutting. One such application could be the manufacturing of ‘high-modulus’ mixes (EME), for laying heavy-duty base courses. These mixes are characterized by great coarse aggregate cohesion and high physical and chemical modified grade bitumens to obtain the EME 2 specifications requirements, in particular high stiffness modulus value at 15 °C and high fatigue resistance, allowing for reduced pavement thickness and greater longevity. Fiber/Polymer modified Hot Mix Asphalt (PMA) has been claimed to resist rutting since they are less susceptible to reduction of the asphalt cement viscosity with high pavement temperatures during the summer months while the fiber component increase the resistance to tensile stresses and consequent cracking. Laboratory assessment of such materials consisted in the evaluation of the mix compactability, moisture resistance, rutting resistance at 60 °C, stiffness modulus at 15 °C and 35 °C and fatigue resistance at 10 °C...|$|E

30|$|All {{steel fiber}} {{concrete}} mixes were mixed in a 4.6  m 3 (6 yd 3) drum mixer at the Texas Concrete Company’s (Victoria, Texas) precast plant. 1.5  m 3 (2 yd 3) of concrete was mixed for each beam. The six PSFC I-Beams were cast in two groups {{on two different}} days. Beams R 2, R 3 and R 6 were first cast concurrently in a long-line prestressing bed using Type-A steel formwork. The strands were prestressed by hydraulic jacks against the prestressing bed ends. The second group of three Beams R 1, R 4 and R 5 were cast 1  week after the first group. Concrete for both the groups was prepared in the <b>plant’s</b> <b>mixer,</b> transported to the casting location (prestressing bed), and placed into the formwork using a mobile hopper. During concrete placement, spud vibrators were used for compacting the fibrous concrete.|$|R

40|$|A method {{based on}} the use of an Adaptive Control Module (ACM) made thanks to the {{knowledge}} of the process state description is presented. The outputs of this module are the actual process commands and the inputs are constituted by an auxiliary control signal set. Each auxiliary control signal is computed by a usual SISO controller (e. g. PI type). The ACM structure and parameters are determined in order to obtain the desired dynamics between the auxiliary control signals and the process outputs. When the process inputs come into saturation, it is possible - thanks to the ACM - to project these input saturations into the state variable space and to choose among the set points specifications which of them may be lost and which must be held. The method is easy to handle. It enables non-interactive and feed-forward control. It can be applied with great success to bilinear systems. The example of a <b>mixer</b> <b>plant</b> shows the advantages of the method. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching <b>plant</b> is the <b>mixer,</b> {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single Shaft and Twin shaft mixer. The twin shaft mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost. [...] In North America, the predominant central mixer type is a tilt drum style, while in Europe a Twin Shaft is more prevalent. A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo. Conveyors are typically between 24-48 inches wide and carry aggregate from the ground hopper to the aggregate bin, {{as well as from the}} aggregate batcher to the charge chute.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{increased}} focus on sustainable construction, building products are {{being required to}} document the environmental impact associated with their manufacture and show continuous improvement. This article focuses on the concrete mixture and demonstrates how improved concrete quality {{can play an important}} role in developing concrete products with reduced environmental impact and contribute to sustainable development. Improved concrete quality practices and lower standart deviations of compressive strength result required average strength for a specified strength. The carbon footprint for the producer with S = 8. 6 MPa, was calculated to be about 41 % higher than that for the producer with S = 2. 4 MPa. Improved job-site cylinder curing practices can contribute to sustainability. Concrete mixtures can be optimized to contain low cementitious content with a target w/cm the lowest amount of mixing water content for a 12. 5 mm slump be used and higher workability levels can be attained with admixtures dosages. Proper maintenance of <b>plant</b> and <b>mixers</b> ensures reduced energy and waste, tracking concrete and ambient temperatures at the plant can help reduce the energy for heating and cooling the concrete. Monitoring batching accuracy ensures conservation of materials while reducing the variability of the concrete produced. This helps sustainability through reduced energy use in handling rejected concrete, supplying new concrete as a replacement, lowering the amount of coring, and lowering the amount of repair material. At this time, standard deviation in Indonesian concrete industry still high, therefore, opportunities for improvement of the quality and sustainability of concrete in Indonesia are very big...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} {{focuses on}} assessing productivity, cost, and delays for concrete batch plant (CBP) operations using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology. Data were collected to assess cycle time, delays, cost of delays, cost of delivery, productivity, and price/m 3 for the CBP. Two ANN models were designated to represent the CBP process considering many CBP variables. Input variables include delivery distance, concrete type, and truck mixer's load. Output variables include the assessment of cycle time, cost of delays, delivery cost, productivity, and price/m 3. The ANN outputs have been validated to show the ANN's robustness in assessing the CBP output variables. The average validity percent for the ANN outputs is 96. 25 %. A Time-Quantity (TQ) chart is developed to assess the time required for both truck mixers and the CBP to produce a specified quantity of concrete.

40|$|Rotor-stator mixers {{are widely}} used in the {{chemical}} and pharmaceutical process industries. Up to now, however, few papers discuss the mean flow and turbulence fields generated by them and their influence on final product quality. In this work, CFD results at different scales are used {{to aid in the}} scale up of crystal wet milling processes. CFD simulations were performed to simulate different scale mixers. In addition, wet milling studies were conducted at the bench scale to complement the CFD results and predict wet milling performance in larger scale mixers. The flow properties in a batch Silverson L 4 R rotor-stator mixer at 4000 and 6000 rpm were investigated. A hybrid technique was developed. The new method is computationally efficient compared with the standard sliding mesh method. Macro scale properties are predicted. The turbulent flow field and deformation rate field are compared and analyzed. After obtaining fully converged flow fields, one way coupled particle tracking calculations were performed using an efficient fast particle tracking code. Particles trajectories were recorded, and analyzed. To validate the simulated flow field, particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments were conducted. CFD simulations of Silverson inline L 4 R (bench scale), 450 LS (pilot scale) and 600 LS (<b>plant</b> scale) <b>mixers</b> were conducted at constant tip speed to investigate the scale up effect. The macro scale properties werer predicted. The mean velocity, turbulent and deformation rate fields were investigated. The flow properties of the 450 LS and 600 LS mixers are quite similar, but they are significantly {{different from those of the}} L 4 R (bench scale) mixer. Therefore, it may be resonable to scale up from pilot scale to plant scale by the general accepted tip speed scale up criterion. However, considering tip speed alone may lead to a significant discrepancy between bench scale and larger scales. Bench scale wet milling experiment were performed at 4000, 6000 and 8000 rpm using sucrose and mannitol in the Silverson L 4 R inline mixer. The crystal size decreases with rotation rate at both free pumping conditions and constant flow rate conditions. To investigate the effect of flow rate, wet milling of granulated sucrose in the Silverson L 4 R inline mixer with constant rotor tip speed were performed at different flow rates. It is found that the crystal size increases with the flow rate...|$|R
