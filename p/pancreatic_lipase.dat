25|$|The {{compound}} bortezomib with a boronic {{acid group}} is a drug used in chemotherapy. The boron atom in this molecule is a key substructure because through it certain proteasomes are blocked that would otherwise degrade proteins. Boronic acids are known to bind to active site serines and are part of inhibitors for porcine <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase,</b> subtilisin and the protease Kex2. Furthermore, boronic acid derivatives constitute a class of inhibitors for human acyl protein thioesterase 1 and 2, which are cancer drug targets within the Ras cycle.|$|E
25|$|Bile emulsifies fats {{contained}} in the chyme, then <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> cleaves triacylglycerol molecules into two fatty acids and one 2-monoacylglycerol. Enterocytes readily absorb these small molecules from the chymus. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are transformed again into triacylglycerides. Then these lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters) are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into nascent chylomicrons. These particles are then secreted into the lacteals {{in a process that}} depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and about 50% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal pancreas. Less than 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the pancreas. Similar to the salivary glands, most of the pancreas specific genes encode for secreted proteins. Corresponding pancreas specific proteins are either expressed in the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion of food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> PNLIP, or expressed in the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets and have functions related to secreted hormones such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide.|$|E

25|$|Orlistat is the {{saturated}} {{derivative of}} lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipases</b> {{isolated from the}} bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug.|$|R
25|$|Orlistat {{works by}} {{inhibiting}} gastric and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipases,</b> the enzymes that break down triglycerides in the intestine. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the GI tract after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination {{is through the}} feces.|$|R
25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> still needs some time to develop.|$|E
2500|$|Digestion of some fats {{can begin}} in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine. [...] The {{presence}} of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids. [...] Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of [...] fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, {{as well as some}} undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Orlistat (Xenical) reduces {{intestinal}} fat absorption by inhibiting <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase.</b> [...] Some side-effects {{of using}} Orlistat include frequent, oily bowel movements (steatorrhea).

40|$|AIM [...] To {{determine}} whether pancreatic enzymes {{are present in}} hepatic bile and in intrahepatic bile duct epithelium. METHODS [...] The activity and proteins of pancreatic enzymes (<b>pancreatic</b> alpha-amylase, <b>lipase,</b> trypsin/trypsinogen) in hepatic bile were investigated using biochemical and western blot analyses in 25 patients with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. Immunolocalization of enzyme proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 20 necropsy livers with extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. RESULTS [...] Western blot analysis showed proteins of <b>pancreatic</b> alpha-amylase, <b>lipase,</b> and trypsin in 19 of 25 (76 %), 10 of 25 (40 %), and 14 of 25 (56 %) patients, respectively. <b>Pancreatic</b> alpha-amylase and <b>lipase</b> activities was present in every bile specimen. Radioimmunoassay showed that trypsin was present in every bile sample. Immunohistochemically, the immunoreactivity of the three enzymes was present in epithelia and in the lumina of intrahepatic large bile ducts, septal bile ducts, and peribiliary glands in all cases. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results strongly suggest that biliary epithelia of larger intrahepatic ducts produce <b>pancreatic</b> alpha-amylase, <b>lipase,</b> and trypsin, and that these enzymes are secreted into the lumina of intrahepatic bile ducts...|$|R

50|$|Lipase inhibitors {{belong to}} a drug class that is used as an antiobesity agent. Their mode of action is to inhibit gastric and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipases,</b> enzymes that play an {{important}} role in the digestion of dietary fat. Lipase inhibitors are classified in the ATC-classification system as A08AB (peripherally acting antiobesity products).Numerous compounds have been either isolated from nature, semi-synthesized, or fully-synthesized and then screened for their lipase inhibitory activity but the only lipase inhibitor on the market (October 2016) is orlistat (Xenical, Alli).Lipase inhibitors have also shown anticancer activity, by inhibiting fatty acid synthase.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States {{orlistat}} (Xenical) {{is currently}} {{approved by the}} FDA for long-term use. It reduces intestinal fat absorption by inhibiting <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase.</b> Rimonabant (Acomplia), a second drug, works via a specific blockade of the endocannabinoid system. It has been developed from the knowledge that cannabis smokers often experience hunger, which {{is often referred to}} as [...] "the munchies". It had been approved in Europe for the treatment of obesity but has not received approval in the United States or Canada due to safety concerns. The European Medicines Agency in October 2008 recommended the suspension of the sale of rimonabant as the risks seem to be greater than the benefits. Sibutramine (Meridia), which acts in the brain to inhibit deactivation of the neurotransmitters, thereby decreasing appetite was withdrawn from the United States and Canadian markets in October 2010 due to cardiovascular concerns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> is {{secreted}} {{into the}} duodenum through the duct {{system of the}} pancreas. Its concentration in serum is normally very low. Under extreme disruption of pancreatic function, such as pancreatitis or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the pancreas may begin to autolyse and release pancreatic enzymes including <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase</b> into serum. Thus, through measurement of serum concentration of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipase,</b> acute pancreatitis can be diagnosed.|$|E
50|$|Orlistat {{has a few}} adverse effects. Most {{reported}} {{side effects}} are gastrointestinal; including liquid stools, steatorrhea and abdominal pain. More severe and serious are interactions between orlistat and anticoagulants when given in combination. It can increase INR {{which can lead to}} insufficient anticoagulant treatment and bleeding. These adverse effects of orlistat are more common early in the therapy but usually decrease with time. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>lipases</b> do not only affect the hydrolysis of triglycerides but are also necessary for hydrolysis of fat soluble vitamins. Due to this, the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins may decrease. Therefore, it is recommended to take a multiple-vitamin supplement during orlistat therapy.|$|R
40|$|At present, the {{epidemic}} of overweight and obesity {{is one of the}} most pressing public health problems worldwide.

The safety of olestra has been established in over 100 studies in seven different species of animals, with confirmatory safety data coming from approximately 75 human studies; consumption of olestra at levels typical for savoury snacks does not result in reports of gastrointestinal problems in humans. This is consistent with the results of studies of the physiological and morphological effects of olestra in animals and in humans.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Assimilation of lipid {{nutrients}} {{depends on}} the efficiency of emulsified fat hydrolysis by digestive lipases. As shown in vitro, the activity of preduodenal and <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipases</b> is governed by the physicochemical properties of emulsions.

Fasted rats were intragastrically tube fed emulsions with different median droplet sizes (0. 6 &mu;m, fine; 22 &mu;m, coarse) or solute composition (0. 8 &mu;m, complex fine) containing 14 C-triolein and 3 H-cholesterol. Two and 5 hours after feeding, fat-droplet size was measured in gastric and duodenal contents, and lipids were radioactively quantified in different compartments.

Their digestion and absorption are unknown. This study examines the hydrolysis of galactolipids in vitro with human duodenal contents, pancreatic juice, and purified human <b>pancreatic</b> <b>lipases.</b> Galactolipids were incubated with human duodenal contents, pancreatic juice, pure <b>pancreatic</b> carboxyl ester <b>lipase</b> (CEL), and colipase-dependent lipase with colipase (Lip-Col). Hydrolysis was estimated as release of {{free fatty acids}} and {{by the use of}} [3 H]galactose or [3 H]fatty acid-labeled DGDG. Pancreatic juice and duodenal contents hydrolyzed DGDG to fatty acids, digalactosylmonoacylglycerol (DGMG) and water-soluble galactose-containing compounds. The hydrolysis of DGDG was bile salt-dependent and had a pH optimum at 6. 5 - 7. 5. Human pancreatic juice released fatty acids from MGDG, DGDG, and SQDG. Purified CEL hydrolyzed all three substrates; the hydrolysis rate was MGDG > SQDG > DGDG. Pure Lip-Col had activity toward MGDG but had little activity against DGDG. Separation of pancreatic juice by Sephadex G 100 gel filtration chromatography revealed two peaks with galactolipase activity that coincided with CEL (molecular mass 100 kD) and lipase (molecular mass 50 kD) peaks. In contrast to pure Lip-Col enzymes of the latter peak were as active against DGDG as against MGDG. Thus, DGDG is hydrolyzed both by CEL and by a pancreatic enzyme(s) with a molecular mass of 40 - 50 kD to fatty acids and lyso DGDG. MGDG, DGDG, and SQDG are all hydrolyzed by human pancreatic juice.
