5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|Portland {{has had two}} {{replicas of}} Philadelphia's {{original}} Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture had slipped off its supports. Repairs were made before the replica was paraded through the city on a flatbed truck, then <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> until Independence Day. The bell was publicly rung {{for the first time}} during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964.|$|E

50|$|So far, {{the society}} has had much {{support from the}} local {{population}} and the council for the area. In 2007, they bought 'Where the Rainbow Ends' cafe, and have since dismantled it and <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> for future use.|$|R
5000|$|This reactor was {{operational}} {{from the}} late 1970s to 1985, until it was shut down due to corrosion problems; fuel elements {{were removed from the}} core and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> dry <b>storage,</b> waiting to be transported to United States. [...] The installation of this facility did not have any public opinion controversies.|$|R
5|$|The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch {{refractor}} {{that was}} originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey {{for their own}} use. The telescope was the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E
5|$|Volia was {{surrendered}} to the Germans in 1918, but {{they were forced to}} turn her over to the British by the terms of the Armistice. The British turned her over to the White Russians in 1919 and they used her to help evacuate the Crimea in 1920. She was interned in Bizerte by the French and ultimately scrapped by them in 1936 to pay her docking fees. Her guns were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> and were later used by the Germans and Finns for coastal artillery during World War II. The Finns and the Soviets continued to use them throughout the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|It {{was taken}} down after the Glorious Revolution but was {{replaced}} by order of William III. In 1898 it was moved to a location {{in the garden of}} Gwydyr House but was taken down four years later {{to make room for the}} stands for the coronation of Edward VII. It lay on its back amid grass and weeds in a state of total neglect until it was re-erected in 1903 outside the New Admiralty building, but was displaced again when the Admiralty Citadel was built in 1940. During the Second World War it was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> at Aldwych tube station. It was relocated to its present site in 1947. The statue is listed by Historic England as a Grade I listed building, a status which it was granted in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{security}} gate murals have since been removed, or repainted grey. In 2008, new zoning laws required storeowners to install [...] "see-through" [...] gates, which required storeowners to de-install Franco's works. Aside from the gates still currently in use today, twenty five gates have been saved and <b>put</b> away <b>into</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Biposto {{was given}} to {{motoring}} journalist Dick Smith in mid-1953 as his prize for suggesting a new Packard advertising slogan.

It is now in Trafford Park Village at the junction of Third Avenue and Eleventh Street.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{extension}} of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path {{on the east side of}} the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s. Preliminary work on the conversion of Irish Pete for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> at Pendre.|$|E
5|$|To prepare aircrew {{for their}} {{rotation}} through No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, No.1OCU {{students participated in}} exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No.30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September–October 1969, {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23March 1970. From 21March to 25April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No.1OCU was disbanded on 9June 1971, following the withdrawal of No.2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No.2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No.1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No.2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No.82 Wing in 1973, No.6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No.1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No.1OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Surviving Finnish {{aircraft}} {{remained in}} service with the FAF aviation units HLeLv 13, HLeLv 11 and LeSK until 30 August 1948, {{when the last}} operational Finnish Hawks were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage.</b> In 1953, the stored aircraft were scrapped.|$|E
50|$|Following German reunification, {{freight traffic}} in the former East Germany saw a sharp downturn, leading to large numbers of {{locomotives}} being <b>put</b> <b>into</b> preserved <b>storage.</b> Beginning in August 1990, 243 922 (later redesignated 143 922) was thus hired to the Südostbahn (Swiss South-Eastern Railway). Also, increasing numbers of 243s were reallocated to Freiburg and Düsseldorf for testing by Deutsche Bundesbahn.|$|R
50|$|Most ZSU-57-2s were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> reserve <b>storage</b> {{while a few}} {{remained}} in service in tank training centres (as vehicles for driver training), {{until the end of}} the 1970s. Some were converted by army workshops into bulldozers. The last ZSU-57-2s were scrapped in the 1980s, while some dismantled vehicles were used as gunnery range targets. One is preserved in the Kubinka Tank Museum.|$|R
50|$|On 21 January 1971 at the MIRA {{high-speed}} circuit Dewis {{drove the}} only Jaguar XJ13 {{for a film}} promoting the new V12 Jaguar E-type. Despite a damaged tyre, and against the instructions of Jaguar Director, Lofty England, the car was driven by Dewis at high speed. The tyre failed and the car crashed heavily, almost destroying it. Dewis was unharmed. The wreck of the car was <b>put</b> back <b>into</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1802 copy from Les Invalides {{was taken}} down and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> on the Bourbon Restoration of 1814; but in 1837, under {{the orders of}} Louis-Philippe, it was rehung in his newly {{declared}} museum at the Palace of Versailles, where it remains to the present day.|$|E
25|$|While the Hilux used by Jeremy Clarkson and James May {{became an}} exhibit {{because of its}} achievement, the one used by the film crew was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage,</b> until it was later re-used by James May in 2010 {{in his attempt to}} get close to the still-erupting Eyjafjallajökull volcano.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a public}} appeal in 1956 a plaque was erected {{in memory of}} Currey in the Speakers Square within the New South Wales Parliament complex. During renovations in the 1970s the plaque was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> for {{safekeeping}} and was only rediscovered and restored to its place in 2008.|$|E
50|$|By 1999, all the warhead's {{various parts}} had been dismantled. The high {{explosives}} {{were removed from}} around the plutonium pits at the Pantex Plant and the pits were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> secure <b>storage.</b> Non-nuclear components {{were taken to the}} Savannah River Site and the National Security Campus. The canned subassemblies were moved to Y-12 National Security Complex, where recovery of the uranium began in 2012 and was completed in 2016.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 a 4,000 pipe concert organ was {{installed}} {{as a memorial}} to Prof. Milton Z. Tinker, for years supervisor of music in the local public schools. At {{the time of its}} installation it was among the largest municipal pipe organs in the world. In 2013, the University of Evansville purchased the pipe organ, dismantled it, and <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> <b>storage.</b> The University hopes to restore it to full operating condition sometime in the future.|$|R

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the T class diesel electric locomotive from 1955 onwards on VR's branch line network spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for the N class, gradually being retired as successive orders of Ts were delivered throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. Many were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage,</b> used only for seasonal grain traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{aircraft was}} <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> at Weir Cook Airport for 29 years {{until it was}} restored, then donated to the Frederick G.

The aircraft retired with less than 30 hours flying time.|$|E
25|$|After the Pressler {{amendment}} was passed, the U.S. placed sanctions and an arms embargo on Pakistan on 6 October 1990 {{due to the}} country's continued nuclear weapons programme. All eleven Peace Gate III F-16s, along with 7 F-16A and 10 F-16B of the 60 Peace Gate IV F-16s, which had been built {{by the end of}} 1994 were embargoed and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|A 200th flight over Nevada {{was first}} {{scheduled}} for 21 November 1968, to be flown by William [...] "Pete" [...] Knight. Numerous technical problems and outbreaks {{of bad weather}} delayed this proposed flight six times, and it was permanently canceled on 20 December 1968. This X-15 was detached from the B-52 and then <b>put</b> <b>into</b> indefinite <b>storage.</b> The aircraft was later donated to the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for display.|$|R
5|$|The EO-10 crew, {{launched}} aboard Soyuz TM-13 on 2 October 1991, was {{the last}} crew to launch from the USSR and continued the occupation of Mir through {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union. The crew is notable for having launched as Soviet citizens and returning to earth as Russians. The newly formed Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) was unable to finance the unlaunched Spektr and Priroda modules, instead <b>putting</b> them <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> and ending Mir's second expansion.|$|R
25|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1941 the {{aircraft}} carried out around 20 reconnaissance and propaganda missions in the Lake Ladoga area before ice conditions <b>put</b> them <b>into</b> winter <b>storage.</b> The aircraft were also used during the Continuation War to support long-range patrols behind the Soviet lines.|$|R
25|$|Jones made 18 {{instructional}} golf {{films in}} Hollywood between 1931 and 1933 {{in which he}} coached well-known film stars with golf pointers. The films were popular, and Jones gave up his amateur status while earning lucrative contract money for this venture. These films were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> and were unavailable for decades, but a surviving print was located 60 years later and put into video format for preservation by Ely Callaway, a distant cousin of Jones's.|$|E
25|$|The second {{prototype}} of the Ultra-light, which featured a modified nose {{so that it could}} accommodate a stretcher for its intended use as a casualty evacuation helicopter. In 1977, it was rediscovered in a derelict condition on a farm near Harlow and was promptly transferred to The Helicopter Museum, being moved to Weston-super-Mare in May 1979 and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> prior to its restoration. A set of original rotor blades, an engine and the original tail unit were acquired. It is currently undergoing long-term restoration at the museum.|$|E
25|$|A Temperance Hall {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Little Malop Street and Aitchison Place. It was erected in 1858/59, the {{foundation}} stone being laid on 15 November 1858. This distinctive conservative classical building with Barrabool freestone facade, ornate central parapet entablature supported on Tuscan Doric pilasters and matching entrance portal was designed by an unknown architect for the Geelong Total Abstinence Society. The Hall was later used as a Grammar School in 1864. The hall was demolished in 1978 to enable the construction of GPAC. The stones were numbered and <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage</b> for future rebuilding, the current location being unknown.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1930s {{the engine}} was {{purchased}} by Rahway Valley Railroad in New Jersey. Renumbered 15, the locomotive served primarily while the company's other locomotives were being serviced. The locomotive was the favorite of master mechanic Charles Nees. [...] "Perhaps not the most efficient engine, Rahway Valley No. 15 qualified as the line's most attractive." [...] When it was retired in 1953, having been replaced with diesel power, No. 15 was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> well-protected <b>storage</b> until it was purchased by F. Nelson Blount in 1959.|$|R
2500|$|Examples of {{conversion}} include: [...] 1) Alpha cuts down and hauls away trees on land s/he knows {{is owned by}} Beta, without permission or privilege to do so; and 2) Gamma takes furniture belonging to Delta and <b>puts</b> it <b>into</b> <b>storage,</b> without Delta's consent (and especially if Delta does not know where Gamma put it). [...] A common act {{of conversion}} in medieval times involved bolts of cloth that were bailed for safekeeping, which the bailee or a third party took and made clothes for their own use or for sale.|$|R
50|$|The Canon d'Infantrie de 37 modele 1916 TRP (37mm mle.1916) was a French {{infantry}} support gun, {{first used}} during World War I.
