40|$|International Workshop on Informatics (IWIN) 2010 The <b>portable</b> <b>terminal</b> is an {{important}} information terminal that contains a lot of individual information such as the address, the telephone number, the mail address, and the telephone call history, etc. now. Corporate use for the <b>portable</b> <b>terminal</b> increases, {{so it will be}} necessary to prove the incident to decrease the incident of the human factor in the future. For example, "Ignorance" that deals with information easily. "Fault" that is made false operation and loss / the theft of the <b>portable</b> <b>terminal.</b> "Intention" to make an intentional carrying out to perform illegal selling of the information. We propose the perpetuation of evidence technique in the <b>portable</b> <b>terminal</b> for the purpose of it proving the behavior of own and to prove the incident of the human factor. At the proposal, we consider two problems. A problem of the reliability of the evidence when we applied digital forensic to the <b>portable</b> <b>terminal.</b> A problem with little calculation resources of CPU and memory, etc. Our proposal method is to solve two problems for the hysteresis signature and priority level of the perpetuation of evidence...|$|E

The interface was enhanced by {{cooperating with the}} hosting computer where the terminal is connected to: the hosting computer shows a detailed image of the filled ballot. The displayed image does not convey any personal information, namely the voter’s choices, to the hosting computer; voter’s choices are solely presented at the terminal. Furthermore, the image contains visual authentication elements that can be validated by the voter using information presented at the terminal. This way, hosting computers {{are not able to}} gather voters ’ choices or to deceive voters, by presenting tampered ballots, without being noticed. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) is a flexible data communication system that can act as an extension to a wired LAN within a building or campus for <b>portable</b> <b>terminals.</b> However, always-on wireless connectivity for smaller devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDA), is limited by terminal battery capacity. The main aim of the PDAnet project is to improve the performance and power efficiency of short-range wireless access networks through the use of effective medium access control (MAC) protocols and adaptive packet scheduling. Having demonstrated the power efficiency of the PDAnet MAC protocol [1], we now propose an adaptive packet scheduling technique for improved performance. Although the new technique is similar in complexity to Round Robin, its performance is much better in terms of both link-layer access delay and power consumption. Simulation of a three-terminal piconet confirmed that the new scheduling technique is able to reduce the mean access delay of high traffic terminals in the network by up to 55. 1 %. Similarly, the mean access delay for lightly loaded terminals in the piconet also improved by up to 38. 4 %. Notably, the energy consumption of the <b>portable</b> <b>terminals</b> was reduced by up to 50. 7 % and was linearly proportional to the amount of data being transmitted...|$|R
