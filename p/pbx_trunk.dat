50|$|When {{signaling}} {{is performed}} on the same circuit as the conversation of the call, it is termed channel-associated signaling (CAS). This {{is the case for}} earlier analogue trunks, multi-frequency (MF) and R2 digital <b>trunks,</b> and DSS1/DASS <b>PBX</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
50|$|For old, analog <b>PBX</b> <b>trunks,</b> glare {{would be}} reduced by using ground start signalling, which offered better answer and {{disconnect}} supervision. IE: Nortel BSP discouraged using loop start trunks for this and other reasons. Long Distance exchanges in the 1950s and 60s incorporated Glare Detectors to alleviate the problem.|$|R

5000|$|In {{land-line}} telephony, AIOD leads are Terminal equipment leads used {{solely to}} transmit automatic identified outward dialing (AIOD) {{data from a}} PBX to the {{public switched telephone network}} or to switched service networks (e.g., EPSCS), so that a vendor can provide a detailed monthly bill identifying long distance calling usage by individual <b>PBX</b> stations, tie <b>trunks,</b> or the attendant console. [...] It resembles common channel signalling in that the AIOD leads provide data for all trunks, but is used only for billing, thus resembling automatic number identification.|$|R
50|$|Transmitters, {{receivers}} {{and other}} service circuits are in Trunk Module (TM) and Miscellaneous Trunk Module (MTM) shelves. Trunks are on DTC (Digital Trunk Controller) or DTCI (Digital Trunk Controller ISDN) or PDTC (PCM30 Digital Trunk Controller) shelves, usually two T-1 lines per card, ten cards per DTC {{for a total}} of 480 ds0 voice channels. At {{the turn of the century}} many original NT6X50AA cards were still in service that cannot perform T-carrier extended superframe signaling, this can be performed with a plug-in replacement NT6X50AB card, used for services such as <b>PBX</b> ISDN T1s. <b>Trunks</b> can also be provisioned on SPM (Spectrum Peripheral Module) capable of handling 2016 DS0s, nearly 4.2x more than the DTC.|$|R

50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's <b>PBX</b> via the <b>trunks.</b> As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|R
