40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of Computed tomography (CT) findings for characterizing <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> with the use of attenuation values.

A region of interest was placed for the measurement of Hounsfield Unit (HU) values in the area of the greatest amount of effusion on each slice of the three slices used.

25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), <b>pleural</b> <b>effusion</b> (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen).

Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (<b>pleural</b> <b>effusion),</b> or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{distinction}} between malignant and benign <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> is a diagnostic challenge today and measuring soluble biomarkers could {{add to the}} diagnostic accuracy. Syndecan- 1 is a proteoglycan involved in various cellular functions and is cleaved from the cell surface in a regulated manner. The shed fragment, which can be recovered in effusion supernatant and in serum, retains its binding capacities, but often with different functions and signalling properties than the cell-bound form. Aim. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of soluble syndecan- 1 in <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and sera from patients with pleural malignancies. Study Design. Using two cohorts of patients, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic value of soluble syndecan- 1 in <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and sera, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results. In <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions,</b> syndecan- 1 distinguished malignant and benign diseases, with an odds ratio of 8. 59 (95 % CI 3. 67 to 20. 09). Furthermore, syndecan- 1 in <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> predicted a survival difference for patients with pleural metastatic disease and malignant mesothelioma of 11. 2 and 9. 2 months, respectively. However, no such effects were seen when syndecan- 1 was measured in serum. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> can {{be caused}} by highly {{different}} underlying diseases and are characterized by complex interactions of various local and circulating cells as well as numerous soluble parameters like interleukins (IL). Knowledge of this complex network can be helpful {{in order to make the}} differential diagnosis in known malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and understand the underlying immunochemistry of each disease or condition. Methods We investigated immunoreactive concentrations of Interleukin 10 (IL- 10) and Interleukin 17 (IL- 17) in malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> and peripheral blood from patients with bronchial carcinomas and other carcinomas, excluding other conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonias in twenty four (24) patients (9 men/ 15 women), 37 - 74 years (mean: 61) with already diagnosed malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> applying the ELISA method. Results The SPSS 15 program for Windows was used. Quantitative analysis showed high concentrations of IL- 10 and IL- 17 in pleural fluid and blood. Even though IL- 17 levels -both blood and pleural- were lower than IL- 10 ’s, statistical correlation between blood and pleural concentations was proven, confirming once more the systematic action of these cytokines. At the same time high IL- 17 levels in malignant effusions shows maybe a new perspective in understanding the pathophysiology of malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions.</b> Conclusions Our results confirm the pathogenetic role of these cytokines in malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>effusions</b> combining for the first time a pro- and an anti- inflammatory cytokine.
