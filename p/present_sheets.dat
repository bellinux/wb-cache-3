The pentacene transistors with top contact geometry have a channel length of 18 m and mobility of 0. 7 cm 2 Vs. Organic photodetectors composed of copper phthalo-cyanine and 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylene-tetracarboxylic-diimide distinguish between black and white parts on paper based on the difference in their reflectivity.
