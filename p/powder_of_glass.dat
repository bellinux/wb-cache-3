40|$|As known, {{pozzolana}} is {{a natural}} or artificial material containing silica or alumina (mainly silica) in a reactive form. By themselves, pozzolanas {{have little or no}} cementitious properties. However, in a finely divided form and in the presence of moisture they will chemically react with alkalis to form cementing compounds. The silica and alumina in a pozzolana has to be amorphous, or glassy, to be reactive. When silica containing e. g. fly ash is added to concrete the pozzolanic reaction occurs between the silica glass (SiO 2) and the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) or lime, which is a by-product of the hydration of Portland cement minerals. The hydration products produced fill the interstitial pores reducing the permeability of the matrix [1]. Ca(OH) 2 (hydrated lime) is produced by the reaction of hydrolysis of Portland cement minerals and water. Due to its limited solubility, particles of hydrated lime form within interstitial spaces. With a continuing supply of moisture, the lime reacts with the fly ash pozzolanically, producing additional hydration products of a fine pore structure. The pozzolanic reaction is as in Calcium hydroxide + silica = tricalcium silicate + water: 3 Ca(OH) 2 + SiO 2 = 3 CaO · SiO 2 + 3 H 2 O [1 - 3]]. The main aim of given studies was to perform a comprehensive investigation of relationships between concrete mix composition containing additive of different pozzolanic materials and mechanical strength and microstructure.

In this work, we identify these phases by performing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses on both the as-received glass and heat-treated samples. We detected three glass transitions in the as-received G 338 glass during DSC upscanning, implying the co-existence of three amorphous phases. Towards resolving the chemical identity of the three phases, we performed XRD analyses on samples subjected to dynamic heating, while further DSC and XRD analyses were performed on samples subjected to isothermal treatment. The results suggest that the three amorphous phases in G 388 are Ca/Na?Al?Si?O, Ca?Al?F and Ca?P?O?F phases, respectively. However, the exact chemical compositions of the three phases still require further exploration. The results of this work are important for understanding the impact of phase separation within ionomer glasses on the setting behavior of GICs, and hence improving performances of GICs by optimizing the glass production conditions.

40|$|International audienceBioactive glass {{coatings}} deposited via suspension plasma sprayingwere {{studied to}} improve the adhesion between orthopaedic implants and bone. Fine <b>powders</b> <b>of</b> a bioactive <b>glass,</b> named BG_Ca, having composition (in wt. %) : 4. 7 Na 2 O, 42. 3 CaO, 6. 1 P 2 O 5, and 46. 9 SiO 2, were produced and dispersed in ethanol to form a suspension used as a feedstock. Various sets of spray parameterswere applied in order to define {{the influence of the}} deposition process on the final coating properties. Consequently, the coatings were characterized in as-sprayed state and after soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for different periods ranging from 1 to 14 days. Themicrostructural investigationswere carried out using environmental scanning electronmicroscope (ESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The coatings' adhesion to the substrate was evaluated bymeans of scratch tests. Finally, hardness and elasticmodulus were determined by means of depth-sensing indentation methods...|$|R
5000|$|Composite resin {{fillings}} (also called white fillings) are {{a mixture}} <b>of</b> <b>powdered</b> <b>glass</b> and plastic resin, {{and can be}} made to resemble the appearance of the natural tooth. Although cosmetically superior to amalgam fillings, composite resin fillings are usually more expensive. Bis-GMA based resins contain Bisphenol A, a known endocrine disrupter chemical, and may {{contribute to the development of}} breast cancer. However, it has been demonstrated that the extremely low levels of bis-GMA released by composite restorations do not cause a significant increase in markers of renal injury, when compared to amalgam restorations. That is, there is no added risk of renal or endocrine injury in choosing composite restorations over amalgams. [...] PEX-based materials do not contain Bisphenol A and are the least cytotoxic material available.|$|R
