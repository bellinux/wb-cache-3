40|$|In th? Computer Music {{activity}} area, {{the design}} of original man-machine interfaces for controlling interactive live computer music performances is taken into consideration. In this context we designed and carried out the TwinTowers device which detects information from movements of the hands with no kind of physical connection with them: it consists of two sets of four infra-red sensing devices which create two zones of the space (the vertical edges of two square-based <b>parallelepipedon,</b> or towers) where the hands can be detected in terms of distance and front and side rotations {{with respect to a}} reference frame, using the values of the four heights of each tower. The system implements a sort of double aerial three-dimensional joy sticks. Originally developed for on-stage musical performances, the Twin-towers can be considered as a general purpose remote sensing device to be used {{in a wide range of}} applications such as games, mouse-like operations and 3 -D pointing device for CAD-like applications...|$|E
40|$|Frobel's fourth gift are 8 {{rectangular}} parallelepipedons. They {{compose the}} same size cube as the second gift's cube and the third gift's one. The third gift was composed of 8 small cubes. The third and fourth gifts are showing us Frobel's educational law that calls partical-whole. This fourth gift's rectangular <b>parallelepipedon</b> has 3 different face, {{is more complicated than}} third gift's small cube. Therefore, children are able to manifest more variously one's their own inner creativity. But, the third gift exhibits fortes of facet (surface, angle, edge), against one, the fourth gift exhibits fortes of line (length, width, heigh). To manifest inner creativity by moulding is Frobel's nurturel purpose. As a result of moulding, children take physical world into inner spirit, and cultivate their inner creativity. The 8 rectangular parallelepipedons which follow the 8 small cubes satisfy a creative impulse of child that grown up than before. The fourth gift is plaything for harmony of opposition that internal world and physical world of child. The interactions by mould play (in existance, in knowledge, in beauty) come to children's own mission that man ought to create like God under the law of opposition-harmony...|$|E
40|$|Several {{problems}} {{regarding the}} process of galaxy formation are still open. One {{of them is the}} role played by AGN phenomena in contributing to galaxy build-up and to Star Formation (SF) quenching. On the other hand, the theory of AGN formation predicts these phenomena to be correlated with the host-galaxy environment, thus opening for links between SF quenching, environment and AGN phenomena in the galaxy formation paradigm. This work is focused on the study of the correlation between environmental density and radio AGN presence. Using data from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1. 4 GHz VLA-COSMOS, a sample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied throughout the use of the richness distributions inside a <b>parallelepipedon</b> with base side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift precision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the redshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN hosts up to $z= 2 $. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are significantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is absent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy to host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power radio AGNs leads {{to the conclusion that the}} significance in the environmental effect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the evolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence is a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z= 2 $, with a significant increase of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with decreasing redshift. Hints of an environmental effect are present. The results found with this work lead to conclude that denser environments play a significant role in enhancing the probability of a galaxy to host a low power radio AGN...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonography (US) {{devices are}} systems largely {{used to collect}} medical images useful for {{visualizing}} subcutaneous body structures. It is wellknown {{that one of the}} major drawbacks in US is the limited field of view and lack of spatial information among different images acquiredÍ¾ therefore, to manage this issue, more expensive and time consuming medical image devices, such as MRI and CT, are used. However, in some clinical applications, it could be possible to exploit US as alternative approach, by using a procedure called 3 D Freehand ultrasound (3 DUS). This approach, initially proposed in the 90 s, combines ultrasound images and the corresponding position and orientation of the US transducer with the aim to reconstruct large 3 D anatomical parts. The aim of the present work is to customize the 3 DUS implementation by pushing on vectorization in NumPy / SciPy along with memory waste avoidance, for speeding up processing as much as possible. These aspects are essential in this context, since for commodity hardware: i) memory resources are relatively limited and 3 D volumes involved here can quickly reach large dimensions, ii) computation time can become unrealistic if very large foror whileloops are used in Python. A package called Py 3 DFreeHandUS is therefore provided for this purpose. The Py 3 DFreeHandUS package is able to process data acquired simultaneously by US and position+orientation sensors (POS), being as input DICOM and C 3 D files, respectively. The package is composed of two main parts: US probe calibration and voxel array reconstruction. The probe calibration is an essential step for using the freehand imaging systems for determining the pose of the US images with respect to the POS [1]. Calibration quality assessment was also implemented in terms of repeatability and accuracy. Once to define parameters from calibration, it is possible to apply the voxel array reconstruction, which was performed by positioning the 2 D US images in the 3 D space by mapping relevant pixel information. A 3 D voxel data set is therefore created, containing the grey values of all the repositioned original pixels. The voxelarray (a <b>parallelepipedon)</b> was defined to be the smallest one containing the sequence of realigned scans, to avoid RAM waste. Since gaps can occur in the voxelarray when the voxel size is small compared to the distance between the acquired images, interpolation methods were applied for filling these empty voxels. For optimizing this process, a robust method was used, i. e. convex hull, for restricting the volume containing only the useful information, which will be then filled during interpolation. Finally, data can be exported as VTI file (VTK) and visualized using tools like Paraview. Py 3 DFreeHandUS is developed in Python 2. 7 and has the following dependencies: NumPy SciPy (0. 11 +) matplotlib SymPy pydicom btk (Biomechanical ToolKit) VTK sphinx (doc only) The present package (available here [URL] has implemented the stateoftheart algorithms for the 3 DUS. Sample data and code are provided in the same repository as well. We'll regularly work on this tool in the coming months to improve architecture, generalize code (e. g. POS type, more general US data readers [...] .), add new features (e. g. image segmentation). References: [1] Hsu PW, Prager RW, Gee AH, Treece GM. Freehand 3 D Ultrasound Calibration: A Review.
