The corresponding γ-factor, however, has sharp spikes at the times when the tangential vector potential vanishes and the surface velocity becomes close to the speed of light. We show that managing the laser polarization, one can efficiently control the ARP dynamics, e. g., to gate a single (sub-) attosecond <b>pulse</b> <b>out</b> of the short pulse train generated by a multi-cycle driver.

MC/OQAM system performance with DPSS and other pulses types is analyzed by simulation confirming the quasi-orthogonality of DPSS.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{femtosecond}} lasers, performance improvements have constantly impacted on existing applications and enabled novel applications. However, one performance feature bearing the potential of a quantum leap for high-field applications is still not available: the simultaneous emission of extremely high peak and average powers. Emerging applications such as laser particle acceleration require exactly this performance regime and, therefore, challenge laser technology at large. On the one hand, canonical bulk systems can provide pulse peak powers in the multi-terawatt to petawatt range, while on the other hand, advanced solid-state-laser concepts such as the thin disk, slab or fibre are well known for their high efficiency {{and their ability to}} emit high average powers in the kilowatt range with excellent beam quality. In this contribution, a compact laser system capable of simultaneously providing high peak and average powers with high wall-plug efficiency is proposed and analysed. The concept is based on the temporal coherent combination (pulse stacking) of a pulse train emitted from a high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser system in a passive enhancement cavity. Thus, the pulse energy is increased at the cost of the repetition rate while almost preserving the average power. The concept relies on a fast switching element for dumping the enhanced <b>pulse</b> <b>out</b> of the cavity. The switch constitutes the key challenge of our proposal. Addressing this challenge could, for the first time, allow the highly efficient dumping of joule-class pulses at megawatt average power levels and lead to unprecedented laser parameters...|$|E

However, when the laser power is insufficient, the probability of a pulse that was dropped to recover is small.

Continuous-wave output powers well above the kW-barrier have been demonstrated with diffraction-limited beam quality.

Spectral combining of continuous-wave fiber lasers is a well known as a very promising power scaling technique to obtain power levels far beyond the limitations of a single fiber emission without significant beam quality degradation. In this paper, the authors report {{for the first time}} to their knowledge on spectral combination of pulsed fiber laser systems.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a quantum system {{driven by an}} external field is well described by a unitary transformation generated by a time dependent Hamiltonian. The inverse problem of finding the field that generates a specific unitary transformation {{is the subject of}} study. The unitary transformation which can represent an algorithm in a quantum computation is imposed on a subset of quantum states embedded in a larger Hilbert space. Optimal control theory (OCT) is used to solve the inversion problem irrespective of the initial input state. A unified formalism, based on the Krotov method is developed leading to a new scheme. The schemes are compared for the inversion of a two-qubit Fourier transform using as registers the vibrational levels of the X^ 1 Σ^+_g electronic state of Na_ 2. Raman-like transitions through the A^ 1 Σ^+_u electronic state induce the transitions. Light fields are found that are able to implement the Fourier transform within a picosecond time scale. Such fields can be obtained by pulse-shaping techniques of a femtosecond <b>pulse.</b> <b>Out</b> of the schemes studied the square modulus scheme converges fastest. A study of the implementation of the Q qubit Fourier transform in the Na_ 2 molecule was carried out for up to 5 qubits. The classical computation effort required to obtain the algorithm with a given fidelity is estimated to scale exponentially with the number of levels. The observed moderate scaling of the pulse intensity with the number of qubits in the transformation is rationalized. Comment: 32 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{the goal}} of net energy {{production}} from a DT microexplosion, two ideas (methods) are studied through which (separately or in combination) energy may be ''concentrated'' into a small volume and short period of time [...] the so-called space-time energy densification or compression. The advantages and disadvantages of lasers and relativistic electron-beam (E-beam) machines as the sources of such energy are studied and the amplification of laser pulses as a key factor in energy compression is discussed. The pulse length of present relativistic E-beam machines is the most serious limitation of this pulsed-power source. The first energy-compression idea discussed is the reasonably efficient production of short-duration, high-current relativistic electron pulses by the self interruption and restrike of a current in a plasma pinch due to the rapid onset of strong turbulence. A 1 -MJ plasma focus based on this method is nearing completion at this Laboratory. The second energy- compression idea is based on laser-pulse production through the parametric amplification of a self-similar or solitary wave pulse, for which analogs can be found in other wave processes. Specifically, the second energy-compression idea is a proposal for parametric amplification of a solitary, transverse magnetic pulse in a coaxial cavity with a Bennett dielectric rod as an inner coax. Amplifiers of this type can be driven by the pulsed power from a relativistic E- beam machine. If the end of the inner dielectric coax is made of LiDT or another fusionable material, the amplified pulse can directly drive a fusion reaction [...] there would be no need to switch the <b>pulse</b> <b>out</b> of the system toward a remote target.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{femtosecond}} lasers have proven their vast benefit in both scientific and technological tasks. Nevertheless, one laser feature bearing the tremendous potential for high-field applications, delivering extremely high peak and average powers simultaneously, is still not accessible. This is the performance regime several upcoming applications such as laser particle acceleration require, and therefore, challenge laser technology to the fullest. On the one hand, some state-of-the-art canonical bulk amplifier systems provide pulse peak powers {{in the range of}} multi-terawatt to petawatt. On the other hand, concepts for advanced solid-state-lasers, specifically thin disk, slab or fiber systems have shown their capability of emitting high average powers in the kilowatt range with a high wall-plug-efficiency while maintaining an excellent spatial and temporal quality of the output beam. In this article, a brief introduction to a concept for a compact laser system capable of simultaneously providing high peak and average powers all along with a high wall-plug efficiency will be given. The concept relies on the stacking of a pulse train emitted from a high-repetitive femtosecond laser system in a passive enhancement cavity, also referred to as temporal coherent combining. In this manner, the repetition rate is decreased in favor of a pulse energy enhancement by the same factor while the average power is almost preserved. The key challenge of this concept is a fast, purely reflective switching element that allows for the dumping of the enhanced <b>pulse</b> <b>out</b> of the cavity.
