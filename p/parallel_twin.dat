In addition to a few outcroppings, the Snake River has eroded terraces into Jackson Hole. Southeast of Jackson Lake, glacial depressions known as kettles are numerous. The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from ice sheets melted as the glaciers retreated.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{like the}} {{agricultural}} machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible. [...] The <b>parallel</b> <b>twin</b> cylinder engine featured {{no less than}} five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary chaincase cover), a duplex cam chain, and a starter motor easily twice as powerful as needed. [...] Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, BSA {{introduced}} new short-stroke unit construction 500 and 650 cc <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> to replace their existing pre-unit long-stroke engines. Triumph modified their large pre-unit 500 and 650 cc <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> into unit-construction engines. The smaller Triumph 350 and 500 cc twins had been unit construction from their introduction in 1957. The decision by Lucas to discontinue making dynamos and magnetos, and to produce only alternators and coil ignition systems, {{was a significant}} factor in forcing the redesign.|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, Japanese <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> of the 1960s (such as the 1966 Honda “Black Bomber” and the Yamaha TX500) {{adopted a}} 180° crank that afforded perfect {{mechanical}} primary engine balance. However, the 180° crank yielded some [...] "tingling" [...] secondary vibration (which could be minimised with a balance shaft), and an uneven firing order.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Royal Enfields {{version of}} the now popular selling <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> appeared. This 500cc version was the forerunner {{of a range of}} Royal Enfield Meteors, 700cc Super Meteors and 700cc Constellations. Offering good {{performance}} at modest cost, these sold widely, if somewhat quietly in reputation. The 700cc Royal Enfield Constellation Twin has been described as the first Superbike.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Francesco and {{brothers}} began sketching {{out a new}} breed of large motorcycles that would be built around an all new 650 cc <b>parallel</b> <b>twin</b> engine. [...] The brand was now sufficiently strong and well known, and Francesco's son Massimo had just returned from the USA where it was clear that sales were dominated by large capacity British and American hardware suited for long distance traveling. [...] Above all this, was a desire to produce a prestigious and powerful machine that could conceivably take on the best and finest from Moto-Guzzi, BMW and the rapidly emerging Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1966 Laverda {{exhibited}} {{the result of}} its thinking with the 650 prototype at Earls Court in London.

[...] At the same time its appearance disrupted {{the concept of a}} big bore <b>parallel</b> <b>twin</b> being British built. [...] After this first appearance, Luciano Zen and Massimo Laverda retreated until April 1968, working hard in order to prepare the bike for production. [...] By now they had developed a 750 cc version too. [...] They were confident enough to enter four examples in the prestigious Giro d'Italia. [...] Two 650 and two 750 machines provided Laverda with victory for the 650 in her class, with three bikes finishing in the first 6 and all in the top 10! ...|$|E

The Moto Guzzi V8 reinforced Moto Guzzi's commitment to pushing engineering boundaries. The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano, Enrico Cantoni, Umberto Todero, Ken Kavanagh and Fergus Anderson just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{designed}} by Edward Turner in 1928, the dry-sump Ariel Square Four {{was the only}} British motorcycle engine with four cylinders arranged to form a square. The front two cylinders powered one crankshaft while the rear two drove a second. Unlike contemporary British <b>parallel</b> <b>twins,</b> each crankshaft had a 180° configuration, the two crankshafts being linked by a helical gear so that diagonally opposed pistons moved in unison. The engine had even ignition intervals, and {{was said to be}} smooth, with little vibration.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of {{parallel}} twins: 360°, 180° & 270°. Secondary imbalance {{is the strongest}} on a <b>parallel</b> <b>twin</b> with a 360° crankshaft (that otherwise {{has the advantage of}} 13. an evenly spaced firing, and lack of 4. & 6. imbalances), which moves two pistons together. A <b>parallel</b> <b>twin</b> with a 180° crankshaft (that has the disadvantage of 13. uneven firing spacing and strong 4., 6., 14. & 16. imbalance) produces the vibration a half as strong and twice as frequent. The 270° crank, first used on a Yamaha TRX850, gives a firing pattern more regular than a 180° crank, but less regular than a 360° crank. A 270° crank gives optimum secondary engine balance for a <b>parallel</b> <b>twin,</b> and its exhaust note and power delivery resembles those of a 90° V-twin.|$|E
5000|$|Starting with Edward Turner's 1937 Triumph Speed Twin design, {{and until}} the mid-1970s, the parallel-twin {{was the most common}} British {{motorcycle}} type. Parallel-twins are usually mounted transversely, with the cylinders side by side above the crankshaft, and with exhaust pipes at the front, in the cool airstream. Longitudinal twins (a.k.a. [...] "inline twins") include the 500 cc Sunbeam S7 and S8. There are three crankshaft configurations for this engine: 360°, 180°, and the newer 270°. <b>Parallel</b> <b>twins</b> usually have only two main bearings.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in crankcase pressures as the pistons alternately compress {{and expand the}} crankcase gases. This issue is usually addressed {{by means of a}} crankcase breather, as in the BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360° <b>parallel</b> <b>twins.</b> Crankcase pressure differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation has yet to be used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|R
50|$|The Super Dream {{was fitted}} with a four stroke, air-cooled, twin {{cylinder}} engine. It had three valves per cylinder, two inlet and one exhaust, operated by a chain driven over head camshaft. Ignition was provided by capacitor discharge ignition (CDI). It utilized a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> albeit with tandem balance-shafts in the front {{left side of the}} engine to reduce unwanted vibrations. It used a six-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling was provided by twin Keihin carburettors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, <b>parallel</b> <b>twins,</b> triples, fours and sixes; {{and all these}} may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes {{tend to have more}} cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50 cc to 660 cc, twins from 175 cc to 1,800 cc, triples from 380 cc to 2,300 cc, and so on.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{bilateral}} symmetry of the larval body may arise epigenetically even in animal forms with bilaterally symmetrical eggs. In insects, {{this can be}} shown by development of <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> from eggs or early embryos split along their midlines. The present contribution explores the possibility that epigenetic symmetrization is based on circular asymmetries pre-existing in the egg cell. This possibility is suggested by phologenetic considerations and by data based on epimorphic regeneration of larval appendages. The author proposes an experimental test discriminating between circular and bilaterally symmetrical prepatterns in primitive insects...|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Ducati {{made their}} last {{significant}} {{attempt to provide}} a competitive 'off road' two stroke motorcycle. The 125 'Regolarita' was a 6 speed enduro model based on an ISDT factory prototype from 1975. While the bike proved viable enough overall, gearbox problems plagued it during development and the project was terminated in 1978. Ducati were sufficiently serious about this project to explore MX versions. However like the <b>parallel</b> <b>twins</b> developed and produced at that time, they were sidelined in favour of Ducati's focus on evolutions of their now established and popular V twins.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe growth {{characteristics}} of eutectic Si in unmodified and Sr-modified Al- 12. 7 %Si alloys were investigated by microstructure-correlated crystallographic analyses. For the unmodified alloys, {{the formation of}} repeated single-orientation twin variants enables rapid growth of eutectic Si according to the twin plane re-entrant edge (TPRE) mechanism. Microscopically, Si crystals are plate-like elongated in one direction {{that is not in}} accordance with the growth assumed by the TPRE model. The growth direction is realized by paired zigzag growth on <b>parallel</b> <b>twinning</b> planes, leading to alternate disappearance and creation of 141 re-entrants. As each twinning plane is associated with three re-entrants, Si crystals may extend in three co-planar directions and cause the formation of equilateral plates. With the formation of cc-Al around eutectic Si, the number of re-entrants is reduced. The planar isotropic growth of eutectic Si becomes anisotropic, leading to the formation of long plates. The reduction of the number of re-entrants also accounts for the width and thickness changes over the length of Si plates. This complex growth mode results in Si crystals exposing only their low-energy planes to the melt. For the Sr-modified alloys, substantial changes appear in the eutectic Si morphology, attributable to the restricted TPRE growth and the impurity induced twinning (IIT) growth. The former enhances lateral growth by forming new <b>twins</b> with <b>parallel</b> <b>twinning</b> planes, while the latter leads to isotropic growth by forming differently oriented twins...|$|R
