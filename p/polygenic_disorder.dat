The most common and reproducible cellular phenotype associated with SZ is a reduction in dendritic spines within the neocortex, suggesting alterations in dendritic architecture may cause aberrant cortical circuitry and SZ symptoms. Here, we review evidence supporting a multifactorial model of mitochondrial dysfunction in SZ etiology and discuss how these multiple paths to mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to dendritic spine loss and/or underdevelopment in some SZ subjects. The pathophysiological role of mitochondrial dysfunction in SZ is based upon genomic analyses of both the mitochondrial genome and nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function. Previous studies and preliminary data suggest SZ is associated with specific alleles and haplogroups of the mitochondrial genome, and also correlates with a reduction in mitochondrial copy number {{and an increase in}} synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions of mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been widely implicated in SZ by genome-wide association, exome sequencing, altered gene expression, proteomics, microscopy analyses, and induced pluripotent stem cell studies.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Next Generation Sequencing(NGS), it has quickly become a popular tool for studying monogenic and <b>polygenic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Genetic architecture between monogenic and <b>polygenic</b> <b>disorders</b> differs significantly, posing unique analysis challenges. By studying 4 different disorders in this thesis, I have attempted to demonstrate the strength of NGS and the analysis approaches towards NGS data across very different disorders. Diffuse oesophageal leiomyomatosis(DOL) is a monogenic disorder displaying an X-Link dominant inheritance. In the case study described, I have studied 4 {{members of the family}} with mother and son affected. The whole exome sequencing analysis coupled with genotyping array resulted in the identification of a new COL 4 A 5 / 6 deletion shared by 2 affected individuals. The difficulty in detecting gonosomal mosaicism on the affected mother revealed the weakness of current analysis methods. A similar deletion was described in previous studies and could destabilize the collagen IV monomer and induce leiomyomatosis. The three disorders discussed after, including choledochal cyst(CDD), mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis(MTLE-HS),and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) are examples of <b>polygenic</b> <b>disorders.</b> <b>Polygenic</b> <b>disorders</b> often present a complex genetic architecture affected by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In the cases of MTLE-HS and CDD, both demonstrated a complex and heterogeneous genetic profile where a vast number of genes liable to the disorder have been discovered. For the MTLE-HS study, 23 trios were studied to investigate inherited rare recessive mutations and de novo mutations. As aresult,PKD 1 and CEP 170 Bwerefound to be recurrently mutated across patients, multiple listed de novo variants were also found on genes liable to psychiatric disorder. The study on 33 CDD trios suggested amore complex genetic architecture of the disorder. Three different analysis approaches to detection of candidate mutations resulted in finding double hit rare variants, de novo mutations, and an overall enrichment of rare variants compared to the normal population. The 3 approaches identified 31 genes recurrently mutated in the double hit setting, 21 genes carrying de novo damaging variants, and significant enrichment in the interacting gene pair TRIM 28 /ZNF 382 (p< 3. 6 x 10 - 6). To further understand the biology behind the vast number of genes involved, multiple functional databases on pathways, mouse knockout phenotypes, and human disease were queried. The capability of NGS is beyond simple mutations on DNA level. As demonstrated by the HCC study, a malicious and recurrent intronic Hepatitis B Virus(HBV) integration was uncovered. Although this interesting event did not fall within the coding region, the effect is only observable after post-transcriptional splicing. By coupling transcriptome sequencing, Sanger sequencing and functional studies, a large number of HCC patients affected by a non-degradable CCNA 2 protein encoded by a 177 b. p. long insertion from HBV have been identified. The study highlighted capability NGS in studying the transcriptome, which could help understanding complex mutations in diseases. This thesis has demonstrated the unprecedented capability of NGS in understanding various types of disorders by the analysis of 4 diseases with the substantial difference in their genetic architecture and the underlying type of variants. published_or_final_versionPsychiatryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

A short interval near the distal tip of chromosome 21 contributes to congenital heart defects (CHD), {{and a variety of}} indirect genetic evidence suggests that multiple candidate genes in this region may contribute to this phenotype. We devised a tiered genetic approach to identify interacting CHD candidate genes. We first used the well vetted Drosophila heart as an assay to identify interacting CHD candidate genes by expressing them alone and in all possible pairwise combinations and testing for effects on rhythmicity or heart failure following stress. This comprehensive analysis identified DSCAM and COL 6 A 2 as the most strongly interacting pair of genes. We then over-expressed these two genes alone or in combination in the mouse heart. While over-expression of either gene alone did not affect viability and had little or no effect on heart physiology or morphology, co-expression of the two genes resulted in ≈ 50 % mortality and severe physiological and morphological defects, including atrial septal defects and cardiac hypertrophy. Cooperative interactions between DSCAM and COL 6 A 2 were also observed in the H 9 C 2 cardiac cell line and transcriptional analysis of this interaction points to genes involved in adhesion and cardiac hypertrophy. Our success in defining a cooperative interaction between DSCAM and COL 6 A 2 suggests that the multi-tiered genetic approach we have taken involving human mapping data, comprehensive combinatorial screening in Drosophila, and validation in vivo in mice and in mammalian cells lines should be applicable to identifying specific loci mediating a broad variety of other <b>polygenic</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
