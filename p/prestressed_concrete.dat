5|$|Made up of two road {{bridges and}} a railway bridge located over {{a section of}} water known as The Narrows, located between Mill Point and Point Lewis, it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways, linking the city's {{northern}} and southern suburbs. The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge in the world. Construction of the northern interchange for this bridge necessitated the reclamation of {{a large amount of}} land from the river.|$|E
5|$|After {{duplication}} in 1890, {{the original}} lattice-girder Como Bridge across the Georges River was laid as gauntlet track. This arrangement remained {{in place for}} many decades, causing a notorious bottleneck on the line, until the New South Wales Government commissioned John Holland & Co {{to build a new}} bridge in 1969. Construction of the new bridge, made of <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> box girders, commenced in 1969 and was first used by the 18:17 service from Como on 19 November 1972. The old bridge, as well as a former alignment of the line between Mortdale and Oatley replaced in 1905, is now used as a rail trail for pedestrians and cyclists.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the shear behaviour of prestressed beams made with high-workability concrete and normal concrete under static load. A total of 18 prestressed beam specimens were made in this study; nine were <b>prestressed</b> high-workability <b>concrete</b> beams, and the rest were normal concrete beams. The specimens were all 400 mm deep T-sections, tested with two concentrated loads. The test parameters included concrete strength, amount of prestress, shear span-to-depth ratio and spacing of transverse reinforcement. The results show that <b>prestressed</b> high-workability <b>concrete</b> beams have better structural behaviour than <b>prestressed</b> normal <b>concrete</b> beams. The diagonal cracking strengths and ultimate strengths of high-workability concrete beams were 1. 20 and 1. 17 times those of normal <b>concrete</b> beams respectively. <b>Prestressed</b> high-workability <b>concrete</b> beams have better crack control ability than <b>prestressed</b> normal <b>concrete</b> beams. With the same crack width, high-workability concrete beams can reach greater loads which are approximately 1. 21 times those of normal concrete beams. In addition, <b>prestressed</b> high-workability <b>concrete</b> beams have greater stiffness than <b>prestressed</b> normal <b>concrete</b> beams...|$|R

Based {{on the low}} {{cyclic loading}} {{experiments}} on <b>prestressed</b> high strength <b>concrete</b> pipe piles, in which {{one of them was}} reinforced by steel fiber, another stirrup ratio, the other was not reinforced, the authors compare the results in terms of damage characteristic, hysteretic curve, bearing capacity, displacement and ductility. It is shown that the bearing capacity and ductility of <b>prestressed</b> high strength <b>concrete</b> pipe piles reinforced by steel fiber increases.

25|$|Many car {{parks are}} {{independent}} buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often {{less than the}} office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> double-tee floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced}} concrete used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary {{reinforced concrete}}. Prestressing tendons (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being {{a balance between the}} costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E
25|$|Resistant to weak {{acids and}} {{especially}} sulfates, this cement cures quickly and has very high durability and strength. It was frequently used after World War II to make precast concrete objects. However, it can lose strength with heat or time (conversion), especially when not properly cured. After {{the collapse of}} three roofs made of <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> beams using high alumina cement, this cement was banned in the UK in 1976. Subsequent inquiries into the matter showed that the beams were improperly manufactured, but the ban remained.|$|E
25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete.</b> The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|E

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and <b>prestressed</b> <b>concrete</b> cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{numerical}} {{approach to the}} reliability analysis of <b>prestressed</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> long span bridges is presented. A bridge is modeled by nite element software and the analysis is performed in time domain by considering the bridge material nonlinearity. The considered random variables are: Specic strength of concrete, yield stress of steel bars, yield stress of prestressed bars, all sectional dimensions, structural damping ratio, eective depth of steel bars and the magnitude and PGA of earthquake. In this study, the reliability of a bridge structure is evaluated under earthquake excitations. For this purpose, the First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) method is used. In this method, the mean value and standard deviation of the random variables are considered for evaluating structural reliability.
