5|$|The {{occupation}} {{coincided with}} a religious revival in Belgium which had always been overwhelmingly Catholic. The Primate of Belgium, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, became {{an outspoken critic of}} the German occupation regime. Mercier published a celebrated pamphlet entitled Patriotisme et Endurance (<b>Patriotism</b> <b>and</b> Endurance) on Christmas Day 1914 which called for civilians to observe occupation laws only which were consistent with Belgian <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> Christian values. The pamphlet attacked the authority of the German occupying government, stating that any rule legitimised by force alone should not be obeyed.|$|E
5|$|Cooper and {{his friend}} and {{frequent}} collaborator, noted director John Ford, formed Argosy Productions in 1946 and produced such notable films such as Wagon Master (1950), Ford's Fort Apache (1948), and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Cooper's films at Argosy reflected his <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> his vision of America.|$|E

5|$|Huldrych Zwingli or Ulrich Zwingli (1 January 1484– 11 October 1531) was {{a leader}} of the Reformation in Switzerland. Born during a time of {{emerging}} Swiss <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> increasing criticism of the Swiss mercenary system, he attended the University of Vienna and the University of Basel, a scholarly center of Renaissance humanism. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in Glarus and later in Einsiedeln, where he was influenced by the writings of Erasmus.|$|E

While the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war. The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens.

5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government.

5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{continuing}} debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan {{has been the}} most influential president since Franklin D.

J. Heale, who finds that scholars now concur that Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the nation to the right, practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics, revived faith in the presidency and in American exceptionalism, and contributed to victory in the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Friedrich's <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> resentment {{during the}} 1813 French {{occupation}} of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He {{was impressed by the}} anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in the history of art.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine {{is based on the}} ancient Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, <b>Patriotism</b> <b>and</b> Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{explores the}} themes of {{leadership}} <b>and</b> <b>patriotism</b> by comparing <b>and</b> contrasting the two protagonists/antagonists of the story.

5|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of union radicals in the Industrial Workers of the World, Disque sponsored an alternative union based on <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> labor–management cooperation. The new union, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen, was established in 1917 and put {{under the leadership of}} Portland attorney Captain Maurice E. Crumpacker, who would later serve as a U.S. Congressman. The union was initially opposed by both labor and mill owners, but due to Disque's strong advocacy, within six months nearly all of the mill owners had agreed to support the union; by October 1918, it had 125,000members. In fact, the union lasted 20 years longer than the Spruce Production Division.|$|E
5|$|His legend {{had begun}} growing even during his lifetime, as {{he became a}} hero of poems and songs. Few {{negative}} rumors about him, popular {{in the last few}} years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of <b>patriotism,</b> <b>and</b> a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przedświt of Zygmunt Krasiński, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, The Deluge.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his <b>patriotism</b> <b>and</b> dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
