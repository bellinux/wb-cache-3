25|$|Swafield Mill was a three-storey building, with a brick base, weatherboaring on {{the middle}} storey, and the upper storey built into the <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> Water {{was taken from the}} River Ant, and was used to drive two sets of stones and two flour mills in 1831. By 1967, only the brick base remained, as the mill pond had been filled in. However, the mill house, which was {{constructed}} in the mid-eighteenth century, remains and is grade II listed. It is built of brick with three storeys and three bays, with a roof of black glazed pantiles.|$|E
25|$|West Acre mill was a four-storey building, with a brick-built {{ground floor}} and the upper storeys built in weatherboarded timber. It had a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> with a mill house attached. The ground floor of the mill dated from the 15th century, and {{appeared}} to be built from material obtained from West Acre Abbey. The water wheel drove four pairs of grinding stones, although only two were used in later years. The four-level stone driving frame, which allowed all four wheels to be operated at once, was noted as an outstanding example of milling machinery in the 1950s, when the building was surveyed, but it was demolished in 1959, as it was deemed to be unsafe. The mill house remains.|$|E
25|$|The river has {{provided}} the power for several mills over many centuries. Working downstream from the source, the first mill was at Newton by Castle Acre. The site was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The present mill was built in brick with a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> and a mill house, built with stone from a ruined priory, was attached. The mill was then enlarged, resulting in it having a different roof line to the house. It was used for kibbling corn in the 1930s. By 1972, when the mill was restored, the mill house was just a shell with no roof, {{and it had been}} demolished by 1977. A new mill house was built in the 1990s by a Norfolk historian, in a similar style to the original. Most of the machinery, including the wheel, were still in place in 2003, although not operational.|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{settlement}} in the vale, apart from York, is Haxby. Other villages typically exhibit a linear form with houses of mottled pink brick and <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs</b> facing each other {{on either side of}} a main street.|$|R
50|$|The {{watermill}} and its adjoining mill {{house are}} constructed from local brick and flint and the buildings have red Norfolk <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs.</b> The river Glaven was dammed {{and a large}} mill pond stands directly behind the mill.|$|R

500|$|Rounton Grange was {{finished}} in 1876, under the architect Philip Webb; {{it was at}} that time his largest project. The house was five storeys high, of yellow brick with a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> enormous mock mediaeval chimneys and [...] "gothic" [...] features. It was set in an estate of 3000 acres with lawns, a wood full of daffodils, a rose garden, and two lakes. Inside was an immense arched gallery that stretched the full width of the house, a wide curved staircase and baronial fireplace. In the main drawing room there was an Adamesque fireplace, and two grand pianos on a vast carpet. There was a large tapestry frieze of Chaucer's [...] Romaunt of the Rose designed by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, and made by Lady Bell and her daughters over several years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{church is}} built of flint with stone {{dressings}} and {{stands at the}} centre of a rectangular churchyard. The tower at the western end has battlements with an early example of flushwork panelling. The bell openings have reticulated tracery, with two minor reticulation units within the major one. The nave, without pillars or aisles, is nearly [...] wide, the widest among Norfolk’s parish churches, giving a large preaching space as pioneered by the mendicants. [...] The nave and chancel have battlemented parapets and [...] a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof</b> built in 1781, supported by kingposts on arched ties, which solved earlier problems caused by {{the width of the}} nave. The nave has three large three-light windows on each side with Curvilinear tracery based on the petal motif. The west door is of Perpendicular style opening into the nave through a tall narrow tower arch. There are both north and south doors with porches, all having boldly cusped ogee arches. The floor is of buff pamment stone.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a mill at Bacton Wood since the Domesday Book was {{produced}} in 1086. The present building was reconstructed in 1747, and extensively modified in 1825, {{in anticipation of the}} canal opening, and the increase in trade that that might bring. It was made of white rendered brick, with a roof of slates, although the adjoining mill house had a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> but was subsequently reroofed in slate. The cast iron waterwheel was [...] in diameter and [...] wide, providing enough power to turn three sets of stones. The water supply was not always adequate in the summer, and a Dodman steam plant was installed in the late nineteenth century. Its boiler exploded around 1910, and an [...] hot bulb engine manufactured by Richard Hornsby & Sons replaced it. The mill was last used commercially in 1944, by which time it was powered by a diesel engine. It was sold for conversion to a house in 1967. The Hornsby engine was sold to enthusiasts when the mill was restored in 1984, and the mill was bought by Laurence Ashton in 1994, who is hoping to run it using water power once his Old Canal Company has rewatered the canal. There are four sets of stones on the milling floor. Sir William Cubitt, who invented the self-regulating windmill sail in 1807 and the prison treadmill in 1818, lived in the mill house during his childhood.|$|E

500|$|Whitby is {{situated}} {{on the east coast}} of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley {{at the mouth of the}} River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a [...] span that separates the upper and lower harbours which have a total area of around [...] The houses are built of brick or stone, often with red <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs,</b> in narrow, steep streets, on both sides of the river.|$|R
50|$|Most of Dale's churches {{share common}} features: a {{tympanum}} with bas-reliefs over the main door, <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs,</b> an Italianate pent-roofed chimney for the boiler {{and in some}} cases a baldachin over the main altar and a pantiled bell-cot on the west gable. With the exception of St. Francis of Assisi (which is stuccoed) they are built of a modern buff brick that contrasts with traditional building materials in this part of England. The tympanum at St. Alban the Martyr was carved by John Brookes, then Principal of Oxford City Technical College. St. Francis' has also a set of Stations of the Cross carved by Eric Gill.|$|R
50|$|The theatre has a {{capacity}} of 200 (standing) and is situated in the 'Cultural Quarter' of Stockton town centre, which is centred on Green Dragon Yard. It is gabled with <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof</b> and approached {{at the south end}} from a cobbled passage. There is a lean-to structure at the southern end, which is relatively modern. Adjoining is a cottage which was used as a drawing room, with actors entering the theatre through a door at the stage end of the east wall.|$|E
50|$|A Palaeolithic axehead {{was found}} {{somewhere in the}} area. Roman coins were found in 1856 and 1978 in Cocker Beck, and the later finds were dated 308-346 AD. Bishop Bek ordered a tower {{to be built in}} Low Coniscliffe in the 13th century; the site is unknown, but it may be the site of the manor house. There is an unknown site of a gallows, pre−1293 AD, south of the Tees, and west of Howden Hill Farm. The extreme south−west end of the present built−up area of the village is {{probably}} the site of the old medieval manor house, 1066-1540. The site includes earthwork enclosures, and a 1960s excavation revealed a 15th-16th century round dovecote. There is supposed to be another dovecote here; location unknown. The house at the south−west end of the village, numbers 55-57, is a 17th-century listed building: a roughcast brick and rubble structure with a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> This is a pair of houses; once a farmhouse with a cottage on the right. Well Bank House, number 20 near the south−east corner of the village, is a listed building dated around the late 18th to early 19th century. Like numbers 55-57 it is built of roughcast rubble with a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> and this building contains a 19th-century iron range.|$|E
50|$|Hunworth {{watermill}} {{stands on}} the river Glaven and the building seen today dates from the 1750s. There has been a mill on the site for even longer with records showing milling dues being paid to Edward the Confessor. The building is constructed from Norfolk red brick and flint and has a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> When the mill was sold in 1974 it had been unused for forty years and all its machinery was intact. It has since been renovated into a dwelling and is a grade II listed mill house.|$|E
50|$|The set of early-19th-century {{outbuildings}} to {{the north}} of the Hall was once a house with stabling and is now a garage and storage building. It has <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs</b> with stone−flagged eaves, squared limestone walls and brickwork chimneys, and it is listed. The early-19th-century garden walls to the left or west of the Hall are also listed. They are built of hand−made red brick with flat stone coping. They are high walls enclosing three sides of a rose garden with a lower and possibly rebuilt wall on the south side. The eastern wall has a coursed rubble face with an arched doorway in the south−east corner, and the north wall has boarded doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} were austerely constructed of red brick with <b>pantiled</b> mansard <b>roofs</b> and were situated {{so as to}} {{give a sense of}} community and privacy as well as {{to take advantage of the}} wooded surroundings which were retained and enhanced by tree-thinning and landscaping.|$|R
50|$|North of the village, {{just south}} of New Moor Farm and just {{to the west of}} Walworth Road, is the site of a post-medieval lime kiln. The disused {{limestone}} quarry called Quarry Hole, where Newton Lane meets Walworth Road, is post-medieval also, and it once had an associated lime kiln. 0.9 mi north-west of Walworth, between Newton Lane and the A68 road, is the post-medieval Paradise Cottage, once known as Hood's Cottage, with an associated well. There is an overgrown well {{on the west side of}} Walworth Road and level with the castle gate, at the north end of Tomtit Wood. It is made of stone with a trough to collect water. Estimated to be about 0.31 mi west of Walworth village, and halfway between Walworth and Denton, is the site of a medieval mill. The evidence for this is from field names on tithe maps and manuscripts. There is a late 18th- or early 19th-century listed ice house to the east of Quarry End, at Quarry Hole. It is built into a bank, and has a partially-collapsed barrel-vaulted passage connected to a deep, egg-shaped cavity intended for the ice. It is built of coursed rubble and the inside is brick-lined. On the east side of Walworth Grange are a Grade II listed late 18th- or early 19th-century threshing barn and gin gang. They are built of limestone with <b>pantiled</b> <b>roofs,</b> and the gin gang is semi-octagonal with square piers and later infilled walls.|$|R
50|$|Baysgarth House is a Grade II listed building, {{believed}} to date from c. 1731. The building {{is built on}} an L-plan, with 2 storeys and an attic in red brick with a hipped <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> The building has an adjacent grade II listed stable building, {{believed to}} date from the early 19th Century, and an adjacent cottage {{believed to have been}} built for servants.Also attached to the property are the grade II* listed gate piers in an 18th-century style, topped by a lion and a unicorn.

5000|$|The small {{tower is}} at the end of a lane in the town of Tranent, which has grown up around it. The remains are {{protected}} as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. There are two vaulted chambers in the basement. There is a main block of three storeys, and a four-storey stair-wing. It has a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> The first floor included the hall. The tower is in a poor state of repair. [...] The stair-wing {{is at the}} south-west corner. The entrance is to the south, as are most of the windows. This suggests that there was a barmkin on this side, but there is no other evidence for this.|$|E
2500|$|Lealholm is a {{small village}} in the Glaisdale civil parish of the Borough of Scarborough, in North Yorkshire, England. It is sited at a {{crossing}} point of the River Esk, in Eskdale which is within the North York Moors National Park. It is [...] by road from the nearest town of Whitby, and approximately [...] from both Middlesbrough and Scarborough.

50|$|The Villa Lante {{is formed}} by two casini (houses), nearly {{identical}} but built by different owners {{in a period}} separated by 30 years. Each square building has a ground floor of rusticated arcades or loggias which support a piano nobile above. Each facade on this floor has just three windows, alternating round or pointed pediments. Each window is divided by pilasters in pairs. An upper floor is merely hinted at by small rectangular, mezzanine type, windows above those of the piano nobile. Each casino is then crowned by a tower or lantern in {{the summit of the}} <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> These elaborate square lanterns too have pilasters, and windows both real and blind.|$|E
50|$|West Acre mill was a four-storey building, with a brick-built {{ground floor}} and the upper storeys built in weatherboarded timber.

50|$|Two {{building}} {{within the}} village have been listed as being of architectural merit. The {{first is the}} church of St Andrew, which has been Grade II* listed since 1966. It consists of a nave dating from the twelfth century, a chancel dating from the early thirteenth, and the west tower, which dates from the late fourteenth century. There are various other early features, including a twelfth century tub font and an effigy of a knight which has been defaced. Nearby is a medieval cubical sandstone cross base, which is also listed. The other listed building is the Mill House, which forms part of Mill Farm. It is an early nineteenth century brick structure, with a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof,</b> consisting of two storeys and a basement.|$|E
5000|$|Haldenby Grange is a Grade II listed farmhouse, {{dating from}} the middle to late eighteenth century. It is built of red-brown brick, with later {{alterations}} in a lighter-coloured brick, and has a <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof.</b> It was once close to {{the banks of the}} River Don, and formed part of the deserted medieval village of Haldenby. The village continued to the north-east, as far as Haldenby Hall, another listed building which dates from the late seventeenth century, altered in the mid-nineteenth century. It is [...] "T"-shaped in plan, built from bricks in different colours, and with pantiles and Welsh slate roofs. It replaced the medieval Haldenby Hall, once the residence of the Haldenby family, who are commemorated by monuments in the church at Adlingfleet. Close to Haldenby Grange is a listed barn and horse mill.|$|E
5000|$|The present mill {{was built}} in 1802, and is {{constructed}} of Norfolk red brick with a Norfolk black <b>pantiled</b> <b>roof</b> which over sail the walls at the eves. This large watermill is constructed over four storeys and has three apexes on the gable ends. On the gable end there are bricked window fenestrations.The waterwheel was built with a dual irrigation system and was designed to run as breastshot but could be changed to undershot if water levels fell in times of dry weather. To increase {{the flow of water}} to the mill, sometime in the 19th century the height of the mill pond dam was increased by 2 ft.
