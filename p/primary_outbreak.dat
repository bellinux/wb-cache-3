40|$|The {{opinions}} {{of a number}} of recognised world experts on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were sought in order to answer key questions relating to the importation of the disease into European countries from countries outside Europe. In addition, their opinions were sought on where in Europe a <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> of FMD was most likely to occur and the number of outbreaks likely to occur within European countries in the next five years. The Balkans group of countries was considered to be the most likely group within Europe to have a <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> of FMD and also most likely to have the highest number of primary outbreaks. Turkey was considered to be the country outside Europe which was most likely to be the source of an outbreak within Europe as a whole, and the illegal importation of livestock was considered to be the most likely route of introduction of FMD into Europe. Results specific to the Islands group of countries, which included the UK and Ireland, suggested that this group was likely to have a mean of one <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> of FMD in the five years from September 2000, and that the importation of foodstuffs by people entering those countries from Turkey was the most likely source of an outbreak...|$|E

40|$|The cause(s) of <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of the coral-eating {{crown-of-thorns starfish}} (Acanthaster planci) are still subject to {{scientific}} controversy. The possibility of <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> being linked to terrestrial runoff has been postulated {{a number of}} times, suggesting that enhanced nutrient supply is critical for enhanced A. planci larval development. This paper examines the evidence for such a cause, focusing particularly on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Nutrient discharges from rivers have increased at least four-fold in the central GBR over the last century, and concentrations of large phyto-plankton (> 2 um) of the inshore central GBR shelf in the wet season when A. planci larvae develop, is double that of other places and times. Larval development, growth and survival increase almost ten-fold with doubled concentrations of large phyto-plankton. This and other lines of evidence suggest that frequent A. planci outbreaks on the GBR may indeed {{be a result of}} increased nutrient delivery from the land...|$|R
40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{information}} on settlement and recruitment of Acanthaster planci in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) system, {{with emphasis on}} the recent phenomenon of population outbreaks of the starfish. Observations that recent outbreaks have occurred in two series of activity (1962 - 77 and 1979 - 91 +), each characterized by a southward wave of infestations in the central section of the GBR, and that outbreaks are not preceded by observable increases in densities of juveniles, {{have important implications for}} settlement and recruitment processes. The pattern of <b>outbreaks</b> indicates that <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> occur infrequently and unpredictably in the vicinity of 16 degrees S. However, {{it is not possible to}} assert that <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> have not occurred elsewhere in the GBR system, and isolated outbreaks at the southern end of the GBR may be primary events. Present data are insufficient to discern whether recruitment leading to <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> is by mass settlement of larvae or aggregation of adult starfish of various ages. In contrast, evidence indicates strongly that the majority of outbreaks in the system are secondary infestations as a result of water-borne transport and subsequent mass settlements of planktonic larvae seeded by other outbreak populations (and initially by populations undergoing <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks).</b> The likelihood and pattern of secondary outbreaks is influenced by several parameters that operate at vastly different scales. These include passive transport of larvae by large-scale circulation patterns at scales of 10 to the power of 4 - 10 to the power of 6 m, which can largely account for the southward wave, and substratum selectivity by larvae at small scales (0 - 10 to the power of - 3 m). The spatial distribution of important cues for larval settlement (coral rubble and the coralline alga Lithothamnium pseudosorum) suggests that mass settlements are more likely to occur in deep water at the base of reefs, where they are less likely to be observed. Several foci are defined for future research on settlement and recruitment processes. These include (1) identification of parameters influencing the spatial and temporal distribution of recruitment events that initiate <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> (2) testing of hypotheses relating to dissipation of the southward movement of outbreaks at about 20 degrees S despite an abundance of reefs in the area supporting high coral cover, (3) determining the period of competency of larvae for settlement, (4) elucidating the behaviour of larvae (particularly late brachiolaria) in the water column, (5) further work to identify substrata inductive of larval settlement and to determine the nature of inducers, the spatial distribution of inductive substrata, and the effect of small-scale hydrodynamic processes in modifying the response of larvae to inductive substrata, and (6) testing of the hypothesis of deep-water recruitment...|$|R
40|$|The {{crown-of-thorns starfish}} (COTS) {{is a major}} {{predator}} of hard corals.

Knowledge of the precise timing and location of primary outbreaks could reveal the initial drivers of outbreaks and so could indicate possible management measures. In the central GBR, COTS outbreaks appear to follow major flooding events, but despite many years of observations, no <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> has ever been unequivocally identified in the central and northern GBR. Here we locate a <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> of COTS on the southern GBR which is not correlated with flooding.

Thirty-five isolates were generated and characterized molecularly using the haemagglutinin gene. The molecular analysis indicated that different sublineages of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 viruses spread throughout Nigeria.

40|$|Cryptococcus gattii is an {{emerging}} intracellular pathogen {{and the cause}} of the largest <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> of a life-threatening fungal disease in a healthy population. Outbreak strains share a unique mitochondrial gene expression profile and an increased ability to tubularize their mitochondria within host macrophages. However, the underlying mechanism that causes this lineage of C. gattii to be virulent in immunocompetent individuals remains unexplained. Here we show that a subpopulation of intracellular C. gattii adopts a tubular mitochondrial morphology in response to host reactive oxygen species. These fungal cells then facilitate the rapid growth of neighbouring C. gattii cells with non-tubular mitochondria, allowing for effective establishment of the pathogen within a macrophage intracellular niche. Thus, host reactive oxygen species, an essential component of the innate immune response, act as major signalling molecules to trigger a ‘division of labour’ in the intracellular fungal population, leading to increased pathogenesis within this outbreak lineage...|$|E

The absence of HPAI from the Netherlands for more than 75 yr created {{a situation in which}} poultry farmers and veterinary practitioners did not think of AI in the differential diagnosis as a possible cause of the clinical problems seen. Increased and progressive mortality was not reported to the governmental authorities by farmers or veterinary practitioners.

The advance is predicted to be from about a minimum of one day in South Africa in 2030 to a maximum of 28 days in Chile and China in 2080. The advance in the outbreak time could lead to more severe infections, due to the polycyclic nature of the pathogen. Therefore, changes in the timing and frequency of fungicide treatments could be expected in the future, with a possible increase in the costs of disease management...|$|R
40|$|Only type A in¯uenza viruses {{are known}} to cause natural infections in birds, but viruses of all 15 {{haemagglutinin}} and all nine neuraminidase in¯uenza A subtypes {{in the majority of}} possible combinations have been isolated from avian species. In¯uenza A viruses infecting poultry can be divided into two distinct groups {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause disease. The very virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian in¯uenza (HPAI), in which mortality may be as high as 100 %. These viruses have been restricted to subtypes H 5 and H 7, although not all viruses of these subtypes cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a much milder, primarily respiratory disease, which may be exacerbated by other infections or environmental conditions. Since 1959, <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of HPAI in poultry have been reported 17 times (eight since 1990), ®ve in turkeys and 12 in chickens. HPAI viruses are rarely isolated from wild birds, but extremely high isolation rates of viruses of low virulence for poultry have been recorded in surveillance studies, giving overall ®gures of about 15 % for ducks and geese and around 2 % for all other species. In¯uenza viruses have been shown to affect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas of the world, but the frequency with which primary infections occur in any type of bird depends on the degree of contact there is with feral birds. Secondary spread is usually associated with human involvement, probably by transferring infective faeces from infected to susceptible birds. # 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersal}} of HIV- 1 subtype B (HIV- 1 B) {{is a reflection}} of the movement of human populations in response to social, political, and geographical issues. The initial dissemination of HIV- 1 B outside Africa seems to have included the passive involvement of human populations from the Caribbean in spreading the virus to the United States. However, the exact pathways taken during the establishment of the pandemic in the Americas remain unclear. Here, we propose a geographical scenario for the dissemination of HIV- 1 B in the Americas, based on phylogenetic and genetic statistical analyses of 313 available sequences of the pol gene from 27 countries. Maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods were used to explore the phylogenetic relationships between HIV- 1 B sequences, and molecular variance estimates were analyzed to infer the genetic structure of the viral population. We found that the initial dissemination and subsequent spread of subtype B in the Americas occurred via a single introduction event in the Caribbean around 1964 (1950 - 1967). Phylogenetic trees present evidence of several <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in countries in South America, directly seeded by the Caribbean epidemic. Cuba is an exception insofar as its epidemic seems to have been introduced from South America. One clade comprising isolates from different countries emerged in the most-derived branches, reflecting the intense circulation of the virus throughout the American continents. Statistical analysis supports the genetic compartmentalization of the virus among the Americas, with a close relationship between the South American and Caribbean epidemics. These findings reflect the complex establishment of the HIV- 1 B pandemic and contribute to our understanding between the migration process of human populations and virus diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A large, multi-province {{outbreak}} of listeriosis associated with ready-to-eat meat products contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1 / 2 a occurred in Canada in 2008. Subtyping of outbreak-associated isolates using {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) revealed two similar but distinct Asc I PFGE patterns. High-throughput pyrosequencing of two L. monocytogenes isolates was used to rapidly provide the genome sequence of the <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> strain and to investigate the extent of genetic diversity associated with a change of a single restriction enzyme fragment during PFGE. Results The chromosomes were collinear, but differences included 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three indels, including a 33 kbp prophage that accounted for the observed difference in Asc I PFGE patterns. The distribution of these traits was assessed within further clinical, environmental and food isolates associated with the outbreak, and this comparison indicated that three distinct, but highly related strains {{may have been involved}} in this nationwide outbreak. Notably, these two isolates were found to harbor a 50 kbp putative mobile genomic island encoding translocation and efflux functions that has not been observed in other Listeria genomes. Conclusions High-throughput genome sequencing provided a more detailed real-time assessment of genetic traits characteristic of the outbreak strains than could be achieved with routine subtyping methods. This study confirms that the latest generation of DNA sequencing technologies can be applied during high priority public health events, and laboratories need to prepare for this inevitability and assess how to properly analyze and interpret whole genome sequences in the context of molecular epidemiology. </p...|$|E

Here we describe a current silkmoth outbreak that is occurring about half degree northward of its formerly documented outbreak range. This outbreak has covered an area of about 800 thousand ha with mortality of conifer stands within an area of about 300 thousand ha. The <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> originated in the year 2014 within stands located on gentle relatively dry southwest slopes at elevations up to 200 m above sea level (a. s. l.) Then the outbreak spread to the mesic areas including northern slopes and the low-elevation forest belts along the Yenisei ridge. Within the outbreak area, the northern Siberian silkmoth population has reduced generation length from two to one year. Our study showed that the outbreak was promoted by droughts in prior years, an increase of the sum of daily temperatures (t > + 10 °C), {{and a decrease in}} ground cover moisture. Within the outbreak area, secondary pests were also active, including the aggressive Polygraphus proximus bark borer beetle. The outbreak considered here is part of the wide-spread (panzonal) Siberian silkmoth outbreak that originated during 2014 – 2015 with a range of up to 1000 km in southern Siberia.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} biological disturbances on a tropical coral reef is a population outbreak of the fecund, corallivorous crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci. Although the factors that trigger an initial outbreak may vary, successive outbreaks within and across regions are assumed to spread via the planktonic larvae released from a <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak.</b> This secondary outbreak hypothesis is predominantly based on the high dispersal potential of A. planci and the assertion that outbreak populations (a rogue subset of the larger population) are genetically more similar to each other than they are to low-density non-outbreak populations. Here we use molecular techniques to evaluate the spatial scale at which A. planci outbreaks can propagate via larval dispersal in the central Pacific Ocean by inferring the location and severity of gene flow restrictions from the analysis of mtDNA control region sequence (656 specimens, 17 non-outbreak and six outbreak locations, six archipelagos, and three regions). Substantial regional, archipelagic, and subarchipelagic-scale genetic structuring of A. planci populations indicate that larvae rarely realize their dispersal potential and outbreaks in the central Pacific do not spread across the expanses of open ocean. On a finer scale, genetic partitioning was detected within two of three islands with multiple sampling sites. The finest spatial structure was detected at Pearl & Hermes Atoll, between the lagoon and forereef habitats (< 10 km). Despite using a genetic marker capable of revealing subtle partitioning, we found no evidence that outbreaks were a rogue genetic subset of a greater population. Overall, outbreaks that occur at similar times across population partitions are genetically independent and likely due to nutrient inputs and similar climatic and ecological conditions that conspire to fuel plankton blooms...|$|E
40|$|Background Since 2005, France {{has been}} officially free of brucellosis, an {{infectious}} disease that causes abortion in cattle {{and can be}} transmitted from cattle to humans. Recent animal and human cases have drawn attention {{to the need to}} prevent infection of humans and animals from any <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> In order to detect any new outbreaks as soon as possible, a clinical surveillance system requires farmers and veterinarians to report each abortion and to test the aborting cow for brucellosis. However, under-reporting limits the sensitivity of this system. Our objective was to identify the barriers and motivations influencing field actors in their decision to report or not to report bovine abortions. We used a qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews of 12 cattle farmers and their eight veterinarians. Results Our analysis showed that four main themes influence the decision-making process of farmers and veterinarians: 1) the perceived risk of brucellosis and other abortive diseases; 2) the definition of a suspected case of brucellosis and other abortive diseases adopted by field actors, which is less sensitive than the mandatory definition; 3) the cost-benefit analysis conducted by actors, taking into account regulatory and health aspects, economic and financial losses, technical and practical factors; 4) the level of cooperation within the socio-technical network. We discussed how early detection may be improved by revising the definition of abortion, extending the time frame for notification and generalising the differential diagnosis of the causes of abortion. Conclusions In contrast to quantitative approaches, qualitative studies can identify the factors (including unknown factors) influencing the decision-making process of field actors and reveal why they take those factors into consideration. Our qualitative study sheds light on the factors underlying the poor sensitivity of clinical brucellosis surveillance system for cattle in France, and suggests that early detection may be improved by considering actors’ perceptions. We believe our findings may provide further insight into ways of improving other clinical surveillance systems and thus reduce the risk of disease...|$|R

The results indicate that even for river basins dominated by agricultural land uses, quite modest reductions in end-of-river PRN concentrations (~ 20 – 40 %) may assist in mitigating the risk of <b>primary</b> COTS <b>outbreaks</b> from the mid-shelf reefs of the Wet Tropics.

The main group (47 children) — children with sepsis, the comparison group (68 children) — with a localized bacterial infection. Age of children was from 1 month to 18 years. Distribution to groups was carried out by the presence of signs of systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction. Results. The study found that the level and duration of the main symptoms of SIRS (hyperthermia, tachycardia and tachypnoe) were statistically significantly higher in the sepsis group. With increasing signs of SIRS and the development of septic shock, the duration and severity of the clinical signs of SIRS increased in direct proportion. Tachycardia almost always (93 %) accompanies the development of sepsis, while localized bacterial infections occur in only a third of children. 40 % of children with sepsis require oxygen therapy. Signs of SIRS are greater in children with localization of the bacterial focus in the ENT and chest cavity, while with central nervous system infection, they passed most quickly. In inotropic support, children with a <b>primary</b> <b>outbreak</b> in ENT were most in need — 44. 4 % of cases, children with localization of the focus of bacterial infection in the abdominal cavity did not demand it at all. The average length of stay in the department of intensive care in the children of the comparison group was 5. 14 days (95 % confidence interval (CI) 4. 42 – 5. 87), and in children of the main group — 13. 1 days (95 % CI 9. 16 – 17), which was 2. 5 times higher (p < 0. 01). Conclusions. The indicator and duration of the main manifestations of SIRS (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea) are statistically significantly higher in children with sepsis, and they proportionally increase with an increase in the number of signs of SIRS. The main indicators of SIRS in children with sepsis with 2 symptoms of SIRS are observed for a long time, and their level is statistically lower in comparison with children with 3 or more signs of SIRS. In 75 % of children with localized bacterial infection, there is a short breathing, although its duration is negligible and they do not require oxygen therapy, while slightly fewer children with sepsis require the latter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 1. The {{effects of}} insects on primary {{production}} in temperate herb-aceous communities were investigated in a meta-analysis. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) {{the effect of}} insects on primary production depends on community type, (2) the effect of insects on primary production varies {{as a function of}} productivity, (3) insects have a greater effect on primary production in communities with low species diversity, and (4) insects have a larger effect on <b>primary</b> production during <b>outbreaks.</b> 2. Data were collected from 24 studies in which insecticides were used to suppress insects in self-sown or pastoral communities. Effect sizes were calculated from sprayed and control plot standing crop or yield, expressed as the log response ratio, ln (sprayed plot phytomass/control plot phytomass). 3. There was a significant increase in primary production as a result of insect suppression. Forb-dominated communities showed a more variable response than graminoid communities. During outbreaks, insects had a greater negative impact on primary production. Effect size was unaffected by productivity or plant species richness. 4. Although insects lower primary production in a diversity of temperate herb-aceous communities, the basic measures by which such communities are often described have little effect on the proportional impact that insects have on <b>primary</b> production. While <b>outbreaks</b> are significant predictors of higher negative impact on primary production, causes of outbreaks are not always related to traits of the plant community...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} notifiable {{avian influenza}} (HPNAI) {{is a disease}} caused by influenza A virus. It is frequently fatal in poultry. Since late 2003, disease outbreaks caused by the Asian strains of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus have ravaged the poultry industry {{with the death of}} over 200 million birds. The epidemic has spread from Asia to Europe and more recently to Africa. To date, more than 200 human fatalities have occurred. A clear understanding of the full epidemiology of the disease at the genetic and spatial/temporal level is critical for the management, control and eventual eradication of the virus. In this study, modern tools of molecular epidemiology (Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, and other epidemiological tools were used to explore the outbreak of HPNAI in Nigeria. The molecular and spatial analyses both concluded that Nigeria was infected with multiple infections. The spread of <b>primary</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> which affected mainly sectors 2 and 3 of the poultry industry as described by Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, were strongly linked to trades, live bird markets, inappropriate disposal of carcasses and poorly implemented control measures. This work did not find a strong correlation between wild birds and HPNAI H 5 N 1 in Nigeria. Some of the analyzed viruses showed genetic drift, and the implications of these for future epidemiology and ecology of avian influenza in Africa will need further evaluation. The option of vaccination and its implications were adjudged good, and its shortcomings were highlighted. Community initiative at fighting emergency diseases like HPNAI H 5 N 1 was similarly advocated. The financial losses to the Nigerian poultry industry were estimated at around $ 680 million. The risk of the spread of infection was assessed using ecological niche modeling and the whole of West Africa is at risk of infection, should no concrete action be taken to halt the spread. In conclusion, useful suggestions were proffered to affected countries like Nigeria, and unaffected countries that are at risk of infection, so that Africa can be safe from the scourge of HPNAI H 5 N 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} of our manuscript was {{to present an}} alter-nate hypothesis on large-scale climatic controls on epidemic cholera. Within this context data from Indus River Valley and Haiti were used to show that episodes of warm air tem-perature, followed by high rainfall may contribute to cholera occurrence. It appears that Gaudart and colleagues are not interpreting our results correctly. 1 We did not challenge the idea of importation, but rather disagree on the timing of such an event. Climate {{can play a role}} in a <b>primary</b> cholera <b>outbreak.</b> Spread of the disease within a population is a secondary route of transmission. Regarding references in our manuscript, we have provided all necessary and appro-priate references within the context of our results and inter-pretations (such as Chin and others, 2011). 2 We now present evidence, indicating our disagreement with the interpretation by Gaudart and colleagues. 1.

40|$|Coral reefs face {{a crisis}} due to {{local and global}} {{anthropogenic}} stressors. A {{large proportion of the}} ~ 50 % coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef has been attributed to outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns-seastar (COTS). A widely assumed cause of <b>primary</b> COTS <b>outbreaks</b> is increased larval survivorship due to higher food availability, linked with anthropogenic runoff. Our experiment using a range of algal food concentrations at three temperatures representing present day average and predicted future increases, demonstrated a strong influence of food concentration on development is modulated by temperature. A 2 °C increase in temperature led to a 4. 2 – 4. 9 times (at Day 10) or 1. 2 – 1. 8 times (Day 17) increase in late development larvae. A model indicated that food was the main driver, but that temperature was an important modulator of development. For instance, at 5000  cells ml− 1 food, a 2 °C increase may shorten developmental time by 30 % and may increase the probability of survival by 240 %. The main contribution of temperature is to ‘push’ well-fed larvae faster to settlement. We conclude that warmer sea temperature is an important co-factor promoting COTS outbreaks...|$|R

After providing exact and required information from questionnaires, the volunteers were randomly selected and 150 questionnaires were distributed between the two groups. 250 questionnaires (inventories) were statistically analyzed after collecting and monitoring the questionnaires. This study was performed by the technique of, correlation and analyzed by the use of descriptive and inferential statistical methods (K-square test). The results showed that: 1. The level of <b>primary</b> amenorrhea <b>outbreak</b> in athletes was meaningfully more than non-athletes (p 0. 05). 3. The level of secondary amenorrhea outbreak in non-athletes was observed more than athletes but the difference wasn’t meaningful between the two groups (p> 0. 05). 4.

40|$|In many cities, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - 1 seroprevalence among drug injectors stabilizes at 30 – 70 % for many years without secondary outbreaks that increase seroprevalence by 15 % or more. The authors considered how HIV- 1 incidence can remain moderate at seroprevalence levels that would give maximum incidence. Previously suggested answers include behavioral risk reduction and network saturation within high-risk subgroups. Among 767 drug injectors studied in 1991 – 1993, {{during a period of}} stable high seroprevalence in New York City, risk behaviors remained common, and networks were far from saturated. The authors suggest a different network-based mechanism: in stable high-prevalence situations, the relatively small sizes of subnetworks of linked seronegatives (within larger networks containing both infected and uninfected persons) may limit infectious <b>outbreaks.</b> Any <b>primary</b> infection <b>outbreak</b> would probably be limited to members of connected subcomponents of seronegatives, and the largest such subcomponent in the study contained only 18 members (of 415 seronegatives). Research and mathematical modeling should study conditions that may affect the size and stability of subcomponents of seronegatives. Finally, if the existence of small, connected components of seronegatives prevents secondary outbreaks, this protection may weaken, and vulnerability to new outbreaks increase, if HIV- 1 seroprevalence falls. Thus, in situations of declining prevalence, prevention programs should be maintained or strengthened. Am J Epidemiol 2000; 152 : 913 – 22...|$|R

The presence of a long-term totally-implanted central venous catheter {{appears to be a}} predisposing factor, while a peripheral venous catheter appears to have offered protection from infection. This is reinforced by fact that intervention measures controlled the outbreak, suggesting cross-contamination from a common source. These findings corroborate the fundamental role of the hospital infection control service in early intervention and reinforce the need for continued training of health professionals that perform this type of care...|$|R
