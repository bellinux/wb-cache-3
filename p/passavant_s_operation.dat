40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed.
