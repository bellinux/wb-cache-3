In {{order to}} inspect on wall {{condition}} inside the coke oven, an inspection device {{has been developed}} to protect a camera inside and sustains high temperature long enough {{so that it can}} be permanently-installed on the pusher ram beam. The temperature of the coking chamber during operation is about 1200 C while the maximum tolerable temperature of a camera is less than 40 C. The device has to function as a good thermal insulator with cooling element for the camera at the <b>pusher</b> <b>head</b> and for signal cables along the beam. In this paper, the necessary conditions of the inspective device were found out by building a three-dimensional numerical model of the device to simulate the temperature distribution inside the device with CFD commercial software...|$|E

5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media <b>push</b> <b>headed</b> by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion that was almost exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|R

50|$|Anteosaurus {{like other}} related therapsids had a {{thickened}} skull (pachyostosis), {{and this has}} been suggested as an adaptation for head butting, or perhaps more aptly for <b>head</b> <b>pushing.</b> Also like with Moschops, the overall build seems to have been for projecting its body weight forwards. Not only could this have been useful in dominance <b>head</b> <b>pushing</b> contests, but it may have also been a technique to knock over unsuspecting or weakened prey.|$|R

Ageeb suffocated shortly after the aircraft took off.|$|R
60|$|Here {{he poked}} a little table through the window, {{and put a}} bottle and two glasses, one a tooth-glass, upon it. Then he withdrew again to finish shaving.

2500|$|Mark III (Referred to as [...] "All New War" [...] by Privateer Press) {{is another}} {{reworking}} of the game. As with MK II all models and point levels of army lists have been updated. Additionally, many legacy rules have changed, specifically {{in regards to}} targeting one's own models with power attacks and charges (no longer allowed), warjacks that begin in their controlling warcaster's control range now [...] "power up" [...] or receive a free focus point during the control phase of the game, and some power attacks such as the <b>push,</b> <b>head</b> lock, and weapon lock have been removed. Also guidelines for terrain have been changed and Privateer Press has begun the Community Integrated Development or CID process to involve players {{in the development of}} errata, new releases, and theme forces as a quality control mechanism in what they are calling a [...] "continuous development" [...] goal. The idea of this process is to avoid new version releases following Mark 3. As a result, all model cards and the base rules set are available on the Privateer Press website.|$|R

2500|$|The three extracapsular ligaments {{of the hip}} joint— the iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and pubofemoral ligaments— form a {{twisting}} mechanism encircling {{the neck}} of the femur. [...] When sitting, with the hip joint flexed, these ligaments become lax permitting a high degree of mobility in the joint. [...] When standing, with the hip joint extended, the ligaments get twisted around the femoral neck, <b>pushing</b> the <b>head</b> of the femur firmly into the Acetabulum, thus stabilizing the joint.|$|R

50|$|B. bimaculatus queens forage on Aquilegia flowers.

Workers enter the Aquilegia spurs by <b>pushing</b> their <b>head</b> and part of their thorax into the spur's mouth. They then extend the maxillae and tongue into the spur to drink nectar, repeating this process on multiple spurs of the same plant before visiting the next one.|$|R
