40|$|We {{consider}} an industrial application {{consisting of the}} mass minimization of a frame in an injection moulding machine. This frame has to compensate the forces acting on the mould inside the machine and has to fulfill certain critical constraints. The deformation of that frame with constant thickness is described by the <b>plain</b> <b>stress</b> state equations for linear elasticity. If the thickness varies then we use a generalized <b>plain</b> <b>stress</b> state with constant thickness in the coarse grid elements. These direct problems are solved by an adaptive multigrid solver. The mass minimization problem leads to a constrained minimization problem for a non-linear functional which will be solved by some standard optimization algorithm which requires the gradients with respect to design parameters. For the shape optimization problem, {{we assume that the}} machine components consist of simple geometrical primitives determined by a few design parameters. Therefore, we calculate the gradient in the shape optimization by means of numerical differentiation which requires the solution of approximately 4 direct problems per design parameter. The adaptive solver guarantees the detection of critical regions automatically, and ensures a good approximation to the exact solution of the direct problem. A different strategy has been implemented for optimal sizing problems. Here, we have to handle hundreds of vary...|$|E

Results: All patients reported good-excellent results from 6 months after surgery. Radiological examination demonstrated some superior clavicular migration in all patients within 1 month of the procedure, although never more than that seen with a grade 2 dislocation.

However, medial deltoid ligament ruptures are difficult to diagnose using current imaging modalities. We hypothesized that ultrasonography {{can be used to}} accurately allow early clinical assessment of ankle fracture stability, thereby negating the need to perform <b>plain</b> film <b>stress</b> views of the acutely injured ankle. This prospective study included 12 patients (age range, 18 - 72) with supination external rotation fractures requiring operative fixation. Following induction of anesthesia, ultrasonography examination was performed, followed by an arthrogram under fluoroscopic screening. Radiographs, ultrasonography, and arthrographic findings were compared. There was 100 % correlation between ultrasonography and arthrogram findings. Ultrasonography accurately diagnosed medial deltoid rupture with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 100 %.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} value of CT-arthrography imaging in the {{diagnosis}} of knee osteoarthritis and to facilitate the selection of partial versus total knee replacement. Methods: A retrospective study of 100 patients that had either medial unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) (N= 50) or total knee replacement (TKR) (N= 50). One observer measured lower limb mechanical alignment and osteoarthritis patterns of the knee in each compartment with radiographs, CT-arthrography and full leg standing radiographs. Results: All patients had Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV osteoarthritis of the medial femorotibial joint with a mean (SD) varus alignment of the lower limb (172 ° (3. 5 °) HKA-angle). Zone mechanical axis distribution showed strong correlation with HKA-axis. Arthritis patterns were different for patients selected for UKR or TKR. UKR patients had anteromedial osteoarthritis and wear of the medial facet of the patella in contrast to TKR patients who had medial osteoarthritis associated with diffuse or lateral patellofemoral wear and wear of the central or posterior zones of the lateral compartment. Medial facet wear of the patella is related to more important varus alignment of the lower limb (Kennedy zone 0 and 1). Conclusion: CT-arthrography imaging can show lesions that are not visible on <b>plain</b> or <b>stress</b> radiographs because of central or posterior localization with surrounding intact cartilage.

John C. Hudson opens the volume with an overview of the American Great <b>Plains,</b> <b>stressing</b> the impact of energy conservation policies on the development of activities as varied as the westward movement of the slaughter houses and the innovation of 2 ̆ 2 boxed 2 ̆ 2 (boneless) beef shipments, the coal mining boom on the plains, the rationalization (i. e., reduction) of railroads and grain elevator facilities, and the promotion of soil conservation through no-till farming. William J. Carlyle predicts that prairie agriculture in the 1980 s will generally continue to show the trends already established, namely, fluctuating production still mainly at the mercy of the weather; decreasing numbers of farmers and increasing farm size, often of rented land; increased mechanization and even videotape viewing of cattle for sale; possible on-farm cropping for gasohol fuel supplies; and an increasing amount of foreign ownership despite restrictive legislation. Hansgeorg Schlichtmann provides a brief preview of a larger study of the documentation of changing patterns of rural settlement from the 1930 s onward, with abandonment and relocation of residences associated with farm amalgamations; the reemergence of community pastures from the bankrupted farmlands; and continued successes of at least some group settlements such as the Hutterites. Carson H. Templeton decries the lack of a Canadian federal energy policy and predicts that political instability might be one result. Richard C. Rounds provides a comprehensive review of the background to the current crisis in wildlife conservation on the prairies and notes the frustrations of the bureaucracies, whose difficulties are only partially offset by the limited success of private conservation institutions such as Ducks Unlimited (Canada), a company managing Canadian wetlands for, among others, American hunters. Finally, J. Keith Semple provides an overview of the Canadian prairies to balance Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s introductory paper on the Great Plains.
