40|$|Packaging is a {{fundamental}} element in logistics, which significantly affects costs and efficiency of logistics activities. Returnable and reusable packaging items are seen as corporate assets and capital investments for companies. However, one problem regarding returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> is that companies usually have weak visibility and control over them especially in extensive supply chain networks. The purpose of control is to assure returning of assets, satisfy service level and make sure to utilize packaging efficiently. The cores of this study constitute identifying important factors in business models regarding <b>packaging</b> <b>management,</b> and evaluation of their efficiency based on critical performance indicators i. e. leakage and turnaround time in the network. Therefore, this study first created an analytical framework {{in order to provide}} holistic view over packaging systems and their management by combining different elements in the packaging control systems. The six important dimensions of the framework are loop design, packaging ownership types, pool control systems, order management, network design and tracking systems. Then this study analyzes the efficiency of the packaging pool at Volvo Logistics Services and finally provides recommended solutions to achieve higher level of control in their <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Problem Little {{research}} has been conducted on how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the Scandinavian automotive supply chain. Sources also propose that returnable packaging is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how packaging and returnable packaging are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> from the perspective of suppliers, sub-suppliers and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. Non-returnable and returnable packaging was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient returnable <b>packaging</b> <b>management.</b> These were found specific for the internal, outbound and inbound flows and further divided into fundamental and efficiency factors...|$|E

The box of cereal we pick up in the morning, the shaving cream, soap, or makeup we use, the products we use at dinner, and even the bedding we sleep upon does or has involved the use of packaging at some time. There is no escaping it. But what exactly is packaging? A few pieces of cardboard? A label or printing on the box? Plastic wrap? J. H. Briston and T. J.

The activities of the CEI are divided into five core areas: air protection, water protection, waste management, nature protection and forest protection.

40|$|The {{construction}} sector {{is responsible for}} around 28 % of the total waste volume generated in Europe, which exceeds the amount of household waste. This {{has led to an}} increase of different research studies focusing on construction waste quantification. However, within the research studies made, packaging waste has been analyzed to a limited extent. This article focuses on the packaging waste stream generated in the {{construction sector}}. To this purpose current on-site waste <b>packaging</b> <b>management</b> has been assessed by monitoring ten Mediterranean residential building works. The findings of the experimental data collection revealed that the incentive measures implemented by the construction company to improve on-site waste sorting failed to achieve the intended purpose, showing low segregation ratios. Subsequently, through an analytical study the generation patterns for packaging waste are established, leading to the identification of the prevailing kinds of packaging and the products responsible for their generation. Results indicate that plastic waste generation maintains a constant trend throughout the whole construction process, while cardboard becomes predominant {{towards the end of the}} construction works with switches and sockets from the electricity stage. Understanding the production patterns of packaging waste will be beneficial for adapting waste management strategies to the identified patterns for the specific nature of packaging waste within the context of construction worksites. 3. 220 JCR (2014) Q 1, 46 / 221 Enviromental sciences; Q 2, 12 / 47 Engineering, environmentalUE...|$|E
