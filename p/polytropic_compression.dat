Autoignition of the combustible mixture can occur only upon reaching the characteristic self-ignition temperature Tz. It should take place during (near end) the load compression. In order to achieve the fuel mixture ignition temperature Tz in the system, usually it is proposed adjusting the engine compression ratio,H. However, it is quite cumbersome especially in case of frequent changes of engine load (there are also difficulties with the precise advance angle adjusting of fuel mixture ignition). According to our conception, the other method of autoignition adjustment can be successfully applied.

40|$|During the {{start-up}} of the propulsion system of a spacecraft, the filling of an evacuated pipeline, {{a process known}} as priming, can generate severe pressure peaks due to the slam (water hammer) of the propellant against a closed thruster valve. The downstream conditions strongly affect the pressure surge; in the case of evacuated lines these pressure peaks can be as high as 250 bar and may lead to structure failure if not properly taken into account in the sub-system dimensioning. At DLR Lampoldshausen a new test-bench has been built in order to investigate priming process and other fluid transient phenomena. The experimental investigation presented in this paper includes priming test in both pre-pressurized and evacuated pipelines. Geometry of the test-section is a 2000 mm straight pipe with a relative large diameter (19 mm) in order to examine high mass flow. From a physical point of view, the modeling of priming is a complex task, as it involves transient multiphase flow.

40|$|The Norwegian {{petroleum}} industry has {{played an important}} role in the country’s industrial development since the early 1970 s. At present, however, the largest oil and gas fields on the Norwegian continental shelf have been developed. To maintain its position and production rates in the future, the {{petroleum industry}} rely on improved recovery from existing fields and the development of smaller, remoter and more technically complicated discoveries. A major contribution to accomplishing this will be made by the development of new and cost-efficient technology. One consequence of technological progress in recent years is that a greater proportion of the processing equipment is being installed subsea. Ormen Lange and Snøhvit are gas fields developed on the basis of subsea solutions, where wellstream processing is located on land. These discoveries are characterised by high gas fractions with relative small amounts of liquid. Gas containing less that 5 % liquid on a volume basis is denoted wet gas. To maintain production rates as well pressure decreases, boosting the wellstream is essential. This has therefore created a big incentive in recent years to develop subsea boosting technology. Subsea compression is also applicable for boosting existing gas fields to increase tail production and in development of marginal fields where subsea boosting can be utilised in transportation of wellstream to nearby processing facility. Technology development for subsea compression is currently based on two alternatives: compressing the unprocessed wellstream and subsea separation with compression based on traditional gas compressors and pumps. This thesis evaluates performance prediction models for wet gas compression. No commercial available wet gas compressors exist at present, but several concepts for such equipment have been tested. No performance and test standards currently exist for wet gas compressors. To ensure nominated flow under varying fluid flow conditions, a complete understanding of compressor performance is essential. Present evaluation methods for compressor performance fail when evaluating the compression of wet gas. The development of a wet gas compressor performance model has been based on the polytropic approach given in ASME and ISO standards, and a full review of this method is given. Assuming a <b>polytropic</b> <b>compression</b> path, the method is based on averaged gas properties of inlet and outlet condition. Depending on how this <b>polytropic</b> <b>compression</b> analysis is implemented, the review has revealed up to 4 % deviation in polytropic head and efficiency for some specific compressors. This adds an extra uncertainty in compressor performance verification. Even though the API 617 allows up to 4 % deviation, some compressors have to meet a more stringent demand, such as 2 % at the Snøhvit gas liquefaction plant. Existing computer technology permits a direct integration of the compression path where the variation in actual gas properties along the path is included.   This method eliminates the averaging of gas properties which the Schultz procedure includes. Direct integration is of special interest when evaluating wet gas compression. Phase changes along the compression path are included, enabling a detailed prediction to be made of the actual volumetric flow rate for the various compressor stages. This thesis reports the implementation of the direct integration procedure for wet gas performance prediction. The procedure enables generic wet gas compression to be studied, which forms the foundation for performance analysis with variations in operation conditions and fluid properties. The polytropic procedure in its current form does not permit a direct comparison of wet and dry gas conditions owing to the influence of a high-density liquid phase in wet conditions. Correction methods to account for these changes are presented. These correction parameters are verified against the results from a wet gas compressor test. The compressor was tested on fluid conditions typically encountered in a North Sea gas and condensate field.

40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies, such as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI), {{have been}} identified as one method to achieve future emissions and fuel economy regulations for diesel engines. These advanced combustion strategies require precise inputs to the combustion process to maintain stable combustion, maximize fuel efficiency, and minimize emissions. Given that the inputs to the combustion process can be considered outputs of the gas exchange process, an accurate understanding of the dynamics of the gas exchange process is critical to accurate control of the combustion process. ^ The work presented in this thesis focuses on modeling for estimation and the estimation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow. In the process of developing a candidate estimation strategy for the EGR flow, extensive efforts were focused on the development of a physically-based, control-oriented, gas exchange model; specifically, the development of an exhaust enthalpy model for application in the gas exchange model. The exhaust enthalpy model is utilized to determine the temperature of gas flow out of the cylinder. This is accomplished by first determining the conditions in the cylinder when the intake valve close (IVC) then assuming a <b>polytropic</b> <b>compression</b> process to top dead center (TDC). To maintain simplicity in the model, fuel injection is neglected, and it is assumed that combustion begins at TDC in a constant pressure process until the end of combustion (EOC). Upon completion of combustion, the expansion process is modeled as a polytropic expansion process until the exhaust valves open (EVO). The proposed model for exhaust gas enthalpy was extensively experimentally validated against 193 data points and is shown to accurately predict the exhaust gas temperature, generally well within 10 % error. ^ Ultimately, the gas exchange model, including the exhaust gas enthalpy model, was utilized in the development of an estimation strategy for EGR flow. The estimation strategy utilizes the exhaust manifold pressure state equation and feedback from the exhaust manifold pressure sensor, as well as models of the EGR flow, charge flow, and turbine flow to estimate the EGR flow. Preliminary validation of the estimator has been accomplished utilizing both the gas exchange model and GT-POWER simulations, with the results demonstrating that with accurate models for charge flow and turbine flow, the estimator can accurately predict the EGR flow. ...|$|E

The instrumentation provided information needed to determine the system COP, cooling capacity, mass flow rates, and thermodynamic states of the refrigerant at the inlet and exit of each component in the system.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{prototype}} external heat engine based on the Ericsson cycle, {{as an alternative to the}} internal combustion engine, to be used as a small-scale power source for rural Africa. Subsequently test and evaluate its viability and potential to fulﬁl the requirements of such an application. Despite the wide range of possible prime movers, it appears there is still a need for a simple, low-tech, low-output power plant for developing countries. This created an opportunity to revisit the origins of basic engine design in order to seek an alternative solution to the modern internal combustion engine. The hot air or external heat engine developed in the l 800 's provides an attractive alternative as it has a number of advantages over the modem internal combustion engine. A hot air engine is a cyclical heat engine that uses an external heat source, heat exchangers, pistons and a gaseous working ﬂuid contained within the engine to convert heat to mechanical work by volumetric expansion. The project looked at old and new engines in an attempt to capture the best of both. Two experimental engines were constructed during the course of this project, the ﬁrst engine was built to provide insight into the functioning of an unconventional external heat engine and to test the validity of theoretical predictions made using a thermodynamic computer model. This engine was designed to function off a cycle consisting of a <b>polytropic</b> <b>compression,</b> a polytropic expansion with heat addition and a constant volume heat rejection process, achieved using a two-stroke principal to exchange the hot exhaust gas with cold recharge gas. Based on experience gained from this model, the second generation engine was designed to circumvent the problems experienced with the ﬁrst engine. It functioned off a near Ericsson cycle, with the compression and expansion truncated for practical purposes and valve control being achieved with solenoid valves controlled by a computer. A thermodynamic computer model similar to the one used for the first engine was employed to optimise the design of this engine. Experimental investigations were carried out with the Ericsson engine to examine how closely the actual cycle resembled that predicted by the thermodynamic model and to determine engine performance. The power and mean effective pressure produced by the engine were determined and compared with friction data. Hence the potential of this engine to meet the criteria necessary to function as a small-scale rural power source was judged and resultant conclusions as to the engines feasibility were drawn. The actual pressure-volume diagrams obtained closely conformed to the theoretical expectations for the cycle and the truncated Ericsson cycle functioned sufficiently well. However, the friction in the system was too high a percentage of the total engine output and therefore the engine was unable to operate unaided. Although the hot air engine has the potential to provide cheap power efﬁciently, in practice these engines need to be highly pressurised and run at temperatures close to their material limit in order to obtain useful work from them. Therefore, although with the use of low friction seals and high pressurisation the engine could potentially produce the 5 kW design target, due to the complexity these efforts would add to the engine it is recommended that other options be explored for rural power generation in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Cylinder {{pressure}} {{modeling and}} heat release analysis are today important and standard tools for engineers and researchers, when developing and tuning new engines. Being able to accurately model and extract {{information from the}} cylinder pressure {{is important for the}} interpretation and validity of the result. The first part of the thesis treats single-zone cylinder pressure modeling, where the specific heat ratio model constitutes a key part. This model component is therefore investigated more thoroughly. For the purpose of reference, the specific heat ratio is calculated for burned and unburned gases, assuming that the unburned mixture is frozen and that the burned mixture is at chemical equilibrium. Use of the reference model in heat release analysis is too time consuming and therefore a set of simpler models, both existing and newly developed, are compared to the reference model. A two-zone mean temperature model and the Vibe function are used to parameterize the mass fraction burned. The mass fraction burned is used to interpolate the specific heats for the unburned and burned mixture, and to form the specific heat ratio, which renders a cylinder pressure modeling error in the same order as the measurement noise, and fifteen times smaller than the model originally suggested in Gatowski et al. (1984). The computational time is increased with 40 % compared to the original setting, but reduced by a factor 70 compared to precomputed tables from the full equilibrium program. The specific heats for the unburned mixture are captured within 0. 2 % by linear functions, and the specific heats for the burned mixture are captured within 1 % by higher-order polynomials for the major operating range of a spark ignited (SI) engine. In the second part, four methods for compression ratio estimation based on cylinder pressure traces are developed and evaluated for both simulated and experimental cycles. Three methods rely upon a model of <b>polytropic</b> <b>compression</b> for the cylinder pressure. It is shown that they give a good estimate of the compression ratio at low compression ratios, although the estimates are biased. A method based on a variable projection algorithm with a logarithmic norm of the cylinder pressure yields the smallest confidence intervals and shortest computational time for these three methods. This method is recommended when computational time is an important issue. The polytropic pressure model lacks information about heat transfer and therefore the estimation bias increases with the compression ratio. The fourth method includes heat transfer, crevice effects, and a commonly used heat release model for firing cycles. This method estimates the compression ratio more accurately in terms of bias and variance. The method is more computationally demanding and thus recommended when estimation accuracy is the most important property. In order to estimate the compression ratio as accurately as possible, motored cycles with as high initial pressure as possible should be used. The objective in part 3 is to develop an estimation tool for heat release analysis that is accurate, systematic and efficient. Two methods that incorporate prior knowledge of the parameter nominal value and uncertainty in a systematic manner are presented and evaluated. Method 1 is based on using a singular value decomposition of the estimated hessian, {{to reduce the number of}} estimated parameters one-by-one. Then the suggested number of parameters to use is found as the one minimizing the Akaike final prediction error. Method 2 uses a regularization technique to include the prior knowledge in the criterion function. Method 2 gives more accurate estimates than method 1. For method 2, prior knowledge with individually set parameter uncertainties yields more accurate and robust estimates. Once a choice of parameter uncertainty has been done, no user interaction is needed. Method 2 is then formulated for three different versions, which differ in how they determine how strong the regularization should be. The quickest version is based on ad-hoc tuning and should be used when computational time is important. Another version is more accurate and flexible to changing operating conditions, but is more computationally demanding...|$|E
