40|$|Social {{identity}} voting (SIV) is a {{new model}} of voting behavior based on the principles of social identity theory. We introduce and use this model to analyze roll call votes for the 35 th through 112 th US Congresses. Comparing out-of-sample accuracy of SIV and Poole and Rosenthal’s Weighted NOMINAL Three-step Estimation (W-NOMINATE), we find that SIV performs better than the one- or two-dimensional W-NOMINATE model and that generally, W-NOMINATE needs up to 10 dimensions to produce accuracy comparable to that of SIV. The differences between SIV and W-NOMINATE are further clarified in three case studies: first, a longitudinal examination of all Congresses; second, an analysis <b>of</b> the 112 <b>th</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives; and third, a study of the Tea Party caucus in the 112 <b>th</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives. Each study sheds new light on the potential motivations driving voting behavior, supporting our assertion that the SIV and W-NOMINATE models provide two distinct approaches to understanding voting records. SIV, with its emphasis on political identity derived from group membership, expresses combinations of individual and group preferences which contribute to legislators’ ideological classifications...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} in Europe face large-scale renovation <b>of</b> 20 <b>th</b> century <b>housing.</b> Although challenges for energy efficient renovation {{are similar in}} many countries contextual differences create varying possibilities and barriers for actions. We present a comparative study of managerial practices regarding refurbishment of housing in Austria and Sweden, countries with large stocks of publicly built, owned and managed housing. Due {{to what we have}} identified as socio-technical traditions of the welfare state, rather distinct renovation strategies are applied. We conclude that a more reflective approach to refurbishment that coordinates policy for housing and sustainability with detailed knowledge of the stock and its socio-technical context is a way forward...|$|R
40|$|One {{component}} of the heritage of publicly funded property developments put up since the Second World War is residential districts designed by leading architects in which upgrading has {{to take into account}} considerations of safeguarding. The raising of the threshold from 50 to 70 years before safeguarding norms come into effect means that local authorities and management companies have sole responsibility for the modification and safeguarding of this heritage. This paper looks at some examples <b>of</b> 20 <b>th</b> century <b>housing</b> estates designated for upgrading in order to highlight the specific strategies adopted, selected from a range of actions based on the need for accurate knowledge and collective agreement by all the parties involved right from the design phase...|$|R
