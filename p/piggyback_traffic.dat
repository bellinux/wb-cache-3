50|$|Clearances {{were also}} raised for the <b>piggyback</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Italian {{side as well}} on the Simplon {{southern}} approach. Here, too, for financial reasons, at times only one line was cleared for the rolling highway. South of Domodossola, the single line to Novara via Lake Orta was electrified and modernized.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, Hurricane Agnes {{destroyed}} {{many miles}} of track and related assets, especially in southwestern New York State. The main line between Hornell and Binghamton was abandoned as {{not worth the}} high cost of rebuilding it. The cost of what repairs were done, and the loss of revenue, forced the company into bankruptcy, filing for reorganization under Section 77 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on June 26. [...] The completion of the Interstate 80 highway across Pennsylvania and New Jersey by 1971 added to the Erie Lackawanna's financial problems, as it diverted <b>piggyback</b> <b>traffic</b> previously garnered from less than truckload shipping companies such as Navajo and Cooper-Jarrett. On the flip-side, EL was able to land large contracts with UPS because of its ability to move <b>piggyback</b> <b>traffic</b> between Chicago and Metro New York more reliably, although not faster than Penn Central (and formerly, New York Central). For example, in 1971, the Penn Central advertised a 24 and 1/2 hour piggyback service from Metro New York to Metro Chicago in the Official Guide of the Railways, while the EL's Employees Timetable Number 3, New York Division, showed its fastest comparable schedule to be 28 hours and 45 minutes. By 1973, the Penn Central's fastest piggyback service between these points was shown in the Official Guide to be 26 hours and 15 minutes, while the EL's Employees Timetable Number 4 showed that the EL's fastest comparable schedule was 29 and 1/2 hours.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} choose a {{rational}} piggyback technology there was offered a method that envisages the automated system improvement by giving it a heuristic nature. The automated system {{is based on a}} set of methods, techniques and strategies aimed at creating optimal resource saving technologies, which makes it possible to take into account with maximum efficiency the interests of all the participants of the delivery process. When organizing the <b>piggyback</b> <b>traffic</b> there is presupposed the coordination of operations between the <b>piggyback</b> <b>traffic</b> participants to minimize the cargo travel time...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} several {{multicast}} schemes in optical burst-switched WDM networks {{taking into consideration}} of the overheads due to control packets and guard bands (GBs) of bursts on separate channels (wavelengths). A straightforward scheme is called Separate Multicasting (S-MCAST) where each source node constructs separate bursts for its multicast (per each multicast session) and unicast traffic. To reduce the overhead due to GBs (and control packets), one may <b>piggyback</b> the multicast <b>traffic</b> in bursts containing unicast traffic using a scheme called Multiple Unicasting (M-UCAST). The third scheme is called Tree-Shared Multicasting (TS-MCAST) whereby multicast traffic belonging to multiple multicast sessions can be mixed together in a burst, which is delivered via a shared multicast tree. The multicast schemes (MUCAST and TS-MCAST) are compared with S-MCAST in terms of bandwidth consumed and processing load...|$|R
25|$|North American railroads {{operated}} 1,471,736 {{freight cars}} and 31,875 locomotives, with 215,985 employees. They originated 39.53 million carloads (averaging 63 tons each) and generated $81.7 billion in freight revenue of present 2014. The average haul was 917 miles. The largest (Class 1) U.S. railroads carried 10.17 million intermodal containers and 1.72 million <b>piggyback</b> trailers. Intermodal <b>traffic</b> was 6.2% of tonnage originated and 12.6% of revenue. The largest commodities were coal, chemicals, farm products, nonmetallic minerals and intermodal. Other major commodities carried include lumber, automobiles, and waste materials. Coal alone was 43.3% of tonnage and 24.7% of revenue. Coal accounted for {{roughly half of}} U.S. electricity generation and was a major export. As natural gas became cheaper than coal, coal supplies dropped 11% in 2015 but coal rail freight dropped by up to 40%, allowing an increase in car transport by rail, some in tri-level railcars.|$|R
