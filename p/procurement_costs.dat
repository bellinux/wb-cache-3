Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 {{percent of the cost of}} photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity. Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as feed-in tariff programs. [...] Also, Renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate [...] that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy <b>procurement</b> <b>costs.</b> In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean, geothermal, municipal solid waste, hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, the HASC Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee {{proposed}} {{legislation that would}} direct the Air Force [...] "to conduct a comprehensive assessment and study of {{the costs associated with}} resuming production of F-22 aircraft." [...] Defense Secretary Robert Gates had production halted at 187 F-22s (at a cost of $67 billion) to direct funds for ongoing irregular warfare operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Since then, lawmakers and the Pentagon noted that air warfare systems of Russia and China were catching up to U.S. air superiority capabilities. Previous estimates of restarting production placed figures at around $2 billion, including $300–500 million in non-recurring start-up costs, with an estimated unit cost of $233 million for a production run of 75 aircraft over five years. [...] Lockheed has proposed upgrading the 36 early training-model Block 20 Raptors into combat-coded Block 30/35 versions as a way to increase numbers available for deployment. On 9 June 2017, the Air Force submitted their report to Congress stating they had no plans to restart the F-22 production line due to economic and operational issues; it estimated it would cost approximately $50 billion to procure 194 additional F-22s, at a cost of $206–$216 million per aircraft, including approximately $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up costs and $40.4 billion for aircraft <b>procurement</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the Airbus {{corporate}} strength behind it, AirInsight {{anticipate the}} CSeries {{market share of}} the 100-149 seat market over 20 years will increase from 40% of 5,636 aircraft ( [...] sales) to 55-60%, around 3,010 aircraft. [...] Supplier costs could be cut by 30-40% by Airbus' market power, as a 10% <b>procurement</b> <b>costs</b> decrease would add six gross margin points to the program. Boeing seems seriously concerned it cannot match fleet package deals enabled by the partnership. A CS500 stretch would allow Airbus to enlarge its A320-family replacement to better compete with the proposed Boeing New Midsize Airplane.|$|E
30|$|We {{formulated}} {{a method}} for minimising the expected <b>procurement</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity and we reported the results of simulations of the proposed procurement method using actual data. From these simulations, we found that this method minimised the <b>procurement</b> <b>cost.</b> Based on the above discussion, to reduce the <b>procurement</b> <b>cost</b> {{it was necessary to}} estimate not only the accuracy of predictions but also the prediction error distributions. In this paper, the prediction error distributions were assumed to be normal distributions, but the actual prediction errors did not always become normal distributions.

2500|$|Development started {{under the}} [...] "Advanced Technology Bomber" [...] (ATB) project during the Carter administration; its {{expected}} performance {{was one of}} his reasons for the cancellation of the supersonic B-1A bomber. The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program. Program costs rose throughout development. Designed and manufactured by Northrop, later Northrop Grumman, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737million (in 1997 dollars). Total <b>procurement</b> <b>costs</b> averaged $929million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support. The total program cost including development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1billion per aircraft in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 February 2014, the USAF reasserted the bomber's need at {{the annual}} Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Fla. It was stated it will be fielded in the mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the bombers will be procured. Lt. Gen. Burton Field {{clarified}} the 80 to 100 range is due to uncertainty over the price rather than a figure representing the minimum number of bombers needed to mitigate risk. Some USAF leaders expect the unit cost limit of $550 million per aircraft will be exceeded with additional equipment added to the airframe. The cost goal is to set design constraints to prevent extra requirements for capability growth desires and untested technologies that would increase the price more from being incorporated during development. Though the final cost may be greater than planned, a fixed price objective is expected to keep average <b>procurement</b> <b>costs</b> affordable. Rather than the price ceiling being too low to meet requirements, the USAF sees this arrangement as itself and the potential contractor being disciplined about the bomber's missions and roles. Research and development expenses {{are likely to be}} [...] "significant", but not expected to be double the cost of production aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Procuring {{material}} from commodity spot markets can flexibly fulfil a forward production demand, but {{increase the risk}} of high <b>procurement</b> <b>cost</b> due to spot price volatility. In this paper, a dynamic stack-and-roll hedging approach using futures contracts is proposed. The approach aims at mitigating the <b>procurement</b> <b>cost</b> risk and optimising the terminal revenue received from the procurement and hedging activities. It separates the procurement planning horizon into multiple stages, along with varying hedging positions in the nearby futures contracts. Hedging positions are adjusted in response to commodity price behaviour and contemporary perceived information about forward production demand. Guided by the mean-variance criteria over the terminal revenue, dynamic programming is applied to derive a closed-form solution for optimal hedging positions in a discrete-time Markovian setting. Numerical experiments are carried out to assess the proposed approach with explicit solution in a realistic stochastic environment. The price processes are modelled by a fractal nonlinear regression model using real price data of China’s commodity market, while demand information process is modelled by Bayesian formula. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms naive hedging strategy, and effectively mitigates the <b>procurement</b> <b>cost</b> risk. postprin...|$|R
