50|$|<b>Phenindamine</b> (Nolahist, Thephorin) is an {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic {{closely related}} to cyproheptadine. It was developed by Hoffman-La Roche in the late 1940s. It is used to treat symptoms of the common cold and allergies, such as sneezing, itching, rashes, and hives. Its efficacy against some symptoms of opioid withdrawal was researched in the 1950s and 1960s {{in a number of}} countries; William S. Burroughs' book Junkie mentions this technique. Like many other first-generation antihistamines, <b>phenindamine</b> has useful potentiating effects on many narcotic analgesics and is even more useful with those opioids which release histamine when in the body.|$|E

40|$|The local {{application}} of antihistaminic agents has been recommended {{for the treatment}} of a variety of skin conditions (Feinberg and Bernstein, 1947; Perry, 1947; Laymon and Schmid, 1948; Friedlander and Feinberg, 1946). Since there is a considerable variation in the results reported in the current literature, a direct pharmacological study of the local action of some of these agents was under-taken. Four antihistamines were used: I. Doxylamine succinate (dimethylamino-ethoxy methylbenzylpyridine, Decapryn-Merrell) (Brown and Werner, 1948; Brown, 1948); II. <b>Phenindamine</b> hydrogen tartrate (2 -methyl- 9 -phenyl- 2, 3, 4...|$|E
