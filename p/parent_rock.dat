5|$|Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with {{passages}} totaling about , {{formed in}} marble. The <b>parent</b> <b>rock</b> was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes {{that created the}} Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.|$|E
5|$|Commercially viable natural {{deposits}} of graphite occur {{in many parts}} of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller {{deposits of}} graphite are obtained by crushing the <b>parent</b> <b>rock</b> and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the <b>parent</b> <b>rock</b> and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E

50|$|The <b>parent</b> <b>rocks</b> were serpentinized {{during the}} Variscan {{regional}} metamorphism {{which took place}} about 400 to 350 million years BP. In the Limousin the main metamorphism was mediovariscan and of the Barrovian type with medium pressure and medium to high temperature conditions (MP/MT metamorphism). It {{is responsible for the}} regional foliation. The <b>parent</b> <b>rocks,</b> which had formed under high temperatures and relatively high pressures, underwent retrograde metamorphism in several stages right down to chlorite schists as an end product. The chloritization seems to be general and can be seen to affect other basement rocks (i.e. granites and granodiorites) in the Limousin.|$|R
25|$|Soils of {{the basin}} come {{primarily}} from andesitic volcanic rocks and granodiorite, with minor areas of metamorphic rock. Some of the valley bottoms and lower hill slopes are mantled with glacial moraines, or glacial outwash material derived from the <b>parent</b> <b>rock.</b> Sandy soils, rock outcrops and rubble and stony colluvium account for over 70% of the land area in the basin. The basin soils (in the < 2nbsp&mm fraction) are generally 65–85% sand (0.05–2.0nbsp&mm).|$|E

25|$|Aqueous {{minerals}} are minerals {{that form}} in water, either by chemical alteration of pre-existing rock or by precipitation out of solution. The minerals indicate where liquid water existed {{long enough to}} react chemically with rock. Which minerals form depends on temperature, salinity, pH, and composition of the <b>parent</b> <b>rock.</b> Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. The OMEGA spectrometer and the MER rovers both uncovered evidence for aqueous minerals. OMEGA revealed two distinct kinds of aqueous deposits. The first, containing sulfates such as gypsum and kieserite, is found in layered deposits of Hesperian age (Martian middle age, roughly from 3.7 to 3 billion years ago). The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of Noachian age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The MER Opportunity rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The Lower Pleistocene {{bentonite}} {{deposits of}} Eastern Milos, Greece {{have been formed}} {{at the expense of}} volcaniclastic rocks under submarine conditions. Systematic variation of the major chemical elements reveals that he deposits were formed from different precursors which were erupted from different volcanic centers belonging to at least two separate volcanic provinces. The volcanic eruptions were probably subaqueous. The major authigenic phases are smectite, K-feldspar, opal-CT and the zeolites mordenite and clinoptilolite. The deposits have a complex history and have been affected by hydrothermal alteration. The geological features ofbentonites coupled by the presence of abundant authigenic K-feldspar indicate that alteration of the <b>parent</b> volcanoclastic <b>rocks</b> took place under low temperatures and is probably not related to hydrothermal lteration, which is a separate vent. Hydrothermal lteration has modified both the mineralogical characteristics and the properties of bentonites. Alteration of the <b>parent</b> <b>rocks</b> to ben-tonites was favoured by high water:wall rock ratios and fluid flow and is associated with leaching and subsequent removal of Na, K and Ca. The source of Mg was the <b>parent</b> <b>rocks</b> and only small scale Mg-uptake from the sea water has probably taken place. The formation of authigenic K-feldspar has probably been favoured by a high K § + activity ratio and high Si activity of the pore fluid.

500|$|The <b>parent</b> <b>rock</b> {{in which}} the cave {{developed}} was formed about 190million years ago as limestone {{that was part of}} a tectonic plate beneath the Pacific Ocean. Granitic plutons intruded this part of the ocean crust, the Applegate terrane, about 160million years ago. As the oceanic crust carrying the terrane subducted under the North American plate, the terrane accreted onto the North American Plate and the limestone was subjected to heat and pressure that metamorphosed it to marble. Further tectonic movements eventually lifted the marble to about [...] above sea level. The marble block containing the cave is at least [...] long, [...] wide, and about [...] high.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{referred}} to as a [...] "cave", Mummy Cave is actually a broad, shallow alcove in a vertical cliff. It owes its depth to its overall size and the stability of the <b>parent</b> <b>rock.</b> The alcove's roof is about [...] above the river, with the rock floor of the alcove at about [...] above the river. By the time it was discovered, the alcove had been almost entirely filled with alluvium. The cliff is composed of Tertiary period volcanic ash mixed with larger rock fragments of volcanic origin. A similar alcove is being cut by the Shoshone at the mouth of Clocktower Creek. The cave fill has accumulated for at least 10,000years and appears to have originated from nearby debris fans formed where weathered material has flowed down channels in neighboring cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|Laterite is a {{soil and}} rock type rich in iron and aluminium, and is {{commonly}} {{considered to have}} formed in hot and wet tropical areas. Nearly all laterites are of rusty-red coloration, because of high iron oxide content. [...] They develop by intensive and long-lasting weathering of the underlying <b>parent</b> <b>rock.</b> Tropical weathering (laterization) is a prolonged process of chemical weathering which produces a wide variety in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils.

2500|$|Bauxite ore is {{the main}} source for aluminium. Bauxite is a variety of {{laterite}} (residual sedimentary rock), so it has no precise chemical formula. It is composed mainly of hydrated alumina minerals such as gibbsite [...] in newer tropical deposits; in older subtropical, temperate deposits the major minerals are boehmite [...] and some diaspore [...] The average chemical composition of bauxite, by weight, is 45 to 60% Al2O3 and 20 to 30% Fe2O3. The remaining weight consists of silicas (quartz, chalcedony and kaolinite), carbonates (calcite, magnesite and dolomite), titanium dioxide and water. Bauxites of economical interest must be low in kaolinite. Formation of lateritic bauxites occurs worldwide in the 145- to 2-million-year-old Cretaceous and Tertiary coastal plains. The bauxites form elongate belts, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, parallel to Lower Tertiary shorelines in India and South America; their distribution {{is not related to}} a particular mineralogical composition of the <b>parent</b> <b>rock.</b> Many high-level bauxites are formed in coastal plains which were subsequently uplifted to their present altitude.|$|E

60|$|Venters had a moment's {{notice of}} the rock, which was of the same {{smoothness}} and hardness as the slope below, before his gaze went irresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of granite. These were ruined walls of yellow sandstone, and so split and splintered, so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim, so impending with tremendous crumbling crags, that Venters caught his breath sharply, and, appalled, he instinctively recoiled as if a step upward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation. Indeed, it seemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind to collapse and come tumbling down. Venters hesitated. It would be a foolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning, waiting avalanches of rock in that gigantic split. Yet how many years had they leaned there without falling! At {{the bottom of the}} incline was an immense heap of weathered sandstone all crumbling to dust, but there were no huge rocks as large as houses, such as rested so lightly and frightfully above, waiting patiently and inevitably to crash down.

6000|$|One day, it is said, that Aloys {{was called}} upon to write--rather a humble {{composition}} for an author and artist--a washing-bill. He had no paper at hand, and so he wrote out the bill {{with some of his}} newly-invented ink upon one of his Kelheim stones. Some time afterwards he thought he would try and take an IMPRESSION of his washing-bill: he did, and succeeded. Such is the story, which the reader most likely knows very well; and having alluded to the origin of the art, we shall not follow the stream through its windings and enlargement after it issued from the little <b>parent</b> <b>rock,</b> or fill our pages {{with the rest of the}} pedigree.

The schoolmaster, who is now abroad, has taught us, in our youth, how the cultivation of art [...] "emollit mores nec sinit esse"--(it is needless to finish the quotation); and Lithography has been, to our thinking, the very best ally that art ever had; the best friend of the artist, allowing him to produce rapidly multiplied and authentic copies of his own works (without trusting to the tedious and expensive assistance of the engraver); and the best friend to the people likewise, who have means of purchasing these cheap and beautiful productions, and thus having their ideas [...] "mollified" [...] and their manners [...] "feros" [...] no more.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{concluded}} that the coast {{on this side of}} the continent, for a space of at least 1,180 miles, has been elevated to a height of 100 feet in La Plata, and of 400 feet in Southern Patagonia, within the period of existing shells, but not of existing mammifers. That in La Plata the elevation has been very slowly effected: that in Patagonia the movement may have been by considerable starts, but much more probably slow and quiet. In either case, there have been long intervening periods of comparative rest, during which the sea corroded deeply, as it is still corroding, into the land. (I say COMPARATIVE and not ABSOLUTE rest, because the sea acts, as we have seen, with great denuding power on this whole line of coast; and therefore, during an elevation of the land, if excessively slow (and of course during a subsidence of the land), it is quite possible that lines of cliff might be formed.) That the periods of denudation and elevation were contemporaneous and equable over great spaces of coast, as shown by the equable heights of the plains; that there have been at least eight periods of denudation, and that the land, up to a height of from 950 to 1,200 feet, has been similarly modelled and affected: that the area elevated, in the southernmost part of the continent, extended in breadth to the Cordillera, and probably seaward to the Falkland Islands; that northward, in La Plata, the breadth is unknown, there having been probably more than one axis of elevation; and finally, that, anterior to the elevation attested by these upraised shells, the land was divided by a Strait where the River Santa Cruz now flows, and that further southward there were other sea-straits, since closed. I may add, that at Santa Cruz, in latitude 50 degrees S., the plains have been uplifted at least 1,400 feet, since the period when gigantic boulders were transported between sixty and seventy miles from their <b>parent</b> <b>rock,</b> on floating icebergs.|$|E
