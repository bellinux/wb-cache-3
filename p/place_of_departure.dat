The first time the race didn't start or finish in Milan was in 1911, where the start and finish were moved to Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy's unification. With the occasional exception, the start and finish in Milan was the standard for the Giro d'Italia. However, since 1960 the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> has changed each year. Some years (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1981–1989) the finish was also changed, but in 1990 the traditional finish in Milan was restored.|$|E
25|$|In the Sunni tradition, {{the number}} of such texts is ten {{thousand}} plus or minus a few thousand. But if, say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident {{in the life of the}} prophet, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths—but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations within the text or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century. In the 3rd century of Islam (from 225/840 to about 275/889), hadith experts composed brief works recording a selection of about two- to five-thousand such texts which they felt to have been most soundly documented or most widely referred to in the Muslim scholarly community. The 4th and 5th century saw these six works being commented on quite widely. This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for any serious study of hadith. In addition, Bukhari and Muslim in particular, claimed that they were collecting only the soundest of sound hadiths. These later scholars tested their claims and agreed to them, so that today, they are considered the most reliable collections of hadith. Toward the end of the 5th century, Ibn al-Qaisarani formally standardized the Sunni canon into six pivotal works, a delineation which remains to this day.|$|E

The party were obliged to travel by diligence on that part of the journey. The diligence is the French stage coach. The diligence leaves Lyons in the evening, and travels all night. As Mr. Holiday arrived at Lyons the evening before, Rollo had the whole of the day to walk about the town before setting out for his evening ride.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the migration aspirations of young, lower middle-class Cameroonians living in Anglophone Cameroon. Deportations and prevention campaigns portray the negatives of migration, yet often have little impact because {{they assume that}} migrants' aspirations are grounded in the prior success of other migrants.

It {{is based on an}} ethnographic fieldwork conducted between September 2007 and January 2009 in Buea (South West Cameroon). Since the late 1990 s, the desire for a future 'away from home' has come to be expressed in Anglophone Cameroon by aspirations of going to 'bush'. Taking seriously people's conceptions of success and failure in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> the article argues that locally voiced claims of 'global belonging' exert an important influence on migration aspirations.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of school-university collaborative efforts to establish partnerships {{and professional development}} schools (PDSs) suggests {{that most of these}} efforts focus on the induction of student teachers, interns, and beginning teachers. Little attention is devoted to helping university-based teacher educators or experienced school faculty study their own practice, improve their work, or reform what they do. Nor is there much attention to rethinking or recreating schools as organizations, reconceptualizing student learning, or adding to the knowledge base for teaching. To a large extent, the partnerships that were studied perpetuated several ideas about schools, learning, teaching, and professional development that have been challenged by many education scholars and reformers. Among these limiting conceptualizations are the view of teaching as a non-theoretically based craft and of schools as factories. Although current reform, restructuring, and partnership endeavors will not, for the most part, create the kinds of schools, learning, teaching, and teacher knowledge and competence that are needed, these efforts can identify: (1) points of intrusion into practice; (2) <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> from current practice to more meaningful visions of what schools, learning, and teaching should be; and (3) vehicles for reaching these visions.

As in two {{previous}} cases, the Mere Gate was at first but a fisherman's station for the village of St. John's, which gathered about the old church {{at the south end of}} the existing town. But as the Northmouth closed up, and Sandwich Haven decayed, the Mere Gate naturally became the little local port for corn grown on the island and wool raised on the newly-reclaimed Minster Level. A wooden pier existed at Margate long before the reign of Henry VIII., when Leland found it [...] "sore decayed," [...] and the village was in repute for fishery and coasting trade. Throughout the Stuart period Margate was the ordinary <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and arrival for Flushing and the Low Countries. William of Orange frequently sailed hence, and Maryborough used it for almost all his expeditions. It was about the middle of the last century, however, that the real prosperity of Margate first began. Then it was that citizens of credit and renown in London first hit upon the glorious discovery of the seaside, and that watering-places tentatively and timidly raised their unobtrusive heads along the nearer beaches. The journey from London could be made far more easily by river than that to Brighton by coach; and so Margate, the nearest spot to town (by water) on the real sea with any accommodation for visitors, became in point of fact the earliest London seaside resort. It was, if not the first place, at least one of the first places in England to offer to its guests the perilous joy of bathing machines, which were inaugurated here about 1790.|$|E

40|$|Public Transit Information System is {{an online}} {{transportation}} system providing integrated transit journey planning {{solutions to the}} general public. Generally, the system requires users to input their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and arrival {{as well as some}} preferences such as the shortest or cheapest path. The system will then generate the results with transit schedule, route, fare and so forth. Since the system is designated for public usage, {{it is important that the}} system not only meets the needs of its users, but also is easily operated by the general public with different level of computer skills. Thus, this paper explores the design criteria of public transit information system by reviewing the development of user interface design from previous research and comparing the user interfaces of the public transit information systems of Hong Kong, Singapore and Vancouver. This paper also studies the transit systems <b>of</b> these three <b>places</b> and thereby concludes that the diverse and complex transit network of Hong Kong makes it difficult in developing such a system.

It thus intend to highlight the social, temporal and spatial dynamism of Syrian migratory networks by showing (i) how previous circular labour migration and the transnational social networks developed over time have contributed to shape post- 2011 emigration processes; (ii) how the reinforcement of migration controls reshapes refugees‘ itineraries and thereby the characteristics and the efficiency of the social networks they rely on in order to access resources (e. g. mobility, housing, employment). This approach intends to emphasize refugees‘ autonomy and self decision-making from a long-term perspective in order to tackle the humanitarian perception that usually deems this population as being extremely vulnerable. On the other hand, understanding these rapidly changing migratory networks and the Jordanian migration policies (especially the implementation of refugee camps and transit centres at the border, as well as drastic restrictions toward the informal employment of Syrians in the country) should also help to shed light on the ongoing trends of asylum migration from Middle East to Europe. To conclude with the objectives of this research, looking beyond the strict separation <b>of</b> <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> transit and arrival, as well as the distinction between voluntary and forced migration will also emphasize the process by „which immigrants build social fields that link together their country of origin and their country of settlement“ (Glick Schiller et al., 1992) ...|$|R

Such variations in conceptual orientations and use have led to a somewhat complex and cloudy knowledge base with respect to “community-place-and-decision-making” linkages. In this chapter, we articulate and apply principles from an interactional theoretical perspective of social organization, rooted in the writings of Harold Kaufman (1959; 1985) and Kenneth Wilkinson (1970; 1991) – and further elaborated upon by their colleagues and students – to the notions <b>of</b> community, <b>place,</b> and decision-making.
