50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is leaking to the outside {{is to use a}} pressure pan, which is a register cover with a <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> for a hose connection. With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores a novel design of cone {{flowmeter}} for bi-directional flow metering application. Two identical cone shapes are machined with their base circle surfaces joined {{together with a}} small step in between them and differential pressure measurement is done across {{the apex of the}} cones. The bidirectional cone flowmeter is tested under fully developed flow conditions and its performance under double 90 degrees bend (out-of-plane) is also evaluated. The bi-directional cone flowmeter is tested in a circular pipe (inside diameter of 101 mm) with water as the working medium for the flow Reynolds number ranging from 1. 18 x 10 (5) to 5. 48 x 10 (5). Influence of the half cone angle (alpha) and the location of static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the coefficient of discharge (C-d) of a cone flowmeter are studied. Two cones with half cone angles alpha= 30 degrees and alpha= 45 degrees with a constant constriction ratio (beta) of 0. 75 are studied. Static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> are located {{on both sides of the}} bi-directional cone. Two sets of locations of static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> are studied. First set includes two static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the pipe wall in the planes of apexes of the bi-directional cone-called apex taps. Second set includes <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> on the pipe wall in the planes at a distance D/ 4 away from the apexes of the bi-directional cone-called D/ 4 taps. Double 90 degrees bend (out-ofplane) is placed at 1. 5 D, 5. 5 D, 9. 5 D and 13. 5 D upstream to the bi-directional cone flowmeter. It is observed that the apex static <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> located in the plane of apexes of the bi-directional cone result in statistically consistent coefficient of discharge for all Reynolds numbers covered in this study. The results suggest that the bi-directional cone flowmeter is insensitive to the swirl created by double 90 degrees bend (out-of-plane) placed at the upstream of cone flowmeter, if placed at a distance of 9. 5 D or more.

The current study examines the efficacy of the AA-PSP technique, which is prepared with a more practical approach than that reported in literature, in analysing the flow characteristics of a double ramp model placed in hypersonic flow of M = 5. Three different flow angles of 0 °, − 2 °, and − 4 ° are studied. Two-dimensional colour schlieren visualisation, using a colour wheel, is employed alongside high sensitivity Kulite <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> data to corroborate the AA-PSP findings.

40|$|Some {{preliminary}} velocity {{measurements were}} carried out inside the transonic tunnel using the laser velocimeter (LV) system {{in association with the}} smoke generator. Pressure measurements were also performed using a <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> located on the side wall of the test section slightly upstream of the windows. Though the pressure measurements and the LV measurements were not taken at exactly the same location, extrapolation of the pressure data into the location of the LV measurements indicated a very close agreement between the velocity values obtained using the two different methods. Thus it is believed that the smoke particle is following the air flow with little or no velocity slip. Velocity measurements with airfoil at various angles of attack are now being carried out in conjuction with schlieren flow visualization. In the near future pressure distribution around and on the airfoil will be obtained by putting pressure taps on the side windows and using a <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> model (currently under construction) of the airfoil...|$|E

40|$|Acquiring {{pressure}} maps of aerodynamic surfaces is {{very important}} for improving and validating the performance of aerospace vehicles. Traditional pressure measurements are taken with <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> embedded in the model surface that are connected to transducers. While <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> allow highly accurate measurements to be acquired, they do have several drawbacks. <b>Pressure</b> <b>taps</b> do not give good spatial resolution due to the need for individual pressure tubes, compounded by limited space available inside models. Also, building a model proves very costly if taps are needed because of the large amount of labor necessary to drill, connect and test each one. The typical cost to install one tap is about $ 200. Recently, a new method for measuring pressure on aerodynamic surfaces has been developed utilizing a technology known as pressure sensitive paints (PSP). Using PSP, pressure distributions can be acquired optically with high spatial resolution and simple model preparation. Flow structures can be easily visualized using PSP, but are missed using low spatial resolution arrays of <b>pressure</b> <b>taps.</b> PSP even allows pressure distributions to be found on rotating machinery where previously this has been extremely difficult or even impossible. The goal of this research is to develop a laser scanning system for use with pressure sensitive paints that allows accurate pressure measurements to be obtained on various aerodynamic surfaces ranging from wind tunnel models to high speed jet engine compressor blades...|$|R

Local pressure changes were measured using six <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> holes along {{the wall of the}} casting. The test-fluid was a 33 percent sugar-water solution of approximately the same viscosity as human blood. Flow visualization results were obtained by injecting blue-dye through the <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> holes. Measurement of local pressure demonstrated a significant Reynolds number effect. At Reynolds numbers of 80 - 710, a local pressure rise was observed downstream of the mild atherosclerotic constriction due to momentum changes. The Reynolds number necessary for flow separation in the divergent region of the coronary casting was about 330. The experimental results can be used to obtain a quantitative relation between coronary morphology and the fluid dynamic consequences of mild diffuse disease under conditions of maximum cardiac demand i. e., higher coronary flow rates and Reynolds numbers associated with space and atmospheric flight...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} {{paint is}} a newly-developed optical measurement technique with {{which one can}} get a continuous pressure distribution in much shorter time and lower cost than a conventional <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> measurement. However, most of the current pressure sensitive paint applications are restricted to steady pressure measurement at high speeds {{because of the small}} signal-to-noise ratio at low speed and a slow response to pressure changes. In the present study, three phases of work have been completed to extend the application of the pressure sensitive paint technique to low-speed testing and to investigate the applicability of the paint technique to unsteady flow. First the measurement system using a commercially available PtOEP/GP- 197 pressure sensitive paint was established and applied to impinging jet measurements. An in-situ calibration using only five <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> data points was applied and the results showed good repeatability and good agreement with conventional <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> measurements on the whole painted area. The overall measurement accuracy in these experiments was found to be within 0. 1 psi. The pressure sensitive paint technique was then applied to low-speed wind tunnel tests using a 60 deg delta wing model with leading edge blowing slots. The technical problems encountered in low-speed testing were resolved by using a high grade CCD camera and applying corrections to improve the measurement accuracy. Even at 35 m/s, the paint data not only agreed well with conventional <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> measurements but also clearly showed the suction region generated by the leading edge vortices. The vortex breakdown was also detected at alpha= 30 deg. It was found that a pressure difference of 0. 2 psi was required for a quantitative pressure measurement in this experiment and that temperature control or a parallel temperature measurement is necessary if thermal uniformity does not hold on the model. Finally, the pressure sensitive paint was applied to a periodically changing pressure field with a 12. 8 s time period. A simple first-order pole model was applied to deal with the phase lag of the paint. The unsteady pressure estimated from the time-changing pressure sensitive paint data agreed well with the pressure transducer data in regions of higher pressure and showed the possibility of extending the technique to unsteady pressure measurements. However, the model still needs further refinement based on the physics of the oxygen diffusion into the paint layer and the oxygen quenching on the paint luminescence...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of a lifetime-based Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) method for application in cryogenic wind tunnels was investigated. The relevant experiments {{were conducted in}} the Pilot-European Transonic Windtunnel (PETW). The 2 D airfoil model (CAST 10 -II) was painted with PtTFPP/PTMSP paint and tested {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} at 150 K. PSP and <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> data were acquired at Mach 0. 78 at a total pressure of 160 kPa. The oxygen concentration of the flow was set to 1000 ppm by continuously supplying dry air. As a result, the lifetime-based PSP method successfully visualized the pressure distribution on the airfoil model under cryogenic conditions. The quantitative agreement of PSP and <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> data was obtained and the difference in both data came out to be 0. 05 in the pressure coefficient Cp. The accuracy of PSP data is comparable to results achievable at ambient conditions. Therefore, it may be concluded that the lifetime-based method was successfully applied under cryogenic conditions. In addition to the lifetime-based method, the intensity-based method was also conducted as a comparison. Furthermore the applicability of the lifetimebased method to tests with model deformation was evaluated...|$|E

40|$|With {{the arrival}} of highly {{accurate}} multi-port pressure measurement systems, conditions that previously did not affect overall system accuracy must now be scrutinized closely. Errors caused by elevation differences between pressure sensing elements and model <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> can be quantified and corrected. With multi-port pressure measurement systems, the sensing elements are connected to <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> that may be many feet away. The measurement system may be at a different elevation than the <b>pressure</b> <b>taps</b> due to laboratory space or test article constraints. This difference produces a pressure gradient that is inversely proportional to height within the interface tube. The pressure {{at the bottom of}} the tube will be higher than the pressure at the top due to the weight of the tube's column of air. Tubes with higher pressures will exhibit larger absolute errors due to the higher air density. The above effect is well documented but has generally been taken into account with large elevations only. With error analysis techniques, the loss in accuracy from elevation can be easily quantified. Correction factors can be applied to maintain the high accuracies of new pressure measurement systems...|$|R

Unsteady surface pressures were measured to understand if this information {{could be used to}} resolve for turbulence-induced perturbations and furthermore utilize this information in a turbulence mitigation system. Although pressure tapping the majority of the chord is inevitability impractical for MAV application, it was discovered that a point local Coefficient of Pressure (Cp) held high correlation to the chord-wise Cp integration and allowed for a linear relationship to be formed between the two variables. The defined relationship provided a 95 % confidence for angles of attack below stall and can be used to estimate the integrated cord-wise pressure coefficient at a particular span wise location. The relationship between a single <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> and the integrated Cp of that chord-wise section was valid for each two different span-wise locations with similar defining equations. As one <b>pressure</b> <b>tap</b> can be used to adequately estimate the integrated Cp on a chord-wise wing section, a limited amount of pressure taps across the wings span can approximate the pressure distribution across the span and approximate flight perturbations.
