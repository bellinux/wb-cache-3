50|$|In 1996 Maruti Esteem, {{became the}} {{preferred}} choice for all top teams and {{was confined to}} Group A (I) IND category. The Maruti Esteem also had a high <b>power</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to other cars in India. The Rally terrain was split in two formats, Dirt or Tarmac for the entire event. Events like K-1000, South India Rally and Coimbatore rallies mostly ran in Dirt format, while Popular Rally and Rally D’ Endurance opted for tarmac rallies. Hence the choice of tyres and suspension setup for the saloon cars were done well before the rally. Also with restricted engine power and more Tarmac rallies for saloon cars meant suspension tuning for handling by tuners became the deciding factor for a cars performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Orthogonal {{experiment}} design and variance analysis were adopted {{to investigate the}} hydrogen desorption properties of NaAlH 4 and LiAlH 4, which consisted of three stages, ball-milled under argon. Optimum milling condition was {{very important for the}} performance of NaAlH 4 and LiAlH 4, which was obtained from the orthogonal experiments. The orthogonal {{experiment design}} considered three experimental factors, i. e. weight ratio of ball to <b>power,</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of ɸ 8 ball to ɸ 4 ball and milling time, which varied on three different levels, respectively. According to the range analysis and variance analysis from the orthogonal experiments, the weight ratio of ball to powder and ɸ 8 ball to ɸ 4 ball had more impacts on the hydrogen desorption time of NaAlH 4,while the most sensitive influencing factor of LiAlH 4 was milling time. NaAlH 4 had the optimum performance when the weight ratio of ball to power was 30 : 1, the weight ratio of ɸ 8 ball to ɸ 4 ball was 0. 5 : 1 and milling time was 0. 5 h. LiAlH 4 had the optimum performance when the weight ratio of ball to power was 40 : 1, the weight ratio of ɸ 8 ball to ɸ 4 ball was 0. 5 : 1 and milling time was 2 h...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a method of}} non-intrusive local inspection of surface and sub-surface conditions, interfaces, laminations and seals in both space vehicle and ground operations with an integrated suite of imaging sensors during pre-launch operations. It employs an advanced Raman spectrophotometer with additional spectrophotometers and lidar mounted on a flying robot to constantly monitor the space hardware as well as inner surface of the vehicle and ground operations hardware. This paper {{addresses a}} team of micro flying robots with necessary sensors and photometers to monitor the entire space vehicle internally and externally. The micro flying robots can reach altitude with least amount of energy, where astronauts have difficulty in reaching and monitoring the materials and subsurface faults. The micro flying robot has an embedded fault detection system which acts as an advisory system {{and in many cases}} micro flying robots act as a Supervisor to fix the problems. As missions expand to a sustainable presence in the Moon, and extend for durations longer than one year in lunar outpost, the effectiveness of the instrumentation and hardware has to be revolutionized if NASA is to meet high levels of mission safety, reliability, and overall success. The micro flying robot uses contra-rotating propellers powered by an ultra-thin, ultrasonic motor with currently the world's highest <b>power</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> and is balanced in mid-air by means of the world's first stabilizing mechanism using a linear actuator. The essence of micromechatronics has been brought together in high-density mounting technology to minimize the size and weight. The robot can take suitable payloads of photometers, embedded chips for image analysis and micro pumps for sealing cracks or fixing other material problems. This paper also highlights advantages that this type of non-intrusive techniques offer over costly and monolithic traditional techniques...|$|E
