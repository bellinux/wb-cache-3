25|$|The basal {{membrane}} is a histopathological extracellular matrix feature that forms {{at the center}} of injury and partially covers the astrocytic processes. It is composed of three layers with the basal lamina as the prominent layer. Molecularly, the {{basal membrane}} is created by glycoprotein and <b>proteoglycan</b> protomers. Further, two independent networks are formed within the basal membrane by collagen IV and laminin for structural support. Other molecular components of the basal membrane include fibulin-1, fibronectin, entactin, and hepparan sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> perlecan. Ultimately, the astrocytes attach to the basal membrane, and the complex surrounds the blood vessels and nervous tissue to form the initial wound covering.|$|E

These cell types can develop into a normal oligodendrocyte or a glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocyte depending on environmental factors. NG2 is found on the surface of these cells and has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, as well. These are high molecular weight transmembrane molecules with the largest portion extending into the extracellular space.|$|E

Here we inves-tigate the distribution and time course of deposition {{of a range of}} <b>proteoglycans</b> between 4 and 14 days following unilateral axotomy of the nigrostriatal tract in anaesthetised adult rats. Immunolabelling using a variety of antibodies was used to examine the response of heparan sulphate <b>proteoglycans,</b> chondroitin sulphate <b>proteoglycans</b> and keratan sulphate <b>proteoglycans.</b> We observed that many <b>proteoglycans</b> became abundant between 1 and 2 weeks post-axotomy. Heparan sulphate <b>proteoglycans</b> were predominantly found within the lesion core (populated by blood vessels, amoeboid macrophages and meningeal ¢broblasts) whereas chondroitin sulphate <b>proteoglycans</b> and keratan sulphate <b>proteoglycans</b> were predominantly found in the lesion surround (populated by reactive astrocytes, activated microglia and adult precursor cells). Immunolabelling indicated that cut dopaminergic nigral axons sprouted proli¢cally within the lesion core but rarely grew into the lesion surround.

25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in <b>proteoglycan</b> content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E
25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, keratan sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> (KSPG) {{production}} is up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} glial scar formation. KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrophobic}} cell-surface <b>proteoglycans</b> of mouse mammary {{epithelial cells}} were purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and liposome incorporation. The {{size of the}} <b>proteoglycans</b> appeared to be directly proportional {{to the size of}} their heparan-sulfate chains, larger <b>proteoglycans</b> yielding larger chains. The chondroitin sulfate chains, in contrast, showed no size heterogeneity. Digestion of 125 I-labeled <b>proteoglycans</b> with heparitin-sulfate lyase and chondroitin ABC lyase yielded core proteins of approximately 93 kDa, approximately 85 kDa and approximately 38 kDa. Comparison with single enzyme digestions identified the 93 -kDa and 85 -kDa cores as components of hybrid <b>proteoglycans</b> that carried both heparan-sulfate and chondroitin-sulfate chains. Immunoblotting indicated that the 93 -kDa and 85 -kDa cores shared the epitope defined by monoclonal antibody 281 - 2. The 38 -kDa core, in contrast, carried only heparan-sulfate chains and lacked the 281 - 2 epitope. Preparations enriched in heparan sulfate or in heparan-sulfate/chondroitin-sulfate hybrid <b>proteoglycans</b> were obtained by N-desulfation and ion-exchange chromatography. Hybrid <b>proteoglycans</b> accounting for the bulk of the chondroitin-sulfate and nearly half of the heparan-sulfate residues of the <b>proteoglycans</b> showed a similar polydispersity of heparan-sulfate chain sizes as found in <b>proteoglycans</b> that carried only, or predominantly, heparan-sulfate chains. These hybrids contained heparan-sulfate and chondroitin-sulfate chains in similar molar amounts. Analysis of 125 I-labeled <b>proteoglycans</b> suggested that typical hybrid <b>proteoglycans</b> were composed of a 85 -kDa core protein that carries a single chondroitin-sulfate chain and a single heparan-sulfate chain of variable length. A minority of hybrids seemed characterized by the variant, but possibly structurally related, 93 -kDa core protein.

However, disc <b>proteoglycans</b> contain more keratan sulphate and protein and less chondroitin sulphate and are also considerably smaller than cartilage <b>proteoglycans.</b> In <b>proteoglycans</b> of human discs, these differences appeared to be due principally to a shorter region of the core protein bearing the chondroitin sulphate chains, whereas in <b>proteoglycans</b> of pig discs their smaller size and relatively low uronic acid content were due to shorter chondroitin sulphate chains.

These receptors are DC-SIGN, Heparan Sulfate <b>Proteoglycan</b> and a specific interaction with the CD4 receptor, particularly on helper T-cells. Binding to CD4 induces the start of a cascade of conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 that lead to the fusion of the viral with the host cell membrane.

2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, <b>proteoglycan</b> like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E

[...] SFRP1 are heparin-binding proteins, with the heparin-binding domain within the C-terminal region of the SFRP1 protein. [...] In vitro studies show that SFRP1 is stabilizezd by heparin, suggesting that heparin or endogenous heparan-sulfate <b>proteoglycan</b> (HSPG) has the potential to promote SFRP1/Wnt binding by serving as a scaffold to facilitate interaction between SFRP1 and Wnt proteins. Lowering HSPG levels in tissue have been shown to impair Wnt signaling in vivo, supporting the idea that HSPG {{plays an important role in}} Wnt signaling regulation. [...] Furthermore, SFRP1 is tyrosine-sulfated at two N-terminal tyrosines; this modification is, however, inhibited by heparin. [...] Tryosine sulfation could partially destabilize the SFRP1 protein, which is supported by previous studies showing that SFRP1 is susceptible to degradation in the absence of heparin. [...] The finding that heparin can inhibit intracellular post-translational modification of SFRP1 was surprising. [...] This indicates that heparin may inhibit the process of tyrosine sulfation, for example, by tyrosyl-protein sulfotransferases enzymes or sulfate donor pathways. [...] Since heparin is highly negatively charged and cannot permeate the membrane, it must activate a signal transduction pathway to carry out its effect. [...] It is well known that fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) bind heparin with relatively high affinity. [...] HSPGs have also been shown to be involved in FGF cell signaling. Zhong et al. revealed a specificity of FGFs and FGF receptors on SFRP1 accumulation, demonstrating that FGF and their receptors are involved in post-translational modification of SFRP1. As stated above, SFRP1 has been shown to attenuate the malignant phenotype and decrease the growth of tumors. [...] Thus, Heparin is a potential drug that could be used to stabilize and accumulate SFRP1 in cancer cells.|$|E

In SACC, neoplastic myoepithelial cells secrete <b>proteoglycans</b> unconventionally full of the cribriform or tubular and glandular structures of SACC. Literatures have demonstrated that extracellular matrix provided an essential microenvironment for the biological behavior of SACC. However, there is rare study of the effect of <b>proteoglycans</b> on the potential metastasis of SACC. In this study, human xylosyltransferase-I (XTLY-I) gene, which catalyzes the rate-limited step of <b>proteoglycans</b> biosynthesis, was knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the <b>proteoglycans</b> biosynthesis in SACC cell line with high tendency of lung metastasis (SACC-M). The impact of down-regulated <b>proteoglycans</b> on the metastasis characters of SACC-M cells was analyzed and discussed. This research could provide a new idea for the clinical treatment of SACC. Methods The eukaryotic expression vector of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting XTLY-I gene was constructed and transfected into SACC-M cells. A stably transfectant cell line named SACC-M-WJ 4 was isolated. The XTLY-I expression was measured by real-time PCR and Western blot; the reduction of <b>proteoglycans</b> was measured. The invasion and metastasis of SACC-M-WJ 4 cells were detected; the effect of down-regulated <b>proteoglycans</b> on the potential lung metastasis of nude mice was observed, respectively. Results The shRNA plasmid targeting XTLY-I gene showed powerful efficiency of RNAi. The mRNA level of target gene decreased by 86. 81 %, the protein level was decreased by 80. 10 %, respectively. The silence of XTLY-I gene resulted in the reduction of <b>proteoglycans</b> significantly in SACC-M-WJ 4 cells.

Here, we review some recent advances, emphasising that many tumour-related functions of <b>proteoglycans</b> are revealed only after their modification in processes subsequent to synthesis and export to the cell surface. These include enzymes that modify heparan sulphate structure, recycling of whole or fragmented <b>proteoglycans</b> into exosomes that can be paracrine effectors or biomarkers, and lateral interactions between some <b>proteoglycans</b> and calcium channels that impact the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R

Once {{thought to be the}} molecular glue providing structural support and imparting biomechanical properties to lung tissue, it is now apparent that <b>proteoglycans</b> are important biological modifiers which regulate processes such as lung development, homeostasis, inflammation and wound healing. The diverse roles of <b>proteoglycans</b> in the extracellular matrix suggest that these molecules {{play a critical role in}} normal and diseased lungs. This short article will discuss the role extracellular matrix <b>proteoglycans</b> play in regulating epithelial cell function in the lungs...|$|R
