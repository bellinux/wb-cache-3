2500|$|Plastics {{extrusion}} commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, {{which are}} usually dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper {{before going to the}} feed screw. The polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw. [...] The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A [...] "caterpillar haul-off" [...] (called a [...] "puller" [...] in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the extrudate. <b>Pelletizers</b> can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result. [...] In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called [...] "pultrusion". The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.|$|R

The results, demonstrating the effect of the heating rate on the process parameters, in particular, on the content of residual carbon in the obtained heat-strengthened pellets are important. It has been shown that increasing the heating rate of raw pellets from 100 to 500 °C/min, and cooling rate of the heat-strengthened pellets from 100 to 600 °C/min with decreasing oxygen content in the heat-carrying agent for gas burning in the burners and cooling gas from 21 % to 10, 3 - 5, 1 % make it possible to increase the content of residual carbon in the heat-strengthened pellets from 0, 8 - 1, 9 % to 3, 5 - 3, 7 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the quality of pellets from the end of the <b>pelletizer</b> machine until the end of the line feed plate, using two methods of analysis: pellet durability index (PDI) and EMBRAPA pelletizing method (MEP). Furthermore, the effect of the discharging methods at the broiler farm on the physical quality of pellets using MEP as a method of analysis was evaluated. The first phase of the experiment was a randomized block with six treatments: A - pellets at the end of the <b>pelletizer</b> machine; B - pellets inside the truck; C - truck's discharging at the feed silo; D - place inside the warehouse after the feed silo; E - the middle of the feed plate line and F - the end of the feed plate line. The experiment was carried out in seven replicates (blocks). The second phase of the experiment was a randomized block with two treatments: A - smaller discharge opening (for pellets feed); B - bigger discharge opening (for mashed feed). The experiment was performed with twelve replicates (blocks). The discharge of the pellets feed at broilers farm is the point that worsens the pellets quality.

40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, dry ice cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density <b>pelletizers</b> have been available to the dry ice cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new dry ice blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable media, particle blast, cleaning systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single discharge hose device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, dry ice pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The dry ice and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate blasting velocity. When directed to impact upon a target area, these dry ice pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, dry ice pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer dry ice pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, dry ice pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, dry ice cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. Dry ice cleaning system components include: a dry ice pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. Dry ice cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, dry ice mass flow rate, dry ice pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the dry ice cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible. The analysis of the applicable range of modulation of these parameters, within system component mechanical constraints, has just begun...|$|R

For all biomasses, pellets made from lower particle size (150 - 300 μm) exhibited higher density (950 - 1178 kg/m 3 for spruce and pine; 668 - 800 kg/m 3 for RCG, H and SW; 900 - 970 kg/m 3 for blended biomass). The intrinsic yield stress exhibited differences in values for individual forestry (40 MPa) and agricultural biomass (27 - 48 MPa), however after blending the values converged closest to that value for forestry biomass. In conclusion, blending low cost and abundant available agricultural biomass with woody biomass could not only result in better mechanical properties but would also help to meet the pellet market demand in future...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{animal studies}} have shown that carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) may pose a significant health risk to those exposed in the workplace. To further understand this potential risk, effort must be taken to measure the occupational exposure to CNTs. Results from an assessment of potential exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) conducted at an industrial facility where polymer nanocomposites were manufactured by an extrusion process are presented. Exposure to MWCNTs was quantified by the thermal-optical analysis for elemental carbon (EC) of respirable dust collected by personal sampling. All personal respirable samples collected (n = 8) had estimated 8 -h time weighted average (TWA) EC concentrations below the limit of detection for the analysis which was about one-half of the recommended exposure limit for CNTs, 1 µg EC/m 3 as an 8 -h TWA respirable mass concentration. Potential exposure sources were identified and characterized by direct-reading instruments and area sampling. Area samples analyzed for EC yielded quantifiable mass concentrations inside an enclosure where unbound MWCNTs were handled and near a <b>pelletizer</b> where nanocomposite was cut, while those analyzed by electron microscopy detected the presence of MWCNTs at six locations throughout the facility. Through size selective area sampling it was identified that the airborne MWCNTs present in the workplace were in the form of large agglomerates. This was confirmed by electron microscopy where most of the MWCNT structures observed were in the form of micrometer-sized ropey agglomerates. However, a small fraction of single, free MWCNTs was also observed. It was found that the high number concentrations of nanoparticles, ~ 200000 particles/cm 3, present in the manufacturing facility were likely attributable to polymer fumes produced in the extrusion proces...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of wood-pellets involves fractioning {{of the raw}} material, e. g. the sawdust and cutter shavings, into a homogeneous particle size before pressing through a ring die <b>pelletizer.</b> The fractioning {{takes place in a}} hammer mill, where wear on the cutting knives is considered a problem. The main material property requirements of the knives are high wear resistance and toughness. This research project examines the suitability of austempered high silicon steel to achieve these desirable properties. One specific steel, 55 Si 7, has been austempered to obtain a carbide free ausferritic microstructure and the mechanical properties, microstructure and wear resistance of this steel have been characterized. Microscopy and x- ray diffraction were used for microstructural characterization and examination of the stress-induced transformation of retained austenite into martensite. The mechanical properties were characterized via tensile testing, Charpy V-notch impact testing and hardness measurements: and the wear resistance has been investigated in a laboratory environment under non- lubricated sliding wear conditions. The wear resistance of austempered high silicon steel has been compared to other steels heat treated under different conditions to obtain different microstructures. In addition, a field test took place in a hammer mill for a direct comparison between the wear on four austempered high silicon knives and commercial knives made of case hardened low carbon steel. The austempered high silicon steel proved to have a uniform and high hardness combined with good impact toughness, plastic deformation before fracture, and high wear resistance. These desirable properties were achieved by austempering at low temperatures, resulting in a very fine microstructure and absence of carbides due to the presence of silicon.

40|$|Natural fibres play a {{significant}} role in mass industries such as automotive, construction and sports. Many researchers have found that the natural fibres are the best replacement for the synthetic fibres in terms of cost, safety, and degradability due to the shortage of landfill and ingestion of non biodegradable plastic by animals. This study mainly revolved around pineapple leaf fibre (PALF) which is available in abundance in tropical countries and for its excellent mechanical properties. The composite fabricated in this study is highly compostable as both fibre and matrix is from natural based material. The matrix used which is polylactic acid (PLA) is made from corn starch, which gives the upper hand as both materials are renewable resources are easier to degrade by bacteria or enzyme. The PALF is treated with different alkaline percentage to remove excessive moisture in the fibre for better interfacial bonding with PLA. Thereafter the PALF is washed with distilled water several times before placing in vacuum oven. The dried PALF were later mixed with PLA through extrusion using fibre in percentage of 30 by weight for better bonding and afterwards the products of the mixture were pelletized using <b>pelletizer.</b> The pellets were placed in the specimen sized mould for hot compression and subsequently were cold pressed. The specimens were tested for tensile and flexure strength and the result was remarkable where a fluctuating graph can be seen for both tensile and flexure strength where 5 % alkaline treatment showed the highest tensile and flexure strength among the alkaline solution. It can be concluded that the alkaline concentration affects the strength of the composite and the 5 % NaOH solution is the best percentage of alkaline treatment for PALF...|$|E
40|$|Engineering-scale in-canister melting {{tests were}} made to {{evaluate}} the use of silicon to prevent formation of water-soluble molybdate phases in melts. The tests demonstrated that silicon metal powder added to the feed stock effectively prevents formation of such phases. A test also showed that coatings of ZrO$sub 2 $ or chromium carbide on stainless steel canisters prevent oxidation during the in-can melting process. Thermal analysis of canister design concepts examined effects of type of storage, use of fins, emissivity, canister size and cracks in glass. Pressurization tests show that all types of calcine can produce very high pressures within the canister unless the calcine is post-treated at temperatures greater than 850 $sup 0 $C. Initial studies on the effects of alpha and recoil bombardment (from $sup 244 $Cm doping) on devitrification of waste- containing glass were completed. The devitrification behavior of a waste-bearing zinc orthosilicate glass is being studied using optical microscopy, electron microprobe, and x-ray diffraction examination. Fine calcine particles were agglomerated into larger particles suitable for coating via chemical vapor deposition. Thermal stability tests of nickel and Cr$sub 7 $C$sub 3 $ coatings on waste calcine have been conducted, and deterioration has occurred at temperatures as low as 500 $sup 0 $C. Waste-containing pellets were successfully coated by plasma spraying Al$sub 2 $O$sub 3 $ powder. Calculations indicate that plasma spraying of large pellets is feasible on a production scale. Seven scoping runs made with a disc <b>pelletizer</b> indicate that it can provide a simple, inexpensive process for making high-quality pellets from calcine-frit powders. Risk assessment was used to systematically identify dominant sequences for the accidental release of radionuclides during the solidification, basin storage, and rail transport activities of high-level waste management.

40|$|Dust {{generated}} from electric arc furnaces (EAF's) employed in steelmaking plants is currently {{listed as a}} hazardous waste because of its toxic metgllic constituents, i. e., lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and hexavalent chromium (Cr 6). Disposal of the waste at controlled landfills is not only expensive, but also has associated long-term liability concerns. Recycling of pelletized electric arc furnace (EAF) dust from carbon and low-alloy steel production was evaluated through a comprehensive, experimental program at a participating steel plant. Equipment for pelletizing the dust was evaluated, and a 3 -foot-diameter disc <b>pelletizer</b> with an 8 -inch-diameter pin mixer was selected for the pilot trials. two separate blocks of testing. The experimental design was comprised of Block I focused {{on the effects of}} recycling fresh pelletized EAF dust on power consumption and other important variables, whereas Block I 1 focused on conducting a fate analysis of zinc and other heavy metals under continuous recycling conditions. The tests demonstrated the feasibility of pelletizing and recycling EAF dust. Power consumption increased approximately 4 percent during recycling. No significant change occurred in the tap-to-tap heat time. An increase in coke consumption was noted during recycling. Because plant operating conditions precluded the availability of high zinc-bearing scrap for the Block I 1 tests, the zinc content of the dust was almost 50 percent lower than that in Block I. despite some degree of recycle. The zinc content of the dust, however, increased from 9 weight percent to 15 weight percent during the short continuous recycling period. Preliminary economic.,analyses show that the recycling option may be a favorable one for many steel plants. The EAF dust recycling technology is immediately applicable; it requires only specific engineering design for a given steel plant installation and the resolution of specific permitting requirements. 89...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} size {{enlargement}} or agglomeration finds {{a variety of}} applications in material processing and utilization. Pelletization is one such process which uses water as medium and revolving units (Disc/Drums) to form spherical pellets from fine particulates. Green or wet pelletization {{is the first step}} in pelletization process and is of critical importance since the effectiveness of the subsequent stages of drying and in duration depends on the quality and quantity of green pellets. This research presents the work carried out to develop model equations to predict the size distribution of pellets at any given level of intervals. Modeling of pelletization was oriented towards predicting the size distribution of pellets at any given level of variables. The prediction of pellet size distribution involves quantification of the self preserving curve and correlation between D 50 and the variables. A new model has been developed to predict the size distribution of the pellets using advanced statistical software "STATISTICA". The equation Y=- 0. 3757 X 2 + 1. 6256 X- 0. 74 where "Y" is the cumulative wt. % passing and "X" is D/D 50 was used to predict the pellet size distribution. Correlation between D 50 and variables was given by "D 50 "= 4. 226 +(3. 106 *M) -(0. 544 *M 2) +(2. 044 *I) -(0. 644 *I 2) +(0. 2444 *T) -(0. 028 *T 2) -(0. 058 *M*I) +(0. 0917 *I*T) using quadratic response surface methodology. The mean pellet diameter "D 50 " observed versus predicted was compared. A polynomial regression equation was used to quantify the characteristic curve of iron ore slimes agglomeration process. This can be utilized to predict the complete agglomerate size distribution irrespective of the operating conditions and the size of the <b>pelletizer</b> if a relationship such as agglomerate median product size D 50, as a function of the operating conditions is made available...|$|E
