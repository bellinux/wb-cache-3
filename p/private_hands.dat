5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was brought}} from the East {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century. It was in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> for over 100 years. Since 1830 it has been housed at the Utrecht University.|$|E
5|$|After the war, she {{was renamed}} Biokovo and later Jadranka, {{serving as a}} Yugoslav Navy yacht and also as a presidential yacht for the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito. In 1969–1970 she was serving as a {{dispatch}} boat. In 1978, she was in <b>private</b> <b>hands,</b> still serving as a yacht.|$|E
5|$|An 1869 Roper {{machine is}} now in the Smithsonian Institution, and one from 1868 is in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> after being offered at auction in 2012. An 1894 Roper {{velocipede}} was exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum's The Art of the Motorcycle show at their Las Vegas venue, and was shown in 2011 at the Deeley Museum collection in Vancouver.|$|E
60|$|I {{have just}} this moment an {{opportunity}} of a <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> to Edinburgh, as perhaps {{you would not}} digest double postage.|$|R

50|$|In some variants, {{each player}} may be dealt a 3-card <b>private</b> <b>hand,</b> with 4 sets of face up/face down cards; or a 5-card hand, with 3 sets of face up/face down cards.|$|R
5|$|In 1894, the Piedmont Exposition Company {{offered to}} sell the land {{to the city of}} Atlanta for $165,000.00, but Mayor John B. Goodwin refused. Thus, The park {{remained}} in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> and outside the city limits for another ten years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{much of the}} SSSI is in <b>private</b> <b>hands,</b> {{considerable}} {{areas are}} managed by large conservation organisations. As well as the two NNRs, there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh, and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes. The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR. In addition to Blakeney Point, the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it was not included in the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
60|$|Upon the whole, {{the genius}} of the noble {{collector}} may be seen in this glorious collection, than which, take them together, there is not a finer in any <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> in Europe, and in no hand at all in Britain, private or public.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine is assuredly not, madam; I {{know the}} <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> of the Queen of Scots too well to be deceived. Moreover, Madame Curll, {{the wife of}} the Secretary, and others, can speak to the manner in which this young lady was treated." ...|$|R
50|$|Another hold 'em variant is Omaha hold'em. Each {{player is}} dealt four cards to his <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> instead of two. The betting rounds and layout of {{community}} cards {{is identical to}} Texas hold 'em. At showdown, each player's hand is the best five-card hand he can make from exactly {{three of the five}} cards on the board, plus exactly two of his own cards.|$|R
5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coming of}} the Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 opened up Hebden as a {{destination}} for day visitors and holiday makers. A purpose-built timber guest house was opened in 1909 {{at the south end}} of the village by the Co-operative Holiday Association, founded by Thomas Arthur Leonard. It passed into <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> in 1960, and continued as a holiday centre until 1990, mainly catering for school parties. It was demolished in 2016 and replaced with a private residence.|$|E
5|$|The {{holding company}} of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, {{is a private}} limited company, with {{approximately}} 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.|$|E
60|$|Permission to open letters {{had been}} left with Sophy, who with silent {{resignation}} followed the details of poor Gilbert's rapid decay. At last came the parcel by the <b>private</b> <b>hand,</b> containing a small packet {{for each of the}} family. Sophy received a silver Maltese Cross, and little Albinia a perfumy rose-leaf bracelet. There was a Russian grape-shot for Maurice, and with it a letter.|$|R
6000|$|On {{her arrival}} at home, she was astounded by {{a letter that}} she found there,--a letter of such a nature that it {{altogether}} drove {{out of her head}} the purpose which she had of writing to the Duke on that evening. The letter was from John Morton and now reached her through the lawyer to whom it had been sent by <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> for immediate delivery. It ran as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] said Banker, {{drawing the}} letter he had {{prepared}} from his pocket, and {{holding it in}} such a position that she could read the address. [...] "You see, it is marked, 'by private hand,' and this is the <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> that has brought it to you. Now, if you will count out the money, and will hand it to me, I will give you the letter. That is perfectly fair, isn't it?" ...|$|R
5|$|The pose of Musidora {{is based}} on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b> On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E
5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's frontispiece confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> and has not been published.|$|E
50|$|As {{a sign of}} friendship, Władysław {{bestowed}} many favours, {{positions and}} gifts to Kazanowski, who soon had his own palace in Warsaw. He soon became the richest magnate in Poland, and owned close to half of the Praga district in the capital. A contemporary writer, after his death, wrote: Never has Poland seen so much wealth in a <b>private</b> <b>hand</b> of a single man. Those many favours, especially coupled with both Kazanowski and Władysław lavish spending, raised many protests from the Commonwealth's parliament. They had, however, little effect on both Kazanowski and Władysław.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's my answer,' says Mellinger, <b>private</b> secretary, <b>'and</b> there'll {{be another}} in the morning. I have proofs of {{conspiracy}} against every man of you. The show is over, gentlemen.' ...|$|R
60|$|Though I {{have wanted}} leisure to {{acknowledge}} the honour of a letter you were pleased to write to me about six months ago; yet I have been very careful in obeying some of your commands, and am going on as fast as I can with the rest. I wish you had thought fit to have conveyed them to me by a more <b>private</b> <b>hand,</b> {{than that of the}} printing-house: for though I was pleased with a pattern of style and spirit which I proposed to imitate, yet I was sorry the world should be a witness how far I fell short in both.|$|R
5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into <b>private</b> <b>hands,</b> Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b> An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|While {{the estate}} remains in <b>private</b> <b>hands,</b> the National Trust owns {{the house and}} gardens, the park, the village of West Wycombe, and the hill on which the Dashwood {{mausoleum}} sits. The hill was {{the first part of}} the property given to the Trust by Sir John Dashwood in 1925. The village was bought by the Royal Society of Arts from Sir John in 1929 and given to the Trust five years later. The grounds are open to the public in the afternoon only from April to August annually, and the house is open from June to August.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained in <b>private</b> <b>hands</b> {{to operate the}} various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b> This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in <b>private</b> <b>hands.</b> This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E
5000|$|Community card poker {{refers to}} any game of poker that uses {{community}} cards (also called [...] "shared cards" [...] or [...] "window cards"), which are cards dealt face {{up in the}} center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand ("hole cards"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the [...] "board", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's <b>private</b> <b>hand.</b> The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.|$|R

40|$|Responses {{of college}} administrators in, schools facing {{conditions}} of fiscal stress, and alteinative strategies found to'be effective in private sector firms are examined. It {{is suggested that}} many college administrators are responding to conditions of decline by being. conservative and efficiency oriented. A number of factors {{within and outside the}} institution-that create pressure to respond in this wayare identified. Research on colleges and universities and on private sector firms are reported which suggest that these responses are detrimental to long-term organizational viability. A study of 40 colleges in the northeast United States (Cameron, 1981) provided responses from 600 faculty members and 694 administrators from public, <b>private,</b> <b>'and</b> chnrch-related institutions. Results suggest that administrators in declining institutions focus on internal resource allocation problems (budgeting and finance), rely on past,policies and practices (standardization), and do not valu...|$|R
