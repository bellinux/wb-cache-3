40|$|We {{studied the}} {{kinetics}} of transmitter release during trains of action potential (AP) -evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the calyx of Held synapse of juvenile rats. Using a new quantitative method {{based on a}} combination of ensemble fluctuation analysis and deconvolution, we were able to analyse mean quantal size (q) and release rate (ξ) continuously in a time-resolved manner. Estimates derived this way agreed well with values of q and quantal content (M) calculated for each EPSC within the train from ensemble means of peak amplitudes and their variances. Separate analysis of synchronous and asynchronous quantal release during long stimulus trains (200 ms, 100 Hz) revealed that the latter component was highly variable among different synapses but it was unequivocally identified in 18 out of 37 synapses analysed. Peak rates of asynchronous release ranged from 0. 2 to 15. 2 vesicles ms− 1 (ves ms− 1) with a mean of 2. 3 ± 0. 6 ves ms− 1. On average, asynchronous release accounted for less than 14 % {{of the total number of}} about 3670 ± 350 vesicles released during 200 ms trains. Following such trains, asynchronous release decayed with several time constants, the fastest one being in the order of 15 ms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Action {{potentials}} {{are thought}} to be determinant for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory. However, neuronal activity does not lead systematically to an action potential but also, in many cases, to synaptic depolarizing subthreshold events. This is particularly exemplified in corticostriatal information processing. Indeed, the striatum integrates information from the whole cerebral cortex and, due to the membrane properties of striatal medium spiny neurons, cortical inputs do not systematically trigger an action potential but a wide range of subthreshold <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>depolarizations.</b> Accordingly, we have addressed the following question: does a brief subthreshold event act as a Hebbian signal and induce long-term synaptic efficacy changes? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, using perforated patch-clamp recordings on rat brain corticostriatal slices, we demonstrate, that brief (30 ms) subthreshold depolarizing events in quasi-coincidence with presynaptic activity can act as Hebbian signals and are sufficient to induce long-term synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. This "subthreshold-depolarization dependent plasticity" (SDDP) induces strong, significant and bidirectional long-term synaptic efficacy changes at a very high occurrence (81 %) for time intervals between pre- and postsynaptic stimulations (Deltat) of - 110 <Deltat<+ 110 ms. Such subthreshold depolarizations are able to induce robust long-term depression (cannabinoid type- 1 receptor-activation dependent) as well as long-term potentiation (NMDA receptor-activation dependent). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show the existence of a robust, reliable and timing-dependent bidirectional long-term plasticity induced by brief subthreshold events paired with presynaptic activity. The existence of a subthreshold-depolarization dependent plasticity extends considerably, beyond the action potential, the neuron's capabilities to express long-term synaptic efficacy changes...|$|R
40|$|Both GABAB and muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (mAChRs) influence hippocampal-dependent mnemonic processing. Here {{the possibility}} of a direct interaction between GABAB receptors and mAChR-mediated synaptic responses has been studied using intracellular recording in rat hippocampal slices. The GABAB receptor agonist(−) -baclofen (5 – 10 μm) depressed an atropine-sensitive slow EPSP (EPSPM) and occluded the GABAB-receptor-mediated IPSP (IPSPB) which preceded it. These inhibitory effects were accompanied by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (9 ± 2 mV) and a reduction in cell input resistance (12 ± 3 %). The selective GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845 A (1 μm) fully reversed the depressant effects of (−) -baclofen (5 – 10 μm) such that in the combined presence of (−) -baclofen and CGP 55845 A the EPSPM was 134 ± 21 % of control. (−) -Baclofen (5 – 10 μm) caused a small (28 ± 11 %) inhibition of carbachol-induced (3. 0 μm) <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>depolarizations</b> and increases in input resistance. CGP 55845 A (1 μm) alone caused an increase in the amplitude of the EPSPM (253 ± 74 % of control) and blocked the IPSPB that preceded it. In contrast, the selective GABA uptake inhibitor NNC 05 – 0711 (10 μm) increased the amplitude of the IPSPB by 141 ± 38 % and depressed the amplitude of the EPSPM by 58 ± 10 %. This inhibition was abolished by CGP 55845 A (1 μm). Taken together these data provide good evidence that synaptically released GABA activates GABAB receptors that inhibit mAChR-mediated EPSPs in hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurones. The mechanism of inhibition may involve both pre- and postsynaptic elements...|$|R
40|$|The isolated, intact, {{membranous}} {{labyrinth of}} the frog (Rana temporaria) {{has been investigated}} electrophysiologically in vitro to determine {{the nature of the}} transmitter substance at the synapse between the vestibular hair cells and afferent fibers. Spontaneous synaptic activity can be monitored with intra-axonal recordings from the afferents. Increased K+ in the bath results in an increase in frequency of presynaptic release, as indicated by an increased frequency of spontaneous synaptic potentials. Adding Mg 2 + and lowering Ca 2 + results in a decrease in synaptic potential frequency (often to zero) with no change in their mean amplitude, indicating pre-synaptic blockade. Extracellular recordings from individual vestibular afferents indicate that bath-applied glutamate and related acidic amino acids consistently increase the firing rates of these afferents in a dose-dependent manner with no evidence of desensitization. In the presence of presynaptic blockade (high Mg 2 +/low Ca 2 +), bath application of glutamate and its agonists results in a reversible depolarization of vestibular afferents, suggesting a postsynaptic action of these substances. 2 -Amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid, kynurenic acid, and other acidic amino acid antagonists reversibly decrease the amplitudes of spontaneously occurring synaptic potentials without affecting their frequency, indicating subsynaptic blockade. These antagonists also block the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>depolarizations</b> due to glutamate and its agonists. GABA and its agonists and antagonists have no consistent effect upon afferent activity. These findings suggest that glutamate, aspartate, or a related compound is the transmitter at this synapse.

The AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas the slow component is contributed by NMDA receptors (e. g., Stern et al. 1992).

When one applies this protocol to a pair of cells, one will see a sustained increase of the amplitude of the EPSP following tetanus. This response is interesting since it is thought to be the physiological correlate for learning and memory in the cell.

Using a peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analysis, we therefore aimed at characterizing changes in the electrophysiological properties of GABAA receptors in PCs of rat cerebellar cortex during depolarization-induced "rebound potentiation (RP) " and purinoceptor-mediated long-term potentiation (PM-LTP), because both RP and PM-LTP likely depend on postsynaptic mechanisms. Stimulation-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were recorded from PCs in neonatal rat cerebellar slices. Our analysis showed that <b>postsynaptic</b> membrane <b>depolarization</b> induced RP of eIPSCs in association with {{significant increase in the}} number of synaptic GABAA receptors without changing the channel conductance.

Pretreatment with protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, H- 89 and cAMPS-Rp, completely abolished the PM-LTP. The CaMKII inhibitor KN- 62 reported to abolish RP did not alter PM-LTP. These results suggest that the signaling mechanism underlying PM-LTP could involve ATP-induced phosphorylation of synaptic GABAA receptors, thereby resulting in upregulation of the channel conductance by stimulating adenylyl cyclase-PKA signaling cascade, possibly via activation of P 2 Y 11 purinoceptor.

Despite the presence of hyperexcitability, the resting [K]o was not increased after injury. The faster rate of increase and larger amplitude of the orthodromically evoked [K]o elevation after head trauma occurred in association with a greater population spike with shorter response latency. Contrary to the assumption in previous studies that the evoked activity in control and injured neuronal circuits is the same during antidromic activation, stimulation of granule cell axons in glutamate receptor antagonists evoked a greater [K]o increase and a larger population spike. Although perforant path stimulation resulted in a larger [K]o elevation after injury, the rate of clearance of the [K]o transients evoked either by neuronal activity or by external application of potassium was not compromised. The [K]o increase evoked by activa-tion of the presynaptic afferents in isolation was not increased. In addition, the <b>postsynaptic</b> neuronal <b>depolarization</b> and firing evoked by exogenous potassium application was decreased after trauma.

40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP), {{a persistent}} enhancement of synaptic transmission {{that may be}} involved in some forms of learning and memory, is induced at excitatory synapses in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus by coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. Although action potentials backpropagating into dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells provide sufficient postsynaptic activity to induce LTP under some in vitro conditions, it is not known whether LTP can be induced by patterns of postsynaptic action potential firing that occur in these cells in vivo. Here we report that a characteristic in vivo pattern of action potential generation in CA 1 pyramidal cells known as the complex spike burst enables the induction of LTP during theta frequency synaptic stimulation in the CA 1 region of hippocampal slices maintained in vitro. Our results suggest that complex spike bursting may have an important role in synaptic processes involved in learning and memory formation, perhaps by producing a highly sensitive postsynaptic state during which even low frequencies of presynaptic activity can induce LTP.

Though AMPA receptors are not {{expressed in the}} postsynaptic membranes of silent synapses, they are stored in vesicles inside the postsynaptic cells, where they cannot detect extracellular glutamate, but can be quickly inserted into the postsynaptic cell membrane {{in response to a}} tetanizing stimulus. The NMDAR is functionally similar to AMPAR except for two major differences: NMDARs carry ion currents composed of Na+, K+, but also (unlike most AMPAR) Ca2+; NMDARs also have a site inside their ion channel that binds magnesium ions (Mg2+). This magnesium binding site is located in the pore of the channel, at a place within the electrical field generated by the membrane potential. Normally, current will not flow through the NMDAR channel, even when it has bound glutamate. This is because the ion channel associated with this receptor is plugged by magnesium, acting like a cork in a bottle. However, since the Mg2+ is charged and is bound within the membrane's electric field, depolarization of the membrane potential above threshold can dislodge the magnesium, allowing current flow through the NMDAR channel.

Since the bursts under these conditions were markedly longer in duration than those observed in the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate alone, it was hypothesized that carbachol might have another action, in addition to the membrane hyperpolarization. Using dissociated cells, it was found that brief applications of carbachol could indeed diminish the slow afterhyperpolarizations that follow single spikes, short bursts or long trains of action potentials in cholinergic basalis neurons. These results indicate that, through its dual ability to hyperpolarize cholinergic neurons and to reduce their afterhyperpolarizations, acetylcholine can promote the occurrence of rhythmic bursting in the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate. Accordingly, whether derived from brainstem or local sources, acetylcholine may facilitate rhythmic discharge in cholinergic basalis neurons which could in turn impose a rhythmic modulation upon cortical activity during particular states across the sleep-waking cycle...|$|R
40|$|Glutamate mediates the {{majority}} of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the vertebrate brain. Glutamate receptors (GluRs) transduce signals in two ways: metabotropic GluRs signal via intracellular G proteins, whereas ionotropic GluRs (iGluRs) open intrinsic ion channels in response to agonist binding. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate- and glycine-gated iGluRs that play critical roles in spatial learning, contextual fear memory acquisition, synapse elimination, and chronic pain. Their particularly high calcium (Ca 2 +) permeability and strongly voltage-dependent channel block by external magnesium (Mg 2 +) distinguish NMDARs from other iGluRs. Mg 2 + channel block of NMDARs inhibits current influx through {{the majority}} of agonist-bound, open NMDARs at resting membrane potentials (Vms), but this block is relieved by depolarization. Thus, significant current flow through NMDARs requires presynaptic activity (glutamate release) and <b>postsynaptic</b> activity (<b>depolarization</b> to relieve Mg 2 + channel block), conferring on NMDARs a coincidence-detection capability that is central to their physiological importance. To mediate this and other important functions, NMDARs require tight regulation of the voltage-dependent Mg 2 + block that provides crucial control of NMDAR-mediated current flow and Ca 2 + influx. NMDARs are typically composed of NR 1 and NR 2 subunits. The four NR 2 subunits (NR 2 A-D) contribute to four diheteromeric NMDAR subtypes (NR 1 / 2 A-NR 1 / 2 D), which differ in many respects, including the magnitudes of channel block by Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + permeability, and single-channel conductance. Previously-gathered data from our lab demonstrates that the subtype specificity of Mg 2 + block is principally conferred by a single amino acid site in the third transmembrane region (M 3) of NR 2 subunits. This "NR 2 S/L site" contains a serine in NR 2 A and NR 2 B subunits and a leucine in NR 2 C and NR 2 D subunits. Surprisingly, the NR 2 S/L site does not line the pore. I created several structural homology models of NMDARs to generate hypotheses regarding how the NR 2 S/L site conveys its effects to the pore. I tested these hypotheses experimentally {{and found that the}} NR 2 S/L site interacts with an NR 1 subunit tryptophan in the pore-loop to regulate Mg 2 + block properties. I further determined that the NR 2 S/L site greatly contributes to the subtype variation in single-channel conductance, and likely plays a role in the subtype variation in Ca 2 + permeability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we studied and {{compared}} the biochemical and the electrophysiological characteristics of two cell lines (GT 1 - 7 and GN 11) of immortalized mouse LHRH-expressing neurons and the correlation with their maturational stage and migratory activity. In fact, previous {{results indicated that}} GN 11, but not GT 1 - 7, cells exhibit an elevated motility in vitro. The {{results show that the}} two cell lines differ in terms of immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase and nestin as well as of production and release of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and of intracellular distribution and release of the LHRH. Patch-clamp recordings in GN 11 cells, reveal the presence of a single inward rectifier K+ current indicative of an immature neuronal phenotype (neither firing nor electrical activity). In contrast, as known from previous studies, GT 1 - 7 cells show the characteristics of mature LHRH neurons with a high electrical activity characterized by spontaneous firing and excitatory <b>postsynaptic</b> potentials. K+-induced <b>depolarization</b> induces in GT 1 - 7 cells, but not in GN 11 cells, a strong increase in the release of LHRH in the culture medium. However, depolarization of GN 11 cells significantly decreases their chemomigratory response. In conclusion, these results indicate that GT 1 - 7 and GN 11 cells show different biochemical and electrophysiological characteristics and are representative of mature and immature LHRH neurons, respectively. The early stage of maturation of GN 11 cells, as well as the low electrical activity detected in these cells, appears to correlate with their migratory activity in vitro...|$|R
