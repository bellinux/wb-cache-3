5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Speirs {{was born}} on 22 March 1886 in the Govan area of Glasgow, Scotland, to James Hamilton Speirs senior and Janet Shields Speirs (née McLean), the fifth of six children. By 1901, the family had moved to nearby Govanhill, and Jimmy worked as a clerk. It was in Govanhill that Speirs' {{football}} ability was first shown, when {{he played in the}} junior football circuit on the black ash <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> Glasgow, for Annandale, during summer tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese characteristics, {{including}} the further use of traditional pentatonic scales, continued to crop up elsewhere {{in his early}} works. In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner (first movement), a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis. The <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> the opening melody combine to form the constituent notes of the ascending form of the Japanese in scale.|$|E

5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

25|$|Trail {{layout and}} length – The trail system should {{comprise}} loops with internal connectors and cutoffs {{that allow the}} skier discretion in how long to ski. Loop lengths should range from 5 to 15km with a beginners loop of about 1km. Minimum clearing widths should range between 3 and 5 meters, depending on what type of skiing is accommodated and whether a steep section would require herringbone technique uphill or turns downhill. Grades should usually be less than 5% rise over run for general skiing with occasional sustained <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> 10% and short (less-than-50-m) <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> up to 25%.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} notated {{sources of}} Gregorian chant (written ca. 950) used symbols called neumes (Gr. sign, of the hand) to indicate tone-movements and relative duration within each syllable. A sort of musical stenography {{that seems to}} focus on gestures and tone-movements but not the specific <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> individual notes, nor the relative starting <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> each neume. Given the fact that Chant was learned in an oral tradition in which the texts and melodies were sung from memory, this was obviously not necessary. The neumatic manuscripts display great sophistication and precision in notation and a wealth of graphic signs to indicate the musical gesture and proper pronunciation of the text.|$|E

30|$|Mean <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the melody: We {{restrict}} the minimum and maximum allowed pitches for the melody to the <b>pitch</b> range <b>of</b> the three considered instruments which is from E 3 (165 Hz) to A 6 (1047 Hz). For the experimental design, we define two levels. The first level transposes the song extract (including the accompaniment) {{such that the}} average <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the melody is D 4 (294 Hz), and the second level transposes the song extract such that the average <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the melody is D 5 (587 Hz). Afterwards, we apply the following mechanism to prevent unnatural pitches w.r.t. the instruments. If the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> one tone violates the allowed pitch range, the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> all tones within the considered song extract is shifted until all pitches are valid.|$|R

25|$|Beverly Johnson was {{the first}} woman to {{successfully}} ascend El Capitan, via the Nose route, with Dan Asay in June 1973. In September 1973, Beverly Johnson and Sibylle Hechtel were the first team of women to ascend El Capitan via the Triple Direct route, which takes the first ten <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> the Salathe Wall, then continues up the middle portion of El Capitan via the Muir Wall, and finishes on the upper <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> the Nose route. In 1977, Molly Higgins and Barb Eastman climbed the Nose, to become the second party of women to climb El Capitan and the first to climb it via the Nose. In 1978, Bev Johnson {{was the first}} woman to solo El Capitan by climbing the Dihedral Wall. In 1993, Lynn Hill established the first free Ascent of The Nose (IV 5.14a/b). Hazel Findlay has made three free ascents of El Capitan, including the first female ascent of Golden Gate in 2011, the first female ascent of Pre-Muir Wall in 2012, and a three-day ascent of Freerider in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Briggs was a notably {{short man}} at {{about five feet}} five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill lay {{in his ability to}} vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E
25|$|He bowled {{at around}} medium pace and on English <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> his time could gain spin, {{so that when}} rain {{affected}} the pitch he was unplayable. Against the best batsmen, too, Lohmann possessed skill and guile, and he could vary his pace, flight and break deceptively, so as to worry batsmen on better pitches. He was the finest slip fielder of his time and in county cricket a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries for Surrey and averaged 25 in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Scored for string {{orchestra}} and bell (only a single chime is used, on the pitch A, the tonal {{centre of the}} piece), Cantus exemplifies Pärt's tintinnabuli style, using only the <b>pitches</b> <b>of</b> a single A minor scale.
