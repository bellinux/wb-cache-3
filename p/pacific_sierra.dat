40|$|Abstract Background Testing {{connectivity}} among {{populations of}} exploited marine fish is a main {{concern for the}} development of conservation strategies. Even though marine species are often considered to display low levels of population structure, barriers to dispersal found in the marine realm may restrict gene flow and cause genetic divergence of populations. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>Sierra</b> mackerel (Scomberomorus sierra) is a pelagic fish species distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific. Seasonal spawning in different areas across the species range, as well as a limited dispersal, may result in a population genetic structure. Identification of genetically discrete units is important in the proper conservation of the fishery. Results Samples collected from the Eastern Pacific, including the areas of main abundance of the species, presented high levels of mtDNA genetic diversity and a highly significant divergence. At least two genetically discrete groups were detected in the northern (Sinaloa) and central areas (Oaxaca and Chiapas) of the species range, exhibiting slight genetic differences with respect to the samples collected in the southern region (Peru), together with a "chaotic genetic patchiness" pattern of differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance. Historical demographic parameters supported the occurrence of past population expansions, whereas the divergence times between populations coincided with the occurrence of glacial maxima some 220 000 years ago. Conclusions The population genetic structure detected for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Sierra</b> mackerel is associated with a limited dispersal between the main abundance areas that are usually linked to the spawning sites of the species. Population expansions have coincided with glacial-interglacial episodes in the Pleistocene, but they may also be related to the increase in the SST and with upwelling areas in the EEP since the early Pleistocene. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of CV syllables exhibits a trading relationship between voice onset time (VOT) of a consonant {{and duration of}} a vowel. Percepts of [ba] and [wa] can, for example, depend on the durations of the consonant and vowel segments, {{with an increase in}} the duration of the subsequent vowel switching the percept of the preceding consonant from [w] to [b]. A neural model, called PHONET, is proposed to account for these findings. In the model, C and V inputs are filtered by parallel auditory streams that respond preferentially to transient and sustained properties of the acoustic signal, as in vision. These streams are represented by working memories that adjust their processing rates to cope with variable acoustic input rates. More rapid transient inputs can cause greater activation of the transient stream which, in turn, can automatically gain control the processing rate in the sustained stream. An invariant percept obtains when the relative activations of C and V representations in the two streams remain uncha. nged. The trading relation may be simulated as a result of how different experimental manipulations affect this ratio. It is suggested that the brain can use duration of a subsequent vowel to make the [b]/[w] distinction because the speech code is a resonant event that emerges between working mernory activation patterns and the nodes that categorize them.

40|$|How do {{reactive}} {{and planned}} behaviors interact in real time? How are sequences of such behaviors released at appropriate times during autonomous navigation to realize valued goals? Controllers for both animals and mobile robots, or animats, need reactive mechanisms for exploration, and learned plans to reach goal objects once an environment becomes familiar. The SOVEREIGN (Self-Organizing, Vision, Expectation, Recognition, Emotion, Intelligent, Goaloriented Navigation) animat model embodies these capabilities, and is {{tested in a}} 3 D virtual reality environment. SOVEREIGN includes several interacting subsystems which model complementary properties of cortical What and Where processing streams and which clarify similarities between mechanisms for navigation and arm movement control. As the animat explores an environment, visual inputs are processed by networks that are sensitive to visual form and motion in the What and Where streams, respectively. Position-invariant and sizeinvariant recognition categories are learned by real-time incremental learning in the What stream. Estimates of target position relative to the animat are computed in the Where stream, and can activate approach movements toward the target. Motion cues from animat locomotion can elicit head-orienting movements to bring a new target into view. Approach and orienting movements are alternately performed during animat navigation. Cumulative estimates of each movement are derived from interacting proprioceptive and visual cues. Movement sequences are stored within a motor working memory. Sequences of visual categories are stored in a sensory working memory. These working memories trigger learning of sensory and motor sequence categories, or plans, which together control planned movements. Predictively effective chunk combinations are selectively enhanced via reinforcement learning when the animat is rewarded. Selected planning chunks effect a gradual transition from variable reactive exploratory movements to efficient goal-oriented planned movement sequences. Volitional signals gate interactions between model subsystems {{and the release of}} overt behaviors. The model can control different motor sequences under different motivational states and learns more efficient sequences to rewarded goals as exploration proceeds.

40|$|Both {{animals and}} mobile robots, or animats, need {{adaptive}} control systems {{to guide their}} movements through a novel environment. Such control systems need reactive mechanisms for exploration, and learned plans to efficiently reach goal objects once the environment is familiar. How reactive and planned behaviors interact together in real time, and arc released at the appropriate times, during autonomous navigation remains a major unsolved problern. This work presents an end-to-end model to address this problem, named SOVEREIGN: A Self-Organizing, Vision, Expectation, Recognition, Emotion, Intelligent, Goal-oriented Navigation system. The model comprises several interacting subsystems, governed by systems of nonlinear differential equations. As the animat explores the environment, a vision module processes visual inputs using networks that arc sensitive to visual form and motion. Targets processed within the visual form system arc categorized by real-time incremental learning. Simultaneously, visual target position is computed {{with respect to the}} animat's body. Estimates of target position activate a motor system to initiate approach movements toward the target. Motion cues from animat locomotion can elicit orienting head or camera movements to bring a never target into view. Approach and orienting movements arc alternately performed during animat navigation. Cumulative estimates of each movement, based on both visual and proprioceptive cues, arc stored within a motor working memory. Sensory cues are stored in a parallel sensory working memory. These working memories trigger learning of sensory and motor sequence chunks, which together control planned movements. Effective chunk combinations arc selectively enhanced via reinforcement learning when the animat is rewarded. The planning chunks effect a gradual transition from reactive to planned behavior. The model can read-out different motor sequences under different motivational states and learns more efficient paths to rewarded goals as exploration proceeds. Several volitional signals automatically gate the interactions between model subsystems at appropriate times. A 3 -D visual simulation environment reproduces the animat's sensory experiences as it moves through a simplified spatial environment. The SOVEREIGN model exhibits robust goal-oriented learning of sequential motor behaviors. Its biomimctic structure explicates a number of brain processes which are involved in spatial navigation.

40|$|What is {{the neural}} {{representation}} of a speech code as it evolves in real time? A neural model of thiss process, called the ARTPHONE model, is developed to quantitatively simulate data concerning segregation and integration of phonetic percepts, as exemplified by the problem of distinguishing "topic" from "top pick" in natural discourse. Psychoacouotic data concerning categorization of stop consonant pairs indicate that the closure time between syllable final (VC) and syllable initial (CV) transitions determines whether consonants are segregated, i. e., perceived as distinct, or integrated, i. e. fused into a single percept. Hearing two stops in a VC CV pair that are phonetically the same, as in "top pick," requires about 150 msec more closure time than hearing two stops in a Vc 1 -C₂V pair that are phonetically different, as in "odd ball. " When the distribution of closure intervals over trials is experimentally varied, subjects' decision boundaries between one-stop and two-stop percepts always occurred near the mean closure interval (Repp, 1980). The neural model traces these properties to clynamical interactions between a working memory for short-term storage of phonetic items and a list categorization network that groups, or chunns, sequences of the phonetic itemss in working memory These interactions autornatically adjust their processing rate to the speech rate via automatic gain control. The speech code in the model is a resonant wave that emerges after bottom-up signals from the working memory select list chunks which, in turn, read out top-down expectations that amplify consistent woking memory items. The resonance between bottom-up abd top-down information develops on a slower time scale than the processing of bottom-up information alone. It focuses attention upon speach groupings in working memory that are expected based upon past experience, while inhibiting speech features that are not expected, as in phonemic restoration. As in other examples drawn from Adaptive Resonance Theory, it is proposed that all conscious speech precepts are resonant events. In the case of VC₁-C₂V pairs, such a resonance may be rapidly reset by inputs, such as C₂, that are inconsistent with a top-down expectation, say if C₁ or, {{in the absence of}} a top-down mismatch, by a collapse of resonanct activation due to a habituative process that can take a much longer time to occur, as illustrated by the categorical boundary between VCV-CV. The categorical boundary for integration of VS-CV persists 150 msec longer that that of VC₁-C₂V because of the resonant dynamics that subserve perception of C. These categorization data may thus be understood ass emergent properties of a resonant process that adjusts its dynamics to track the speech rate.
