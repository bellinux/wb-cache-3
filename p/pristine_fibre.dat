As directly imaged by HRTEM, the material treated at 900 °C consists of nanometre-sized graphitic domains with a microtexture that resembles non-graphitisable carbon. However, above 2000 °C, these elongated structures coalesce, yielding highly graphitised lamellar carbon. This graphitisation mode {{is very different}} from the conventional progressive graphitisation of lamellar carbon. It is similar to that of polyimide films, and is characterized by a preferential planar orientation of the polyaromatic structural units inherited from the <b>pristine</b> <b>fibre</b> microtexture...|$|E

The elastic modulus and the tensile strength were computed after measuring carefully the fibre diameter. The average fibre strength was reduced by 20 % and the Weibull modulus by half during composite processing. The analysis of the fracture surfaces in the scanning electron microscope showed that the strength-limiting defects were located around the tungsten core in <b>pristine</b> <b>fibres</b> and at the surface in fibres extracted from the composite panels.

40|$|The 40  kg test {{masses of}} the Advanced LIGO {{interferometric}} gravitational wave detector will each be suspended on four fibres fabricated from Heraeus Suprasil synthetic silica glass. The ultimate tensile breaking stress and fracturing process of loaded silica fibres was investigated {{in order to develop}} the technology required to suspend the test mass in a robust and safe manner. The majority of the fibres in this study were pulled by hand in a H 2  − O 2 flame; for comparison, fibres were also pulled on a CO 2 laser machine. Carefully prepared fibres were shown to be pristine, i. e. free of surface cracks. Such fibres exhibited breaking strengths as high as 5  −  6  GPa. To analyse the mechanisms of fracture a high speed photographic setup was developed in addition to the use of a high speed video camera. The <b>pristine</b> <b>fibres</b> break in the zone of maximal stress as expected in the model of flawless fibres. Some fibres break at a lower stress and these fractures occur at the fibre ends. This type of fracture is related to the thermal stress induced by local heating which was used to align the fibre in the test structure. The most likely fracture mechanism is based on a thermo-kinetic approach...|$|R

Thermal recycling of end-of-life glass fibre reinforced composites or composite manufacturing waste delivers fibres with virtually no residual strength or value. Composites produced from such fibres also have extremely poor mechanical performance. Data is presented showing that a short hot sodium hydroxide solution treatment of such recycled fibres can more than triple their strength and restore their ability to act as an effective reinforcement in second life composite materials.

This paper introduces and reviews the initial results of the ReCoVeR projects on enabling cost-effective performance regeneration of glass-fibres from thermal recycling of end-of-life automotive and wind energy composites. ReCoVeR technology targets treating glass fibre thermally reclaimed from GRP waste in order to regenerate a performance level which is equivalent to new fibres.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} utilisation {{of light}} and strong structural materials {{has led to an}} increasing demand to engineering industries on developing different types of advanced composites. Thus, the development of simple and low cost woven glass fibre composites with an improvement on their tensile and impact properties is suggested. In this paper, the hybridization of a glass fibre reinforced composite is achieved by using low cost short silk fibres as a medium to enhance its cross-ply strength. The comparison on the tensile and impact properties of the composite reinforced by the short silk fibre (with the content from 0. 3 to 0. 6. wt%) with a <b>pristine</b> glass <b>fibre</b> composite sample was conducted. Fracture surfaces were analysed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental results indicated that the maximum Young's modulus and ductility index (DI) of a silk reinforced composite increased by 50 % and 75 %, respectively as compared with the pristine one. Furthermore, the visual examination on drop-weight test samples proved that the impact resistance of the silk reinforced composite was better than that of the pristine sample as well. According to the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} addition of 0. 4. wt% short silk fibre into glass fibre composite was shown to be the advisable reinforcement content to achieve better tensile and impact strengths. ...|$|R

The change of length of the fibres was determined under various treatment conditions (ie temperature, time, stress applied). Prolonged heat treatment resulted in lower tensile strength of the <b>fibres.</b> The <b>pristine</b> and treated <b>fibres</b> were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy and by TGA, {{and the results were}} used for representing the different regions according to chemical aspects in a plot of temperature versus time; this is very important for the whole treatment process. A shrinkage model was proposed, having both scientific and technical importance.

40|$|Yabbies {{have the}} ability to {{regenerate}} lost limbs. Loss of a limb results in the growth of a limb bud. Development of this new limb involves many developing stages until the new limb becomes morphologically and physiologically virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor. In the yabby, the claw becomes functional after the first moult when the dactyl becomes moveable. However, the muscle fibres are able to develop force and appear to be functioning before the dactyl becomes moveable and the claw is operational (West et al., 1995). This study aimed to document morphological stages of claw regeneration and determine sequence and protein appearance of all fibre types in the claw closer muscle of yabby, Cherax albidus. The regenerating limbs were harvested at strategic stages, and the contralateral pristine claw was taken as a control. The stages of re-growth sampled were an unsegmented limb (papilla), a limb with a closed dactyl, an early stage of the limb with an open dactyl, and a fully regenerated limb. Fast (SL 3 ̆c 4 µm) and slow (SL 3 ̆e 8 µm) fibres were isolated from pristine and regenerating claw muscle of the yabby, C. albidus. Muscle tissue was taken from the papilla and closed dactyls. Myofibrillar proteins in <b>fibres</b> from the <b>pristine</b> claw closer muscle were identified using SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Fibres contained numerous isoforms of structural and regulatory proteins in assemblages correlated with fibre type. One fast (F) and one slow (S 2) fibre types were identified. All F fibres possessed two isoforms of paramyosin (P 1 and P 2), while all slow (S 2) fibres contained only the P 2 variant. Slow (S 2) fibres were distinguished by the distribution of a large isoform of troponin T (T 1), while fast fibres contained an unidentified 75 K protein. Fast and slow fibres also differed in the assemblage of other regulatory proteins. The ratio between myosin heavy chain to actin in both fast and slow (S 2) fibres was greater than one. During the initial stages of claw regeneration, the tissue contained undifferentiated muscle mass surrounded by large numbers of dense structures that were possibly haemocytes or nuclei. Protein profiles by SDS-PAGE revealed an extremely large amount of an 88 K protein. The closer muscle does not differentiate until the closed dactyl stage where myofibrils were found to contain scattered fragments of sarcomeres. Sarcomere length of these myofibrils were of intermediate type. Mature, fully differentiated myofibrils (complete sarcomeres) had a short sarcomere length characteristic of fast fibres. Myofibrillar protein analysis by SDS-PAGE could not confirm fibre type. Most proteins from both fibre types were present at this stage. Throughout this phase, the ratio of myosin heavy chain to actin was less than one. Once the dactyl opened, the appearance, sarcomere lengths and protein profiles of the muscle fibres were indistinguishable from <b>pristine</b> <b>fibres,</b> and both fast and slow fibres were present. However the ratio of myosin heavy chain to actin in slow muscle fibres was approximately equal to one, fast muscle fibres contained a ratio greater than one. Results obtained also showed there was a greater proportion of slow fibres (65...|$|R

The preform stack was heated and the composite material was manufactured by press forming. A challenging issue in this work was to achieve the desired distribution of the recovered carbon fibres in the fibre preforms. It is well known that dispersion of reinforcement is of immense importance for quality and performance of the composite materials. Here, a paper making method is employed to distribute the recovered carbon fibres randomly in the plane. The quality of the manufactured novel, fully recycled, composite material regarding void content and consolidation was controlled by extensive microscopy. The resulting composite material was analysed in terms of its mechanical performance including elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, strength and strain to failure as well as its creep resistance.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects focussed on the cost effective recycling of end-of-life glass fibre composites from automotive and wind energy applications. The ultimate goal of these projects is to enable cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties of glass fibres which have been produced from thermal recycling of glass reinforced structural composites. This project has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill. A breakthrough in this field will enable such recycled fibres to compete with pristine materials in many large volume composite applications. The development of an economically viable process for regenerating the properties of thermally recycled glass fibres would have major technological, societal, economic, environmental impacts. Conservative estimates indicate that there is a potential to generate a global industry with an annual production of 1 million Tons of reusable regenerated glass fibres with a market value order of magnitude of £ 1, 000 M. The reuse of these materials could result in a huge reduction in the environmental impact of the glass-fibre industry where the replacement of <b>pristine</b> glass <b>fibre</b> products would equate to a global reduction in CO 2 production of 400, 000 Tons/annum from reduced melting energy requirements alone. Furthermore, such a technological development would also reduce the need for an annual landfill {{disposal of}} 2 million Tons of composite materials. These developments would clearly be in line with the growing societal and environmental pressure to reduce the use of landfill disposal, increase the reuse of valuable raw materials resources, and reduce the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The results of a study of the properties of glass fibres after thermal conditioning will be presented. The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane sized and unsized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 600 °C. Thermal conditioning for only 15 minutes led to strength degradation of greater than 80 % at higher temperatures. The room temperature strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. Unsized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The results as discussed in terms of the changes in surface coating and bulk glass structure during heat conditioning...|$|R

A challenging issue in this work was to achieve the desired distribution of the recovered carbon fibres in the fibre preforms. Here, a paper making method was employed to distribute the recovered carbon fibres randomly in the plane. It is well known that the fibre/PP interface properties are often the weakest link in the composite performance. Several modifications, including the addition of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP), are often used. MAPP improves the interface bonding between the fibre and polymer matrix by two simultaneous reactions. Firstly, the long molecular chain is responsible for chain entanglements and co-crystallisation with the non-polar PP matrix. These entanglements provide mechanical integrity to the host material. Secondly, the anhydride groups chemically interact with the functional groups on the fibre surface. The addition of MAPP has been found to improve the interface and increase the stiffness and strength of the composite. Inelastic mechanical behaviour in tension of a recycled polypropylene (rPP) matrix and a rPP matrix with addition of 10 % of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (rPP+MAPP) was characterised and compared. The time dependent response was decomposed into nonlinear viscoelastic and viscoplastic parts and each of them quantified. It was found that the elastic properties of the rPP matrix did not degrade during loading. The addition of MAPP to the rPP matrix did not change the mechanical properties of the material. A non-linear material model was developed and the involved parameters (stress dependent functions) were identified. The model was then validated in a stress controlled test at a constant stress rate. The inelastic and time dependent behaviour of the MAPP modified composite material in tension was analysed. A series of quasistatic tensile and creep tests were performed to identify the material model, which accounts for: a) damage related stiffness reduction, b) development of stress and time dependent irreversible strains described as viscoplasticity, c) nonlinear viscoelastic behaviour. Fibre length distribution was investigated before and after composite manufacturing process to investigate the influence of the processing conditions on the fibre degradation. The quality of the manufactured novel, fully recycled, composite material regarding void content and fibre orientation was examined by microscopy.
