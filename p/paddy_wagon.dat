5|$|Homer's {{escape from}} the {{overturned}} <b>paddy</b> <b>wagon</b> is a homage to the 1993 film The Fugitive. Chief Wiggum's dream in which Lisa speaks backwards is reference to Twin Peaks and Special Agent Dale Cooper's interaction with the Man from Another Place. While recording Lisa's lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards; the recording was in turn reversed, a technique known as phonetic reversal, the same technique used on Twin Peaks. Several other parts out of the segment are direct references to the dream, including a moving shadow on the curtain, and Wiggum's hair standing straight up after waking.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to the trucking operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic vehicles on display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. The displays included a 1916 Mack <b>Paddy</b> <b>Wagon,</b> a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford Tank Truck. A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages. Other early period vehicles on display included a 1912 Autocar two-cylinder transit bus, a 1914 Trumbull, a 1915 Barker, and a 1917 Republic Model 10 1-ton express and a 1920 3 Â½ ton Model AC Mack.|$|E

50|$|At that moment, {{two policemen}} spot the Mad Bomber and they pursue him, {{thinking}} that Porky {{holding onto the}} Mad Bomber's cloak {{is a sign that}} Porky's trying to tackle him. The Mad Bomber reaches his hideout, and just as the police, followed by the press arrive at the scene, he locks five doors to the entrance and barricades the last door with various furniture, vowing that they'll never find him. Once more, however, Porky appears and tries to hand back the time bomb. The Mad Bomber decides he's had it and flees the hideout, only to run into the waiting police <b>paddy</b> <b>wagon.</b> Porky then comes out, shoves the bomb (now beginning to smoke) into the <b>paddy</b> <b>wagon,</b> and holds out his hand, expecting the Mad Bomber to pay him a penny for his troubles, but the <b>paddy</b> <b>wagon</b> drives away to the City Jail. On the way, the bomb blows up on its creator, sending fireworks and skyrockets shooting out of the <b>paddy</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Sunday {{folk music}} was {{regularly}} played in Washington Square Park on Sundays until April 9, 1961 when Morris rejected the folkies' {{application for a}} permit with no explanation.

Police estimated that were 2,500 people in the ballroom during the disturbance and that 40 different fights were going on when they arrived. The concert promoter, LeRoy Smith (1911-1989), estimated that 1,600 were in attendance and that only 4 fights had broken out. There were no serious injuries or damage to the ballroom.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} precursors of the perp walk, before the term came into use, occurred in 1903. NYPD inspector George W. McClusky had arrested the principal members of the Morello crime family, one of {{the earliest}} dominant Mafia groups in the city, following the discovery of a mutilated, dismembered corpse later identified as a Morello associate from Buffalo in a barrel outside a Little Italy apartment house, the most notorious of the city's organized crimeârelated Barrel Murders {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. After they had been in lockup for a night, McClusky had the cuffed suspects marched through the streets of Little Italy, in full view of their fellow Italian immigrants, from police headquarters to the nearby Third Judicial District Courthouse for arraignment, claiming that the <b>paddy</b> <b>wagons</b> in which this would normally be done had not arrived as scheduled.|$|R

500|$|On May 2, {{more than}} a {{thousand}} students skipped school and gathered at the 16th Street Baptist Church. The principal of Parker High School attempted to lock the gates to keep students in, but they scrambled over the walls to get to the church. Demonstrators were given instructions to march to the downtown area, to meet with the Mayor, and integrate the chosen buildings. They were to leave in smaller groups and continue on their courses until arrested. Marching in disciplined ranks, some of them using walkie-talkies, they were sent at timed intervals from various churches to the downtown business area. More than 600 students were arrested; the youngest of these was reported to be eight years old. Children left the churches while singing hymns and [...] "freedom songs" [...] such as [...] "We Shall Overcome". [...] They clapped and laughed while being arrested and awaiting transport to jail. The mood was compared to that of a school picnic. Although Bevel informed Connor that the march was to take place, Connor and the police were dumbfounded by the numbers and behavior of the children. They assembled <b>paddy</b> <b>wagons</b> and school buses to take the children to jail. When no squad cars were left to block the city streets, Connor, whose authority extended to the fire department, used fire trucks.

40|$|On a {{warm and}} sunny September day in 2004, an {{unlikely}} group of historians, labor leaders, city administrators, anarchists, police spokespeople, and assorted progressives gathered at a nondescript intersection near Chicagoâs trendy West Loop Gate neighborhood. After more than a century, a central event in labor and radical history was finally getting an official monument. In the shadow of parked <b>paddy</b> <b>wagons,</b> workers in union T-shirts cheered, police officers clapped uneasily, and anarchists unfurled banners contesting {{the dedication of the}} Haymarket Memorial. Heralded by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs as âa new way to do monuments at historic sites, â 1 the memorialâs semi-abstract design resulted from months of discussion by union leaders, police representatives, and public art administrators eager to find a consensus solution for representing an event still divisive over 100 years after it occurred. Marking the precise location where anarchist organizers made revolutionary speeches at a rally for workers killed during the May, 1886 strike for an 8 -hour day, the red-patina-ed, bronze sculpture depicts faceless, coverall-wearing workers speaking from a cart. An unusually lengthy text describes the story in bloodless and carefully worded language: the uneventful nighttime rally, the charge of the police line, the mysterious bomb, the death toll from the explosion and subsequent police violence, the unfair trial and execution of the rally organizers, and their posthumous pardon.
