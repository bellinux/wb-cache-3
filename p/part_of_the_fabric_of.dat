These societies form <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> Roman Catholic Mariology. As early as the 16th century, the Holy See endorsed the Sodality of Our Lady and Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull commending it and granting it indulgences and establishing it as the mother sodality, and other sodalities were formed thereafter.|$|E

Throughout Roman Catholic history, the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary has {{led to the creation of}} numerous items of Roman Catholic Marian art. Today, these items may be viewed from an artistic perspective, but also they are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> Roman Catholic Mariology.|$|E

Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Sandra Hall criticised Wright's attention to realism for being [...] "careless with the customs and conventions that were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> Austen's world." [...] In another review, Time Out magazine lamented the absence of Austen's [...] "brilliant sense of irony", remarking that the film's [...] "romantic melodrama's played up at the expense of her razor-sharp wit." [...] More positively, Derek Elley of Variety magazine praised Wright and Moggach for [...] "extracting the youthful essence" [...] of the novel while also [...] "providing a richly detailed setting" [...] under Greenwood and Durran's supervision. Equally pleased with the film was the San Francisco Chronicles Ruthe Stein, who wrote that Wright made a [...] "spectacular feature film debut" [...] that is [...] "creatively reimagined and sublimely entertaining". Claudia Puig of USA Today called it [...] "a stellar adaptation, bewitching the viewer completely and incandescently with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing Robbins' storyline in [...] "Going, Going, Gone", Capshaw {{revealed}} {{that she was}} [...] "shocked" [...] when it was made known {{to her that the}} character's leg would be amputated. The actress additionally noted that it was difficult to keep the fate of her character a secret. Following the premiere, E! Online reported that Dane's death and departure in the premiere were results of budgetary cuts, mandated by ABC. Speaking of Sloan's death, Rhimes said it was the [...] "most tragic", adding that [...] "he's <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the show". Rhimes wrote that anything other than the character dying would entail him leaving his daughter behind, something the writers did not want. However, she noted that the writing team considered having him move to Los Angeles to be with Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) after her departure from Private Practice, but they feared it would have given the impression that his love confession for Lexie Grey was forgotten.|$|E
500|$|The larger north {{building}} was built without deep foundation trenches, but was nevertheless a solid, well-built flint and mortar construction. The building had [...] "substantial {{time and money}} spent on it" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the principal archaeologist. The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose, and the internal corners were decorated with limestone blocks set as quoins. Seashells were recovered, with a distribution suggesting that they were once <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the building as galleting (strengthening for the mortar). [...] There were entrances in the west and northeast walls, and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls. The floor was compacted soil, and the original roof material is unknown, but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and Flemish pantiles of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher-status appearance. There was no internal wall at this date, but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner.|$|E
500|$|In 1882 the Moore Street Market and Dublin City Improvement Act {{was passed}} by the Westminster parliament, {{overriding}} the trust and giving the Corporation [...] authority to resite the Pillar, but subject to a strict timetable, within which the city authorities found it impossible to act. The Act lapsed and the Pillar remained; a similar attempt, with the same result, was made in 1891. Not all Dubliners favoured [...] demolition; some businesses considered the Pillar to be the city's focal point, and the tramway company petitioned for its retention as it marked the central tram terminus. [...] "In many ways", says Fallon, [...] "the pillar had [...] become <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the city". Kennedy writes: [...] "A familiar and very large if rather scruffy piece of the city's furniture, it was The Pillar, Dublin's Pillar rather than Nelson's Pillar... it was also an outing, an experience". [...] The Dublin sculptor John Hughes invited students at the [...] Metropolitan School of Art to [...] "admire the elegance and dignity" [...] of Kirk's statue, [...] "and the beauty of the silhouette".|$|E

500|$|The ad {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Slate {{called it}} the [...] "most striking Super Bowl ad" [...] but also criticized it for being similar in concept to a 2011 YouTube video by Farms.com. [...] While the Slate review was criticizing its originality, Farms.com released a statement reflecting their approval of the ad. [...] While liveblogging the Super Bowl commercials for the Wall Street Journal, Cindy Gallop {{referred to it as}} the [...] "Great American Super Bowl Commercial". [...] Dale Buss, of Forbes, wrote [...] "Chrysler managed to insert just enough of its vehicles and brands in each spot so as to make their inclusion seem <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the paean, not at all intrusive, thereby lending the kind of authenticity to Ram and Jeep that fuels long-term brand success". [...] The ad ranked third in the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter. Critics noted that the ad focused on the family farm despite the industrialization of agriculture in America. [...] A Latino nonprofit organization called Cuéntame uploaded a remake to its Facebook page that featured more Latinos.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to other [...] "mainstays" [...] of modern-day youth, technology serves {{an important role}} in the series, specifically the Internet and Kim's gadgets, the most significant of which is a cell phone-like device known as a Kimmunicator, designed to help Kim communicate with Wade and allow her access to virtually any information she desires. McCorkle elaborated on the show's emphasis on technology: [...] "Using the Internet theme in the series became an easy launching pad partially because it is such a major <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> teen life and the interactive possibilities are endless ... It's as though we get to play James Bond's 'Q' for each episode -- the more imaginative the toy, the better." [...] Particularly desirable to younger viewers, technology allows Kim to travel around the world effortlessly and to some extent mirrors children's ability to speak to anyone anywhere in the world via the Internet. Kim's ability to travel virtually anywhere around the world within a short period of time is left largely unexplained; BuzzFeed referred to Wade as an [...] "example that sitting in front of your computer all day is actually the most powerful position to be in." [...] The fact that Wade never leaves his bedroom could potentially indicate that he suffers from agoraphobia.|$|E

[...] In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is [...] "going on all the time" [...] and that it is [...] "worrying and disturbing." [...] At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: [...] "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews." [...] In August 2014, the Hamas' spokesman in Doha said on live television that Jews use blood to make matzos.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{as to the}} {{maintenance}} of that coherency, interdependence, and systematisation of opinions and motives, which is said to make character organic, and is therefore so highly prized by some schools of thought. No doubt the loosening of this or that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> heterogeneous origin, which constitutes the character of a man or woman, tends to loosen the whole. But do not let us feed ourselves upon phrases. This organic coherency, what does it come to? It signifies in a general way, to describe it briefly, a harmony between the intellectual, the moral, and the practical parts of human nature; an undisturbed cooperation between reason, affection, and will; the reason prescribing nothing against which the affections revolt, and proscribing nothing which they crave; and the will obeying the joint impulses of these two directing forces, without liability to capricious or extravagant disturbance of their direction. Well, if the reason were perfect in information and method, and the affections faultless in their impulse, then organic unity of character would be the final consummation of all human improvement, and it would be criminal, even if it were possible, to undermine a structure of such priceless value. But short of this there can be no value in coherency and harmonious consistency as such. So long as error is an element in it, then for so long the whole product is vitiated. Undeniably and most fortunately, social virtues are found side by side with speculative mistakes and the gravest intellectual imperfections. We may apply to humanity the idea which, as Hebrew students tell us, is imputed in the Talmud to the Supreme Being. God prays, the Talmud says; and his prayer is this,--'Be it my will that my mercy overpower my justice.' And so with men, with or without their will, their mercifulness overpowers their logic. And not their mercifulness only, but all their good impulses overpower their logic. To repeat the words which I have put into the objector's mouth, we do not always work out every vicious principle to its remotest inference. What, however, is this but to say that in such cases character is saved, not by its coherency, but by the opposite; to say not that error is useful, but what is a very different thing, that its mischievousness is sometimes capable of being averted or minimised? ...|$|E
