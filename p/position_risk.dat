For most leading firms in the financial services industry, however, market forces, not minimum regulatory capital requirements, appear to play the dominant role in firms ’ capital decisions. Thus we conclude by considering measures to enhance market discipline...|$|E

We construct a model, under reasonable assumptions, with deposit insurance where banks undertake excessive risk - moral hazard risk. Empirical investigation using experimental design approach supports our moral hazard hypothesis. Our findings indicate that banks subject to the moral hazard behaviour show significant increases in foreign exchange <b>position</b> <b>risk</b> and deterioration in capital adequacy relative to their benchmark after introduction of full deposit insurance system. We relate this excessive risk-taking to the moral hazard behaviour by commercial banks. The research results indicate that complete deposit insurance system distorts the incentive structure of commercial banks and thus, prevents proper functioning of market discipline mechanism and leads to the taking excessive risk-taking. ...|$|E

This article focuses on another hazard that is commonly encountered by adolescent workers: exposure to initiation rites and pranks. It needs to be noted, however, that older workers can also be subjected to practical jokes at workplaces. Initiation rites, pranks and bullying are all forms of workplace violence. Indeed, these behavioural categories often overlap. For example, groups of workers may play 'tricks' on a new employee that escalate in intensity and severity when repeated over time and may culminate in initiation rites that involve actual physical violence. Many victims of initiation rites are young or new recruits to a workforce. (author abstract) Griffith Business School, Dept of Employment Relations and Human ResourcesNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in voting patterns and political attitudes towards redistribution are well-documented. The experimental gender literature suggests several plausible behavioral explanations behind these differences, relating to gender {{differences in}} confidence concerning future relative income <b>position,</b> <b>risk</b> aversion, and social preferences. We use data from lab experiments on preferences for redistribution conducted in the U. S. and several European countries to disentangle these potential mechanisms. We find that when choosing to redistribute income as a disinterested observer, women choose higher tax rates than men when initial income depends on performance in a task but not when it is randomly allocated. In a veil of ignorance condition with uncertainty about the income position of the decision maker, this effect is even stronger, leading to a 10 ppt gender difference in average chosen tax rates in the performance conditions. We find that this gender difference is mainly due to men being more (over) confident about their task performance and the resulting income position, with {{gender differences in}} risk aversion and social preferences playing a minor role...|$|E

Degree of ADD was detected {{and its relationship to}} joint effusion, retrodiscal layer integrity, thickness of lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) attachments, degenerative changes and condylar position and translation as well as clinical manifestations was studied. Results: Compared with normal disc <b>position,</b> <b>risk</b> of joint effusion and degenerative changes were significantly increased with increased degree of ADD (p <  0. 05).

In cases when liquidity of instruments on financial markets is low, banks should consider also the third (skewness) and the fourth (kurtosis) moment of a yield probability distribution.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} deposit insurance system on the financial performance of Turkish commercial banks using experimental design approach. The research findings provide support to moral-hazard hypothesis. My findings indicate that domestic private commercial banks show significant increases in credit risk, foreign exchange <b>position</b> <b>risk,</b> liquidity risk, and agency costs relative to their benchmark after introduction of 100 percent deposit insurance system. I relate this excessive risk-taking to the moral-hazard behavior by commercial banks. The smaller commercial banks which are more vulnerable to moral-hazard problem experience significant increases in agency costs. The research results indicate that 100 percent deposit insurance system distorts the incentive structure of commercial banks and thus, prevent proper functioning of market discipline mechanism and lead to the taking excessive risk-taking. I also analyze the efficiency of market discipline mechanism by examining market reaction to the four failed banks transferred to SDIF. The research findings show that the cumulative abnormal returns of failed banks reflected unfavorable information 45 weeks prior {{to the beginning of}} the bank examination and 65 weeks prior to the transfer of the failed bank to SDIF.

AimsThe aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of the anterior-posterior electrode position on the success of electrical cardioversion in patients undergoing external electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. MethodsPubmed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for randomized controlled trials. The effect of the anterior-posterior electrode position on cardioversion success is presented as a risk ratio with 95 % confidence interval. ResultsTen trials with 1281  patients were included in the analysis. The anterior-posterior electrode position had no advantages in terms of success of electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation compared with the anterior-lateral electrode <b>position</b> (<b>risk</b> ratio 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval 0. 96 – 1. 09; P= 0. 50). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a left atrium diameter≤ 45 mm and lone atrial fibrillation might derive benefits from the anterior-posterior electrode position in terms of success of cardioversion. No evidence of publication bias was detected. ConclusionsThe present analysis suggests that only patients with a left atrium diameter≤ 45 mm and lone atrial fibrillation might derive benefits from the anterior-posterior electrode position compared with the anterior-lateral electrode position during external electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. However, there was insufficient evidence to support any advantages for the anterior-posterior electrode position in other situations...|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{companies}} are operating in more globally and complex environments, {{the need for}} risk control is accelerating. In an ever-changing environment, companies cannot merely focus on traditional risks, which include financial and insurable risks.

Purpose: The purpose is to describe and <b>position</b> <b>risk</b> management for Telecom operators, {{in comparison with the}} risk management literature, with regards to structure, processes, learning process, visions and benefits. In addition, our aim is to link risk management perspectives with the different strategies for knowledge management. Method: The approach taken is a hermeneutic case study, in which a total of 13 in-depth interviews with three different Telecom operators have been carried out. Results: The main findings are that the Telecom operators have developed their risk management to the business risk management perspective. There are some indications however that the {{companies are}} focusing on widening their risk management to the Enterprise-Wide perspective. The degree of the environments complexity, in which companies are operating, is determining the need for different risk management perspectives. To maintain their competitiveness in a highly complex environment a wider risk management perspective is needed. This includes operational and strategic risks, which are non-quantifiable. Therefore the personalization strategy is to recommend for achieving an effective risk management. A less complex environment, on the other hand, can mainly focus on the traditional risks. These risks are quantifiable, and therefore the codification strategy is to prefer...|$|E

Analyses are based on data from a cohort of working Scottish women recruited between 1970 and 1973. Five socioeconomic measures were explored in relation to diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), amount of recreational exercise taken, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. in general, for each of the five measures of socioeconomic position, there were significant differences in {{at least one of the}} age-adjusted physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease (diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, body mass index, FEV 1). There were also significant differences in the percentage of current cigarette smokers according to different measures of socioeconomic position. although this: was not the case for the other behavioural risk factors for cardiovascular disease (amount of recreational exercise taken, and alcohol consumption). Measures of socioeconomic position were also examined in relation to cause of death for the women who died before 1 January 1999. After adjusting for age and risk factors. a composite measure of lifetime socioeconomic experience was a more potent predictor of all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease than other measures of socioeconomic position. It therefore seems that conventional measures of socioeconomic position, estimated at one point in time, do not adequately capture the effects of socioeconomic circumstances on the risk of mortality among employed women. Thus, a broader range of explanatory factors for mortality differentials than currently exists must be considered, and must include consideration of Factors operating throughout the lifecourse...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{caesarean}} section mothers {{can be in}} different positions. Theatre tables could be tilted laterally, upwards, downwards or flexed and wedges or cushions could be used. There is no consensus on the best positioning at present. OBJECTIVES: We assessed all available data on positioning of the mother {{to determine if there}} is an ideal position during {{caesarean section}} that would improve outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (September 2009), PubMed (1966 to 14 September 2009) and manually searched the references of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of woman undergoing caesarean section comparing different positions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 studies with a total of 683 woman included. We included nine studies and excluded eight studies. Included trials were of variably quality with small sample sizes. Most comparisons had data from single trials. This is a shortcoming and applicability of results is limited. The incidence of air embolism was not affected by head up versus horizontal <b>position</b> (<b>risk</b> ratio (RR) 0. 91; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 65 to 1. 26). We found no change in hypotensive episodes when comparing left lateral tilt (RR 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 01 to 1. 94), right lateral tilt (RR 1. 25; 95 % CI 0. 39 to 3. 99) and head down tilt (mean difference (MD) - 3. 00; 95 % CI - 8. 38 to 2. 38) with horizontal positions or full lateral tilt with 15 -degree tilt (RR 1. 20; 95 % CI 0. 80 to 1. 79). Hypotensive episodes were decreased with manual displacers (RR 0. 11; 95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 45), a right lumbar wedge compared to a right pelvic wedge (RR 1. 64; 95 % CI 1. 07 to 2. 53) and increased in right lateral tilt (RR 3. 30; 95 % CI 1. 20 to 9. 08) versus left lateral tilt. Position did not affect systolic blood pressure when comparing left lateral tilt (MD 2. 70; 95 % CI - 1. 47 to 6. 87) or head down tilt (RR 1. 07; 95 % CI 0. 81 to 1. 42) to horizontal positions, or full lateral tilt with 15 -degree tilt (MD - 5. 00; 95 % CI - 11. 45 to 1. 45). Manual displacers showed decreased fall in mean systolic blood pressure compared to left lateral tilt (MD - 8. 80; 95 % CI - 13. 08 to - 4. 52). Position did not affect diastolic blood pressures when comparing left lateral tilt versus horizontal positions. (MD- 1. 90; 95 % CI - 5. 28 to 1. 48). The mean diastolic pressure was lower in head down tilt (MD - 7. 00; 95 % CI - 12. 05 to - 1. 95) when compared to horizontal positions. There were no statistically significant changes in maternal pulse rate, five-minute Apgars, maternal blood pH or cord blood pH when comparing different positions.
