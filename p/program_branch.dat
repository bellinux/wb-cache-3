40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Release-recapture studies {{represent}} an important branch of population analysis {{and are the}} primary method used to investigate population survival and migration. As researchers seek to answer more detailed questions about the populations under study, and as the study designs themselves become increasingly complex, the models necessary to estimate survival and migration parameters must increase in complexity as well. Multi-state models are widely {{used for this purpose}} since they can accommodate multidimensional study designs and have a flexible parameterization. Model specification of a multi-state model for a complex release-recapture study design is far from trivial, and requires a thorough statistical understanding of these types of models. Additionally, multi-state models require specification of all possible capture histories for the study design in question. This task can be daunting when done manually as possible capture histories for some release-recapture studies can number in the tens of thousands. This thesis describes the creation and implementation of a computer program (<b>Program</b> <b>BRANCH)</b> capable of multi-state model specification and parameter estimation for complex release-recapture studies. The program is divided into three main elements: (1) Allow the user to draw a study design diagram on the screen as input, specifying releases and recapture opportunities and the structure of survival and migration routes through the study, (2) translate the study design diagram into a multi-state model specified by a product-multinomial conditional likelihood equation, and (3) provide estimates and standard errors for biologically meaningful migration and survival parameters from study data. The construction of <b>Program</b> <b>BRANCH</b> is developed from digraph and maximum likelihood theory and is illustrated using five diverse release-recapture studies as test cases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper explores using {{information}} about <b>program</b> <b>branch</b> probabilities to optimise reconfigurable designs. The basic premise {{is to promote}} utilization by dedicating more resources to branches which execute more frequently. A hardware compilation system has been developed for producing designs which are optimised for different branch probabilities. We propose an analytical queueing network performance model {{to determine the best}} design from observed branch probability information. The branch optimisation space is characterized in an experimental study for Xilinx Virtex FPGAs of two complex applications: video feature extraction and progressive refinement radiosity. For designs of equal performance, branch-optimised designs require 24 % and 27. 5 % less area. For designs of equal area, branch optimised designs run upto 3 times faster.
