40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>periodical</b> <b>statements</b> of crisis of social {{sciences}} proved constantly to be new turns and vistas revealing each time untapped resources of sociology. The essence of modern claims sociologists agree with is in evident weakening of refe rentiality — sociology is losing the contact with “society”, with that which constituted it both as a science and as a special intellectual practice. This fact seems to prejudice the very ability to be a “modern science about modern society”. The authors believe that the paradox of the current situation lies in the parallel existence both of uncertainty about the key point of the discipline and concern about adequacy of methods, as well as in quite convincing experience of combining tradition and innovation in the works of N. Luhmann, P. Sztompka, L. Thеvenot and L. Boltanski, J. Urry, that engenders the phenomenon of “new old sociology”. The article deals with metamorphoses of tempo rality the social disciplines are concerned with when describing local and extremely wide spaces of human coexistence...|$|R
50|$|Bunge & Born's near-monopoly on {{cereal and}} flour exports ended with populist President Juan Perón's 1946 {{establishment}} of the IAPI, a state agricultural purchasing and export agent. The company responded by extending its reach into the country fast-growing retail processed foods market, and though its prominence as the nation's chief exporter was partly restored by Perón's 1955 ousting and the IAPI's liquidation, its focus remained domestic {{over the next three}} decades. A privately held company, Bunge & Born did not release <b>periodical</b> financial <b>statements,</b> though it did report US$2bn in gross receipts in 1962; by then it had become a leader in commodity futures trading, operating 110 offices worldwide.|$|R

He fell out with Bradbury and Evans, his publishers, because they refused to publish his statement in Punch as they thought it unsuitable for a humorous <b>periodical.</b> Another public <b>statement</b> appeared in the New York Tribune, which later {{found its way into}} several British newspapers. In this statement Dickens declared that it had been only Georgina Hogarth who had held the family together for some time: ...|$|R
5000|$|In the meantime, a very un-vocal group {{continued}} then as {{they had}} historically, to believe that Mrs. Eddy was, in some way, related to Biblical prophecy. Adherents of this view for their part held that rather than any mortal [...] "being" [...] the Woman of the Apocalypse, that Mrs. Eddy typified that woman, {{that she was a}} type for, in Knapp's term, the [...] "Woman of Prophecy". This group, some members of whom are {{on the outside of the}} church organization, continues to point out that there has been no unanimity of opinion on this issue over the years and points to a whole body of published church articles in its <b>periodicals,</b> a <b>statement</b> by the Church's Board of Directors in 1943, and private unpublished letters, and writings that lend credence to the view that Mrs. Eddy has a place in Biblical prophecy. Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, the notion of Mary Baker Eddy as somehow related to the Woman of Prophecy was decidedly the minority opinion.|$|R

Assistant general manager (QC) is also posted {{who is looking}} after the QC work. Under Area Manager control there are Managers to deal with each and every section viz., sales, contracts,sl-tl, movement, establishment, quality control, operational accounts etc., who consolidate the field level operations and through the area managers' authorisation, they transmit the necessary information and <b>periodical</b> <b>statements</b> to regional offices of their respective regions. Regional offices are headed by a general manager, who is {{in most of the}} cases from Indian Revenue Service, Indian Administrative Service /All India Services under deputation. Under his control Deputy General Managers who are FCI's officers co-ordinate with daily operations through the Assistant General Managers who were posted in various sections to oversee the functions of district offices units of their particular section. All these officers appraise the general manager periodically on various issues pertaining to district offices of that particular region. FCI has been divided into 5 zones viz. North, South, East, West & North-East with a Zonal Office in each zone. Each zone is further divided into regions with a regional office in one region. All the Regional Offices are under the control of Zonal Offices which are headed by an Executive Director, who in most of the cases is from Indian Administrative Service or Indian Revenue Service under deputation. Under his control three or more than three General Managers co-ordinate with all Regional Offices of their particular zone through subordinate officers like Deputy General Managers and Assistant General Managers dealing with their allotted operational sections in their zone. All the Zonal Offices are under the control of Headquarters, located at New Delhi, which is headed by chairman and managing director, who is an Indian Administrative Officer of Secretary rank on Central Deputation. Headquarters instruct, communicate, consolidate and refine the voluminous information required for the streamlined execution of day-to-day operations and coordinates with Ministry of Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution and Food Secretary and various sister corporations like Central Warehousing Corporation, Indian Railways in formulating food policy or amending the existing policy to suit the emerging challenges in managing Food Security scenario of the nation.|$|R
40|$|Shortly after Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany, Christian and Jewish Americans {{initiated}} an argument that held Nazi anti-Semitism did violence to their democratic freedoms. They observed the scapegoating of Jews, the hallmark feature of German fascism, indicated a pervasive hostility toward the civil liberties outlined in the U. S. Constitution. Publicly contesting Nazi anti-Semitism became a recurring topic in public discourse. Politicians used the reports of Jewish persecutions to differentiate between fascist and democratic values. Social commentators and artists saw in the issue a path for softening sociocultural attitudes domestically. As members of the Christian majority learned more about Hitler's wide-ranging intolerance, some concluded that tolerating similar domestic prejudices was harmful to society. Rejecting Nazism [...] -and, specifically, its negative portrayal of Jews [...] -became {{part of a much}} larger reconfiguration in mainstream American attitudes. Evidence that citizens, both private and public, opposed Nazi anti-Semitism appeared in <b>periodicals,</b> political <b>statements,</b> plays, motion pictures, novels, private correspondences, and government publications. The common thread binding these texts together was the expression of hostility toward Nazi religious intolerance. Although for some Americans, negative sentiments toward ethnic, racial, and religious minorities undoubtedly persisted, there is a larger story involving the ways both Jews and Christians used the issue of Nazi intolerance toward religious minorities as a tool for promoting a more pluralist worldview.

40|$|While the {{aviation}} industry has grown {{dramatically in the}} past 100 years, it has done so with minimal environmental awareness. Leaders in the industry must become more conscious of environmentally-friendly practices available for airport use. This research provides a discussion of technology and sustainable practices available for use at U. S. airports. This research also provides funding information available to airports for sustainable projects. The methodology used in this research study was a review of literature that examined environmental reports, federal regulations, <b>periodicals,</b> political <b>statements,</b> and professional articles related to the topic. Environmental sustainability and climate change {{as it relates to}} airport sustainability is also defined. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues operating certificates and provides regulatory oversight for all Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 139 airports. FAR Part 139 certificated airports are the largest and busiest air carrier service airports in the United States. Several industry leading airports recognize the need to pursue environmental conservation initiatives, and are doing so on a voluntary basis. These environmental initiatives include the utilization of alternative energy, sustainable building design, retrofitting energy efficient technology to existing facilities, water conservation, recycling programs, and construction waste management. Motivators, priorities, and barriers to airport sustainable practices are identified to provide insight to current and future environmental trends at airports. The results of this research study identify a need for official publications that can be utilized by airports wishing to invest in sustainable initiatives. Further research is necessary by the federal government to create a user-friendly guide for airport sustainability that can be utilized by large and small airports alike...|$|R

40|$|The Popular Front line {{made the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) a more hospitable place for ‘brain workers’. The {{emphasis}} the line placed on mass ideological and cultural struggle against fascism {{meant that they}} became important allies to be won for the working class. As the principal transmitters of ideology and culture to the masses, schoolteachers could be perceived as being {{at the forefront of}} the anti-fascist effort, just as important as the academics, artists, writers and musicians more traditionally associated with the pull of British communism in this period. But communist schoolteachers on the whole avoided the exploration of socialist ideas in their professional practice. Rather, their primary focus was on achieving the greatest possible unity against fascism in their profession. This stance largely excluded critical discussion of the theory or practice of the education of children under capitalism, such as combating imperialist bias in textbooks; ending corporal punishment; advocating secular education; promoting workers’ control of schools and ameliorating the capitalistic nature of competitive examinations, all of which had been debated by communist teachers at various points during the 1920 s. But as well as the tactical considerations of the Popular Front line, this avoidance of a qualitative critique of British schooling was encouraged by Soviet educational conservatism, and often overlooked continuities between the Popular Front line and its predecessor, ‘Class Against Class’. Drawing on the personal papers of British communist schoolteachers, contemporary newspapers and <b>periodicals,</b> and policy <b>statements</b> of the CPGB in the period, this article seeks to shed light upon the communist contribution to the teacher politics of the labour movement in England and Wales during the late 1930 s, an input hitherto unexplored in detail...|$|R
