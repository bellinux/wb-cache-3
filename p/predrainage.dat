40|$|The seams being mined in the Karaganda {{coalfield}} in Kazakhstan {{are very}} gassy and have low permeability, so called tight coals. In addition, the coalfield is dry, {{which means that}} 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 <b>predrainage,</b> through a two phase gas liberation process, by first dewatering, is not possible. Outbursts in development particularly in the D 6 seam are still a major concern and technologies to allow better prediction of geological anomalies are being tried. Managing gas levels during the longwall extraction calls for special applications to be adopted. These have resulted in improved volumetric underground gas capture and purity, which allows the resultant drained gas to be utilised for local power generation. The methods developed and those foreseen {{in the future to}} achieve more effective <b>predrainage</b> and more effective operational gas management are described...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Biliary {{obstruction}} {{changes the}} spectrum of lipoproteins, which are now known to bind and neutralize endotoxin. Postoperative septic complications related to an increased susceptibility to endotoxin occur frequently in patients with obstructive jaundice. The effect of preoperative biliary drainage on changes in the lipoprotein spectrum {{and its relation to}} endotoxin sensitivity was studied. METHODS: Abnormalities in the lipoprotein spectrum were assessed in 15 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice before and 3 weeks after endoscopic biliary drainage. Changes in endotoxin responsiveness were assessed by using endotoxin-neutralizing reagents (anti-CD 14 monoclonal antibody, polymyxin B, and recombinant bactericidal permeability increasing protein) to block cytokine production in whole blood cell cultures that were stimulated by cholestatic plasma taken before and after drainage. RESULTS: Drainage normalized very-low-density, low-density, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fractions from, respectively, 43 % to 19 %, 50 % to 65 %, and 6 % to 16 % (P <. 01). Ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with <b>predrainage</b> cholestatic plasma was 20 -fold higher (P <. 001) than with postdrainage plasma. Blocking the endotoxin response during the stimulation with <b>predrainage</b> cholestatic plasma with anti-CD 14 monoclonal antibody, polymyxin B or recombinant bactericidal permeability increasing protein resulted in attenuation of the inflammatory response, reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels at least 5 -fold. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative biliary drainage normalizes the changed lipid profile and the endotoxin-stimulating capacity of cholestatic plasma, and this signifies a change in sensitivity to endotoxi...|$|E
40|$|Tahmoor Colliery mines the Bulli Seam at a {{depth of}} 400 - 440 m and has had to manage the risk of outbursts since it {{commenced}} production in the early 1980 ’s. Of necessity, it has {{been at the forefront of}} the development of systems to reduce outburst risks and has made many significant contributions to the industry in this regard. In the 1980 ’s, the general strategy for addressing these risks was that outbursts were “inevitable” and so most effort went into protection against their consequences. By the 1990 ’s, this approach was no longer acceptable and there was a major redirection of effort towards the prevention of outbursts. This effort has been highly successful and there has not been an outburst at Tahmoor since 1992, when <b>predrainage</b> of development commenced. Prior to 1992, outbursts were occurring at an average rate of about 10 per year...|$|E
40|$|The current {{trend in}} Australian {{longwall}} mines {{is to increase}} panel dimensions and production rate, and mining in gassy regions. However, this trend poses a challenge to provide adequate ventilation to manage gas emissions. While the traditional two heading gateroad bleederless U ventilation circuit, {{which is the most}} commonly used circuit in Australia, is no longer suitable due to its low volumetric capacity, a few mines manage to overcome this problem by employing a three heading gateroad ventilation circuit. However, this circuit requires significant additional development, which makes it not popular in Australian coal mines. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the suitability of two heading and three heading gateroad traditional bleederless U ventilation circuits for a large longwall panel mining in gassy conditions. It was found that significant <b>predrainage</b> of the thickest roof seam is required in order to make the two heading gateroad circuit feasible in large and gassy longwall panels.

40|$|The Florida Everglades is a {{patterned}} peatland {{formed from}} sawgrass and other aquatic plant material that has accumulated over millennia. This peatland was initially drained {{in the late}} 1800 s for agricultural and urban development and has been highly modified by the construction of canals and levées. Restoration plans include providing additional surface water flow which should help to prevent further peat loss by oxidation and encourage the accretion of peat that has been lost through drainage and peat fires. But how much peat has been lost? We know that about 50 % of the original surface area is gone; {{but what about the}} driver of ecological processes, the soil? Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, we compared <b>predrainage</b> and current peat volumes using historical and recent datasets, spatially-referenced soil bulk density values and carbon content to determine peat mass and carbon mass for each Everglades region. Given the uncertainties in the datasets, this analysis should be viewed as providing rough order-of-magnitude values. Our calculations indicate that the current Everglades contains less than 24 % of the original peat volume, 17 % of its mass and 19 % of its carbon...|$|E
40|$|Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve (NNR) in Cambridgeshire, U. K. is a wetland of {{international}} importance isolated {{in a landscape}} dominated by arable farming. The prospect of species extinctions within the NNR {{led to the creation of}} the Wicken Fen Vision, an ambitious project that will eventually expand the reserve boundary by the purchase and restoration of c. 50 km 2 of arable land. We sampled three fields from each of three distinct age-categories of restoration land (5, 15, and 60 years post-arable), and three fields within the adjacent, undrained NNR, to determine (1) differences in seed bank composition across age-categories, (2) relationships between restoration age, the seed bank and standing vegetation, and (3) changes in species traits across age-categories. Historic arable management contributed to an apparent “vertical mixing” effect in the seed bank of the youngest two age-categories, with associated and significant differences in species functional traits across the study area. Almost all plants associated with NNR vegetation were absent from restoration area seed banks and standing vegetation. Seed bank species common to all ages-categories exhibited a bias toward moderate to high Ellenberg F (moisture) values, persistent seed banks, and lateral vegetative spread. Relatively short (c. 6 years) periods of drainage and plowing impact heavily upon seed bank diversity and soils, resulting in a lack of <b>predrainage</b> vegetation, even after decades of subsequent restoration adjacent to intact, species-rich habitat. However, the seed banks of highly degraded fields can contribute toward the creation of novel wetland vegetation assemblages over time and under suitable environmental conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Preoperative biliary {{drainage}} {{is often}} initiated with {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) in patients with potentially resectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC), but additional percutaneous transhepatic catheter (PTC) drainage is frequently required. This study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model to identify patients with {{a high risk of}} inadequate ERCP drainage. Patients with potentially resectable PHC and (attempted) preoperative ERCP drainage were included from two specialty center cohorts between 2001 and 2013. Indications for additional PTC drainage were failure to place an endoscopic stent, failure to relieve jaundice, cholangitis, or insufficient drainage of the future liver remnant. A prediction model was derived from the European cohort and externally validated in the USA cohort. Of the 288 patients, 108 (38 %) required additional preoperative PTC drainage after inadequate ERCP drainage. Independent risk factors for additional PTC drainage were proximal biliary obstruction on preoperative imaging (Bismuth 3 or 4) and <b>predrainage</b> total bilirubin level. The prediction model identified three subgroups: patients with low risk (7 %), moderate risk (40 %), and high risk (62 %). The high-risk group consisted of patients with a total bilirubin level above 150 µmol/L and Bismuth 3 a or 4 tumors, who typically require preoperative drainage of the angulated left bile ducts. The prediction model had good discrimination (area under the curve 0. 74) and adequate calibration in the external validation cohort. Selected patients with potentially resectable PHC have a high risk (62 %) of inadequate preoperative ERCP drainage requiring additional PTC drainage. These patients might do better with initial PTC drainage instead of ERC...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a {{prominent}} role in the Federal Government’s comprehensive restoration plan for the south Florida ecosystem encompassing the Everglade-e largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States. USGS scientists, in collaboration with researchers from the National Park Service (NPS), other governmental agencies, and academia, are providing scientific information to land and resource managers for planning, executing, and evaluating restoration actions. One major thrust of the restoration effort is to restore the natural functioning of the ecosystem to <b>predrainage</b> conditions, an objective that requires knowledge of the hydrologic and hydraulic factors that affect the flow of water. A vast network of interlaced canals, rimmed with levees and fitted with hydraulic control structures, and highways, built on elevated embankments lined by borrow ditches and undercut by culverts, now act to control and direct the flow of water through the shallow low-gradient wetlands. As water flows south from Lake Okeechobee past the city of Miami and through Everglades National Park (ENP), it is diminished by canal diversions, augmented by seasonably variable precipitation, and depleted through evapotranspiration. Along its path, the shallow flowing water, referred to as sheet flow, interacts with surticial aquifers and is subject to the resistance effects of variably dense vegetation and forcing effects of winds. New scientific investigations are providing additional insight into the hydrologic and hydraulic processes governing the flow, and recent data-collection efforts are supplying more comprehensive data describing the flow behavior, both of which are benefiting development of improved numerical models to evaluate and restore the natural functioning of the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} colonially nesting herons, egrets, ibises, storks and spoonbills {{were one of}} the {{defining}} natural phenomena of the historical Everglades. Reproduction of these species has been tracked over at least a century, and some clear responses to dramatic anthropogenic hydrological alterations have been established. These include a marked decline in nesting populations of several species, and a movement of colonies away from the over-drained estuarine region. Ponding in {{a large portion of the}} freshwater marsh has favored species that hunt by sight in deep water (egrets, cf. 25 – 45 cm), while tactile feeders (ibises and storks) that depend on concentrated prey in shallow water (5 – 25 cm) have become proportionately much less common. There has been a marked increase in the interval between exceptionally large breeding aggregations of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus). Loss of short hydroperiod wetlands on the margins of the Everglades have delayed nest initiations 1 – 2 months by Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) resulting in poor nesting success. These responses are consistent with mechanisms that involve foraging, and the availability and production of prey animals, and each of the relationships is highly dependent on hydrology. Here, we define a group of characteristics about wading bird dynamics (= indicators) that collectively track the specific ecological relationships that supported ibises and storks in the past. We suggest four metrics as indicators of restoration success: timing of nesting by storks, the ratio of nesting ibises + storks to Great Egrets, the proportion of all nests located in the estuarine/freshwater ecotone, and the interval between years with exceptionally large ibis nestings. Each of these metrics has historical (e. g., <b>predrainage)</b> data upon which to base expectations for restoration, and the metrics have little measurement error relative to the large annual variation in numbers of nests. In addition to the strong scientific basis for the use of these indicators, wading birds are also a powerful tool for public communication because they have strong aesthetic appeal, and their ecological relationships with water are intuitively understandable. In the interests of communicating with the public and decision-makers, we integrate these metrics into a single-page annual “traffic-light” report card for wading bird responses. Collectively, we believe these metrics offer an excellent chance of detecting restoration of the ecosystem functions that supported historical wading bird nesting patterns...|$|E
