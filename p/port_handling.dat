5|$|Two {{inland ports}} on rivers serve Oklahoma: the Port of Muskogee and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. The state's only <b>port</b> <b>handling</b> {{international}} cargo, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa {{is the most}} inland ocean-going port {{in the nation and}} ships over two million tons of cargo each year. Both ports are on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which connects barge traffic from Tulsa and Muskogee to the Mississippi River via the Verdigris and Arkansas rivers, contributing to one of the busiest waterways in the world.|$|E
5|$|The port {{developed}} in the 11th century around {{the confluence of the}} Rivers Frome and Avon, adjacent to Bristol Bridge just outside the town walls. By the 12th century Bristol was an important <b>port,</b> <b>handling</b> much of England's trade with Ireland, including slaves. The stone bridge built in 1247 was replaced by the current bridge during the 1760s. The town incorporated neighbouring suburbs and became a county in 1373, the first town in England to be given this status. During this period, Bristol became a shipbuilding and manufacturing centre. By the 14th century Bristol, York and Norwich were England's largest medieval towns after London. One-third to one-half of the population died in the Black Death of 1348–49, which checked population growth, and its population remained between 10,000 and 12,000 for most of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a {{commercial}} shipping <b>port,</b> <b>handling</b> imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic). The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 the <b>port</b> <b>handled</b> 79.4 {{million tonnes}}, up 4% from 76.5 million tonnes in 2005. In 2005 the <b>port</b> <b>handled</b> 1.7 million total containers, 910,172 cruise passengers, and 105,246 foreign vessels.|$|R

Prior to decommissioning, HMS Grafton was a regular visitor to the port and has special links with the town and the county of Suffolk. HMS Orwell, named after the river, is also closely linked with Ipswich.|$|E
25|$|Visited by around 1,600 {{commercial}} vessels a year, Auckland is New Zealand's largest commercial <b>port,</b> <b>handling</b> {{more than}} NZ$20 billion of goods per year, substantially exceeding that of major rival Port of Tauranga. Ports of Auckland handles {{the movement of}} 60% of New Zealand's imports and 40% of its exports (both by value, 2006), respectively 50% of the North Island's container trade, and 37% of all New Zealand's container trade (2007). It moves 4 million tonnes of 'breakbulk' cargo per year (2006), as well as around 773,160 twenty-foot equivalent containers units per year (2007).|$|E

25|$|Rotterdam has {{the largest}} port in Europe, with the rivers Meuse and Rhine {{providing}} excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland, and into France. , Rotterdam was the world's eighth largest container <b>port</b> <b>handling</b> 440.5 million metric tonnes of cargo annually. The port's main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials and between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the Betuweroute, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.|$|E
25|$|Chongqing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing or even Shanghai. In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduce or been cancelled altogether, thus most of the river ferry traffic consists of mostly leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several <b>port</b> <b>handling</b> facilities exists throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.|$|E

The draft of the Triple E class is , less than the SuezMax requirement of [...] at [...] beam. Handling equipment at ports was the main constraint on size, rather than the dimensions of canals or straits. The container <b>port</b> <b>handling</b> speed can be 29 moves per hour in Tanger-Med, or 37 in Rotterdam (215 per ship).|$|E
2500|$|The English King Henry VIII, {{angered by}} the Scots reneging on the initial agreement, made war on Scotland in 1544–1549, a period which the writer Sir Walter Scott later christened the [...] "Rough Wooing". In May 1544 an English army landed at Granton and {{captured}} Leith to land heavy artillery for an assault on Edinburgh Castle, but withdrew after burning {{the town and the}} Palace of Holyrood over three days. Three years later, following another English invasion and victory at Pinkie Cleugh in 1547, the English attempted to establish a [...] "pale" [...] within Scotland. Leith was of prime strategic importance because of its vital role as Edinburgh's <b>port,</b> <b>handling</b> its foreign trade and essential supplies. The English arrived in Leith on 11 September 1547 and camped on Leith Links. The military engineer Richard Lee scouted around the town on 12 September looking to see if it could be made defensible. On 14 September the English began digging a trench on the south-east side of Leith near the Firth of Forth. William Patten wrote that the work was done as much for exercise as for defence, since they stayed only five days.|$|E

The larger ports such as Fowey contributed vessels to the naval enterprises of the King and {{were subject to}} attack from the French in return. Bridgwater {{was part of the}} Port of Bristol until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348, covering [...] of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe. Historically, the main port on the river was at Bridgwater; the river being bridged at this point, with the first bridge being constructed in 1200. Quays were built in 1424; with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge. [...] In Bristol the port began to develop in the 11th century. By the 12th century Bristol was an important <b>port,</b> <b>handling</b> much of England's trade with Ireland. During this period Bristol also became a centre of shipbuilding and manufacturing. Bristol was the starting point for many important voyages, notably John Cabot's 1497 voyage of exploration to North America. By the 14th century Bristol was one of England's three largest medieval towns after London, along with York and Norwich, with perhaps 15,000–20,000 inhabitants {{on the eve of the}} Black Death of 1348–49.|$|E
