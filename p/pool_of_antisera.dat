A <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> was prepared, the affinity of which exceeded {{that of the}} glucagon receptors of liver cell membranes, whereas the binding capacity of the volume used amounted to {{more than one-third of}} the total glucagon content in the rat pancreas. That rapid, extensive, and lasting neutralization of glucagon had taken place after antiserum treatment was indicated by the following findings: When examined more than 1 h after the injection and after 60 min of exercise-stimulated glucagon production, all rats had excess free antibodies in plasma. The concentration of free glucagon was lowered to one-third of the concentration in control rats; at 37 °C plasma samples could bind 25 % of additional 300 pmol/liter of glucagon in 10 s, and 69 % in 120 s; the glycemic response to exogenous glucagon was abolished. Antiserum treatment, however, had no effect on blood glucose in rats fasted for 3 and 10 h, in chemically sympathectomized and adrenomedullectomized rats, and in 48 -h-fasted, acutely adrenalectomized rats. The antiserum was found to contain 460 nmol/liter of antibody-bound glucagon, originating in the rabbit in which the antiserum was raised. However, antibody preparations from which the bound glucagon had been effectively removed were equally ineffective in lowering the basal blood glucose in rats, although in three-fourths of the rats the concentration of free glucagon was lowered beyond detection limit...|$|E
40|$|The capsular {{polysaccharide}} of group B Neisseria meningitidis {{is composed of}} a linear homopolymer of α(2 - 8) N-acetyl neuraminic acid or polysialic acid (PSA) that is also carried by isoforms of the mammalian neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which is especially expressed on brain cells during development. Here we analyzed the ability of antibodies induced by the candidate vaccine N-propionyl polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate to recognize PSA-NCAM. We hyperimmunized mice to produce a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> {{and a series of}} immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibodies and evaluated their self-reactivity profile by using a battery of tests (immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence detection on live cells and human tissue sections) chosen for their sensitivity and specificity to detect PSA-NCAM in various environments. We also searched for the effects of the vaccine-induced antibodies in two functional assays involving cell lysis or cell migration. Although they were highly bactericidal, all the antibodies tested showed very low or no recognition of PSA-NCAM, in contrast to PSA-specific monoclonal antibodies used as controls. Different patterns of cross-reactions were revealed by the tests used, likely due to affinity and specificity differences among the populations of induced antibodies. Furthermore, neither cell lysis nor perturbation of migration was observed {{in the presence of the}} tested antibodies. Importantly, we showed that whereas enzymatic removal of PSA groups from the surfaces of live cells perturbed their migration, blocking them with PSA-specific antibodies was not functionally detrimental.

40|$|Leptospira interrogans is a {{mammalian}} pathogen {{which must}} {{adapt to a}} range of new environmental conditions including temperature change when it infects new hosts. In vitro studies of organisms cultured at 30 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 5 to 7 days have confirmed that synthesis of several proteins involved in equine infection is regulated in response to temperature change (J. E. Nally, J. F. Timoney, and B. Stevenson, Infect. Immun. 69 : 400 – 404, 2001). In order to specifically identify antigenic proteins upregulated at 37 °C, groups of three ponies were immunized with organisms shifted to 37 °C for 5 to 7 days or with organisms maintained at 30 °C. A lambda ZAP II genomic DNA library was screened with the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> to organisms shifted to 37 °C. Clones reactive with this pool but unreactive with the pool of pony antisera to organisms cultured at 30 °C were selected for further analysis. Sequence analysis of the first two clones identified open reading frames for proteins designated Qlp 42 and Hsp 15. Qlp 42 is predicted to be an outer membrane lipoprotein. Its synthesis was upregulated when cultures were shifted from 30 to 37 °C and downregulated when cultures were shifted from 37 to 30 °C. Although the predicted molecular mass of Qlp 42 is 39. 8 kDa for the mature protein, Qlp 42 -specific equine antiserum was reactive with two bands of 30 and 29. 5 kDa. Hsp 15 is a stress response protein {{and a member of the}} Hsp 20 /α-crystallin family. PCR detected homologues of qlp 42 and hsp 15 in pathogenic serovars of L. interrogans but not in the nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa.

40|$|The male-enhanced antigen gene (Mea) was {{previously}} isolated from a mouse testicular cDNA library {{by using a}} <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>antisera</b> against the serological H-Y antigen. The present studies characterize the human and mouse cDNAs and indicate that the MEA gene is conserved at both nucleic acid and protein levels. The corresponding mRNA encodes proteins of 18 - 20 kDa. The phylogenetic conservation could be extended to other mammalian species by Southern blot analysis. Although the Mea gene was transcribed as a 1 -kilobase mRNA in most tissues, it was expressed {{at the highest level}} in adult testis. The testis-enhanced expression of the Mea gene was associated with germ cell development at late stages of spermatogenesis. Chromosome walking experiments identified two linked genes, A and B, located within 38 kilobases of human genomic sequence. Like the MEA gene, genes A and B were coordinately transcribed in the testis, which suggests that MEA and genes A and B are members of a gene family. In situ hybridization studies localized the MEA gene to the short arm of human chromosome 6 at band p 21. 1 - 21. 3, close to the major histocompatibility complex locus.

Each of the rabbits received 20 - 30 mu g oi the purified receptor in Freund's complete adjuvant at a time. Primary immunization was followed by booster injection at intervals. Production of receptor antibodies was monitored by (1) determining the dilution of the serum (IgG fraction) that could specifically bind 50 % of I- 125 -LH/CG-R added and (2) analysing sera for any chance in testosterone levels. Following primary immunization and the first booster, all three rabbits exhibited a 2. 5 - to 6. 0 -fold increase in serum testosterone over basal levels and this effect was spread {{over a period of}} time (similar to 40 days) coinciding with the rise and fall of receptor antibodies. The maximal antibody titre (ED(50)) produced at this time ranged from 1 : 350 to 1 : 100 to below detectable limits for R-I, R-II and R-III respectively. Subsequent immunizations followed by the second booster resulted in a substantial increase in antibody titre (ED(50) of 1 : 5000) in R-I, but this was not accompanied by any change in serum testosterone over preimmune levels, suggesting that with the progress of immunization the character of the antibody produced had also changed. Two <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> from R-I collected 10 days following the booster (at day 70 (bleed I) and day 290 (bleed II)) were used in further experiments. IgG isolated from bleed I but not from bleed II antiserum showed a dose-dependent stimulation of testosterone production by mouse Leydig cells in vitro, thus confirming the in vivo hormone-mimicking activity antibodies generated during the early immunization phase. The IgG fractions from both bleeds were, however, capable of inhibiting (1) I- 125 -hCG binding to crude sheep luteal membrane (EC(50) of 1 : 70 and 1 : 350 for bleed I and II antisera respectively) and (2) ovine LH-stimulated testosterone production by mouse Leydig cells in vitro, indicating the presence oi antagonistic antibodies irrespective of the period of time during which the rabbits were immunized. The: fact that bleed I-stimulated testosterone production could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of IgG from bleed II to the mouse Leydig cell in vitro assay system showed that the agonistic activity is intrinsic to the bleed I antibody. The receptor antibody (bleed II) was also capable of blocking LH action in vivo, as rabbits passively (for 24 h with LH/CG-R antiserum) as well as actively (for 130 days) immunized against LH/CG-R failed to respond to a bolus injection of LH (50 mu g). At no time, however, was the serum testosterone reduced below the basal level. This study clearly shows that, unlike with LH antibody, attempts to achieve an LH deficiency effect in vivo by resorting to immunization with hole LH receptor is difficult, as receptor antibodies exhibit both hormone-mimicking (agonistic) as well as hormone-blocking (antagonistic) activities...|$|R
40|$|Human {{infection}} with Toxoplasma gondii is presumed {{due to the}} ingestion of either tissue cysts containing bradyzoites or oocyst/sporozoites that are excreted in the feces of infected cats. The incidence of human infection {{in the general population}} by either of these routes is unknown. We have previously described unique stage-specific oocyst/sporozoite antigens identified by murine hybridoma monoclonal antibodies. We obtained acute and convalescent antitoxoplasma antisera from patients in an epidemiologically well-documented outbreak of oocyst-transmitted infection associated with the ingestion of contaminated water. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay comparing equal numbers of tachyzoites (invasive stage) and oocyst/sporozoite (excreted stage) indicated that these antisera recognized antigens from both life forms. Absorption <b>of</b> <b>pooled</b> <b>antisera</b> with purified oocyst/sporozoites reduced both the antioocyst immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) titer but had only minimal effect on the antitachyzoite titer. Absorption <b>of</b> the <b>antisera</b> with tachyzoites reduced the IgG and IgM antioocyst and antitachyzoite titer. A sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of radioiodinated oocyst/sporozoites shows that the principal stage-specific surface proteins of the oocyst/sporozoite have approximate Mr of 67, 000 and 25, 000. Periodic acid and silver stain of purified oocyst/sporozoite identified bands of similar molecular weight not present in the tachyzoite preparation. Western blot analysis of purified parasites assayed with human antioocyst antisera identified specific oocyst/sporozoite antigens not present on the tachyzoites. At least two major stage-specific oocyst/sporozoite antigens of approximate Mr of 67, 000 and 190, 000 were identified by the infected patients' antisera and not by the normal controls. Reaction to these oocyst/sporozoite antigens was seen primarily in the IgM fraction of the acute phase and the IgG fraction <b>of</b> convalescent phase <b>antisera.</b> Neither absorption <b>of</b> the <b>antisera</b> with tachyzoites nor periodate treatment of the oocyst/sporozoites reduced the antibody recognition of these stage-specific antigens.

This inhibition was reversed by {{the incorporation of}} 10 (- 8) - 10 (- 7) M 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl- ε-amino-n-caproic acid (TNP-EACA) into the agar during the PFC assay. The factor responsible for the hapten-reversible PFC inhibition was removed from serum by passage through an anti-immunoglobulin column or through a 2, 4,-dinitrophenyl-human-serum-albumin-bromoacetylcellulose plus anti-TNP- antibody column, but not by DNP-HSA-BAC alone. It was concluded that this immunoglobulin-like substance, lacking anti-TNP activity but reacting with anti-TNP antibody of AKR/J origin, was most likely an auto-anti-idiotypie antibody that had been produced during {{the normal course of}} the response of AKR/J mice to TNP-F. <b>Pools</b> <b>of</b> anti-idiotypic-antibody-containing <b>antisera</b> inhibited anti-TNP plaque formation to varying degrees when tested on d- 4 PFC from different mice of the same inbred strain, suggesting a variability in idiotype expression. 4 d after transfer of immune (7 d after 10 μg TNP-F, administered intravenously) AKR/J spleen cells plus 10 μg TNP-F into syngeneic mice, the number of PFC detectable in the recipients' spleens could be markedly augmented by the inclusion of TNP-EACA in the agar during the PFC assay. Incubation of spleen cells containing such hapten-augmentable PFC with TNP- EACA yielded a factor in the supernate that caused a specific, in vitro, hapten-reversible inhibition of anti-TNP PFC. Studies with immunoadsorbents indicated that this PFC-inhibiting factor was antigenically immunoglobulin- like, lacked anti-TNP-antibody activity, but reacted with anti-TNP antibody of AKR/J origin. The results are consistent with the view that this PFC inhibitor is auto-anti-idiotypic antibody that is involved in the normal regulation of the immune response. It is proposed that hapten-reversible inhibition of plaque formation can be employed as an assay for anti-idiotypic antibody and the conditions for such an assay are described. It is further proposed that the detection of hapten-augmentable PFC suggests the presence of auto-anti-idiotypic antibody...|$|R

40|$|Antisera {{were raised}} to acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from mammary glands of lactating rabbits, and cytochrome oxidase from rat liver. The enzymes were all highly purified but {{gave rise to}} multispecific antisera when tested against tissue extracts. Absorption procedures were devised to free the <b>antisera</b> <b>of</b> contaminating antibodies. <b>Antisera</b> to acetyl-CoA carboxylase and cytochrome oxidase were absorbed with fractions discarded during enzyme purification. The antiserum to 6 -phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase was absorbed with a tissue extract from an early stage in mammary-gland differentiation. Monospecific antisera are essential for enzyme turnover studies and therefore antisera should be extensively tested and absorbed before use. A general procedure for the absorption <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> to purified enzymes has been devised {{on the basis of}} accepted principles <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> absorption...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{information}} concerning secretion changes in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in humans has been gained with relatively insensitive bioassays <b>of</b> concentrates <b>of</b> <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> urine. We have developed a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for FSH that is 500 - 1000 times more sensitive than the rat ovarianweight augmentation assay and which is capable of quantifying FSH in small volumes of serum. Anti-FSH was prepared by immunizing rabbits with an impure FSH preparation. The majority <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> showed complete inability to distinguish LH, TSH, and FSH, illustrating the immunological similarities of these hormones. One antiserum was specific when used in a radioimmunoassay. Potency estimates by bioassay were in good agreement, with a single exception, with those obtained with the radioimmunoassay for 10 FSH-containing preparations. Highly purified LH gave a higher potency by immunoassay than by bioassay...|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} method of an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) is described to assess the reactivity <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> used for the identification of peptide hormone producing cells by immunocytochemistry. Compared with radioimmunoassay and immunodiffusion, the ELISA method has the advantages of simplicity and sensitivity and represents with the hormone adsorbed to a matrix a situation more or less comparable to that in tissue sections. It is concluded that specificity testing <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> applied in endocrine immunocytochemical studies can best be achieved by application of the ELISA method in combination with appropriate tissue controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{respective}} {{roles of}} neurofilaments (NFs), microtubules (MTs), and the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP 1 B and tau on neurite outgrowth and stabilization were probed by the intracellular delivery <b>of</b> specific <b>antisera</b> into transiently permeabilized NB 2 a/d 1 cells during treatment with dbcAMP. Intracellular delivery <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> specific {{for the low}} (NF-L), middle (NF-M), or extensively phosphorylated high (NF-H) molecular weight subunits did not prevent initial neurite elaboration, nor did it induce retraction of existing neurites elaborated by cells that had been previously treated for 1 d with dbcAMP. By contrast, intracellular delivery <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> directed against tubulin reduced the percentage of cells with neurites at both these time points. Intracellular delivery of anti-NF-L and anti-NF-M antisera did not induce retraction in cells treated with dbcAMP for 3 d. However, intracellular delivery <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> directed against extensively phosphorylated NF-H, MAP 1 B, tau, or tubulin induced similar levels of neurite retraction at this time. Intracellular delivery of monoclonal antibodies (RT 97 or SMI- 31) directed against phosphorylated NF-H induced neurite retraction in cell treated with dbcAMP for 3 d; a monoclonal antibody (SMI- 32) directed against nonphosphorylated NF-H did not induce neurite retraction at this time. By contrast, none <b>of</b> the above <b>antisera</b> induced retraction <b>of</b> neurites in cells treated with dbcAMP for 7 d. Neurites develop resistance to retraction by colchicine, first detectable in some neurites after 3 d and {{in the majority of}} neurites after 7 d of dbcAMP treatment. We therefore examined whether or not colchicine resistance was compromised by intracellular delivery <b>of</b> the above <b>antisera.</b> Colchicine treatment resulted in rapid neurite retraction after intracellular delivery <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> directed against extensively phosphorylated NF-H, MAP 1 B, or tau into cells that had previously been treated with dbcAMP for 7 d. By contrast, colchicine resistance was not compromised by the intracellular delivery <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> directed against NF-L, NF-M, or tubulin. These findings support previous studies indicating that MT polymerization mediates certain aspects of axonal neurite outgrowth and suggest that NFs do not directly participate in these events. These findings further suggest that NFs function in stabilization of the axonal cytoskeleton, apparently by interactions among NFs and MTs that are mediated by NF-H and MAPs...|$|R

40|$|Anfisera {{directed}} against the As 4 allotype of rabbit gamma globulin are capable of inducing blast transformation and DNA synthesis in lymphocyte cultures obtained from the peripheral blood of As 4 rabbits (1). The present study describes analogous experiments using antisera against the other five well characterised ailotypic determinants: As 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (2). In addition, the effect <b>of</b> mixtures <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> to two different allotypic determinants was compared with the effect of mixtures <b>of</b> two <b>antisera</b> to the same allotype.

40|$|Specific {{antisera}} {{directed against}} {{all six of}} the well characterised allotypic determinants of rabbit IgG (As 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are capable of inducing blast transformation and DNA synthesis when added to lymphocyte cultures obtained from donor rabbits having the appropriate IgG allotype.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to describe the minimum detection limit, reproducibility, accuracy, specificity and parallelism of different pregnancy-associated glycoprotein radioimmunoassay (PAG-RIA) systems: RIA- 497, RIA- 706, RIA- 780, RIA- 809 and RIA-Pool. Their ability to distinguish between non-pregnant and pregnant females at day 30 after artificial insemination (Al) was investigated. The antisera were raised in rabbits against different PAG preparations. All RIA systems proved to be sensitive, repeatable and accurate for measuring PAG concentrations. The dilutions of plasma samples taken at an early stage of pregnancy were found to be parallel to the standard curves. No cross-reaction was observed with different carbohydrates, either with Pregnant Marc Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) or human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). The concentrations of PAG in pregnant females at day 30 after Al were shown to be higher with the use <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> R# 706, R# 780, R# 809 and Pool when compared with antiserum R# 497. All the RIA systems gave 100 % sensitivity and negative predictive values.

The present study clearly shows that the ability of PAG-RIA systems to diagnose pregnancy specifically at day 30 after Al can be improved by using a combination <b>of</b> <b>antisera</b> raised against different forms of PAG.
