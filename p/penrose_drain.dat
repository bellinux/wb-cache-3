40|$|Objective: To report our {{experience}} in treating 10 consecutive patients with recalcitrant subcutaneous emphysema (SE) using {{two different types}} of subcutaneous drains. Methods: A retrospective review of {{our experience}} in managing 10 cases of recalcitrant SE. The method that we employed consisted of creating a subcutaneous tunnelization of the pre-pectoral space, under previous local anesthesia, and inserting three <b>Penrose</b> <b>drains</b> (small rubber tubes) or a multifenestrated Argyle drain in the tunnels. Results: The placement of the subcutaneous drains resolved SE in all 10 cases within a mean time of 5. 3 days. No local or systemic complications were observed, but patients with the Argyle drain showed worse tolerance, presenting local pain that required treatment with additional analgesics. Conclusion: The subcutaneous drain treatment of the recalcitrant SE is a simple, safe, and effective method that should be used in clinical practice for the better comfort of patients. In our series, <b>Penrose</b> <b>drains</b> were better tolerated than the multifenestrated Argyle drains. ...|$|R

40|$|A major {{advance in}} recent years has been the {{demonstration}} in children that most injuries of the spleen can safely be repaired. There is, however, a relative paucity of data regarding primary suture repair of the spleen in adults. This report describes experience with the treatment of 27 consecutive injuries of the spleen between 1978 - 1980. Splenorrhaphy was successful in 24 of 27 patients. Eighteen of the 24 patients were older than 15 years of age. Seven injuries resulted from penetrating trauma, 13 from blunt trauma, and four from injuries during operation. Repair included debridement, partial splenectomy, and primary suture repair, often in conjunction with Avitene®. There were no reoperations for bleeding or postoperative infection. Three splenectomies (11 %) were necessary because of either complete destruction of the splenic pulp, or separation of the spleen from its blood supply at the hilum. A separate question for decades has been the influence of types of drainage on infection following splenectomy. To study this question, between 1976 - 1978, 78 patients undergoing splenectomy were randomized prospectively by sealed envelopes into three groups. Group I—no drainage (23 patients); Group II—closed drainage with Jackson-Pratt drains (30 patients); Group III—open drainage with <b>Penrose</b> <b>drains</b> (25 patients). All but three drains were removed within 48 hours. In these three patients, the drains were removed after 96 hours. In the 53 patients in Group I and II, there were no infections. In Group III (<b>Penrose</b> <b>drains)</b> there were two complications: evisceration of a loop of small bowel through the drain site, and one subphrenic abscess in a patient with a concomitant colonic injury. Present experience does not show any significant difference among the three groups. Concomitant enteric injuries and the duration of drainage maybe the most significant factors influencing infection. The presence or absence of drains per se does not seem significant...|$|R

The laboratory modules allow supervision and self-instruction, practice, and videotape monitoring of the following techniques: skin incision, suturing, knot tying, hemostasis, vascular anastomosis, and intestinal anastomosis. Pigs' feet simulate human skin for exercises in skin incision, lesion excision, suturing, and basic plastic surgical techniques. Latex tubing and <b>penrose</b> <b>drains</b> allow experience in suturing, knot tying, and hemostasis. Polytetrafluoroethylene vascular prostheses permit quantification of the precision of needle passage and suturing by measurement of leakage of water through a vascular anastomosis. Reconstituted, lyophilized, irradiated bovine arteries and ileum provide models of biologic tissue for creating handsewn vascular anastomoses and sutured or stapled gastrointestinal anastomoses. A headlamp videocamera allows unobstructive recording of the resident's technical performance and provides subsequent visual feedback for self-improvement when compared to reference instructional videotapes.

40|$|Although {{postoperative}} pneumoperitoneum is {{a common}} finding, it is particularly disturbing {{when there is an}} increase in the amount of postoperative pneumoperitoneum or when the radiographic finding of pneumoperitoneum is accompanied by such physical findings as increased abdominal tenderness, peritoneal signs or paralytic ileus. Four patients operated upon at the Mount Sinai Hospital are presented. All patients underwent abdominal surgery for treatment of some form of inflammatory bowel disease and all were receiving systemic corticosteroids in the postoperative period. Abdominal findings of tenderness, ileus and peritoneal irritation developed shortly after the removal of <b>Penrose</b> <b>drains</b> in the postoperative period. Pneumoperitoneum was confirmed by abdominal roentgenographs. The first patient in this group underwent a laparotomy with essentially negative findings other than a freely open drain tract. The subsequent three patients were managed by close observation and frequent abdominal radiographs. These three patients had contrast roentgenographic studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract to rule out perforation of a peptic ulcer, and in the patient upon whom reservoir ileostomy had been performed, a contrast study of the reservoir was performed. All patients recovered fully with this management and there were no sequelae. The mechanism for the appearance of pneumoperitoneum after removal of drains, particularly when the patient is receiving systemic corticosteroids, is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the need to consider and rule out perforation of a hollow viscus in this situation before accepting drain removal as the sole cause of post-operative pneumoperitoneum...|$|R
40|$|Consecutive {{patients}} undergoing emergency appendectomy (283) or urgent cholecystectomy (51) were prospectively {{studied for}} the development of post-operative incisional or peritoneal sepsis. Severity of the original peritoneal infection was carefully recorded, while use of a <b>Penrose</b> dam to <b>drain</b> the peritoneum was randomized according to pre-assigned hospital number. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken from the abdomen at the time of operation as well as from all postoperative infectious foci. Results demonstrated no essential differences in incidence of wound and peritoneal infection following appendectomy for simple or suppurative appendicitis (187) or following cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis (51). However, with gangrenous or perforative appendicitis (94), incisional and intra-abdominal infection rates were 43 % and 45 %, respectively, when a drain was used; yet only 29 and 13 %, respectively, without a drain. These latter differences were significant (p < 0. 001). In addition, intra-abdominal abscesses were three times as likely to drain through the incision than along any tract provided by the rubber conduit. Cultures revealed that hospital pathogens accounted for a greater proportion of wound and peritoneal sepsis after cholecystectomy and appendectomy for simple or suppurative appendicitis if a drain had been inserted than if managed otherwise. By contrast, a mixed bacterial flora was responsible for most infections following appendectomy for gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, irrespective as to use of a drain...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether a subcutaneous <b>penrose</b> <b>drain</b> would decrease the superficial surgical site infection (s-SSI) rate in elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: This is a {{comparative study of}} the historical control type. Intervention consisted {{of the use of}} <b>penrose</b> <b>drain</b> in elective open colorectal surgical wounds. The outcome was an incidence of s-SSI. The patients were risk stratified according to the depth of subcutaneous tissue. RESULTS: There were 131 patients (40 patients with high s-SSI risk) in the prior period (from July 2008 to June 2009, when no penrose drains were inserted) and 151 patients (75 patients with high s-SSI risk) in the latter period (from June 2010 to November 2011, when penrose drains were inserted). The overall s-SSI rate was 6. 1 % and 5. 3 % during the two periods (P = 0. 770), and the s-SSI rate in the high s-SSI risk group was 15. 0 % and 8. 0 % (P = 0. 242).

40|$|Abstract During {{bariatric surgery}} in morbidly obese patients, the surgeon’s {{operative}} view is often {{obscured by the}} hypertrophic fatty left lobe of the liver. The use of a conventional liver retractor mandates an additional sub-xiphoid wound, resulting in pain and scar formation, {{in addition to the}} risk of iatrogenic liver injury during retractor insertion. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple, rapid, and safe technique for liver retraction—V-shaped liver suspension technique (V-LIST) —by using a <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> and laparoscopic stapler. A silicone <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and stapled to the pars condensa of the lesser omentum and parietal peritoneum using a laparoscopic stapler. The left lobe of the liver was retracted by the V-shaped suspension. At the end of the surgery, the drain could be easily removed. In October 2009 –February 2010, 14 patients underwent liver retraction with the use of this technique. We performed 12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 2 sleeve gastrectomies. This series also included three cases of single incision transumbilical laparoscopic surgery. The mean time re-quired to complete the liver retraction was 8 min 21 s (range, 2 – 18 min 40 s). Retraction was appropriate in all patients, without the need for additional retractors or conversion. There were no V-LIST-related perioperative complications. Our V-LIST technique using a <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> is safe and simple. It has potential applications in single incision laparoscopic bariatric procedures...|$|E
40|$|An initial {{series of}} 105 women who {{underwent}} excision biopsy {{of the breast}} were entered into a controlled randomised trial {{to determine the effect}} on postoperative morbidity of drainage of the cavity with a soft rubber <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain.</b> The use of this drain had no effect on the incidence of postoperative wound complications (drain 11 of 40 (28 %), no drain 10 of 58 (17 %]. A second series of 202 women were entered into a randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of closed suction drainage and suture of the cavity after breast biopsy. The use of this drain significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative wound complications (drain 9 of 93 (10 %), no drain 22 of 105 (21 %], but although suture of the cavity halved the number of wound complications (suture 11 of 97 (11 %), no suture 20 of 101 (20 %], this did not reach statistical significance. Wound complications were more frequent with large wounds (28 %) than with smaller ones (15 %), and with less experienced operators (registrar 21 %, senior registrar/consultant 10 %). We conclude that a closed suction drain will reduce the incidence of wound haematomas after breast biopsy but that a <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> is ineffective in the prevention of wound complications...|$|E
40|$|Background: Digital tourniquets {{used in the}} {{emergency}} department have been scrutinized due to complications associated with their use, including neurovascular injury secondary to excessive tourniquet pressure and digital ischemia caused by a forgotten tourniquet. To minimize these risks, a conspicuous tourniquet that applies {{the least amount of}} pressure necessary to maintain hemostasis is recommended. Objective: To evaluate the commonly used tourniquet methods, the <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain,</b> rolled glove, the Tourni-cot and the T-Ring, to determine which applies the lowest pressure while consistently preventing digital perfusion. Methods: We measured the circumference of selected digits of 200 adult males and 200 adult females to determine the adult finger size range. We then measured the pressure applied to four representative finger sizes using a pressure monitor and assessed the ability of each method to prevent digital blood flow with a pulse oximeter. Results: We selected four representative finger sizes: 45 mm, 65 mm, 70 mm, and 85 mm to test the different tourniquet methods. All methods consistently prevented digital perfusion. The highest pressure recorded for the <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> was 727 mmHg, the clamped rolled glove 439, the unclamped rolled glove 267, Tourni-cot 246, while the T-Ring had the lowest at 151 mmHg and least variable pressures of all methods. Conclusion: All tested methods provided adequate hemostasis. Only the Tourni-cot and T-Ring provided hemostasis at safe pressures across all digit sizes with the T-Ring having a lower overall average pressure.

40|$|To remove body fluids, {{preventing}} {{an accumulation}} of fluid and assist wound healing. BACKGROUND INFORMATION A drain describes any material or equipment used to prevent {{the formation of a}} haematoma or to carry fluid from inside the body to the surface. Allowing unwanted fluid or blood to remain in a wound may be a potential source of infection and may also impede healing, or result in wound breakdown and dehiscence. Wound drains are classified as closed or open drainage systems. 1. Closed drains do not expose the contents to the atmosphere. They include vacuum drains which apply negative pressure such as the Redivac®, or non-vacuum systems such as the T-tube drain. 1 The drain is often secured with a suture. The use of a closed drain system lowers the risk of potential infection for patients and reduces staff contact with body fluids. 2. Open drains allow communication with the atmosphere. These drains include corrugated drains, the <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> and sump drains. 1 Open drains are inserted directly into the wound bed and they drain into a dressing. As they have an open end there is the potential for infection. Open drains are usually secured by a suture and may have a safety pin attache...|$|E

In these rare cases laparoscopy can be indicated. Objective: Describe the Laparoscopic-assisted rigid nephroscopy performed via transpyelic approach and report the feasibility. Patients and methods: We present two cases of caliceal lithiasis. The {{first is a}} patient that ESWL and previous percutaneous lithotripsy have failed, with pelvic kidney where laparoscopic dissection of renal pelvis was carried out followed by nephroscopy utilizing the 30 Fr rigid nephroscope to remove the calculus. Ideal angle between the major axis of renal pelvis and the rigid nephroscope to allow success with this technique was 60 - 90 grades. In the second case, the kidney had a dilated infundibulum. Results: The operative time was 180 minutes for both procedures. No significant blood loss or perioperative complications occurred. The bladder catheter was removed in the postoperative day 1 and <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain</b> on day 2 when patients were discharged. The convalescence was completed after 3 weeks. Patients were stone free without symptons in one year of follow-up.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPsoas abscess {{is a rare}} {{clinical}} entity with vague symptomatology. We {{report a}} psoas abscess that simulated symptoms of acute appendicitis. Presentation of caseA twenty-five year old male presented pain irradiating to the right iliac fossa and lumbar region associated with thigh flexion. Laboratorial exams revealed leukocytosis with a neutrophil shift to the left. Abdominal Ultrasound showed significant intestinal distension and a small quantity of free fluid at the right iliac fossa. Laparotomy and an appendectomy were performed. During immediate post-operative, the patient evolved with worsening of {{the pain and the}} leukocytosis, therefore, we chose to maintain his antalgic posture. An abdominal Computerized Tomography scan with contrast was solicited, revealing an increase of the iliac and psoas muscles of the right side, and multiple bacterial focuses. A retroperitoneal access was performed and 300 ml of purulent secretion was drained. Afterwards, we implanted a <b>Penrose</b> <b>Drain.</b> The patient had a good post-op evolution, being discharged 7 days after the drainage. DiscussionThe psoas muscle is a flexor of the thigh. Psoas abscess is an underdiagnosed condition, its main treatment is surgery associated with antibiotic therapy. CT scan seems to be the best choice of diagnostic image exam, although some authors prefer the nuclear magnetic resonance. ConclusionThe psoas muscle abscess is uncommon and poorly characterized in its etiology, clinical associations, and its therapeutic approach.

The ulnar nerve was exposed and dissected free from surrounding fibrosis and protected with <b>Penrose</b> <b>drain.</b> Medial epicondyle was observed devoid of any tissue. Flexor-pronator muscle group was found totally avulsed from the medial epicondyle and retracted distally. Ulnar collateral ligament was totally ruptured and remaining parts were attenuated. Triceps tendon was surgically freed from the proximal ulna in continuum with the strong fibrous healing tissue. Since UCL tissue was irreparable, a reconstruction using ipsilateral free palmaris longus tendon graft was performed as described previously [2]. Non-absorbable sutures in Krackow fashion were used to secure the TT. Four drill holes 1  cm apart were prepared at the posterior cortex of the proximal ulna for TT fixation. To improve fixation, two 3.5 -mm suture anchors were used {{at the tip of}} the olecranon. Triceps tendon was then secured to the bone while the elbow in 10 – 20 ° of flexion.

40|$|Introduction: Psoas abscess {{is a rare}} {{clinical}} entity with vague symptomatology. We {{report a}} psoas abscess that simulated symptoms of acute appendicitis. Presentation of case: A twenty-five year old male presented pain irradiating to the right iliac fossa and lumbar region associated with thigh flexion. Laboratorial exams revealed leukocytosis with a neutrophil shift to the left. Abdominal Ultrasound showed significant intestinal distension and a small quantity of free fluid at the right iliac fossa. Laparotomy and an appendectomy were performed. During immediate post-operative, the patient evolved with worsening of {{the pain and the}} leukocytosis, therefore, we chose to maintain his antalgic posture. An abdominal Computerized Tomography scan with contrast was solicited, revealing an increase of the iliac and psoas muscles of the right side, and multiple bacterial focuses. A retroperitoneal access was performed and 300  ml of purulent secretion was drained. Afterwards, we implanted a <b>Penrose</b> <b>Drain.</b> The patient had a good post-op evolution, being discharged 7  days after the drainage. Discussion: The psoas muscle is a flexor of the thigh. Psoas abscess is an underdiagnosed condition, its main treatment is surgery associated with antibiotic therapy. CT scan seems to be the best choice of diagnostic image exam, although some authors prefer the nuclear magnetic resonance. Conclusion: The psoas muscle abscess is uncommon and poorly characterized in its etiology, clinical associations, and its therapeutic approach. On the other hand, acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal emergency, with a 7 % death rate, and surgery is its main treatment...|$|E
