40|$|Freshman grade <b>point</b> <b>average,</b> in {{particular}} first semester grade <b>point</b> <b>average,</b> {{is an important}} predictor of survival and eventual student success in college. As many {{institutions of higher learning}} are searching for ways to improve student success, one would hope that policies geared towards the success of freshmen have long term benefits reflected in eventual graduation. In this paper, we look at whether participation in Intramural and Recreation programs is associated with freshman grade <b>point</b> <b>average</b> at a mid-sized public institution with extensive recreational opportunities. We find a strong positive association between freshman grade <b>point</b> <b>average</b> and participation in recreation.

2500|$|In Bryant's second season, he {{received}} more playing time {{and began to}} show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant's <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> more than doubled from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers [...] "played small", which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up. Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award, and through fan voting, he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history. He was joined by teammates O'Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making {{it the first time}} since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant's 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} liberal-arts {{colleges in the}} U.S. either do not issue grades at all (such as Alverno College, Antioch College, Bennington College, The Evergreen State College, [...] New College of Florida, and Hampshire College), {{de-emphasize}} them (St. John's College, Reed College, Sarah Lawrence College, Prescott College, College of the Atlantic), or do not calculate grade <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> (Brown University). In all cases, the rationale is that grades alone do not provide {{a clear picture of}} academic aptitude or of potential for success, and that learning, not achieving the highest score, should be the goal of a liberal education {{as is the case in}} graduate programs. In many cases, narrative evaluations are used as an alternative measurement system. Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn is one of several secondary schools to eschew grades in favor of narrative reports, while still managing to be the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and several other highly selective colleges.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, colleges were {{required}} by federal law to post a net price calculator on their websites to give prospective students and families a rough estimate of likely college costs for their particular institution, and to [...] "demystify pricing." [...] A student or family could go online, find the calculator at a college's website, and enter the required financial and academic information, and the calculator should tell them {{an estimate of the}} likely cost of attending that college. The first online calculators were started by Williams College. The online calculators look at financial need and academic merit to try to estimate the likely discounted price offered to a particular student from a particular college, using information including details from tax returns, household income, grade <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> and test scores. Schools vary in terms of their pricing formulas; some consider home equity as a factor while others disregard it. Lynn O'Shaughnessy recommends that families shopping for colleges go to a college's website and use the net price calculator to get a personalized estimate of cost.|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 2012, {{university}} officials {{announced that they}} had misreported admissions data on their student body for over a decade. Specifically, it overstated {{the number of students}} who had graduated from high school in the top ten percent of their classes by twenty percentage points. Officials made the assumption that students with top standardized test scores and high grade <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> were in the top tenth of their class when secondary schools did not provide class rank (roughly two-thirds of American high schools do not rank their students). Consequently, U.S. News & World Report removed the school from its rankings. It had been ranked in a three-way tie for the 51st position among national universities but following revelation of the misreporting U.S. News altered the GW entry to read [...] "George Washington University has changed from being a ranked school in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges to an unranked school, based on a data reporting error." [...] The accurate data would have lowered the school's rank. The university was reinstated on the 2014 U.S. News & World Report rankings, coming in as 52nd in National Universities.|$|E
2500|$|Professor {{of journalism}} at Elon University, Michael Skube, argued in the editorial, [...] "The No. 1 reason to rank colleges," [...] against {{arguments}} {{made in the}} 11 March Washington Post article, [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by the President of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers. Skube states that, while having some merit, these arguments were [...] "partly beside the point [...] U.S. News survey, for all its imperfections, performs the useful service of comparing apples with academic apples.In some ways, one might even argue that its nuts-and-bolts consumer information {{is at least as}} practical as the bar charts and numbers a car buyer might find in Consumer Reports or Car and Driver. What factors go into the rankings? Student retention accounts for 25% at schools U.S. News calls master's level and those that provide primarily the bachelor's degree (called 'comprehensive' schools, oddly enough)." [...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective.

40|$|University {{admission}} criteria for graduate and undergraduate non-native English speaking students often include a minimum {{score on the}} Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The relationships among academic success (here defined as first semester university grade <b>point</b> <b>average),</b> TOEFL test score, and other variables were analyzed by means of multiple regression analysis for a sample size of 159.

Data on grade <b>point</b> <b>average</b> in the final semester of pre-university English language study were obtainable because students in the sample had studied English in a full-time non-credit pre-university English language program prior to beginning university course work. In addition first semester university grade <b>point</b> <b>average</b> data from a separate group of similar subjects were separately analyzed using identical procedures {{in an effort to}} validate {{the results of the study}} sample analysis. As another validation procedure, graduate and undergraduate data were also analyzed separately for each sample.

TOEFL test score and grade <b>point</b> <b>average</b> in the final semester of pre-university study-of-English courses were related to first semester undergraduate academic success but not to graduate academic success.
