5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (<b>pyelonephritis).</b> Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pyelonephritis</b> {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop <b>pyelonephritis</b> and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. <b>Pyelonephritis</b> occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyelonephritis</b> is {{infection}} of the kidneys and is frequently caused by complication of a urinary tract infection.|$|E
25|$|Nitrofurantoin is not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>pyelonephritis,</b> prostatitis and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels.|$|E
25|$|The European Medicines Agency, also in 2008, had {{recommended}} restricting {{the use of}} oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used {{in the treatment of}} acute or chronic complicated <b>pyelonephritis,</b> should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated <b>pyelonephritis</b> and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|Complications of {{analgesic}} nephropathy include <b>pyelonephritis</b> and end-stage kidney disease. Risk factors for poor prognosis include recurrent {{urinary tract infection}} and persistently elevated blood pressure. Analgesic nephropathy also appears to {{increase the risk of}} developing cancers of the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|Kiesling {{suffered}} from a respiratory ailment that resulted in multiple hospitalizations in his later years. He died in March 1962 at age 58 at Divine Providence Hospital in Pittsburgh. The {{cause of death was}} acute bacteremia due to <b>pyelonephritis.</b> He was buried at Christ Our Redeemer Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.|$|E
25|$|Early {{diagnosis}} {{in children}} is crucial as {{studies have shown}} that the children with VUR who present with a UTI and associated acute <b>pyelonephritis</b> are more likely to develop permanent renal cortical scarring than those children without VUR, with an odds ratio of 2.8. Thus VUR not only increases the frequency of UTI's, but also the risk of damage to upper urinary structures and end-stage renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones {{are often}} used for {{genitourinary}} infections and are widely used {{in the treatment of}} hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters. In community-acquired infections, they are recommended only when risk factors for multidrug resistance are present or after other antibiotic regimens have failed. However, for serious acute cases of <b>pyelonephritis</b> or bacterial prostatitis where the patient may need to be hospitalised, fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is {{responsible}} for approximately 90% of urinary tract infections (UTI) seen in individuals with ordinary anatomy. In ascending infections, fecal bacteria colonize the urethra and spread up the urinary tract to the bladder {{as well as to}} the kidneys (causing <b>pyelonephritis),</b> or the prostate in males. Because women have a shorter urethra than men, they are 14 times more likely to suffer from an ascending UTI.|$|E
25|$|Another {{virulence}} factor commonly {{present in}} UPEC is the Dr family of adhesins, which are particularly associated with cystitis and pregnancy-associated <b>pyelonephritis.</b> The Dr adhesins bind Dr {{blood group antigen}} (Dra) which is present on decay accelerating factor (DAF) on erythrocytes and other cell types. There, the Dr adhesins induce the development of long cellular extensions that wrap around the bacteria, accompanied by the activation of several signal transduction cascades, including activation of PI-3 kinase.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones are not {{licensed}} by the FDA for use in children due {{to the risk of}} fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and <b>Pyelonephritis</b> due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure). However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the agency}} {{representing}} Blair did not send {{her for the}} role, Blair's mother took her to meet with Warner Bros.'s casting department and then with Friedkin. Pamelyn Ferdin, a veteran of science fiction and supernatural drama, was {{a candidate for the}} role of Regan, but was ultimately turned down because her career thus far had made her too familiar to the public. April Winchell was considered, until she developed <b>pyelonephritis,</b> which caused her to be hospitalized and ultimately taken out of consideration. Denise Nickerson, who played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, was considered, but the material troubled her parents too much, and they pulled her out of consideration. Anissa Jones, known for her role as Buffy in Family Affair, auditioned for the role, but she too was rejected, for much the same reason as Ferdin. The part went instead to Blair, a relative unknown until the film's success.|$|E
500|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} may involve only the lower urinary tract, in which case it {{is known as a}} bladder infection. [...] Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as <b>pyelonephritis.</b> If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. If a {{urinary tract infection}} involves the upper tract, and the person has diabetes mellitus, is pregnant, is male, or immunocompromised, it is considered complicated. Otherwise if a woman is healthy and premenopausal it is considered uncomplicated. In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.|$|E
500|$|Lower {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} is {{also referred to as}} a bladder infection. [...] The most common symptoms are burning with urination and having to urinate frequently (or an urge to urinate) in the absence of vaginal discharge and significant pain. These symptoms may vary from mild to severe and in healthy women last an average of sixdays. Some pain above the pubic bone or in the lower back may be present. People experiencing an upper {{urinary tract infection}}, or <b>pyelonephritis,</b> may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. Rarely the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pus in the urine.|$|E
2500|$|Renal {{physiology}} is {{the study}} of kidney function. Nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function: [...] these include chronic kidney disease, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney injury, and <b>pyelonephritis.</b> Urology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract) anatomy: these include cancer, [...] renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones, and urinary tract obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} for marketing in Japan in 1993 for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under {{the brand name}} Cravit. [...] Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson as it had with ofloxacin, obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute <b>pyelonephritis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Bladder stones or uroliths are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in animals, especially in domestic animals such as dogs and cats. Occurrence in other species, including tortoises, have been reported as well. The stones form in the urinary bladder in varying size and numbers secondary to infection, dietary influences, and genetics. [...] Stones can form {{in any part of}} the urinary tract in dogs and cats, but unlike in humans, stones of the kidney are less common and do not often cause significant disease, although they can contribute to <b>pyelonephritis</b> and chronic renal failure. [...] Types of stones include struvite, calcium oxalate, urate, cystine, calcium phosphate, and silicate. [...] Struvite and calcium oxalate stones are by far the most common.|$|E
6000|$|Calibree slowly {{revolved}} toward her. [...] "Uh--I've never--uh--never {{looked into}} it. I don't believe much in getting {{mixed up in}} politics." [...] He turned squarely from her and, peering earnestly at Kennicott, resumed, [...] "Doctor, what's been your experience with unilateral <b>pyelonephritis?</b> Buckburn of Baltimore advocates decapsulation and nephrotomy, but seems to me----" ...|$|E
50|$|Xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis</b> is {{an unusual}} form of chronic <b>pyelonephritis.</b> It results in severe {{destruction}} of the kidney and causes granulomatous abscess formation. Patients infected with Xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis</b> experience recurrent fevers, anemia, kidney stones and loss of function in the affected kidney.|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of <b>pyelonephritis</b> during pregnancy, and for {{the treatment}} of <b>pyelonephritis</b> caused by gram-positive organisms, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium is preferred.|$|E
5000|$|With {{pathologist}} Ludwig Aschoff (1866-1942), {{he published}} a treatise on <b>pyelonephritis</b> called Die <b>Pyelonephritis</b> in anatomischer und bakteriologischer Beziehung. Other noted works by Schmidt include: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{urine culture}} and {{antibiotics}} sensitivity test is issued {{for patients who}} {{are believed to have}} <b>pyelonephritis.</b> Since most cases of <b>pyelonephritis</b> are caused from bacterial infections, antibiotics are a common treatment option. Depending on the species of the infecting organism and the antibiotics sensitivity profile of the organism, treatments may include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim individually or in combination. For patients with xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis,</b> treatment might include antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the most common surgical treatment for a majority of cases invloving xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyelonephritis</b> {{presents}} with fever, accelerated heart rate, painful urination, {{abdominal pain}} radiating to the back, nausea, and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side. <b>Pyelonephritis</b> that has progressed to urosepsis may {{be accompanied by}} signs of septic shock, including rapid breathing, decreased blood pressure, violent shivering, and occasionally delirium. <b>Pyelonephritis</b> requires antibiotic therapy, and sometimes surgical intervention such as ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrostomy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy, as well as treatment of any underlying causes to prevent its recurrence. Xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis</b> is a rare form of chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> in which surgical removal of the kidney is usually necessary for definitive treatment. The term is from Greek πύελο|ς pýelo|s, [...] "basin" [...] + νεφρ|ός nepʰrós, [...] "kidney" [...] + suffix -itis suggesting [...] "inflammation".|$|E
50|$|In acute <b>pyelonephritis,</b> {{the patient}} {{experiences}} high fever, abdominal pain and pain while passing urine. Treatment for acute <b>pyelonephritis</b> is provided via antibiotics and an extensive urological investigation is conducted {{to find any}} abnormalities and prevent recurrence.|$|E
50|$|Chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> implies {{recurrent}} kidney {{infections and}} {{can result in}} scarring of the renal parenchyma and impaired function, especially {{in the setting of}} obstruction. A perinephric abscess (infection around the kidney) and/or pyonephrosis may develop in severe cases of <b>pyelonephritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In chronic <b>pyelonephritis,</b> {{patients}} experience persistent abdominal and flank pain, high fever, decreased appetite, weight loss, {{urinary tract}} symptoms and {{blood in the}} urine. Chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> {{can also lead to}} scarring of the renal parenchyma caused by recurrent kidney infections.|$|E
50|$|Chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> causes {{persistent}} flank or abdominal pain, {{signs of}} infection (fever, unintentional weight loss, malaise, decreased appetite), lower urinary tract symptoms and {{blood in the}} urine. Chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> can in addition cause fever of unknown origin. Furthermore, inflammation-related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition AA amyloidosis.|$|E
50|$|Xanthogranulomatous <b>pyelonephritis</b> is {{an unusual}} form of chronic <b>pyelonephritis</b> {{characterized}} by granulomatous abscess formation, severe kidney destruction, and a clinical picture that may resemble renal cell carcinoma and other inflammatory kidney parenchymal diseases. Most affected individuals present with recurrent fevers and urosepsis, anemia, and a painful kidney mass. Other common manifestations include kidney stones and loss of function of the affected kidney. Bacterial cultures of kidney tissue are almost always positive. Microscopically, there are granulomas and lipid-laden macrophages (hence the term xantho-, which means yellow in ancient Greek). It is found in roughly 20% of specimens from surgically managed cases of <b>pyelonephritis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A similar term is [...] "pyelitis" [...] {{which means}} {{inflammation}} of the pelvis and calyces. In other words, pyelitis together with nephritis is collectively known as <b>pyelonephritis.</b> Severe cases of <b>pyelonephritis</b> can lead to pyonephrosis (pus accumulation around the kidney), sepsis (a systemic inflammatory response {{of the body to}} infection), kidney failure and even death.|$|E
