5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of <b>platelet</b> <b>activation.</b> If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed.

Here we show, that in permeabilized <b>platelets</b> <b>activation</b> of PKC by DIDS (20 μM), measured as 32 P incorporation in pleckstrin, is completely inhibited by guanosine 5 '-(2 -O-thio) diphosphate (200 μM), an inhibitor of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Also pertussin toxin (4 μgml), which ADP-ribosylates the α-subunits of Gi's and Go, prevents pleckstrin phosphorylation by DIDS. N-Ethylmaleimide (50 μM), which uncouples Gi from α 2 A-adrenoceptors, inhibits pleckstrin phosphorylation by DIDS in intact <b>platelets.</b> <b>Activation</b> of PKC by 55 nM phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and 500 nM platelet-activating factor are not disturbed by NEM.

50|$|Adenosine {{diphosphate}} (ADP) is a platelet agonist. When it {{is added}} to saline-diluted whole blood in the test cuvette, it stimulates the ADP receptors on platelets, activating the <b>platelets.</b> The <b>activation</b> of the <b>platelets</b> leads to shape change and degranulation, and the released content of the granules further activates the <b>platelets.</b> <b>Activation</b> also induces a conformational change in the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor, giving it high affinity for fibrinogen. Binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb/IIIa receptors leads to platelet-to-platelet bridges and results in platelet aggregation. Antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and prasugrel irreversibly inhibit the ADP receptor P2Y12, leading to a decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Drugs that inhibit the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, e.g. eptifibatide, can also reduce or eliminate the ADP-induced platelet response.|$|R

25|$|The typical {{pathophysiology}} of HUS {{involves the}} binding of Shiga-toxin to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; also called ceramide trihexoside which accumulates in Fabry disease) receptor {{on the surface}} of the glomerular endothelium. This action includes a cascade of signaling events leading to apoptosis and binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells. The Shiga-toxin-activated endothelial cells then become thrombogenic (clot-producing) by mechanism that is not fully understood, though they have been shown to induce the release of cytokines and chemokines that are implicated in <b>platelet</b> <b>activation.</b> Additionally, the binding action of Shiga-toxin inactivates a metalloproteinase called ADAMTS13, the deficiency of which causes the closely related TTP. Once ADAMTS13 is disabled, multimers of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) form and initiate <b>platelet</b> <b>activation,</b> causing microthrombus formation. The activation of platelets resulting from inhibition of ADAMTS13 is due to the hyperactivity of large multimers of uncleaved vWF. The arterioles and capillaries of the body become obstructed by the resulting complexes of activated platelets, which have adhered to the endothelium via large multimeric vWF. Through a mechanism known as microangiopathic hemolysis, the growing thrombi lodged in smaller vessels destroy red blood cells (RBCs) as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels, forming schistocytes, or fragments of sheared RBCs. The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS. Typically, this hemolysis results in a hemoglobin level of less than 80g/L.|$|E
25|$|ADP on {{the other}} hand binds to purinergic receptors on {{platelet}} surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces <b>platelet</b> <b>activation.</b> Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.|$|E

25|$|Tissue factor also binds {{to factor}} VII in the blood, which initiates the {{extrinsic}} coagulation cascade to increase thrombin production. Thrombin {{is a potent}} platelet activator, acting through Gq and G12. These are G protein coupled receptors and they turn on calcium mediated signaling pathways within the platelet, overcoming the baseline calcium efflux. Families of three G proteins (Gq, Gi, G12) operate together for full activation. Thrombin also promotes secondary fibrin-reinforcement of the platelet plug. <b>Platelet</b> <b>activation</b> in turn degranulates and releases factor V and fibrinogen, potentiating the coagulation cascade.

However, in most patients with aHUS, it has been demonstrated that chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement can result from production of anti-factor H autoantibodies or from genetic mutations in any of several complement regulatory proteins (e.g., factor H, factor HR1 or HR3, membrane cofactor protein, factor I, factor B, complement C3, and thrombomodulin). This results in <b>platelet</b> <b>activation,</b> damage to endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels), and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), damage to multiple organs, and often, death.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{was first}} {{defined as a}} {{syndrome}} in 1955. The more common form of the disease, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS), is triggered by the infectious agent E. coli O157:H7, and several other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes. Certain Shiga toxin-secreting strains of Shigella dysenteriae can also cause HUS. Approximately 5% of cases are classified as pneumococcal HUS, which results from infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the agent that causes traditional lobar pneumonia. There is also a rare, chronic, and severe form known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is caused by genetic defects resulting in chronic, uncontrolled complement activation. Both STEC-HUS and aHUS cause endothelial damage, leukocyte activation, <b>platelet</b> <b>activation,</b> and widespread inflammation and multiple thromboses in the small blood vessels, a condition known as systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which leads to thrombotic events as well as organ damage/failure and death.|$|E

40|$|Activation and {{aggregation}} {{of blood}} platelets {{is crucial for}} hemostasis and thrombosis. In the vascular system adenine nucleotides are important signaling molecules playing {{a key role in}} hemostasis. ADP was the first low molecular weight agent recognized to cause blood <b>platelets</b> <b>activation</b> and aggregation. NTPDases and adenylate kinase (AK) are the main enzymes involved in metabolism of extracellular adenine nucleotides. The majority of studies concentrated on the role of NTPDase 1 (apyrase) in the inhibition of platelets aggregation. Up to now, there are still insufficient data concerning the role of AK in this process. We found that adenylate kinase activity in the serum of patients with myocardial infarction is significantly increased when compared to the healthy volunteers. The elevated activity of AK is connected to appearance of another isoform of that enzyme, expressed in patients with myocardial infarction. The influence of AK on the pig blood platelets aggregation induced by 20 μM ADP or 7. 5 μg/ml rat collagen was examined. 1 U of adenylate kinase added to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) before ADP or collagen, inhibited the platelets aggregation. One minute after induction of <b>platelets</b> <b>activation</b> by ADP as much as 5 U of adenylate kinase was necessary to stop the platelet aggregation. In the case of collagen activated aggregation, only 2 U of AK added 1 or 5 minutes after initiation of the aggregation process were sufficient for disaggregation of platelets. The increase of ATP: ADP ratio is probably responsible for the initiation of disaggregation process. We conclude that adenylate kinase is involved in regulation of plate-lets aggregation.
