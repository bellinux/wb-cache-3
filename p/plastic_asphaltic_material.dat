40|$|<b>Asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> are {{classical}} {{examples of}} multi-phase composites in different length scales. The {{understanding of the}} mechanical behavior of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> has been {{a challenge to the}} pavement mechanics community due to multiple complexities involved: heterogeneity, anisotropy, nonlinear inelasticity, and damage in multiple forms. The micromechanics-based models based on numerical methods have been receiving attention from the pavement mechanics community because the modeling method can account for those complexities of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> by considering the effects of material properties and geometric characteristics of individual components on overall performance behavior of mixture or structure. As a step-wise effort, this study intends to identify some of key relevant mechanical characteristics such as linear viscoelastic, non-linear viscoelastic, and fracture properties of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> in two different length scales, e. g., mixture scale and component scale. More specifically, this study developed testing-analysis methods to rigorously define the stress-dependent nonlinear viscoelastic material characteristics at various stress levels and the viscoelastic mixed-mode fracture properties at different loading rates and testing temperatures. ^ The results from three-dimensional finite element simulations of the pavement structure presented significant differences between the linear viscoelastic approach and the nonlinear viscoelastic modeling in the prediction of pavement performance with respect to rutting. This implies that differences between the two approaches are considered significant and should be addressed in the process of performance-based pavement design. ^ The Semi-circular Bend (SCB) fracture test presented reasonable and repeatable results. The test and analysis results in this study suggest that the rate-, temperature-, mode- dependent fracture properties are necessary in the structural design of asphaltic pavements with which a wide range of strain rates and service temperatures is usually associated. ...|$|R

The rheological properties of complex modulus (G∗) and phase angle (δ) were measured for modified base asphalt blends containing up to 10 % WCO. The results of rheology studies demonstrated that the incremental addition of WCO to the three parent binders resulted in incremental decreases in the rutting resistance (decrease in G∗/sinδ values) and increases in the fatigue cracking resistance (decrease in G∗sinδ value). The fatigue cracking resistance and rutting resistance for the TLA[*]:[*]TPB (50 [*]:[*] 50) blends were between those of the blends containing pure TLA and TPB. As operating temperature increased, an increase in the resistance to fatigue cracking and a decrease in the rutting resistance were observed for all of the WCO modified asphaltic blends.

40|$|Prediction {{of crack}} growth in {{engineering}} structures {{is necessary for}} better analysis and design. However, this prediction becomes quite complex for certain materials in which the fracture behavior is both rate and path dependent. <b>Asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> used in pavements have that intrinsic complexity in their behavior. A lot of research effort {{has been devoted to}} better understanding viscoelastic behavior and fracture in such materials. This dissertation presents a further refinement of an experimental test setup, which is significantly different from standard testing protocols, to measure viscoelastic and fracture properties of nonlinear viscoelastic solids, such as <b>asphaltic</b> <b>materials.</b> ^ The results presented herein are primarily for experiments with asphalt, but the test procedure can be used for other viscoelastic materials as well. Even though the test is designed as a fracture test, experiments on the investigated materials have uncovered very complex phenomena prior to fracture. Viscoelasticity and micromechanics are used to explain some of the physical phenomena observed in the tests. The material behavior prior to fracture includes both viscoelastic behavior and a necking effect, which is further discussed in the appendix of the present study. ^ The dissertation outlines a theoretical model for the prediction of tractions ahead of the crack tip. The major contribution herein lies {{in the development of the}} experimental procedure for evaluating the material parameters necessary for deploying the model in the prediction of ductile crack growth. ^ Finally, predictions of crack growth in a double cantilever beam specimens and asphalt concrete samples are presented in order to demonstrate the power of this approach for predicting crack growth in viscoelastic media. ...|$|R
40|$|Steel fiber {{reinforced}} {{asphalt concrete}} (SFRAC) is suggested {{in this research}} as a multifunctional high performance material that can potentially lead to a breakthrough in developing a sustainable transportation system. The innovative use of steel fibers in asphalt concrete is expected to improve mechanical performance and electrical conductivity of asphalt concrete that is used for paving 94 % of U. S. roadways. In an effort to understand the fiber reinforcing mechanisms in SFRAC, the interaction between a single straight steel fiber and the surrounding asphalt matrix is investigated through single fiber pull-out tests and detailed numerical simulations. It is shown that pull-out failure modes can be classified into three types: matrix, interface, and mixed failure modes {{and that there is}} a critical shear stress, independent of temperature and loading rate, beyond which interfacial debonding will occur. The reinforcing effects of SFRAC with various fiber sizes and shapes are investigated through indirect tension tests at low temperature. Compared to unreinforced specimens, fiber reinforced specimens exhibit up to 62. 5 % increase in indirect tensile strength and 895 % improvements in toughness. The documented improvements are the highest attributed to fiber reinforcement in asphalt concrete to date. The use of steel fibers and other conductive additives provides an opportunity to make asphalt pavement electrically conductive, which opens up the possibility for multifunctional applications. Various asphalt mixtures and mastics are tested and the results indicate that the electrical resistivity of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>materials</b> can be manipulated over a wide range by replacing a part of traditional fillers with a specific type of graphite powder.

HossainTack coat is a {{thin layer}} of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>material</b> used to bind a newly-placed lift of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{pavement}} to a previously-placed lift or a new HMA overlay/inlay and existing pavement. The purpose of a tack coat is to ensure that a proper bond occurs so that traffic loads are carried by the entire HMA structure. Proper bonding exists when HMA layers act as a monolithic structure, transferring loads from one layer to the next. This depends on appropriate selection of tack coat material type and application rate, and is essential to prevent slippage failure and premature cracking in the wearing surface. This study focuses on development of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of HMA pavement structure in order to assess HMA interface bonding. The FE model was constructed using commercially available ABAQUS software to simulate an Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) experiment conducted at the Civil Infrastructure Systems Laboratory (CISL) at Kansas State University. Mechanistic responses measured in the CISL experiment, such as localized longitudinal strain at the interface, were used to calibrate the FE model.

The model was then calibrated with the resultant load-displacement curves from the laboratory tests. Simultaneously, a parametric study was performed to analyze certain aspects of the OT test procedure such as epoxy strength and testing dimensions that may be improved to increase its success. ^ Developing an accurate and calibrated FEA representation of the experiments in the lab will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the parameters that affect the success of OT as well as a model that can be applied to other types of <b>asphaltic</b> <b>material</b> testing. ...|$|R

The Santa Clara is a small coastal river that drains mountainous terrain in southern California, United States. Organic carbon in shale, river suspended sediment, and coastal marine sediment was separated into three operationally defined organic compound classes: total extractable lipids, acid hydrolyzable material, and the nonhydrolyzable residue. In all samples, the nonhydrolyzable fraction was dominant (∼ 50 % of POC), while lipids and acid hydrolyzable moieties were relatively minor (≤ 22 and ≤ 13 %, respectively). The Δ 14 C and δ 13 C signatures of the isolated fractions varied dramatically, not only across different sample types, but also for a given sample. At the shale exposure, low Δ 14 C values (− 30 ‰). The nonhydrolyzable fraction displayed intermediate Δ 14 C values (<− 190 ‰) that increased steadily downstream with decreasing δ 13 C values (− 22. 2 to − 25. 0 ‰), possibly from mixing of shale and surface soil POC.

Fatigue element tests have been carried out using two types of procedures; uniaxial tension-compression and a trapezoidal cantilever beam. The data from the Trapezoidal test has been used to develop relationships between dissipated energy and the number of load cycles to crack initiation. A method has been developed which enables the stiffness loss during a fatigue test to be quantified in terms of the initial mixture rheology. In addition, an improved method for defining the crack initiation point, N 1, has been developed along with the definition of an energy ratio to enable determination of fatigue life for intermediate modes of loading. An assessment of two tests involving indirect tension has been made. A series of tests were conducted in the Slab Test Facility to determine the performance of various asphaltic mixtures with respect to fatigue. These have been used to validate the results from the element tests and assess the suitability of different shift factors. A 2 -dimensional Finite Element visco-elastic analysis method has been used to calculate dissipated energy in pavement structures. This method has been compared to an elastic analysis method. It was observed that the F. E. method is less sensitive to pavement thickness. The F.
