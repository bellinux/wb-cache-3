There were 41,350 housing units at an average density of 658.5 per square mile (254.3/km²).

5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E

Weather Bureau standard recording gage was explored using data from Weather Bureau stations with both recording and nonrecording gages, a gaging site which included both a standard nonrecording gage and a Stevens recording gage, and gages on the East Central Raingage Network. It was found that, on the average, the standard 8. 0 -in. diameter orifice recording gage caught 2. 5 to 6 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> rain <b>than</b> the nonrecording gage and 2. 5 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> rain <b>than</b> the recording gage fitted with a 12 -in. diameter orifice.

25|$|In a 2008 study, Desai et al. {{focussed}} {{on education}} attainments {{of children and}} young adults aged 6–29, from lowest caste and tribal populations of India. They completed a national survey of over 100,000 households {{for each of the four}} survey years between 1983 and 2000. They found a significant increase in lower caste children in their odds of completing primary school. The number of dalit children who completed either middle-, high- or college-level education increased three times faster than the national average, and the total number were statistically same for both lower and upper castes. However, the same study found that in 2000, the percentage of dalit males never enrolled in a school was still more than twice the percentage of upper caste males never enrolled in schools. Moreover, only 1.67% of dalit females were college graduates compared to 9.09% of upper caste females. The number of dalit girls in India who attended school doubled in the same period, but still few <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> national average.

25|$|Less {{is usually}} {{known about the}} {{pressures}} models in the industry face, but striving hard {{to meet the requirements}} of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up, while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape. Another 54% of models; however, revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) level. A study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41, which qualifies for anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was also recorded to be twenty-three <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; Luisel Ramos, and Ana Carolina Reston. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, an high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.|$|E
