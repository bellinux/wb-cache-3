5|$|It is also {{mentioned}} in discussion of constitutional convention. Whilst it replaced conventions regarding {{the role of}} the House of Lords, it also relies on several others. Section 1(1) only makes sense if money bills do not arise in the House of Lords and the provisions in section 2(1) only if proceedings on a <b>public</b> <b>bill</b> are completed in a single session, otherwise they must fail and be put through procedure again.|$|E
5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any <b>public</b> <b>bill</b> which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a Finance Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{abolished}} {{any power}} of the House of Lords to veto any <b>public</b> <b>Bill</b> introduced in the House of Commons other than a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years or a Bill for confirming a Provisional Order.

50|$|It is {{important}} not to confuse private bills with private members' <b>bills,</b> which are <b>public</b> <b>bills</b> designed to affect a general change in the law. The only difference from regular <b>public</b> <b>bills</b> is that they are brought forward by a private member (a backbencher) rather than by the government. Twenty private members' bills per session are allowed to be introduced, with the sponsoring private members selected by a ballot of the whole house, and additional bills may be introduced under the Ten Minute Rule.|$|R
500|$|Charles conferred {{with the}} House of Lords, {{and then had}} Lord Coventry deliver his reply; that if the Commons did indeed trust the King, they should not request a <b>public</b> <b>bill,</b> and that Parliament would be prorogued on 13 May. With this, the Commons gave up on {{pursuing}} a <b>public</b> <b>bill</b> against Charles's wishes, since it would require his assent to be made law, and on 6 May turned to what to do next. A number of possible alternatives were debated. John Coke {{and a number of}} [...] "courtiers" [...] suggested simply trusting Charles, while William Coryton continued to push for an explanatory bill – precisely what Charles had rejected. Nathaniel Rich suggested asking Charles to explain his understanding of the law and declare certain acts illegal. Finally, Sir Edward Coke made a speech suggesting that the Commons join with the House of Lords, and pass their four resolutions as a petition of right. He was not the first to do so – Digges had suggested such a move as early as 26 April – but his proposal on 6 May was the one to be adopted, and he is thus normally seen as the originator of the Petition of Right.|$|E
