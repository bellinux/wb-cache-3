The Canary Island date palm differs from the date palm in having a stouter trunk, more leaves to the crown, more closely spaced leaflets, and deep green rather than grey-green leaves.

Therefore, {{a series of studies}} were carried out in Kerala, India in 2009 and 2010 to elucidate {{the presence or absence of}} R. indica colonies on hosts in addition to coconut Cocos nucifera L., and betel-nut palm, Areca catechu L., the only previously reported host plants in India. We evaluated the following: RPM numbers on coconut and Musa spp. grown in Kerala; the presence of RPM on coconut and bananas grown as a mixed crop; and the possible presence of RPM on palms and other selected plant species mostly grown as ornamentals or reported to be hosts of the RPM in the New World.

40|$|Oases are desert-farming agro-ecosystems, where <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> (Phoenix dactyliferaL.) plays a {{keystone}} role in offsetting {{the effects}} of drought and maintaining a suitable microclimate for agriculture. At present, abundance, diversity and plant growth promotion (PGP) of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root-associated bacteria remain unknown. Considering the environmental pressure determined by the water scarcity in the desert environments, we hypothesized that bacteria associated with <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots improve plant resistance to drought. Here, the ecology of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root endophytes from oases in the Tunisian Sahara was studied with emphasis on their capacity to promote growth under drought. Endophytic communities segregated along a north-south gradient in correlation with geo-climatic parameters. Screening of 120 endophytes indicated that <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots select for bacteria with multiple PGP traits. Bacteria rapidly cross-colonized the root tissues of different species of plants, including the original Tunisian <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivar, Saudi Arabian cultivars and Arabidopsis. Selected endophytes significantly increased the biomass of <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> exposed to repeated drought stress periods during a 9 -month greenhouse experiment.

Materials used for this study were midribs of fronds of different <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> varieties available in Saudi Arabia and Portland cement (Type I) manufactured by Yammama Cement Company. To achieve this aim, hydration tests of net cement and date palm-cement mixture were carried out using a 2 -litter Dewar flask. The suitability of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> for this industry was made according to inhibitory index (I) and compatibility factor (C A), which were calculated from the hydration data. The results showed that under untreated condition, <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> particles are incompatible with cement and were classified as "unsuitable " for making wood-cement boards. Using of cold or hot water extraction for <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> materials resulted in an enhancement in their compatibility with cement.

Libya is a typical example of a country where medicinal plants are widely used. Plant extracts of five Libyan medicinal plants were used in this study to investigate their in vivo effects on spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in male rats and on ovulation and fertility in female rats. The In vitro effects of these plant extracts were also investigated on TM 3 Leydig cells and MCF 7 breast cancer cells. A phyto-chemical analysis of the five Libyan medicinal plants (flaxseed, black seeds, radish seed, <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen and nutmeg) was done. The results showed that <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen had a higher antioxidant activity than all of the above mentioned plants. In addition to this, Nigella sativa was observed to possess high flavonol content as well as high antioxidant activity. Male rats exposed to flaxseed, radish seeds and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen showed no significant alterations in body weight gain, whereas <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (240 mg/kg, p 0. 05) increase in Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. Besides this, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in testis was increased significantly by radish seed (160 mg/kg), flaxseed (200 mg/kg) and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (120 mg/kg). There was also improved catalase activity in testis of male rats exposed to radish seed and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen. Regarding male sexual behavior, the time to reach the female and the mount frequency decreased significantly in male rats exposed to flaxseed (300 mg/kg) and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg; p > 0. 05) thus, these plant extracts exhibit aphrodisiac properties.

However, the relative uterus weights exposed to nutmeg (200 mg/kg) and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg) were significantly decreased (p 0. 05 or 0. 01) when the female rats have been exposed to black seed (200 mg/kg), nutmeg (200 mg/kg) or <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (120 mg/kg). The LH level significantly (p 0. 05). The creatinine activity in female rat serum in all treated groups was significantly decreased (p 0 · 05) and <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollen (500 μg/ml; p > 0 · 01). MCf- 7 cells treated with BS 10 - 50 μg/ml black seed and nutmeg 10 - 50 μg/ml significantly increased cell proliferation.
