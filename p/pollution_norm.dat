Under this concept as it is promulgated, ships visiting ports are hooked on to local grid power or other power sources, which are already {{regulated}} by local <b>pollution</b> <b>norms.</b> This externally sourced power serves the ship's internal cargo handling machinery and hotelling requirements. Effectively, all the power generating sources are shut down and ship is hence cold-ironed.This brings immediate relief from pollution by shipboard emissions and allows a more holistic maintenance schedule to be followed by ship operators, which are typically hard put to maintain planned maintenance schedules due to commercial operating pressures. The immediate result is lowered heat outputs from ships, lowered air emissions, lowered risk of accidents from fuel based machinery, lowered disturbance to the ecosystem, among various others.|$|R

40|$|The recent <b>pollution</b> <b>norms</b> {{have brought}} a strong {{emphasis}} on the reduction of diesel engine emissions. Low temperature combustion technology such as premixed compression ignition (PCI) has the capability to significantly and simultaneously reduce nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), thus meeting these specific <b>pollution</b> <b>norms.</b> There has been, however, observed loss in fuel conversion efficiency in some cases. This study analyzes how energy transfer and brake fuel conversion efficiency alter with (or are affected by) injection timings and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate. The study is conducted for PCI combustion for four injection timings of 9 ?, 12 ?, 15 ? and 18 ? before top dead center (BTDC) and for four exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates of 39 %, 40 %, 41 % and 42 %. The data is collected from the experimental apparatus located in General Motors Collaborative Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan. The heat release is calculated to obtain various in-cylinder energy transfers. The brake fuel conversion efficiency decreases with an increase in EGR. The decrease in the brake fuel conversion efficiency is due to the decrease in work output. This decrease is due to an increase in the pumping work and an increase in friction and decrease in gross indicated work. The decrease in the combustion efficiency is because of the increased formation of unburnt products due to increased ignition delay caused by the application of EGR and decreasing air-fuel (A/F) ratio. A definite trend is not obtained for the contribution of heat transfer to the total energy distribution. However the total heat transfer decreases with retardation of injection timing because of decreasing combustion temperature. As the injection timing is retarded, the brake fuel conversion efficiency is found to decrease. This decrease is because of a decrease in net work output. This is because the time available for utilization of the energy released is less because of late combustion. The total heat transfer decreases with retardation of injection timing because of decreasing combustion temperature. The contribution of heat transfer to the total energy distribution decreases with increase in EGR...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the structure of laminar axisymmetric coflow hydrogen diffusion flames. The motivation behind studying these flames is the current drive towards sustainable energy and strict <b>pollution</b> <b>norms.</b> In this regard, hydrogen as a fuel is one such candidate, which burns clean and possesses the capability as a future sustainable energy carrier. In addition, hydrogen flames are known to have many interesting properties arising mainly from finite-rate chemistry, thermal diffusion, and large differences in diffusion coefficients between H 2 and other molecules. Considerable research will be needed to understand H 2 diffusion flame structure in practical devices, which often possess multidimensional turbulent flow and complex chemical kinetics. Studying flame structure using the model flames discussed in this thesis can provide insight into the behavior of practical systems. The study of steady laminar flames also allows direct comparison of measurements with theoretical predictions. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{controversial}} Krishna Tissue {{paper mill}} {{was set up}} near the National Highway 6, 1 km from the Ghoraghata railway station. Initially, it was a welcome addition as it promised jobs and development for the region. However, {{it turned out that}} the paper mill was a source of huge pollution. Any paper mill uses huge amounts of water and is normally located close to a river. However, in this case it is located far from the nearest river, primarily because of its locational advantage near the highway. It draws a huge amount of underground water and environmentalists worry that this may lead to a drop in the underground water table level in the long run. The discharge of poisonous gases such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide was a cause of major concern for the neighboring people. A protest group was formed which demanded that the factory discharges must adhere to the <b>pollution</b> <b>norms.</b> Some even demanded the closing of the factory. The strife between the factory management and the locals ("Krishna Tissue Dushon Protirodh Committee") is still happening.|$|R

In this paper, the author suggests testing the monitoring and enforcement efforts of city wastewater pollution control authorities, which are affected by local community characteristics that act as proxies for political power. We utilize the dataset of plant-level annual emission data from 31 provinces in China to serve the model environmental pollution equilibrium. Use demand for residual disposal service and supply of residual disposal service to test the efficiency of the community on government monitoring enforcement.

The European tolerance for NOx emission of diesel light duty vehicles has been divided by 3 between 2000 and 2009. The Euro 6 norm will be even more strict and diesel ICE based vehicles have to deal with this constraint. HEVs can be a solution for automotive industry to reduce emission and respect more easily the current and ongoing norms. On the other hand, safety must be kept at high level in the HEVs. The interaction between the regenerative braking for example and the different systems for safety (ABS, ESP, [...] .) has to be carefully considered. To achieve the consumption and emission target without generating safety problems or prohibitive additional cost a global design optimization is strongly recommended. Three interdependent dimensions should be taken into account in the optimization approach: i) the drive train architecture, ii) the components type and size iii) the energy management. A two level, model based, optimisation methodology could be established. The lower level deals with the energy management optimization using different methods such as dynamic programming or the Pontryagin minimum theory. This level is activated when the vehicle architecture and the different components are known. The upper level operates the variations in the components design parameters using iterative methods or genetic algorithms for example. The global design should also consider either the typical use profile or the most stringent use specification.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Industrialization {{coupled with}} urbanizaton {{has led to}} stress in the Buckingham Canal which runs {{parallel}} to Bay of Bengal {{at a distance of}} around 1 km from the coastline. 4 sediment cores were collected along Ennore – Pulicat stretch to determine acid leachable trace metal concentration. Core samples were collected using gravity corer. The cores were sliced horizontally at 2. 5 cm to determine the grain size, sediment composition, pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate, acid leachable trace metals; cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc. The trace metals were extracted using acid mixture containing hydro fluoric acid, nitric acid and sulphuric acid and analysed by atomic emission spectrophotometer. In an attempt to infer anthropogenic input from geogenic input, several approaches including comparison with sediment quality guidelines – ecotoxicological sense of heavy metal contamination and classification by quantitative indexes such as geoaccumalation index, anthropogenic factor, enrichment factor, contamination factor and degree and pollution load index was attempted. Grain size analysis and sediment composition of core samples shows Ennore is sandy in nature having a neutral pH. Organic matter enrichment is observed to a higher extent in core 3. Core 2 at a depth of 5 cm shows organic matter of 9. 4 %. calcium carbonate is totally absent at the surface sediments in core 2. Cores collected within the canal showed a higher heavy metal concentration than the cores collected from Pulicat lagoon and 2 km into the Ennore Sea. The trace metal concentration for cadmium, lead and zinc in Ennore does not pose a threat to the sediment dwelling fauna whereas chromium and copper are likely to pose a threat. Quantitative indexes place Ennore under moderately polluted. Ennore is likely to face a serious threat of metal pollution with the present deposition rates unless stringent <b>pollution</b> control <b>norms</b> are adopted...|$|R

In all of the samples was determined the total quantity of microorganism, enterococcus and coliform bacterium in two settings. Setting an overall quantity of microorganism gives the final quality of milk. The limit for fresh milk is, according to legislation, 100 000 KTJ/ml. This limit was not fulfilled by the first cow from the family farm in no case of all the settings. Overlimited CPM was found during the third setting by samples from family farm and large-capacity cow house by all of cows, too. In other cases of setting were samples suitable. Setting enterococcus. For these days cancelled norm was setting the same amount as by the coliform bacterium, i. e. 1000 KTJ/ml. The limit fulfilled samples from large-capacity cow house as well as the private farm in 4 of 6 settings.

30|$|Martin and Rothery (1981) present seven micro-genres {{that are}} typical of primary and {{secondary}} school writing in Australia: observations/comments, recounts, reports, narratives, expositions, thematic narratives, and literacy criticisms. In each micro-genre, there is a structural pattern, which is called its schematic structure. Schematic structures present specific stages for each micro-genre (see e.g., Eggins 2004; Martin 1992). Each stage in the schematic structure of a text is instrumental in constructing a genre as the stages enable the genre to achieve its communicative purpose (Eggins 2004). Martin and Rothery (1981) analysed texts written by young children in kindergarten and in years 1 and 2 in primary schools in Australia to identify what micro-genres the children were taught to write. They found that the main micro-genres were narrative ones such as comments, recounts, and reports. Martin and Rothery (1981) argue that young learners need to be provided with more varieties of micro-genre {{to be successful in}} English writing. Woodward-Kron (2002) investigated the micro-genres found in twenty essays assigned in a Department of Education at an undergraduate level in an Australian university. She found that, while all the essays could be classified as either expositions or discussions, other micro-genres such as descriptive reports and exemplums were embedded within them. Chen and Foley (2004) investigated English texts classified as expositions written by fifty Chinese university students. They examined the students’ use of nominalisation (Halliday 1998) such as <b>pollution</b> as a <b>norm</b> form of the verb, pollute.
