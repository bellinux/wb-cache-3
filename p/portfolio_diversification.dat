40|$|For {{more than}} three decades, {{empirical}} analysis of stochastic dominance was restricted to settings with mutually exclusive choice alternatives. In recent years, a number of methods for testing efficiency of diversified portfolios have emerged, which can be classified into three main categories: 1) majorization, 2) revealed preference and 3) distribution-based approaches. Unfortunately, some of these schools of thought are developing independently, with little interaction or crossreferencing among them. Moreover, the methods differ {{in terms of their}} objectives, the information content of the results and their computational complexity. As a result, the relative merits of alternative approaches are difficult to compare. This paper presents the first systematic review of all three approaches in a unified methodological framework.

40|$|The study {{examines}} empirically whether, {{and to what}} extent, equity markets in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are integrated inter-regionally. According to the official Charter of the GCC, building stronger ties among financial and capital markets of member states is a chief objective of the GCC. The results for the equity markets of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman suggest that these markets share a common stochastic trend that binds them together over the long-run. The results from alternative tests also indicate that measures taken since 1997 to liberalize the capital markets in the Gulf region are at least partly responsible for linking the Gulf markets. At least two implications emerge from these results. First, <b>portfolio</b> <b>diversifications</b> {{in the context of}} the Gulf region should bring little or no benefits to investors with long-term horizons, although short-term gains remain a possibility. Second, further steps to liberalize capital markets in the region appear an appropriate strategy for achieving a more integrated capital markets in the Gulf. ...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty {{in stock}} market {{investing}} is remaining unsolved. Investment in portfolio {{is one of}} the solutions to minimize the uncertainty effect. Hence, unit trusts become one of the best investment alternatives for the public investors. However, many researchers discovered that unit trusts' performances are not as good as expected. Therefore, fund managers need a new vigorous portfolio selection model in order to maximize the <b>portfolio's</b> <b>diversification</b> benefit. In solving uncertainty issues, fuzzy approaches are widely applied in engineering, computing and management sciences, but in finance, it is still at an infancy stage. Therefore, the study has investigated the effectiveness of the fuzzy approach in solving the uncertainty issues in stock market investing. Using data sample from Bursa Malaysia for the period of January 1998 to June 2009, the study has examined the VBS fuzzy model and the MV model in constructing various types of portfolios in different market trends. Linear programming optimization tool was used to construct the portfolios' efficient frontier. The study discovered that in the whole period, rising and sideway market trends, 70 % of the MV portfolios are having higher diversification benefit compared to the VBS fuzzy portfolios. In the falling market trend, the result shows that 90 % of the VBS fuzzy portfolios are performing better. Upon the finding, the study has extended the asset return variable in the MV model using fuzzy approach. The effectiveness of the extended MV model then has been tested for <b>portfolio</b> the <b>diversification</b> benefit and the ability to generate cumulative abnormal return...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of the financial system is associated with systemic risk {{factors such as the}} concurrent default of numerous small obligors. Hence it is of utmost importance to study the mutual dependence of losses for different creditors in the case of large, overlapping credit portfolios. We analytically calculate the multivariate joint loss distribution of several credit portfolios on a non-stationary market. To take fluctuating asset correlations into account we use an random matrix approach which preserves, as a much appreciated side effect, analytical tractability and drastically reduces the number of parameters. We show that for two disjoint credit <b>portfolios</b> <b>diversification</b> does not work in a correlated market. Additionally we find large concurrent portfolio losses to be rather likely. We show that significant correlations of the losses emerge not only for large portfolios with thousands of credit contracts but also for small portfolios consisting of a few credit contracts only. Furthermore we include subordination levels, which were established in collateralized debt obligations to protect the more senior tranches from high losses. We analytically corroborate the observation that an extreme loss of the subordinated creditor is likely to also yield a large loss of the senior creditor. Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
