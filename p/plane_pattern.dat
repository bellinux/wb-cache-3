40|$|A simple {{rectangular}} {{microstrip antenna}} on low dielectric constant substrate such as air for improved radiation beam performance is theoretically investigated. The conventional patch antenna fabricated on common substrates always produces quite broader E <b>plane</b> <b>pattern</b> compared to its H plane.

The complete quantitative analysis to explore such radiation beam characteristics for both the structures (conventional and the present one) is also presented in this paper. An easy and handful relationship between the length of patch antenna and its fringing length for different types of substrate is established in the background of 3 dB beam widths.

40|$|Chromostereopsis {{is a type}} {{of visual}} {{perception}} where a specific color is perceived closer to or farther from the observer than other colors in the <b>plane</b> <b>pattern.</b> The mechanism is considered to be binocular stereopsis by the chromatic aberration of the eyeball optical subsystem, but there are large individual differences in natural viewing conditions. For example, {{in the case of a}} red-blue pattern with black background, about 70 % of observers perceive the red pattern to be closer while 20 % perceive the blue pattern to be closer. In the present research, the binocular disparity of the chromostereopsis was estimated both experimentally and numerically and the reason for the individual differences studied. First, the disparity was measured using a constant method, in which a stereo pair of red-blue stimulus patterns (random dots) was presented on a black background. The distance between the red and blue patterns for the right eye image was varied to generate a binocular disparity. It was found that the range of the equivalent disparity was between − 1. 3 and 2. 1 arcmin among 24 subjects. Numerical simulation based on ray-tracing using LeGrand's model eye showed good agreement with the experimental results. The simulation results indicate that when the outer or inner edge of the pupil is shielded, the binocular disparity of the chromostereopsis was drastically changed. We conclude that this situation might occur due to the eccentricity of the center of the pupil and be the main factor of the individual differences in the chromostereopsis in natural viewing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{reference}} posture is important when investigating rearfoot motion in clinical populations.

This study examined the relationship between the rearfoot frontal <b>plane</b> <b>pattern</b> of motion and three reference postures during the stance phase of walking in healthy and patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) subjects. The three reference postures investigated were: Relaxed Standing posture, subtalar joint neutral position (STJN) and when the calcaneus and the lower leg were vertically aligned (Vertical Alignment). The rearfoot inversion/eversion during the stance phase was measured in 14 healthy subjects and 13 subjects with diagnosed PFPS using three dimensional motion analysis with the three different reference postures. The graphs of rearfoot inversion/eversion motion were overlaid with the angle at the rearfoot in the static posture and any intersection between the static angle and rearfoot motion was noted. An ANOVA showed significant differences in static posture between the groups for Relaxed Standing (p = 0. 01), and STJN (p = 0. 02). For both groups, with Relaxed Standing as a reference posture, the mean rearfoot pattern of motion did not intersect the Relaxed Standing static angle during the stance phase. The use of Vertical Alignment reference posture, however, showed an intersection of this reference posture through the rearfoot pattern of motion. The use of the Vertical Alignment reference posture also generated a typical rearfoot motion pattern for both groups and therefore it may be an appropriate reference posture for both healthy and PFPS individual...|$|E
