40|$|The {{level of}} {{vigilance}} for a staff in Air Traffic Controller (ATC) {{needs to be}} optimally sustained. In order to maintain safe flight, his level of vigilance will determine his work quality. This {{study was conducted to}} analyze the correlation between the level of vigilance and the license, rating, work period, work unit, <b>radar</b> <b>equipment,</b> AirNav classification for ATC staffs in Indonesia. The research design applied a cross-sectional study with a total sample of 51 persons at AirNav Surabaya and Lombok. The data were analyzed using a non-parametric test with statistical test of contingency coefficient. The result showed significant and not significant correlation of the variables analyzed, namely license, rating, work period, work unit, <b>radar</b> <b>equipment,</b> and AirNav classification. Those significant variables were the rating, work unit, <b>radar</b> <b>equipment,</b> and classification of AirNav all with value of the contingency coefficient = 0. 000, while the work period and the license were not significantly correlated as the value of the contingency coefficient = 0. 180 and 0. 497 respectively.
