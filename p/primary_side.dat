25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the <b>primary</b> <b>side</b> of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the <b>primary</b> <b>side</b> is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A high step-up DC-DC {{converter}} {{is proposed}} in this paper. The proposed converter has two transformers. The <b>primary</b> <b>sides</b> {{of them are}} paralleled virtually and the secondary sides have series connection to increase the voltage gain. An active clamp {{circuit is employed to}} suppress the switch voltage stresses and obtain zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) operation of the switches. Voltage doubler is selected as an output rectifier to increase the voltage gain and confine the voltage across the output diodes to the output voltage. Since the output diode currents are controlled by the total leakage inductance of the transformers, the reverse-recovery problem of the output diodes is significantly alleviated. Due to the ZVS operation and the alleviated reverse-recovery problem, the switching losses of the proposed converter are significantly reduced and the efficiency is improved. Steady-state analysis is performed. Experimental results based on a prototype are also provided to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed converter...|$|R

To satisfy stringent efficiency considerations, the PFC circuit implements an adjustable frequency fold back to reduce switching losses as the load is going light. To cope with all the signal sequencing required by the ATX and flat TVs specifications, the controller includes several dedicated pins enabling handshake between the secondary and the <b>primary</b> <b>sides.</b> These signals include a power−good line but also a control pin which turns the controller on and off via an opto coupler.
