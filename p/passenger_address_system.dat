50|$|In 1985, a new {{generation}} of advanced suburban passenger train was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581-3608 and T4247-4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, door chimes and <b>passenger</b> <b>address</b> <b>systems.</b> They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers to open the doors manually, but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but {{with the addition of a}} fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.|$|R
5000|$|A given <b>passenger's</b> <b>address</b> in this <b>system</b> {{would be}} {{infinite}} in length, corresponding to a decimal form {{of one of}} the real numbers ranging from 0 (address 0-0-0...) to 1 (address 9-9-9...). Exactly one guest would have the address corresponding to one-sixth (1-6-6-6...), for example, and another to the value of pi minus three (1-4-1-5...). (Real numbers that have terminating decimal expansions, like 3/8 = [...]375, actually correspond to two passengers, one with an address ending in an infinite string of zeroes, the other ending in an infinite string of nines. For example, 3/8 = [...]375000... = [...]374999... corresponds both to the <b>passenger</b> with <b>address</b> 3-7-5-0-0-0... and to the <b>passenger</b> with <b>address</b> 3-7-4-9-9-9...) The set of real numbers, and the set of guests in this example, is uncountably infinite. Because no one-to-one pairing can be made between countable and uncountable sets, rooms at the hotel cannot be made for all of these guests, although any countably infinite subset of them can still be accommodated — for example, the set of guests whose addresses terminate in an infinitely repeating sequence, corresponding to a rational number.|$|R

Besides, it is noted that standardization of <b>address</b> <b>system</b> itself may not be so difficult in abstract level; however implementation and continual management of address database as an application of address standard may face challenges and difficulties. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Besides their {{practical}} implications, public <b>address</b> <b>systems,</b> including megaphones, {{also had}} a social impact. Public <b>address</b> <b>systems</b> helped promote women’s participation in society. In events like the National Republican and Democratic Conventions of 1920, when electronic public <b>address</b> <b>systems</b> were first becoming popularized, women used these amplifying technologies during roll call of participants. [...] Later, portable electric megaphones extended this equalizing influence to outdoor events.|$|R
