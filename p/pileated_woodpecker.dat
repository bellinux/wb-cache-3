5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California ground squirrel, western gray squirrel, and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{found in}} the forest are <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> crows, owls and other birds of prey.|$|R

Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
25|$|We {{have found}} no signs of ivory-billed woodpeckers. No sightings, double knocks or calls, no replies to our many double-knock imitations. We have seen a few {{cavities}} of the appropriate size and shape for ivory-bills, but these can be old, or exceptionally large <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> cavities, or mammal-enlarged <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> cavities.… Given the results, it is unlikely a population of any meaningful size of ivory-billed woodpeckers exists in south Florida.|$|E

50|$|Up to four {{subspecies}} of <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> {{have been}} recognized historically. However, many authors only recognize two subspecies, the southernly D. p. pileatus and the northerly D. p. abieticola, and {{the differences between the}} other two subspecies other than range are not well described. Generally, <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> follow Bergmann's rule being smaller and more compact in the south (D. p. pileatus) and larger in the north (D. p. abieticola). The ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below.|$|R

25|$|The bird is shiny blue-black {{with white}} {{markings}} on its neck {{and back and}} extensive white on {{the trailing edge of}} both the upper- and underwing. The underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, and chalky white in juveniles. Ivory-bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory-billed woodpecker is black. When perched with the wings folded, birds of both sexes present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape. These characteristics distinguish them from the smaller and darker-billed <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> normally is brownish-black, smoky, or slaty black in color. It also has a white neck stripe, but the back is normally black. <b>Pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileated woodpeckers normally have no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched, normally show only a small patch of white {{on each side of the}} body near the edge of the wing. However, pileated woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker has a strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed tongue. Among North American woodpeckers, the ivory-billed woodpecker is unique in having a bill whose tip is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel.|$|E
25|$|The vast forested wildlands, {{coupled with}} a low rate of human {{settlement}} in the rugged remote terrain, makes for excellent habitat {{for a number of}} species. Mammal species include mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, lynx, raccoons, martens, fishers, beavers, grey fox, red fox, northern flying squirrel, and plentiful deer. Bird species include golden eagles, bald eagles, <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> band-tailed pigeon, several hawks including goshawks, several large owl species including the spotted owl, plus an extensive variety of additional species both plant and animal.|$|E
25|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} at Maurice K. Goddard State Park attracts {{a variety of}} birds. Bald eagles and osprey can be seen flying over Lake Wilhelm as they scan the waters for fish. The old fields and forests are home to woodcocks, nighthawks, snipes, {{and a variety of}} warblers. Migrating waterfowl like the loon, common teal, goldeneye, merganser, and bufflehead stop by Lake Wilhelm in the spring and fall. Woodpeckers including the <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> live in the woods of the park. Bluebirds and purple martins make their homes in the old fields and meadows of Maurice K. Goddard State Park.|$|E

25|$|New video {{analysis}} of pileated woodpeckers in escape flights {{comparable to that}} of the putative ivory-billed woodpecker filmed in Arkansas shows that pileated woodpeckers can display a wingbeat frequency equivalent to that of the Arkansas bird during escape flight. The critical frames from the Arkansas video that were used to identify the bird as an ivory-billed woodpecker are shown to be equally, or more, compatible with the pileated woodpecker.…The identification of the bird filmed in Arkansas in April 2004 as an ivory-billed woodpecker is best regarded as unsafe. The similarities between the Arkansas bird and known pileated woodpeckers suggest that it was most likely a <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Michael Collins {{reported}} nine {{sightings of}} Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Pearl River in Louisiana in 2006 and 2008, including an encounter in which kent calls came from two directions {{at the same}} time, and an additional sighting (of two birds) in the Choctawhatchee River in 2007. Three of these sightings are supported by video evidence. Additional analysis of these videos was published in an earlier paper, along with comments by independent experts. Bret Tobalske, an ornithologist who specializes in the flight mechanics of woodpeckers, performed an analysis of wing motion {{and concluded that the}} bird in the 2008 video is a large woodpecker. Only two large woodpeckers occur north of Mexico, but the flap rate is about ten standard deviations greater than the mean flap rate of the <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The flight speed, narrow wings, and prominent white patches on the dorsal surfaces of the wings are also consistent with ivory-billed but not <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Avian artist Julie Zickefoose analyzed the 2006 video and commented on the [...] "rared-back pose, long but fluffy and squared-off crest, and extremely long, erect head and neck" [...] and an unusual short flight that {{does not seem to be}} consistent with a <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> A size comparison was carried out using part of the tree in which the bird in the 2006 video was perched. Two forks made it possible to scale frames from the video relative to a photo of a <b>pileated</b> <b>woodpecker</b> specimen that was mounted on the tree. On the basis of the comparison, it is clear that the bird in the video is a large woodpecker, and the size appears to be consistent with an ivory-billed woodpecker. The 2007 video shows events involving a woodpecker delivering a blow that is accompanied by an audible double knock, unusual swooping flights that are consistent with historical accounts of the ivory-billed woodpecker, and a takeoff with deep and rapid flaps that are similar to the flaps of the closely related imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) taking off.|$|E
