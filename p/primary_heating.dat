Io is in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Europa and a 4:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Ganymede, completing two orbits of Jupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by Ganymede.

The primary fuel salt circulation system consisted of the reactor vessel, a single fuel salt pump, and a single <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Heat was transferred from the fuel salt to a coolant salt circuit in the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger.

The coolant salt passed from the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger to an air-cooled radiator and a coolant salt pump, and then returned to the <b>primary</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger. Each of the salt loops was provided with drain tanks, located such that the salt could be drained out of either circuit by gravity.
