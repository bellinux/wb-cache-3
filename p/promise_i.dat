500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I <b>promise</b> <b>I</b> will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E
