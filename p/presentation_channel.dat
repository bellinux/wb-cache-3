Experi-ment 1 {{examined the effects of}} representation type (word-only versus word-plus-picture) and <b>presentation</b> <b>channel</b> (visual-only versus visual-plus-auditory) on recall and immediate-JOL in fixed-rate learning conditions. Experiment 2 examined the effects of representation type (word-only versus word-plus-picture) and presentation media (computer versus paper) on recall and delayed-JOL in self-paced learning conditions. The results showed that recall performance was better in word-only conditions than in word-plus-picture conditions in Experiment 1, and better in computer conditions than in paper conditions in Experiment 2. Multimodal information had no influence on magnitude of people’s judgment. Participants were over-confident in all conditions, but more overconfident in computer conditions than in paper conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: When {{considering}} {{the addition of}} a mobile <b>presentation</b> <b>channel</b> to an existing web-based application, project managers should know how the mobile channel’s characteristics will impact the user experience and the cost of using the application, even before development begins. The PETTICOAT (Performance Tuning and cost discovery of mobile web-based Applications) approach presented here provides decision-makers with indicators on the economical feasibility of mobile channel development. In a nutshell, it involves analysing interaction patterns on the existing stationary channel, identifying key business processes among them, measuring the time and data volume incurred in their execution, and then simulating how the same interaction patterns would run when subjected to the frame conditions of a mobile channel. As a result of the simulation, we then gain time and volume projections for those interaction patterns that allow us to estimate the costs incurred by executing certain business processes on different mobile channels...|$|E

40|$|In web-based applications, most user {{interactions}} {{take the}} form of navigating between web pages. The structure of the navigation model thus has a strong impact on a web application’s usability. However, specifying a user-friendly navigation model for complex applications can be timeconsuming, especially when designing for multiple <b>presentation</b> <b>channels.</b> We therefore present the formal semantics of the Dialog Flow Notation (DFN) that provides constructs for the design of modular navigation models, and especially focus on constructs that reduce the specification redundancy within and between channels, thus reducing the design effort for web-based user interfaces. 1...|$|R
40|$|Summary This thesis {{introduces}} a notation for specifying the dialog flow of hypertext-based applications, i. e. {{the succession of}} hypertext pages displayed on the client and application logic operations performed on the server. A key concept is the encapsulation of multiple dialog steps in context-independent dialog modules, which can be nested arbitrarily. The notation {{is accompanied by a}} framework that implements a dialog control logic capable of handling multiple <b>presentation</b> <b>channels,</b> leaving only the tasks of implementing the business logic, designing the user interface and specifying the dialog flow to the application developer...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} {{the addition of}} a mobile <b>presentation</b> <b>channel</b> to an existing web-based application, a key question that has to be answered even before development begins is how the mobile channel’s characteristics will impact the user experience and the cost of using the application. If either of these factors is outside acceptable limits, economical considerations may forbid adding the channels, even if it would be feasible from a purely technical perspective. Both of these factors depend considerably on two metrics: The time required to transmit data over the mobile network, and the volume transmitted. The PETTICOAT method presented in this paper uses the dialog flow model and web server log files of an existing application to identify typical interaction sequences and to compile volume statistics, which are then run through a tool that simulates the volume and time that would be incurred by executing the interaction sequences on a mobile channel. From the simulated volume and time data, we can then calculate the cost of accessing the application on a mobile channel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While the {{separation}} of presentation and application logic is widely practiced in web-based applications today, many do not cleanly separate application and dialog control logic, which leads to inflexible implementations especially when multiple <b>presentation</b> <b>channels</b> shall be served by the same application logic. We therefore present a notation for specifying the complete dialog flow of an application separately from the application logic and show how to construct a formal metamodel for it using the OMG’s Meta-Object Facility (MOF). This allows the validation of dialog flow models, {{as well as the}} generation of machine-readable dialog flow specifications from graphical models. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, {{client-server}} {{applications are}} implemented as web-based applications with user interfaces consisting entirely of web pages or equivalent renderings on other <b>presentation</b> <b>channels</b> (e. g. mobile or speech-based devices). However, the page-based medium and the stateless pull communication impose {{restrictions on the}} user interface that often manifest themselves in unsatisfactory dialog control, i. e. possibly severely diminished usability. We therefore present a Dialog Flow Notation that allows developers to encapsulate sequences of multiple dialog steps into reusable dialog modules that can be nested arbitrarily, and to specify different interaction patterns for different devices. The notation is complemented with a Dialog Control Framework that manages dialog flows on multiple channels, leaving only the tasks of implementing the device-independent application logic, designing the interface pages, and specifying the dialog flow to the developer...|$|R

40|$|The {{categories}} that social targets belong to are often activated automatically. Most studies investigating social categorization have used visual stimuli or verbal labels, whereas ethnolinguistic identity theory posits that language {{is an essential}} dimension of ethnic identity. Language should therefore be used for social categorization. In 2 experiments, using the "Who Said What?" paradigm, the authors investigated social categorization by using accents (auditory stimuli) and looks (visual stimuli) to indicate ethnicity, either separately or in combination. Given either looks or accents only, the authors demonstrated that ethnic categorization can be based on accents, and the authors found a similar degree of ethnic categorization by accents and looks. When ethnic cues of looks and accents were combined by creating cross categories, {{there was a clear}} predominance of accents as meaningful cues for categorization, as shown in the respective parameters of a multinomial model. The present findings are discussed with regard to the generalizability of findings using one <b>channel</b> of <b>presentation</b> (e. g., visual) and the asymmetry found with different <b>presentation</b> <b>channels</b> for the category ethnicity...|$|R
