40|$|Abstract: The LInear {{amplification}} using Nonlinear Components (LINC) {{technique is}} a well-known power amplifier linearization method to reduce adjacent channel interference in a nonconstant envelope modulation system. Its major drawback is the inherited sensitivity to gain and <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> between the two amplifier branches. In this paper two novel adaptive full-digital base band methods are described which correct any gain and <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> in LINC transmitters.

50|$|For {{a circuit}} modeled with an ideal source, an output impedance, and an input impedance; the {{circuits}} input reactance can be sized {{to be the}} negative of the output reactance of the load. In this scenario the reactive component of the input impedance cancels the reactive component of the output impedance of the load. The resulting equivalent circuit is purely resistive in nature, {{and there are no}} losses due to <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> in the source or the load.|$|E
5000|$|In AC {{circuits}} carrying power, {{the losses}} {{due to the}} reactive component of the impedance can be significant. These losses manifest themselves in a phenomenon called <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance,</b> where the current is out of phase (lagging behind or ahead) with the voltage. Therefore, {{the product of the}} current and the voltage is less than what it would be if the current and voltage were in phase. With DC sources, reactive circuits have no impact, therefore power factor correction is not necessary.|$|E
50|$|Three phase {{induction}} motors {{are probably}} {{the most common type of}} three phase load and are used in a variety of equipment including refrigeration, pumps, air conditioning, conveyor drives as well as their more obvious applications. The de-rating effects of overvoltage and three <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> on AC motors are well known. Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, the {{two types}} of {{imbalances}} will be addressed sequentially in the control strategy: first, the <b>phase</b> <b>imbalanced</b> is compensated through the modification of the phase references, and the amplitude imbalance is compensated by generating the same reference voltage, because the voltage generated by the SIEGs depends strongly on the variation of the prime mover.|$|R

40|$|We perform 3 D {{finite element}} {{calculations}} {{of the fields}} in microwave cavities and analyze the distributed cavity phase errors of atomic clocks that they produce. The fields of cylindrical cavities are treated as an azimuthal Fourier series. Each of the lowest components produces clock errors with unique characteristics that must be assessed to establish a clock's accuracy. We describe the errors and how to evaluate them. We prove that sharp structures in the cavity do not produce large frequency errors, even at moderately high powers, provided the atomic density varies slowly. We model the amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> of the feeds. For larger couplings, these can lead to increased phase errors. We show that <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> produce a novel distributed cavity phase error {{that depends on the}} cavity detuning. We also design improved cavities by optimizing the geometry and tuning the mode spectrum so that there are negligible phase variations, allowing this source of systematic error to be dramatically reduced.

50|$|Four stroke engines with 4 {{or fewer}} {{cylinders}} normally {{do not have}} overlapping power stroke, so tend to vibrate the engine back and forth rotationally on X-axis. Also, multi-cylinder engines with counter moving pistons have a CG height imbalance in a conrod swinging left on {{the top half of}} crank rotation, while another swings right on the bottom half, causing the top of the engine to move right while the bottom moves slightly to the left.

A ball {{in a ball}} bearing also slides as the diameter of inner and outer races are different and the distance of circumference differs from the inside and out. When a ball bearing is used as the main bearing on a crankshaft (which rarely is the case), eccentricity of the cage (race) normally creates a <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> in slide friction. Friction forces for plain/shell bearings (the {{most common type of}} bearings) are dependent upon diameter and width, which determine bearing surface area. This needs to be balanced for the pressure and the rotational speed of the load. Different main bearing sizes on a crankshaft create plane imbalance in slide friction.|$|E
5000|$|A final {{consideration}} with loads {{is to do}} with power quality. In addition to sustained overvoltages and undervoltages (voltage regulation issues) as well as sustained deviations from the system frequency (frequency regulation issues), power system loads can be adversely affected by a range of temporal issues. These include voltage sags, dips and swells, transient overvoltages, flicker, high frequency noise, <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> and poor power factor. Power quality issues occur when the power supply to a load deviates from the ideal: For an AC supply, the ideal is the current and voltage in-sync fluctuating as a perfect sine wave at a prescribed frequency with the voltage at a prescribed amplitude. For DC supply, the ideal is the voltage not varying from a prescribed level. Power quality issues can be especially important {{when it comes to}} specialist industrial machinery or hospital equipment.|$|E

40|$|In energy-constrained {{applications}} like Body Area Networks (BAN) receiver {{performance is}} traded for lower power consumption. The limited receiver performance will deteriorate the output signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) of the receiver. In this paper we present closed-form output SNR and BER models of a non-ideal receiver front-end with limiter-discriminator demodulator for binary FSK. The presented model is very useful {{in defining the}} minimally required receiver specifications. Moreover, the models are useful for gaining insight into the influences of the receiver impairments on its performance. In the models, the gain and <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> between the in-phase and quadrature-phase paths {{as well as the}} receiver generated noise and the phase noise produced by the local frequency reference are taken into account. This paper shows that the gain and <b>phase</b> <b>imbalances</b> shift the FM threshold to higher carrier-to-noise-ratios (CNR) and only have small influence on the SNR above threshold. On the other hand, receiver generated noise reduces the output SNR both below and above the FM threshold, and phase noise limits the maximum output SNR.

40|$|Abstract—Phase {{imbalance}} {{has been}} considered {{as a source of}} inefficiency in the data center that causes energy loss due to line impedance and increases reactive power. Strategies assume high loss due to <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> and propose sophisticated energy management algorithms including phase balance aware workload scheduling algorithm and dynamic power distribution unit assignment to servers. However, such attempts do not utilize an objective measure of the inefficiencies due to <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> to evaluate the significance of their contributions. Excessive imbalance in a three phase load has various undesirable effects. This paper, first objectively characterizes the inefficiencies due to <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance</b> and then provides numerical measures of the losses in realistic data center deployments. Phase imbalanced load in a delta configuration results in reduced power factor, which is undesirable for several reasons. Also, an imbalanced load (both in delta or star configuration), results in higher line currents, leading to higher line loss. However, this increase in loss is a fraction of a percentage of the energy consumed. The paper also discusses effects of work load scheduling on <b>phase</b> <b>imbalance,</b> and how to minimize the same.
