25|$|Shaik's {{writing off}} of Zuma's {{significant}} personal loans in 1999 had raised suspicions about their financial activities. After Shaik's <b>petition</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Supreme Court of Appeal failed {{he started to}} serve his sentence of 15 years on 9 November 2006. After Shaik's brother, Chippy Shaik, was suspended from the Department of Defence for his involvement in a corrupt arms deal, Schabir Shaik was arrested in 2001 for the possession of secret documents, after which investigators {{found that he was}} involved in corrupt dealings with Zuma as well as fraud. He was brought to trial in October 2004, pleading not guilty.|$|E

5000|$|The {{defendants}} <b>petitioned</b> {{the court}} <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> for rehearing. They {{contended that the}} four erroneously admitted items of evidence were the key differences between the first trial, where the jury did not return a single guilty verdict, and the second trial, where the jury returned guilty verdicts on every count. [...] The court <b>of</b> <b>appeals</b> denied the <b>petition</b> for rehearing without comment.|$|R

5000|$|In Pennsylvania courts, {{the term}} is still {{commonly}} used to denote permission for {{an appeal to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Court, even though the procedure for obtaining discretionary review in the court is now called a <b>petition</b> for allowance <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> [...] See Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1112.

50|$|From these {{findings}} of fact the Court of Claims deduced, as a conclusion of law, that Brown was legally placed on the retired list, and had received the full amount of pay allowed him by law, and was not entitled to recover, and entered judgment dismissing the <b>petition.</b> The <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the petitioner brings that judgment under review.|$|R
5000|$|Cuccinelli, {{the local}} prosecutors, and Haynesworth's lawyers <b>petitioned</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>of</b> Virginia to grant a writ of innocence in the {{remaining}} two cases. Despite the unanimous agreement of the prosecutors and Cuccinelli (who, as attorney general, was the state's chief law enforcement officer), the court seemingly interpreted the new laws allowing for Haynesworth {{to make his case}} more strictly than the General Assembly intended, according to The New York Times. The court asked for further briefs from the parties to discuss whether the exonerating evidence should be [...] "conclusive".|$|R

500|$|Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) is a {{franchise}} cricket team based in Mohali, Punjab in India, {{and is one}} of the teams participating in the Indian Premier League (IPL). KXIP was founded in 2008. The franchise is owned by actress Preity Zinta, Ness Wadia of Bombay Dyeing, Karan Paul of the Apeejay Surendera Group and Mohit Burman of Dabur. The group paid [...] million to acquire the franchise. It is owned by a consortium, along with the Rajasthan Royals. Along with the Rajasthan Royals, KXIP's franchise agreement was terminated by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in October 2010, because the teams had been signed by people who were not members of the consortium which owned the team. A <b>petition</b> <b>of</b> arbitration (<b>appeal)</b> was filed to the Bombay High Court in November 2010, challenging the decision, which was accepted a month later.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2006, Kaliammal <b>petitioned</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> {{to declare}} that the High Court had erred in its earlier {{decision}} which concluded it had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of conversions to Islam. She had been hoping to exhume the body and perform a Hindu cremation. The court announced on 20 June 2006 that they would render a decision in September; however, they emphasised that their ruling would only concern {{the matter of the}} civil High Court's jurisdiction, and that they would not rule on whether Moorthy was a practising Hindu {{at the time of his}} death.|$|R
50|$|Lamberth, {{appointed}} to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, was known for speaking his mind. He repeatedly ruled for the Native Americans in their class-action lawsuit. His opinions condemned the government and found Interior secretaries Gale Norton and Bruce Babbitt in contempt of court for their handling of the case. The appellate court reversed Lamberth several times, including the contempt charge against Norton. After a particularly harsh opinion in 2005, in which Lamberth lambasted the Interior Department as racist, the government <b>petitioned</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> to remove him, saying he was too biased {{to continue with the}} case.|$|R

50|$|In November 2002 {{a similar}} {{decision}} {{in relation to}} adult offenders followed a successful challenge by convicted double murderer Anthony Anderson. Anderson had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1988 with a recommended minimum term of 15 years, but the Home Secretary later informed {{him that he would}} have to serve at least 20 years. The House of Lords ruled that this was incompatible with his human rights. This judgment was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights. Since then, judges have set minimum terms and only the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> or the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom can make any amendments to the sentence. Though politicians can no longer decide when or if a life sentence prisoner can be considered for parole, the Attorney General still has the power to <b>petition</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> in a bid to increase any prison terms which are seen as unduly lenient.|$|R
5000|$|The GSIS-Meralco {{case is a}} {{political}} controversy and pending legal case being heard by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. This complex case began with a complaint filed by the Philippines' Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines (SEC) questioning the unvalidated proxy votes used by the Lopez family in a board election of the Manila Electric Company (Meralco). The SEC issued a cease and desist order (CDO) against Meralco, which was ignored by the latter. [...] A show cause order (SCO) was then issued by the SEC, whereupon Meralco <b>petitioned</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals,</b> questioning {{the jurisdiction of the}} SEC. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) to the SEC while the Special 9th Division composed of Associate Justices Vicente Q. Roxas, Jose L. Sabio Jr. and Myrna Dimaranan Vidal heard the case. Roxas was assigned as the ponente while Sabio was the acting chairman.|$|R
5000|$|On May 23, 2016, Brady <b>petitioned</b> {{the court}} <b>of</b> <b>appeals,</b> {{requesting}} an en banc rehearing {{by the full}} court. That petition was denied on July 13, 2016. As stated by Boston Globe columnists Bob Hohler and Ben Volin in the lead of their article: [...] "Patriots great Tom Brady suffered a resounding defeat in {{a federal appeals court}} Wednesday, leaving him with the daunting option of a last-ditch plea to the Supreme Court in his arduous quest to clear his name. More than 14 months after the National Football League punished Brady for allegedly conspiring with Patriots employees, including an aide who dubbed himself The Deflator, to tamper with the air pressure of footballs in a conference championship game, the US Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> for the Second Circuit flatly rejected Brady’s <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> his four-game suspension. Not a single judge on the 13-member panel issued a dissent." [...] Two days later Brady announced he would not appeal further and would serve his four game suspension {{at the beginning of the}} 2016 NFL season.|$|R

50|$|In July 2005, Pollard again filed {{a motion}} for a new trial, this time {{on the grounds of}} {{ineffective}} assistance of counsel. He also sought access to classified documents pertinent to his new lawyers' efforts in preparing a clemency <b>petition.</b> The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> rejected both arguments. In February 2006, his attorneys filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding access to the classified documents. They argued that the separation of powers doctrine is a flexible doctrine that does not dictate the complete separation of the three branches of Government from one another. The brief claimed that the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> violated this principle in asserting sua sponte that the judiciary has no jurisdiction over the classified documents {{due to the fact that}} access was for the ultimate purpose of clemency, an executive function. The Supreme Court denied the cert petition in March 2006, ruling that the president's clemency power would be wholly unaffected by successor counsel's access to the classified documents, and that the classified documents were sealed under protective order, a judicial tool.|$|R
50|$|The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> has {{original}} {{jurisdiction to}} issue writs of mandamus, prohibition and habeas corpus {{in any case}} over which the Court would have appellate jurisdiction.

5000|$|The {{story of}} Pitchess v. Superior Court is {{somewhat}} convoluted. The Los Angeles County Sheriff, Peter J. Pitchess, along {{with members of}} his administrative staff, are the case's petitioners, and the Superior Court of Los Angeles County is the respondent, with a man named César Echeverría as the real party in interest. Sheriff Pitchess had sought a writ of mandate to compel the Superior Court to quash its subpoena duces tecum requiring that Pitchess' office produce documents for a trial in which Mr. Echeverría was named as defendant. Mr. Echeverría was being charged at the time with four felony counts of assaulting four sheriff's deputies, and this {{despite the fact that}} immediately following the incident he was in an intensive care unit and the officers themselves had sustained no serious injuries. His attorney, Miguel F. García wished to obtain evidence from the Sheriff's Office regarding records of complaints by the public about the propensity of these deputies to use excessive force. The Sheriff's Office had flatly refused to provide such documents. García had then convinced a court to issue a subpoena for them, and the Sheriff's Office, in the form <b>of</b> Sheriff Pitchess, <b>petitioned</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> to hold a hearing to have the subpoena [...] "quashed". The petition was unusual in that it came directly from the county sheriff, and so the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> readily agreed to hear the petition.|$|R
