5000|$|The {{region is}} one of the world's most {{productive}} areas for commercial fishing. In 2010, the Western Central Pacific (excluding the northernmost reaches of the South China Sea closest to the PRC coast) accounted for 14% of the total world catch at 11.7 million tonnes. This was up from less than 4 million tonnes in 1970. The PRC has predicted that the South China Sea holds combined fishing and oil and gas resources worth one trillion dollars. There have already been numerous clashes between the PRC and the Philippines, <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> and between other nations over [...] "foreign" [...] fishing vessels in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), and the media regularly report the arrest of Chinese fishermen. In 1984, Brunei established an exclusive fishing zone encompassing Louisa Reef in the southeastern Spratly Islands.|$|E

50|$|The Spratly Islands are a {{group of}} islands, reefs, and rocks located about 300 {{kilometers}} West of Aborlan, Palawan. The Philippines, along with the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei expressed claims. The Philippines officially staked a claim {{to some of the}} islands during the United Nations convention, although it was first expressed in 1956, when Tomás Cloma, a Philippine mariner, declared some of the eastern Spratlys as a protectorate of the Philippines. Based on proximity and on the United Nations Archipelagic Doctrine, the Philippines can claim some of the Spratlys as an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Whether these arguments (or any other used by the Philippines) would hold up in court is debatable but possibly moot, as the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam</b> seem unwilling to legally substantiate their claims and have rejected Philippine challenges to take the dispute to the World Maritime Tribunal in Hamburg.|$|E
50|$|On 11 March 1976, {{the first}} major Philippine oil {{discovery}} occurred {{off the coast of}} Palawan, near the Spratly Islands territory. In 2010, these oil fields supplied 15% of all petroleum consumed in the Philippines. In 1992, the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam</b> granted oil exploration contracts to US oil companies that covered overlapping areas in the Spratlys. In May 1992, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Crestone Energy (a US company based in Denver, Colorado) signed a co-operation contract for the joint exploration of the Wan'an Bei-21 block, a 25155 km2 section of the southwestern South China Sea that includes Spratly Island areas. Part of the Crestone's contract covered Vietnam's blocks 133 and 134, where PetroVietnam, PetroStar Energy(USA) and ConocoPhillips Vietnam Exploration & Production, a unit of ConocoPhillips, agreed to evaluate prospects in April 1992. This led to a confrontation between China and Vietnam, with each demanding that the other cancel its contract.|$|E

2500|$|John McManus, a {{professor}} of marine biology and ecology at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said: [...] "The worst thing anyone can do to a coral reef is to bury it under tons of sand and gravel... There are global security concerns associated with the damage. It is likely broad enough to reduce fish stocks in the world's most fish-dependent region." [...] He explained that, [...] "the world has heard little about the damage inflicted by the People's Republic of China to the reefs is that the experts can't get to them." [...] and noted [...] "I have colleagues from the Philippines, Taiwan, <b>PRC,</b> <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> Malaysia who have worked in the Spratly area. Most {{would not be able}} to get near the artificial islands except possibly some from <b>PRC,</b> <b>and</b> those {{would not be able to}} release their findings." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2011, {{shortly after}} the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam</b> signed an {{agreement}} seeking to contain a dispute over the South China Sea, India's state-run explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said that its overseas investment arm, ONGC Videsh Limited, had signed a three-year agreement with PetroVietnam for developing long-term co-operation in the oil sector, {{and that it had}} accepted Vietnam's offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the South China Sea. In response, PRC Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu, without referring to India by name, stated:"China enjoys indisputable sovereignty over the South China Sea and the island. China's stand is based on historical facts and international law. China's sovereign rights and positions are formed in the course of history and this position has been held by Chinese Government for long. On the basis of this China is ready to engage in peaceful negotiations and friendly consultations to peacefully solve the disputes over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights so as to positively contribute to peace and tranquillity in the South China Sea area. We hope that the relevant countries respect China's position and refrain from taking unilateral action to complicate and expand the issue. We hope they will respect and support countries in the region to solve the bilateral disputes through bilateral channels. As for oil and gas exploration activities, our consistent position is that we are opposed to any country engaging in oil and gas exploration and development activities in waters under China's jurisdiction. We hope the foreign countries do not get involved in South China Sea dispute." [...] An Indian foreign ministry spokesman responded, [...] "The Chinese had concerns, but we are going by what the Vietnamese authorities have told us and we have conveyed this to the Chinese." [...] The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{there have been}} a series of unresolved, {{iterated}} episodes of tension between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and other states in East Asia. These include the Japanese detainment of a Chinese fisherman in 2010, the standoff between ships from the PRC and Philippines at Scarborough Shoal in 2012, and the 2015 clash between the <b>PRC</b> <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam</b> over the PRC placement of an oilrig near the Paracel Islands. A series of unilateral actions in the region have also generated tensions, including the Japanese nationalization of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in 2012, the PRC establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea, and reclamation efforts in the SCS, most notably by the PRC. Why do these tensions seem so intractable? What effect does each episode of heightened tension have on subsequent stand offs...|$|E
25|$|The Spratlys {{are one of}} {{the major}} archipelagos in the South China Sea which complicate {{governance}} and economics in this part of Southeast Asia due to their location in strategic shipping lanes. The islands have no indigenous inhabitants, but offer rich fishing grounds and may contain significant oil and natural gas reserves, and as such are important to the claimants in their attempts to establish international boundaries. Some of the islands have civilian settlements, but of the approximately 45 islands, cays, reefs and shoals that are occupied, all contain structures that are occupied by military forces from Malaysia, Taiwan (ROC), China (<b>PRC),</b> the Philippines <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> Additionally, Brunei has claimed an exclusive economic zone in the southeastern part of the Spratlys, which includes the uninhabited Louisa Reef.|$|R

50|$|The Spratly Islands are {{important}} for economic and strategic reasons. The Spratly area holds potentially significant, but largely unexplored, reserves of oil and natural gas; it is a productive area for world fishing; {{it is one of}} the busiest areas of commercial shipping traffic; and surrounding countries would get an extended continental shelf if their claims were recognised. In addition to economic incentives, the Spratlys sit astride major maritime trade routes to Northeast Asia, giving them added significance as positions from which to monitor maritime activity in the South China Sea and to potentially base and project military force from. In 2014, China drew increased international attention due to its dredging activities within the Spratlys, amidst speculation it is planning to further develop its military presence in the area. In 2015 satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef within the Spratlys whilst continuing its land reclamation activities at other sites. Only China (<b>PRC),</b> Taiwan (ROC), <b>and</b> <b>Vietnam</b> have made claims based on historical sovereignty of the islands. The Philippines, however, claims part of the area as its territory under UNCLOS, an agreement parts of which have been ratified by the countries involved in the Spratly islands dispute.|$|R

40|$|We {{tested a}} novel hypothesis, {{generated}} from representational accounts of medial temporal lobe (MTL) function, {{that the major}} white matter tracts converging on perirhinal cortex (<b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> hippocampus (HC) would be differentially involved in face and scene perception, respectively.

Microstructure of inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, connecting occipital and ventro-anterior temporal lobe, including <b>PrC)</b> <b>and</b> fornix (the main HC input/output pathway) correlated with accuracy on odd-one-out judgements involving faces and scenes, respectively. Similarly, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in <b>PrC</b> <b>and</b> HC, elicited during oddity judgements, was correlated with face and scene oddity performance, respectively.
