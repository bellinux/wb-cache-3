25|$|In Season 5, the Golden Triangle of Immunity was added. It is {{a border}} that is placed around the Friendship piece. It may be {{transferred}} to another team with any temple mission.

The team in possession of the Triangle of Immunity can avoid being sent to temple once, but is only able to use it until the final four. Once they reach the final three, the Triangle of Immunity is removed from the game. Season 6 removed the Triangle of Immunity, as the Friendship piece is back to a regular pyramid piece.|$|E

The Pink Team's reward is a pair of Canadian flags; a small, tabletop flag for Tyler, and a gigantic flag (big enough to cover up the site's central stage) for Danielle.|$|R
