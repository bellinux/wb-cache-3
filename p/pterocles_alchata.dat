50|$|The pin-tailed {{sandgrouse}} (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata)</b> is a medium large {{bird in the}} sandgrouse family. It has a small, pigeon like head and neck and a sturdy, compact body. It has long pointed wings, which are white underneath, a long tail and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn. The call is a loud kattar-kattar. This gregarious species breeds on dry open treeless plains and similar habitats. Its nest is a ground scrape into which two or three cream-coloured eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Both sexes incubate the eggs.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and frequency of}} color aberrations in wild birds is relatively poorly known. Here we report, for the first time, the observation of an aberrantly colored Pin-tailed Sandgrouse (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata),</b> a threatened steppe bird with cryptic plumage and behavior. The bird displayed a continuous white patch on its back that was not bilaterally symmetrical (i. e., {{not far from the}} neural crest), thus discarding leucism as an explanation. Plausible explanations are progressive graying and, most likely, an injury that damaged feather follicles affecting the pigment cells in that area. This very rare observation (0. 02 %, n = 5, 720) contributes to future studies exploring the frequency of color aberrations in wild birds depending on their ecological and behavioral characteristics.

40|$|The night-lighting {{technique}} is routinely used to catch birds. We improved this technique using a thermal infrared camera to catch steppe birds {{such as the}} sandgrouse. Target birds were located by an observer using the thermal camera, and approached and dazzled by another observer carrying a spotlight attached to a helmet and a hand-held net together with a playback noise to camouflage {{the footsteps of the}} observer. Using this improved technique, we caught on average 1. 14 individuals per 3 -h capture session (N = 81) and a total of 92 sandgrouse in 2007 - 2010 (86 pin-tailed sandgrouse <b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata</b> and six black-bellied sandgrouse Pterocles orientalis). Capture rate and success were negatively influenced by moonlight (lowest during full moon nights). Our night-lighting {{technique is}} a highly selective and harmless method to capture sandgrouse and can be used for other small/medium-sized open-land birds or mammals.

40|$|Predictive species' {{distribution}} models may answer ecological {{questions about}} habitat selection, co-occurrence of species and competition between them. We studied the habitat preferences and segregation of two sympatric species of declining sandgrouse, the black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) and the pin-tailed sandgrouse (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata),</b> during the breeding season. We developed predictive models that related sandgrouse presence to environmental variables at three different spatial levels: large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. At the large geographical scale, differences between sandgrouse distributions, in the Iberian Peninsula, {{seem to be}} explained mainly in terms of bioclimatology: pin-tailed sandgrouse {{appear to be a}} more thermophilous species and occupy warmer sites usually located in flatter areas. At the landscape spatial level, in those areas that exhibit environmental conditions allowing for both species' co-existence at a large geographical scale, black-bellied sandgrouse appear to be more tolerant to environmental variation than pin-tailed sandgrouse. At the microhabitat level, however, differences between species could be related to different flocking behaviour as a consequence of different sensitivities to vegetation structure and predators. Thus, the observed spatial distribution patterns are the result of different ecological factors that operate at different spatial levels. Conservation guidelines for these species should therefore consider their habitat preferences at large geographical, landscape and microhabitat scales. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Capturing and marking {{free-living}} birds {{permits the}} study of important aspects of their biology but may have undesirable effects. Bird welfare should be a primary concern, so {{it is necessary to}} evaluate and minimize any adverse effects of procedures used. We assess short-term effects associated with the capture, handling and tagging with backpack-mounted transmitters of Pin-tailed <b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata</b> and Black-bellied Pterocles orientalis Sandgrouse, steppe birds of conservation concern. There was a significantly higher mortality (15 %) during the first week after capture than during the following weeks (< 2. 5 %) in Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, but no significant temporal mortality pattern in Black-bellied Sandgrouse. In Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, mortality rate during the first week increased with increasing relative transmitter and harness weight regardless of season, and with increasing handling time during the breeding season. There {{were no significant differences in}} mortality rate between study areas, type of tag, sex or age or an effect of restraint time. These results suggest the use of lighter transmitters (< 3 % of the bird’s weight) and a reduction of handling time (< 20 min), particularly during the breeding season, as essential improvements in procedure to reduce the mortality risk associated with the capture, handling and tagging of these vulnerable species...|$|E
40|$|Positive {{interactions}} between species can have important conservation implications, {{especially when the}} species associating are both vulnerable. We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses <b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata</b> and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard Tetrax tetrax in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65 % of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred stubble fields and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of pin-tailed sandgrouse depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used stubble fields significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that pin-tailed sandgrouse benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (stubble fields) {{that would otherwise be}} too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species.

40|$|Ascertaining which niche {{processes}} allow coexistence between {{closely related}} species is of special interest in ecology. We quantified variations in the environmental niches and densities of two congeneric species, the pin-tailed and the black-bellied sandgrouse (<b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata</b> and Pterocles orientalis) in allopatry and sympatry under similar abiotic, habitat and dispersal contexts to understand their coexistence. Using principal component analysis, we defined environmental gradients (niche dimensions) including abiotic, habitat and anthropogenic variables, and calculated niche breadth, position and overlap of both species in sympatry and allopatry. Additionally, sandgrouse density was modelled {{as a function of}} the niche dimensions and the density of the other species. We found evidence that each species occupies distinct environmental niches in sympatry and in allopatry. The black-bellied sandgrouse exploits a broader range of environmental conditions (wider niche breadth) while the pin-tailed sandgrouse reaches high densities where conditions seem to match its optimum. In sympatry, both species shift their niches to intermediate positions, indicating the importance of abiotic factors in setting coexistence areas. Environmental conditions determine regional densities of pin-tailed sandgrouse whereas biotic interactions explain the density of the black-bellied sandgrouse in areas with abiotic conditions similarly conducive for both species. Highly suitable areas for the pin-tailed sandgrouse fall beyond the upper thermal limit of the black-bellied sandgrouse, leading to niche segregation and low densities for the latter. Finally, local niche shift and expansion plus possible heterospecific aggregation allow the pin-tailed sandgrouse to thrive in a priori less favourable environments. This work provides insight into how different mechanisms allow species coexistence and how species densities vary in sympatry compared to allopatry as a result of environmental filtering and biotic interactions.

40|$|Survival and the {{underlying}} causes of mortality are key demographic parameters for understanding animal population dynamics and identifying conservation needs. Here we use a large data set of tagged wild pin-tailed sandgrouse (. <b>Pterocles</b> <b>alchata)</b> to examine the influence of individual traits (age, sex, size, movements and reproduction), and of temporal and spatial variations on the survival of this steppe-bird of conservation concern in Europe. Annual survival for adults and juveniles was estimated at 0. 60 and 0. 61, respectively. Survival rate tended to be lower towards the northern margin of the European distribution. In the core distribution area (central Spain) mortality was more frequent during the non-breeding season due to higher predation rates. Survival rate was slightly higher in males than females, which may explain male skewed population sex-ratios. Sedentary birds had lower survival than birds using different areas for breeding and wintering, indicating that high mobility, as a possible behavioural response to varying conditions, could eventually increase fitness. Predation was the main cause of mortality, but illegal hunting was also recorded, indicating a need for stricter law enforcement and regulation plans. Sandgrouse can be characterized by a relatively slow life history (medium-high adult survival and low reproductive rate), with lower survival rates than other sympatric steppe birds of larger size. Management and conservation efforts should focus on maintaining a high adult survival within protected areas. Sandgrouse mobility, which positively influenced survival, should also be taken into account in conservation plans, especially when considering the size and connectivity of protected areas. A.
