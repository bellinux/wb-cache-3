50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, a range of expired pesticides, industrial chemicals and various other materials were deposited in the warehouse of the rail station. Between 1991 and 1992, German company Schmidt-Cretan temporarily imported and stowed 480 tonnes of dangerous chemicals in Bajzë. Of these chemicals, the most dangerous were toxaphene and <b>phenylmercury</b> acetate, both banned in the European Union since 1983. Importing was halted when the Albanian government noticed that the pesticides were outdated. Following complaints, the German authorities agreed to return the chemicals to Germany. In the meantime, however, local Albanians had emptied many containers in order to use them for household purposes. Much of the contents were emptied directly into the ground, eventually dispersing into Lake Shkodër. It was later reported that many cattle and sheep from the vicinity had died after the incident. Moreover, in subsequent years, fishermen from Lake Shkodër have reported a mass death of fish in the lake.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of a}} new gene, hereby designated merG, located between merA and merB on the broad-spectrum mer operon of Pseudomonas strain K- 62 plasmid pMR 26 was investigated. The 654 -bp merG gene encodes a protein with a canonical leader sequence at its N terminus. The processing of the signal peptide of this protein was dose-dependently inhibited by sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of protein export. These {{results suggest that the}} mature MerG protein (ca. 20 kDa) may be located in the periplasm. Deletion of the merG gene from the broad-spectrum mer operon of pMR 26 had no effect on the inorganic mercury resistance phenotype, but rendered the bacterium more sensitive to <b>phenylmercury</b> than its isogenic wild-type strain. Escherichia coli cells bearing pMU 29, which carries a deletion of the merG gene, took up significantly more <b>phenylmercury</b> than the bacteria with the intact plasmid pMRA 17. When the merG gene in a compatible plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain carrying pMU 29, the high uptake of and high sensitivity to <b>phenylmercury</b> were almost completely restored to their original levels. These results demonstrate that the merG gene is involved in <b>phenylmercury</b> resistance, presumably by reducing in-cell permeability to <b>phenylmercury...</b>|$|E
40|$|Penicillinase {{plasmids}} of Staphylococcus aureus often contain genes conferring {{resistance to}} inorganic mercury (Hg 2 +) and the organomercurial <b>phenylmercury</b> acetate. The mechanism of resistance {{was found to}} be the enzymatic hydrolysis of the organomercurial <b>phenylmercury</b> to benzene plus inorganic ionic mercury, which was then enzymatically reduced to metallic mercury (Hg 0). The Hg 0 was rapidly volatilized from the medium into the atmosphere. After the mercurial was degraded and the mercury was volatilized, the resistant cells were able to grow. These plasmids also conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from thimerosal, although the plasmid-bearing strains were equally as thimerosal sensitive as the S. aureus without plasmids. None of the plasmids conferred the ability to volatilize mercury from several other organomercurials, however: methylmercury, ethylmercury, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, merbromin, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. (Organomercurial resistance-conferring plasmids of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that we have been studying confer the ability to degrade two or three of these organomercurials.) Although mercury was not volatilized from p-hydroxymercuribenzoate or fluorescein mercuric acetate, the plasmid-bearing strains were resistant to these organomercurials. The ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 + and <b>phenylmercury</b> was inducible. The range of inducers included Hg 2 +, <b>phenylmercury,</b> and several organomercurials that were not substrates for the degradation system. Mercury-sensitive mutants have been isolated from the parental plasmids pI 258 and pII 147. Thirty-one such mercury-sensitive strains fall into three classes: (i) mercury-sensitive strains totally devoid of the <b>phenylmercury</b> hydrolase and Hg 2 + reductase activities; (ii) mutants with normal hydrolase levels and no detectable reductase; and (iii) mutants with essentially normal hydrolase levels and low and variable (5 to 25 %) levels of reductase activities. The mercury-sensitive strains were also sensitive to <b>phenylmercury,</b> including those with the potential for hydrolase activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} induction of the mercury resistance operon with inorganic mercury {{and with the}} organomercurial compound phenylmercuric acetate was addressed by DNA sequencing analysis and by lac fusion transcription experiments regulated by merR in trans from broad-spectrum-resistance plasmid pDU 1358 (Hg 2 + and <b>phenylmercury</b> responding). The lac fusion results were compared with those from a narrow-spectrum-resistance (Hg 2 + responding but not phenylmercuric responding) operon and the pDU 1358 merR deleted at the 3 ' end. The nucleotide sequence of the beginning region of the broad-spectrum mer operon of plasmid pDU 1358 was determined, including that of the merR gene, the operator-promoter region, the merT and merP genes, and the first 60 % of the merA gene. Comparison of this sequence with DNA sequences of narrow-spectrum mer operons from transposon Tn 501 and plasmid R 100 showed that a major difference occurred in the 3 ' 29 base pairs of the merR gene, resulting in unrelated C-terminal 10 amino acids. A hybrid mer operon consisting of the merR gene from pDU 1358, a hybrid merA gene (determining mercuric reductase enzyme), and lacking the merB gene (determining <b>phenylmercury</b> lyase activity) was inducible by both <b>phenylmercury</b> and inorganic Hg 2 +. This shows that organomercurial lyase is not needed for induction by organomercurial compounds. A mutant form of pDU 1358 merR missing the C-terminal 17 amino acids responded to inorganic Hg 2 + but not to <b>phenylmercury.</b> Thus, the C-terminal region of the MerR protein of the pDU 1358 mer operon {{is involved in the}} recognition of <b>phenylmercury...</b>|$|E
30|$|Studies {{suggest that}} merR is a {{regulatory}} gene that both negatively and positively controls the transcription of merTPABD (Ansari et al. 1995;Brown et al. 2003), whereas MerD is a transcriptional co-regulator (Hobman and Brown 1997;Kiyono et al. 1995 a;Lund and Brown 1987). MerT, merP, merA, and merB encode a membrane Hg 2 +-transport protein (Hobman and Brown 1997;Kiyono et al. 1995 a;Lund and Brown 1987), a periplasmic Hg 2 +-binding protein (Hobman and Brown 1997;Kiyono et al. 1995 a;Kiyono et al. 2000;Lund and Brown 1987), a mercuric reductase (Hobman and Brown 1997; Schiering et al. 1991; Silver and Phung 1996), and a organomercurial lyase (Griffin et al. 1987;Lafrance-Vanasse et al. 2009;Miller 1999), respectively. merG, identified in pMR 26, is a newly-identified mer-gene involved in <b>phenylmercury</b> resistance, which {{is thought to}} act by reducing cell permeability to <b>phenylmercury</b> (Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 b). Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} the high resistance to <b>phenylmercury</b> shown by P. K- 62 is mediated by the two functional organomercurial lyase enzymes encoded by pMR 26 merB 1 and merB 2 (Kiyono et al. 1995 b; Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 a), by changes in cellular permeability to <b>phenylmercury</b> mediated by merG (Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 b), and by an presumptive mer operon located on plasmid pMR 68 (Kiyono et al. 1995 b) However, no mercurial-resistance loci have been identified in pMR 68; indeed, a previous study shows that removal of pMR 26 from strain K- 62 does not alter its mercurial-resistant phenotype nor prevent it from volatilizing Hg 2 + and organomercurials (Kiyono et al. 1995 b).|$|E

30|$|The present results, {{together}} {{with those of}} our previous study, suggest that the high resistance to <b>phenylmercury</b> shown by strain K- 62 {{may be due to}} the following: [1] the functional organomercurial lyase enzymes encoded by pMR 26 merB 1 and merB 2 (Kiyono et al. 1995 b;Kiyono et al. 1997;Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 a), and pMR 68 merB 1; [2] the two functional mercuric reductases encoded by pMR 26 merA (Kiyono et al. 1995 b;Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 a) and pMR 68 merA; [3] the multi-functional transporters encoded by pMR 26 merT and merP (Kiyono et al. 1995 a;Kiyono et al. 2000;Nagata et al. 2006;Uno et al. 1997), and by pMR 68 merT 1 -merP 1 -merF; and [4] alterations in cellular permeability to <b>phenylmercury</b> mediated by pMR 26 merG (Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 b).

30|$|To fully {{explain the}} high {{resistance}} to <b>phenylmercury</b> observed in this strain of soil bacteria, {{it is essential}} to understand the mer genes expressed by pMR 68. The aim {{of the present study was}} to completely identify the mercury resistance genes of plasmid pMR 68 isolated from strain K- 62. The mer genes encoded by pMR 68 were then cloned and analyzed.|$|E
30|$|We {{report the}} {{complete}} nucleotide sequence of plasmid pMR 68, isolated from Pseudomonas strain K- 62, two plasmids contribute to broad-spectrum mercury resistance {{and that the}} mer operon from one of them (pMR 26) has been previously characterized. The plasmid was 71, 020  bp in length and contained 75 coding regions. Three mer gene clusters were identified. The first comprised merR-orf 4 -orf 5 -merT 1 -merP 1 -merF-merA-merB 1, which confers bacterial resistance to mercuric ions and organomercury. The second and third clusters comprised merT 2 -merP 2, which encodes a mercury transport system, and merB 2, which encodes an organomercurial lyase, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences for the proteins encoded by each of the mer genes identified in pMR 68 bore greater similarity to sequences from Methylobacterium extorquens AM 1 than to those from pMR 26, a second mercury-resistance plasmid from Pseudomonas strain K- 62. Escherichia coli cells carrying pMKY 12 (containing merR-orf 4 -orf 5 -merT 1 -merP 1 -merF-merA-merB 1 cloned from pMR 68) and cells carrying pMRA 114 (containing merR-merT-merP-merA-merG-merB 1 cloned from plasmid pMR 26) were more resistant to, and volatilized more, mercury from mercuric ions and <b>phenylmercury</b> than the control cells. The present results, together with our earlier findings, indicate that the high <b>phenylmercury</b> resistance noted for Pseudomonas strain K- 62 seems to be achieved by multiple genes, particularly by the multiple merB encoding organomercurial lyase and one merG encoding cellular permeability to <b>phenylmercury.</b> The novel mer gene identified in pMR 68 may help us to design new strategies aimed at the bioremediation of mercurials.|$|E
30|$|Pseudomonas strain K- 62, a {{bacterial}} strain isolated from phenylmercury-polluted soil, is about 1, 000 times {{more resistant to}} <b>phenylmercury</b> than sensitive strains of Escherichia coli (Tonomura et al. 1968). A study performed about 40  years ago showed that the biochemical mechanism underlying this mercurial resistance {{is based on the}} enzymatic degradation of organomercurials and the subsequent reduction of the resulting mercuric ions to the less toxic and more volatile metallic mercury (Tonomura et al. 1968). Two separate organomercurial lyases, designated S- 1 and S- 2, each showing somewhat different physical properties and substrate specificities, are thought to be responsible for the resistance of P. K- 62 to <b>phenylmercury</b> (Tezuka and Tonomura 1976;Tezuka and Tonomura 1978). The organomercurial resistance of this soil strain is encoded by two plasmids, pMR 26 and pMR 68 (Kiyono et al. 1995 b). In addition, pMR 26 contains two mer operons that map about 1  kb apart (Kiyono et al. 1997). One comprises merR- o/p-merT-merP-merA-merG-merB 1. The other is a defective mer operon comprising merR-o/p-merB 2 -merD (Kiyono and Pan-Hou 1999 a).|$|E

One encoded narrow-spectrum mercurial resistance to Hg 2 + and a few organomercurials; the other specified broad-spectrum resistance to <b>phenylmercury</b> and additional organomercurials.

Southern DNA X DNA hybridization experiments using gene-specific probes from the plasmid R 100 mer operon indicated close homology with the R 100 determinant. The 2153 base pairs of the promoter-distal part of the broad-spectrum Hg 2 +-resistance operon of pDU 1358 were sequenced. This region included the 3 '-terminal part of the merA gene, merD, unidentified reading frame URF 1, {{and a part of}} URF 2 homologous to previously sequenced determinants of plasmid R 100.

40|$|Removal of {{the green}} colour of butyryl-CoA {{dehydrogenase}} by reagents specific for nucleophilic sulphur is shown to involve chemical modification of the tightly bound CoA persulphide. 5, 5 '-Dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) de-greens the enzyme essentially irreversibly, with a stoicheiometry of approx. 1 mol/mol of FAD.

40|$|Mercury and organomercurial {{resistance}} {{determined by}} genes on ten Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmids and one Pseudomonas putida plasmid {{have been studied}} {{with regard to the}} range of substrates and the range of inducers. The plasmidless strains were sensitive to growth inhibition by Hg 2 + and did not volatilize Hg 0 from Hg 2 +. A strain with plasmid RP 1 (which does not confer resistance to Hg 2 +) similarly did not volatilize mercury. All 10 plasmids determine mercury resistance by way of an inducible enzyme system. Hg 2 + was reduced to Hg 0, which is insoluble in water and rapidly volatilizes from the growth medium. Plasmids pMG 1, pMG 2, R 26, R 933, R 93 - 1, and pVS 1 in P. aeruginosa and MER in P. putida conferred resistance to and the ability to volatilize mercury from Hg 2 +, but strains with these plasmids were sensitive to and could not volatilize mercury from the organomercurials methylmercury, ethylmercury, <b>phenylmercury,</b> and thimerosal. These plasmids, in addition, conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate. The other plasmids, FP 2, R 38, R 3108, and pVS 2, determined resistance to and decomposition of a range of organomercurials, including methylmercury, ethylmercury, <b>phenylmercury,</b> and thimerosal. These plasmids also conferred resistance to the organomercurials merbromin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and fluorescein mercuric acetate by a mechanism not involving degradation. In all cases, organomercurial decomposition and mercury volatilization were induced by exposure to Hg 2 + or organomercurials. The plasmids differed in the relative efficacy of inducers. Hg 2 + resistance with strains that are organomercurial sensitive appeared to be induced preferentially by Hg 2 + and only poorly by organomercurials to which the cells are sensitive. However, the organomercurials p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, merbromin, and fluorescein mercuric acetate were strong gratuitous inducers but not substrates for the Hg 2 + volatilization system.

A sensitive speciation technique for the various organomercury species in environmental matrices is a prerequisite for toxicity investigations.

The greater part of the dose is broken down in the tissues to yield inorganic mercury which is excreted mainly in faeces, and conjugates of phenol and quinol are excreted in urine. In experiments in vitro <b>phenylmercury</b> is broken down by liver homogenates to release inorganic mercury and benzene; this reaction is effected by the soluble, but not the microsomal, fraction and does not require NADPH or NADH. No elemental mercury is formed under these conditions. It is probable that this reaction occurs in vivo and the benzene produced is rapidly converted into phenol and quinol by microsomal enzymes...|$|E
40|$|A {{convenient}} {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} organomercuric compounds in soils from orchards and wheat fields is described based on the aqueous derivatization of the polar organomercuric halides in 0. 1 M HAc-NaAc (pH 4) buffer into their hydrides by addition of 1 mL of 6 % KBH 4 with subsequent headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) of the volatile derivatives. The volatile derivatives are separated by gas chromatography (GC) with a Supelco SPB- 1 capillary column and on-line detected by electric heated quartz furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The relative standard deviations for ten replicate measurements are 2. 1 %, 2. 8 % and 3. 5 % for methyl-, ethyl- and <b>phenylmercury</b> with absolute detection limits of 16 ng, 12 ng and 7 ng, respectively. This method {{is applied to the}} analysis of organomercuric compounds in soil samples and 0. 04 - 0. 64 mu g/g of organomercuric species are detected in soils from different sites. The recoveries after standard addition are between 93 - 106 %...|$|E
40|$|Complex {{formation}} between {{mercury compounds}} and thiols, e. g. cysteine, {{is believed to}} play a major role in the biological chemistry of mercury. The greater affinity of Hg(II) and MeHg(II) for thiols than other possible biological donor ligands has been well documented by stability constant studies in aqueous solution. Our interest in mercury(II) thiolates stems from studies of the chemistry of the antidote British anti-Lewisite which indicated that the structure and reactivity of simple thiolate complexes was little understood. In this review our recent work on the interaction of inorganic and organomercury compounds with British anti-Lewisite, simple thiols and sulphur containing amino acids is discussed, followed by an account of animal studies of the distribution and metabolism of <b>phenylmercury</b> compounds. In discussing the implications of chemical results, e. g. reactivity of thiolates, for the biological behaviour of mercury compounds it is assumed here that chemical studies provide only plausible pathways for biological behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Kinetics {{in water}} of some {{chemical}} and photochemical reactions postulated as key transformations {{in the environmental}} mercury cycle were investigated. Decomposition of dimethylmercury (DMM) and diphenylmercury (DPM) by acids and mercuric salts was shown to be pH dependent and too slow to be significant under most environmental conditions. Degradation of organomercuric salts by acid is even slower. Theoretical evidence indicates that loss of elemental mercury or DMM at the air-water interface can be important in turbulent systems. Dimethylmercury, methylmercuric chloride, methylmercuric hydroxide, and methylmercuric ion were not decomposed by sunlight, but <b>phenylmercury</b> and sulfur-bonded methylmercuric species were readily decomposed to inorganic mercury. Detailed equilibrium calculations indicate that the sulfur-bonded methylmercuric species are the predominant species in natural waters. Quantum yields for these reactions are presented along with a technique for calculating sunlight photolysis rates from laboratory data. The report also includes {{a review of the}} chemical literature concerning the kinetics of chemical and photochemical decomposition of organomercurials...|$|E
