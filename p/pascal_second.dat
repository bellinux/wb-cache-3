40|$|SUMMARY Cadaveric hip joints {{were tested}} in a hip {{function}} simulator which subjected the femoral head to a cycle of loading and oscillation similar to that experienced during walking and measured the frictional torque transmitted to the acetabulum. Silicone fluids with viscosities from 102 Pa s (<b>pascal</b> <b>second)</b> to 30 Pa s were used as lubricants and the transition from mixed to full fluid film lubrication was observed around 5 x 172 Pa s. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose solutions were also tested at the lower viscosities. Hyaluronidase digestion of samples of synovial fluid caused {{a significant increase in}} friction over the control samples. Trypsin digestion had no significant effect. No correlation between compliance of the cartilage and the frictional values was observed. One of the factors which may contribute to the de-generation of the cartilage surfaces of human joints is a breakdown of the natural lubrication mechanism. It is important therefore to attempt to understand the way in which synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and what factors may cause the fluid to lose this ability.

Process parameters optimization of fullerene nanoemulsions {{was done by}} employing response surface methodology, which involved statistical multivariate analysis. Optimization of independent variables was investigated using experimental design based on Box–Behnken design and central composite rotatable design. An investigation {{on the effect of}} the homogenization rate (4, 000 – 5, 000  rpm), sonication amplitude (20 %– 60 %), and sonication time (30 – 150  seconds) on the particle size, ζ-potential, and viscosity of the colloidal systems was conducted. Under the optimum conditions, the central composite rotatable design model suggested the response variables for particle size, ζ-potential, and viscosity of the fullerene nanoemulsion were 152. 5  nm, – 52. 6  mV, and 44. 6 <b>pascal</b> <b>seconds,</b> respectively. In contrast, the Box–Behnken design model proposed that preparation under the optimum condition would produce nanoemulsion with particle size, ζ-potential, and viscosity of 148. 5  nm, – 55. 2  mV, and 39. 9 <b>pascal</b> <b>seconds,</b> respectively. The suggested process parameters to obtain optimum formulation by both models yielded actual response values similar to the predicted values with residual standard error of < 2 %.

The sample responds to this shear stress by generating internal circulations, which are quanti-fied with an optical microscope by monitoring {{the movement of the}} beads. The rate of internal circulation is shown to be a function of particle viscosity but independent of the particle material {{for a wide range of}} organic and organic-water sam-ples.

5000|$|In the {{statement}} of the chain rule, f and g play slightly different roles because f′ is evaluated at g(t) whereas g′ is evaluated at t. This is necessary to make the units work out correctly. For example, suppose {{that we want to}} compute the rate of change in atmospheric pressure ten seconds after the skydiver jumps. This is [...] and has units of <b>Pascals</b> per <b>second.</b> The factor g′(10) in the chain rule is the velocity of the skydiver ten seconds after his jump, and it is expressed in meters per second. f′(g(10)) is the change in pressure with respect to height at the height g(10) and is expressed in Pascals per meter. The product of f′(g(10)) and g′(10) therefore has the correct units of <b>Pascals</b> per <b>second.</b> It is not possible to evaluate f anywhere else. For instance, because the 10 in the problem represents ten seconds, the expression f′(10) represents the change in pressure at a height of ten seconds, which is nonsense.

40|$|The {{effect of}} two gel-forming {{polysaccharide}} gums, guar gum and Na-carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), on glucose transport in vitro was investigated using everted sacs of rat jejunum. The gums {{were added to}} the mucosal bathing media to give apparent viscosities in the range of 1 - 110 <b>Pascal</b> <b>seconds</b> X 10 (- 3), mPa. s(cP). Serosal glucose transport fell steeply by about 60 % as the viscosities of the mucosal media rose to 20 mPa. s, and levelled off thereafter. A similar effect was observed in sacs preincubated with guar gum (15 minutes) and exposed to glucose in a subsequent guar-free incubation. Glucose transport with and without the addition of guar gum was found to be sensitive to mucosal stirring, so that, when shaken at 130 oscillations per minute, sacs exposed to guar gum (0. 25 %, viscosity c. a. 16 mPa. s (cP) transported glucose at a similar rate to sacs incubated without guar at 80 oscillations per minute. By measuring the time course for the establishment of osmotic induced potentials, it was shown that incubation with guar or CMC led to an increase in the apparent thickness of the unstirred fluid layer overlying the mucosa (guar-free thickness = 317 +/- 15 mu, guar treated thickness = 468 +/- 25 mu). It is suggested that the presence of a polysaccharide gum in the fluid film surrounding the villi increases its viscosity, and thus gives rise to a thickening of the rate-limiting unstirred layer. If such an effect occurs in vivo, this could contribute to the diminished post-prandial glycaemia observed in human subjects fed guar gum...|$|R
