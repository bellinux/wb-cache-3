5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is <b>pre-mRNA.</b> <b>Pre-mRNA</b> must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the <b>pre-mRNA</b> chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the <b>pre-mRNA</b> chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
5|$|Introns are spliced out of <b>pre-mRNA</b> by spliceosomes, {{which contain}} several small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or <b>pre-mRNA.</b> They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, <b>pre-mRNA</b> {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E
40|$|Intron-containing <b>pre-mRNAs</b> are {{normally}} {{retained in the}} nucleus until they are spliced to produce mature mRNAs that are exported to the cytoplasm. Although the detailed mechanism is not well understood, the formation of splicing-related complexes on <b>pre-mRNAs</b> {{is thought to be}} responsible for the nuclear retention. Therefore, <b>pre-mRNAs</b> containing suboptimal splice sites should tend to leak out to the cytoplasm. Such <b>pre-mRNAs</b> often contain purine-rich exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) that stimulate splicing of the adjacent intron. Here, we show that ESEs per se possess an activity to retain RNAs in the nucleus through a saturable nuclear retention factor. Cross-competition experiments revealed that intron-containing <b>pre-mRNAs</b> (without ESEs) used the same saturable nuclear retention factor as ESEs. Interestingly, although intronless mRNAs containing ESEs were also poorly exported, spliced mRNAs produced from ESE-containing <b>pre-mRNAs</b> were efficiently exported to the cytoplasm. Thus, the splicing reaction can reset the nuclear retention state caused by ESEs, allowing nuclear export of mature mRNAs. Our results reveal a novel aspect of ESE activity that should contribute to gene expression and RNA quality control...|$|R
50|$|Transcription of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> {{beginning}} at the late promoter is randomly terminated at one of five termination sites, producing a population of transcripts of five different lengths. The <b>pre-mRNAs</b> of any given length are then alternatively spliced to produce 1-4 different mRNAs coding for a corresponding number of proteins.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of six {{endogenous}} <b>pre-mRNAs</b> {{demonstrates that}} localization at the periphery or within splicing factor-rich (SC- 35) domains is {{not restricted to}} a few unusually abundant <b>pre-mRNAs,</b> but is apparently a more common paradigm of many protein-coding genes. Different genes are preferentially transcribed and their RNAs processed in different compartments relative to SC- 35 domains. These differences do not simply correlate with the complexity, nuclear abundance, or position within overall nuclear space. The distribution of spliceosome assembly factor SC- 35 did not simply mirror the distribution of individual <b>pre-mRNAs,</b> but rather suggested that individual domains contain both specific <b>pre-mRNA(s)</b> as well as excess splicing factors. This {{is consistent with a}} multifunctional compartment, to which some gene loci and their RNAs have access and others do not. Despite similar molar abundance in muscle fiber nuclei, nascent transcript “trees” of highly complex dystrophin RNA are cotranscriptionally spliced outside of SC- 35 domains, whereas posttranscriptional “tracks” of more mature myosin heavy chain transcripts overlap domains. Further analyses supported that endogenous <b>pre-mRNAs</b> exhibit distinct structural organization that may reflect not only the expression and complexity of the gene, but also constraints of its chromosomal context and kinetics of its RNA metabolism...|$|R

5|$|Primary {{transcript}} RNAs {{are often}} modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap {{are added to}} eukaryotic <b>pre-mRNA</b> and introns are removed by the spliceosome.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (<b>pre-mRNA)</b> has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the <b>pre-mRNA.</b> The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
40|$|SummarySome {{genes in}} the {{candidate}} early-branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia occur in separate pieces, transcribed from non-contiguous chromosomal locations.

5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with <b>pre-mRNA</b> processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of <b>pre-mRNA,</b> or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
5|$|The {{transcribed}} <b>pre-mRNA</b> contains untranslated regions at {{both ends}} which contain a ribosome binding site, terminator and start and stop codons. In addition, most eukaryotic open reading frames contain untranslated introns which are removed before the exons are translated. The sequences {{at the ends of}} the introns, dictate the splice sites to generate the final mature mRNA which encodes the protein or RNA product.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{polyadenylation}} begins as the transcription {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made <b>pre-mRNA</b> is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
40|$|Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the {{accelerated}} turnover of mRNAs transcribed from genes containing early nonsense mutations, {{is dependent on}} the product of the UPF 1 gene in yeast. Mutations that inactivate UPF 1 lead to the selective stabilization of mRNAs containing early nonsense mutations but have no effect on the half-lives of almost all other mRNAs. Since the transcripts of nonsense alleles are not typical cellular constituents, we sought to identify those RNAs that comprise normal substrates of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Many yeast <b>pre-mRNAs</b> contain early in-frame nonsense codons and we consider it possible that a role of this pathway is to accelerate the degradation of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> present in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, in a strain lacking UPF 1 function, the CYH 2, RP 51 B, and MER 2 <b>pre-mRNAs</b> are stabilized 2 - to 5 -fold and are associated with ribosomes. We conclude that a major source of early nonsense codon-containing cytoplasmic transcripts in yeast is <b>pre-mRNAs</b> and that the UPF 1 protein may be part of a cellular system that ensures that potentially deleterious nonsense fragments of polypeptides do not accumulate...|$|R
40|$|The posttranscriptional {{modification}} of messenger RNA precursors (<b>pre-mRNAs)</b> by base deamination can profoundly alter the physiological {{function of the}} encoded proteins. The recent identification of tRNA-specific adenosine deaminases (ADATs) {{has led to the}} suggestion that these enzymes, as well as the cytidine and adenosine deaminases acting on <b>pre-mRNAs</b> (CDARs and ADARs), belong to a superfamily of RNA-dependent deaminases. This superfamily might have evolved from an ancient cytidine deaminase. This article reviews the reactions catalysed by these enzymes and discusses their evolutionary relationships...|$|R
40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM) is {{a genetic}} disorder {{caused by the}} expression (as RNA) of expanded CTG or CCTG repeats. The alternative splicing factor MBNL 1 is sequestered to the expanded RNA repeats, resulting in missplicing of a subset of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> linked to symptoms found in DM patients. Current data suggest that if MBNL 1 is released from sequestration, disease symptoms may be alleviated. We identified the small molecules pentamidine and neomycin B as compounds that disrupt MBNL 1 binding to CUG repeats in vitro. We show in cell culture that pentamidine was able to reverse the missplicing of 2 <b>pre-mRNAs</b> affected in DM, whereas neomycin B had no effect. Pentamidine also significantly reduced the formation of ribonuclear foci in tissue culture cells, releasing MBNL 1 from the foci in the treated cells. Furthermore, pentamidine partially rescued splicing defects of 2 <b>pre-mRNAs</b> in mice expressing expanded CUG repeats...|$|R
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, <b>pre-mRNA</b> is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the <b>pre-mRNA</b> and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent <b>pre-mRNA</b> transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
25|$|Exon {{skipping}} or cassette exon: in this case, an exon may be spliced out of {{the primary}} transcript or retained. This {{is the most common}} mode in mammalian <b>pre-mRNAs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic {{cells have}} {{to prevent the}} export of unspliced <b>pre-mRNAs</b> until intron removal is {{completed}} to avoid the expression of aberrant and potentially harmful proteins. Only mature mRNAs associate with the export receptor Mex 67 /TAP and enter the cytoplasm. Here we show that the two shuttling serine/arginine (SR) -proteins Gbp 2 and Hrb 1 are key surveillance factors for the selective export of spliced mRNAs in yeast. Their absence leads to the significant leakage of unspliced <b>pre-mRNAs</b> into the cytoplasm. They bind to <b>pre-mRNAs</b> and the spliceosome during splicing, where they are necessary for the surveillance of splicing and the stable binding of the TRAMP complex to spliceosome-bound transcripts. Faulty transcripts are marked for their degradation at the nuclear exosome. On correct mRNAs the SR proteins recruit Mex 67 upon completion of splicing to allow a quality controlled nuclear export. Altogether, these data identify a role for shuttling SR proteins in mRNA surveillance and nuclear mRNA quality control. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{papillomavirus}} type 16 (HPV 16) genome expresses six regulatory proteins (E 1, E 2, E 4, E 5, E 6, and E 7) which regulate viral DNA replication, gene expression, {{and cell}} function. We expressed HPV 16 E 2, E 4, E 6, and E 7 from bacteria as GST fusion proteins and examined their possible functions in RNA splicing. Both HPV 16 E 2, a viral transactivator protein, and E 6, a viral oncoprotein, inhibited splicing of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> containing an intron with suboptimal splice sites, whereas HPV 5 E 2 did not. The N-terminal half and the hinge region of HPV 16 E 2 {{as well as}} the N-terminal and central portions of HPV 16 E 6 are responsible for the suppression. HPV 16 E 2 interacts with <b>pre-mRNAs</b> through its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. HPV 16 E 6 binds <b>pre-mRNAs</b> via nuclear localization signal (NLS 3) in its C-terminal half. Low-risk HPV 6 E 6, a cytoplasmic protein, does not bind RNA. Notably, both HPV 16 E 2 and E 6 selectively bind to the intron region of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> and interact with a subset of cellular SR proteins. Together, these findings suggest that HPV 16 E 2 and E 6 are RNA binding proteins and might play roles in posttranscriptional regulation during virus infection...|$|R
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the <b>pre-mRNA</b> (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>pre-mRNA</b> {{has been}} {{transcribed}} from the DNA, it includes several introns and exons. (In nematodes, the mean is 4–5 exons and introns; in the fruit fly Drosophila {{there can be}} more than 100 introns and exons in one transcribed <b>pre-mRNA.)</b> The exons to be retained in the mRNA are determined during the splicing process. The regulation and selection of splice sites are done by trans-acting splicing activator and splicing repressor proteins as well as cis-acting elements within the <b>pre-mRNA</b> itself such as exonic splicing enhancers and exonic splicing silencers.|$|E

40|$|Polyadenylation of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> is {{critical}} for efficient nuclear export, stability, and translation of the mature mRNAs, and thus for gene expression. The bulk of <b>pre-mRNAs</b> are processed by canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase (PAPS). Both vertebrate and higher-plant genomes encode more than one isoform of this enzyme, and these are coexpressed in different tissues. However, in neither case is it known whether the isoforms fulfill different functions or polyadenylate distinct subsets of <b>pre-mRNAs.</b> Here we show that the three canonical nuclear PAPS isoforms in Arabidopsis are functionally specialized owing to their evolutionarily divergent C-terminal domains. A strong loss-of-function mutation in PAPS 1 causes a male gametophytic defect, whereas a weak allele leads to reduced leaf growth that results in part from a constitutive pathogen response. By contrast, plants lacking both PAPS 2 and PAPS 4 function are viable with wild-type leaf growth. Polyadenylation of SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) mRNAs depends specifically on PAPS 1 function. The resulting reduction in SAUR activity in paps 1 mutants contributes to their reduced leaf growth, providing a causal link between polyadenylation of specific <b>pre-mRNAs</b> by a particular PAPS isoform and plant growth. This suggests {{the existence of an}} additional layer of regulation in plant and possibly vertebrate gene expression, whereby the relative activities of canonical nuclear PAPS isoforms control de novo synthesized poly(A) tail length and hence expression of specific subsets of mRNAs...|$|R

40|$|In trypanosomatids, uridylate {{residues}} are post-transcriptionally {{added to}} or deleted from <b>pre-mRNAs</b> during the complex process of RNA editing. Editing {{is carried out}} exclusively in the mitochondrion of these parasites and involves numerous proteins assembled into protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Previously we identified RNA-editing-associated protein - 1 (REAP- 1), an RNA binding protein found in the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei. REAP- 1 was shown to specifically recognize and bind to <b>pre-mRNAs</b> that require editing and was proposed {{to act as a}} recruitment factor to deliver <b>pre-mRNAs</b> to editing complexes. To help define the role of REAP- 1, we have now constructed REAP- 1 null mutants. We show that the null mutants, although viable, have a significant growth defect. RNA levels within the mitochondrion were evaluated using reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. Surprisingly, the results show that mitochondrial RNA levels are increased, regardless of the editing status of the RNA. All RNA tested, whether unedited, edited, or never edited were increased in the mutant cell line relative to wild-type levels. This study provides the first evidence for a role of REAP- 1 in RNA metabolism...|$|R
