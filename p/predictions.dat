30|$|We have {{mentioned}} above that the K-MMSE estimation method {{does not always}} necessarily lead to a good <b>prediction</b> for the unknown blocks in the non-homogenous texture areas. In order to improve the <b>prediction</b> accuracy for the blocks in such texture areas, we propose to use the hybrid kernel-based MMSE estimation and IntraBC method (hybrid <b>prediction</b> method) to predict the coding blocks and the coding blocks in such texture areas construct the hybrid <b>prediction</b> layer. The hybrid <b>prediction</b> method {{is based on the}} HEVC screen content coding (HEVC-SCC) framework. In the hybrid <b>prediction</b> method, the K-MMSE estimation method, IntraBC <b>prediction,</b> and the intra-directional <b>prediction</b> are all used as the competing <b>prediction</b> modes.

In other word, the hybrid <b>prediction</b> method uses the “try all then select best” intra-mode decision method to find the best <b>prediction</b> mode and optimal depth for each coding block.|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} two {{new types}} of <b>prediction</b> errors in time series: the filtered <b>prediction</b> errors and the deletion <b>prediction</b> errors. These two <b>prediction</b> errors are obtained in the same sample used for estimation, but {{in such a way}} that they share some common properties with out of sample <b>prediction</b> errors. It is proved that the filtered <b>prediction</b> errors are uncorrelated, up to terms of magnitude order O(T- 2), with the in sample innovations, a property that share with the out-of-sample <b>prediction</b> errors. On the other hand, deletion <b>prediction</b> errors assume that the values to be predicted are unobserved, a property that they also share with out-of-sample <b>prediction</b> errors. It is shown that these <b>prediction</b> errors can be computed with parameters estimated by assuming innovative or additive outliers, respectively, at the points to be predicted. Then the <b>prediction</b> errors are obtained by running the procedure for all the points in the sample of data. Two applications of these new <b>prediction</b> errors are presented. The first is the estimation and comparison of the <b>prediction</b> mean squared errors of competing predictors. The second is the determination of the order of an ARMA model.

40|$|Intra <b>prediction</b> is a {{fundamental}} <b>prediction</b> type in blockbased video coding, which has been adopted by the most recent finalized standard H. 264 /AVC. H. 264 /AVC has specified several intra <b>prediction</b> modes that predict the current block through surrounding spatial neighboring pixels in a causal window along various directions. In this paper, we investigate the use of linear <b>prediction</b> for intra block coding and propose a context-adaptive intra <b>prediction</b> approach. Specifically, we use the least square <b>prediction</b> and derive the linear <b>prediction</b> coefficients using reconstructed data. The linear <b>prediction</b> coefficients implicitly embed the local texture characteristics and thus the intra <b>prediction</b> mode is adaptively adjusted according to the local context. No extra overhead is needed for signaling the coefficients since the decoder simply repeats the same deriving process. We take this context-adaptive linear <b>prediction</b> as an additional intra <b>prediction</b> mode along with existing H. 264 /AVC intra <b>prediction</b> modes, and choose the best mode through rate-distortion optimization. By turning on the new intra <b>prediction</b> mode, we will demonstrate an enhanced coding efficiency performance.

40|$|Academia and {{industry}} expend much effort to predict software defects. Researchers proposed many defect <b>prediction</b> algorithms and metrics. While previous defect <b>prediction</b> techniques often take {{the author of}} the code into consideration, none of these techniques build a separate <b>prediction</b> model for each developer. Different developers have different coding styles, commit frequencies, and experience levels, which would result in different defect patterns. When the defects of different developers are combined, such differences are obscured, hurting the <b>prediction</b> performance. This thesis proposes two techniques to improve defect <b>prediction</b> performance: personalized defect <b>prediction</b> and confidence-based hybrid defect <b>prediction.</b> Personalized defect <b>prediction</b> builds a separate <b>prediction</b> model for each developer to predict software defects. Confidence-based hybrid defect <b>prediction</b> combines different models by picking the <b>prediction</b> from the model with the highest confidence. As a proof of concept, we apply the two techniques to classify defects at the file change level.

40|$|In {{practice}} rarely (if ever) is {{the spatial}} covariance known in spatial <b>prediction</b> problems. Often, <b>prediction</b> is performed after estimated spatial covariance parameters are {{plugged into the}} <b>prediction</b> equation. The estimated spatial association parameters arealso plugged into the <b>prediction</b> variance of the spatial predictor. However, simply plugging in spatial covariance parameter estimates into the <b>prediction</b> variance of the spatial predictor {{does not take into}} account the uncertainty in the true values of the spatial covariance parameters. Therefore the plug-in <b>prediction</b> variance estimate will underestimate the true <b>prediction</b> variance of the estimated spatial predictor, especially for small datasets. We propose a new way to estimate the <b>prediction</b> variance of the estimated spatial predictor based on a covariance penalty using parametric bootstrapping. Our new estimator is compared to three other <b>prediction</b> variance estimators proposed in literature.
