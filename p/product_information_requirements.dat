This paper presents a product requirement modeling method based on configuration design, which uses “tabular layouts of article characteristics” (SML) technology to conduct the formal expression of <b>product</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>information</b> element. The function structure model and its optimization algorithm are proposed. Enterprises can use the model to interact with customers about requirements and obtain the model which can be manufactured. The customer individual requirements can be satisfied according to the mapping rules of models. Finally, an example of enterprise application is given to illustrate practical application of the research...|$|R
40|$|Observation {{functionality}} {{integrated into}} interactive products can help companies identifying current consumer requirements and expectations. As these needs can change rapidly, detailed <b>information</b> about <b>product</b> usage {{that comes from}} habitual interaction is crucial to evaluate product acceptance and relevance. We explore how products can be extended with observation functionality that satisfies the information needs of multi-disciplinary experts in the development team. In the process of <b>product</b> evaluation, <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are bound to change, {{and so is the}} observation behavior. Our approach addresses this by integrating observation functionality into products which can be adapted to current information needs. This paper presents a novel way to remotely configure products in the field by using high-level models, graphical observation specifications, that are interpreted by a runtime environment built into the products in the field. An industrial case-study shows the applicability of the approach. This work is part of ongoing development aiming at a generic observation integration methodolog...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} the obstacles against supplier compliance, which focal companies encounter within the upstream supply chain when attempting to collect the requested <b>product</b> contents <b>information.</b> Based on this problem, {{the objective is to}} identify the most useful supply chain management practices to ensure supplier compliance. Method: The theoretical framework contains the Principal-Agent theory and Responsible Supply Chain Management. The empirical findings are derived through semi-structured interviews that were conducted with three Swedish corporations operating in China and one Swedish-Chinese consulting firm. Results: The two main-obstacles to supplier compliance were firstly found to consist of lacking supplier understanding of the <b>product</b> contents <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> (PCIR). These obstacles prevented the supplier from understanding the risk at hand and what behaviour that triggered the risk. The second main-obstacles were found to be the prevalence of different opposing interests, which could all {{be traced back to the}} reluctance to assume an increase in costs, and could induce the supplier to pursue that interest rather than the interest to comply to the PCIR. With these obstacles in mind, the main objective of the focal company’s supply chain management practices should preferably be to create risk in relation to the PCIR, ensure supplier understanding and pay attention to the opposing interests. The most useful type of supply chain management practice for fulfilling these objectives were the use of incentives, preferably in combination with sanctions, to create risk. Training was considered most useful for ensuring supplier understanding, although a combination of training, personal communication and written documents is potentially interesting. Regarding the opposing interests, accommodating practices were found most useful rather than attempt to persuade the supplier to give up the interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>product</b> <b>information</b> management {{during the whole}} lifetime of the product has increased due to the technical sophistication of products as well as stricter governmental regulations for lifecycle management. Just sending the relevant <b>product</b> <b>information</b> downstream in the supply chain does not solve the challenges of <b>product</b> <b>information</b> management of complex products due to difficulties in updating the information and a risk of information overflow in the supply chain. This article describes an agent-based information management model {{that can be used}} for managing the <b>information</b> of complex <b>products</b> at a component level in a distributed manner.

Thirty-one participants performed two online shopping tasks (one searching and one browsing in nature) on predetermined e-tailing sites and were asked to evaluate the display of <b>product</b> <b>information</b> on these sites in helping them carry out these tasks. Results suggest three things: 1) information such as pricing, product description, retailer selection, retailer advice, and a good interface design are required in both tasks; 2) searching requires more detailed product information; and 3) browsing places greater emphasis on information about the retailer. Based on these findings, a theoretical framework for Web-based <b>product</b> <b>information</b> display is presented. With respect to the design of Web retailing sites, the study’s results imply {{the need to}} focus not only on goal-directed search, but also on non-directed browsing tasks as well.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the early phases of information systems (IS) development projects is to determine users' <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Systems analysts' primary concern is to secure <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are stable over {{the duration of the}} project.

40|$|Up until now, brick-and-mortar stores provide {{consumers}} with static <b>product</b> <b>information</b> {{in the form}} of printed product labels. This kind of <b>product</b> <b>information</b> does neither adapt to consumer needs nor facilitates new business models (e. g. consumer experience or ad hoc product bundling by products itself). By contrast, dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> provided by mobile recommendation agents (MRA) may leverage these limitations. In this article we formulate a Simplified Consumer Choice (SCC) model that is used as a reference model for investigating dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> provided by MRA. We evaluate this model by implying technology acceptance (TAM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT). In addition, we assess the SCC model according to decision making theory and analyze whether cognitive load can be reduced by the use of dynamic <b>product</b> <b>information</b> compared with static <b>product</b> <b>information.</b> An experiment (n= 37) was conducted to evaluate our hypotheses in which subjects were asked to buy a bundle of two compatible consumer products.

40|$|This thesis explores global {{business}} performance outcomes {{as a result}} of aligning ERP systems capabilities to {{global business}} <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Global business is a network of interconnected organizations that have multinational operations and exchange finished goods, raw materials, services, information, knowledge, skills and capital across national boundaries. It is a new business trend in which organisations from all industry sectors capitalize on cheap labour, low cost capital, unique resources and new market opportunities in the global economy. Global business management entails unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> from strategic business units (SBSs) operating {{in different parts of the}} world. Global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> include: 1) multi-level and multi-purpose information from global SBUs; 2) accurate and timely information; 3) consolidated information; 4) global business process information; 5) global supply chain information; and 6) secure information. The first three <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are important for supporting management decisions while the other three are important for supporting global businesses’ operating decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been increasingly adopted to meet global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> ERP systems capabilities that support global business information management include multi-level and multi-purpose information management; delivering accurate, timely and consolidated information; integrating global business process information; managing global supply chain information and transmitting secure information. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique this research established that if two variables (global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities) co-align, this resulted in improved business performance. The co-alignment in this research is adopted from Venkatraman’s explanation of “fit as co-variation/co-alignment” perspective. Performance outcomes of global business {{as a result of}} co-aligning ERP systems capabilities and global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> are measured using four perspectives: financial performance; customer performance; learning and growth performance; and internal business process performance. Findings of this research supported the conceptualisation of fit from the co-alignment/co-variation perspective, confirming that the co-alignment of global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> and ERP systems capabilities leads to better business performance of global organizations. The findings also confirmed that global organisations have unique <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> that are somewhat different to local businesses. ERP systems are able to support global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements.</b> Findings also confirmed that the financial, customer, learning and growth and internal business process performance of global organizations are moderated by the organization size and the globalization history. Not only does this research fill the void in global business literature by investigating the important role information plays in global business management, but it extends the ERP literature and IT/IS alignment theories to the co-alignment of IS capabilities with global business <b>information</b> <b>requirements</b> for improved performance outcomes. The major contribution to knowledge this research makes is the development and validation of a co-alignment model, extending theories of IT/IS alignment to the alignment of a specific information system (ERP system) to a specific type of business (global business) ...|$|R
