5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost <b>per</b> <b>operation.</b> This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time <b>per</b> <b>operation.</b> Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key {{is computed by}} using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time <b>per</b> <b>operation.</b> Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, {{it is possible to}} compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses <b>per</b> <b>operation.</b> Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.|$|E

50|$|In G80/G90/GT200, each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) {{contains}} 8 Shader Processors (SP, or Unified Shader, or CUDA Core) and 2 Special Function Units (SFU). Each SP can fulfill {{up to two}} single-precision <b>operations</b> <b>per</b> clock: 1 Multiply and 1 Add, using {{a single}} MAD instruction. Each SFU can fulfill up to four <b>operations</b> <b>per</b> clock: four MUL (Multiply) instructions. So one SM as a whole can execute 8 MADs (16 operations) and 8 MULs (8 <b>operations)</b> <b>per</b> clock, or 24 <b>operations</b> <b>per</b> clock, which is (relatively speaking) 3 {{times the number of}} SPs. Therefore, to calculate the theoretical dual-issue MAD+MUL performance in floating point <b>operations</b> <b>per</b> second GFLOPS of a graphics card with SP count n and shader frequency GHz, the formula is: FLOPSsp+sfu = 3 × n × f.|$|R

25|$|Because {{tabulation}} hashing is {{a universal}} hashing scheme, {{it can be used}} in any hashing-based algorithm in which universality is sufficient. For instance, in hash chaining, the expected time <b>per</b> <b>operation</b> is proportional to the sum of collision probabilities, which is the same for any universal scheme as it would be for truly random hash functions, and is constant whenever the load factor of the hash table is constant. Therefore, tabulation hashing can be used to compute hash functions for hash chaining with a theoretical guarantee of constant expected time <b>per</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients).

Post-procedure, each patient {{was instructed to}} regard any lump in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed. Moreover, the study Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells (2007), about a 40-woman cohort, indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells to the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the autologous fat-grafting procedure.|$|E

500|$|At his clinic, Brinkley {{began to}} perform more {{operations}} he claimed would restore male virility and fertility through implanting the testicular glands of goats in his male patients {{at a cost}} of $750 <b>per</b> <b>operation</b> ($ [...] in current value). Following one of his crude operations, the body of a patient would typically absorb the goat gonads as foreign matter. The organs were never accepted as part of the body since they were simply placed into the human male testicle sac or the abdomen of women, near the ovaries. Unsurprisingly, in light of his questionable medical training (75 percent completion at a less-than-reputable medical school), frequency of operating while intoxicated and less-than sterile operating environments, some patients suffered from infection, and an undetermined number died. Brinkley would be sued more than a dozen times for wrongful death between 1930 and 1941.|$|E

[...] His business, fueled by radio advertisements and speeches, {{continued to}} thrive, and he opened another clinic in San Juan, Texas specializing in the colon. By 1936, Brinkley had amassed enough wealth to build a mansion {{for himself and his}} wife on [...] of land. [...] Brinkley boasted a stable of a dozen Cadillacs, a greenhouse, a foaming fountain garden surrounded by 8,000 bushes, exotic animals imported from the Galapagos Islands, and a swimming pool with a [...] diving tower. [...] Brinkley continued living high in Del Rio, until in 1938 a rival doctor began cutting into Brinkley's business by offering similar procedures much more cheaply. [...] When Del Rio's city elders refused to put the competitor out of business, Brinkley closed up shop and reopened in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas with another hospital at what is now Marylake Monastery.

Surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of <b>per</b> <b>operation,</b> thus the costs to the hospital drops when the number of procedures increases, taking advantage of economies of scale.
