5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} <b>pad,</b> he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional <b>pad</b> in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional <b>pad.</b> Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional <b>pad</b> back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|After the {{leveling}} <b>pad</b> {{has been}} laid {{and the first}} row of panels has been placed and braced, the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted.|$|E
50|$|Round rubber <b>pads</b> were {{introduced}} with the TD-7 drum module in 1992 (previous Roland <b>pads</b> were polygonal) and were universally used as trigger <b>pads</b> for drums and cymbals. Since {{the introduction of}} mesh-head drum <b>pads</b> and cymbal-shaped trigger <b>pads,</b> standard rubber <b>pads</b> are only used as tom-tom and (until recently) bass drum trigger <b>pads</b> on Roland's less expensive drum kits. More expensive kits don't include any rubber <b>pads</b> at all any more.|$|R
50|$|Some {{women make}} their own cloth menstrual <b>pads.</b> These <b>pads</b> range from folded wash cloths to <b>pads</b> similar to the cloth menstrual <b>pads</b> {{available}} commercially.|$|R
25|$|Three {{types of}} <b>padding</b> {{commonly}} used in boxing gloves are horsehair <b>padding,</b> foam <b>padding</b> or a mix of both. Foam <b>padding</b> gloves use latex and PVC foam with shock absorber. Horsehair gloves last longer than foam <b>padding</b> gloves and are environmentally friendly, but are less protective.|$|R
5|$|At Cape Canaveral, {{the space}} shuttle Discovery was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching <b>pad</b> after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching <b>pad</b> to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E

5000|$|In cryptography, a <b>padding</b> oracle {{attack is}} an attack which is {{performed}} using the <b>padding</b> of a cryptographic message. In cryptography, variable-length plaintext messages often have to be <b>padded</b> (expanded) to be compatible with the underlying cryptographic primitive. The attack relies on having a [...] "padding oracle" [...] who freely responds to queries about whether a message is correctly <b>padded</b> or not. <b>Padding</b> oracle attacks are mostly associated with CBC mode decryption used within block ciphers. <b>Padding</b> modes for asymmetric algorithms such as OAEP may also be vulnerable to <b>padding</b> oracle attacks.|$|R
50|$|In cricket, <b>pads</b> {{fall into}} two types, batting <b>pads</b> and wicket-keeper's <b>pads.</b> In Test and {{first-class}} cricket, the <b>pads</b> are white (to match {{the rest of the}} player's whites), while in limited overs cricket they may be coloured.|$|R
5|$|In 1931, Everett H. Kimmell, another U.S. Surveyor, {{found this}} newer stone had broken too and he {{replaced}} it with a brass disc marker set in cement. In 1962, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured an elevated cement <b>pad</b> around the 1931 brass marker; this <b>pad</b> included the state border lines and names in tile. The monument was completely rebuilt in 1992, and the 1931 brass marker was replaced with a disc shaped aluminum-bronze plate set in granite. The monument was again rebuilt in 2010, although the disc shaped plate from 1992 remained in place.|$|E

50|$|All the bytes {{that are}} {{required}} to be <b>padded</b> are <b>padded</b> with zero. The zero <b>padding</b> scheme has not been standardized for encryption, although it is specified for hashes and MACs as <b>Padding</b> Method 1 in ISO/IEC 10118-1 and ISO/IEC 9797-1.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pads</b> 25A and 25B {{were built}} in 1957. <b>Pads</b> 25C and 25D were added in May 1968 for the larger Poseidon. The {{blockhouse}} eventually served all four <b>pads.</b> It was extensively reinforced when the Poseidon <b>pads,</b> 25C and 25D, were added.|$|R

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike <b>pad</b> which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the <b>pad</b> with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike <b>pad</b> needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 <b>pad</b> storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed <b>Pad</b> 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5 was {{launched}} by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, {{but by the}} first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the launch <b>pad</b> on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the launch <b>pad,</b> Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January.|$|E

5000|$|Elbow <b>pads</b> - Provides {{forearm and}} {{sometimes}} triceps protection against pucks {{in addition to}} a reinforced elbow cup. Elbow <b>pads</b> are vital for all hockey players. The <b>pads</b> can protect the elbow joint and arm bones from bruises and prevent fractures. The elbow <b>pads</b> cover the elbow joint and part of the upper and lower arms. Some elbow <b>pads</b> do have extensions that can cover the entire upper arm. The majority of elbow <b>pads</b> are adjustable and are secured with Velcro straps.|$|R
50|$|In some {{circumstances}} <b>padding</b> {{is not required}} or used (the <b>padding</b> can be inferred from {{the length of the}} string modulo 8). RFC 4648 states that <b>padding</b> must be used unless the specification of the standard referring to the RFC explicitly states otherwise. Excluding <b>padding</b> is useful when using base32 encoded data in URL tokens or file names where the <b>padding</b> character could pose a problem.|$|R

5|$|During the launch, Launch <b>Pad</b> 39A {{sustained}} substantial damage, {{more than}} had been seen on any previous launch. Following liftoff, inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad's base had been thrown {{as far as the}} perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457m).|$|E

50|$|Cotton <b>pads</b> are <b>pads</b> made {{of cotton}} {{which are used}} for medical or {{cosmetic}} purposes. For medical purposes, cotton <b>pads</b> are used to stop or prevent bleeding from minor punctures such as injections or venipuncture. They may be secured in place with tape. Cotton <b>pads</b> are also used in the application {{and the removal of}} makeup. Cotton <b>pads</b> are soft enough that they can be used to clean babies. Cotton balls have much of the same applications as cotton <b>pads,</b> and can be used interchangeably.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of <b>padding</b> {{is that it}} makes the plain text of the message susceptible to <b>padding</b> oracle attacks. <b>Padding</b> oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself. <b>Padding</b> oracle attacks can be avoided by making sure that an attacker cannot gain knowledge about the removal of the <b>padding</b> bytes. This can be accomplished by verifying a message authentication code (MAC) or digital signature before removal of the <b>padding</b> bytes, or by switching to a streaming mode of operation.|$|R
