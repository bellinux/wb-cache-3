50|$|There is a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> when {{an estate}} {{will return to}} the grantor if a {{condition}} is violated. The <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> can only follow a fee simple determinable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fee simple}} determinable is an estate that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will revert to the grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> follows a {{fee simple determinable}}. However a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> does not follow a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a fee simple determinable and a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some jurisdictions in the United States have {{abolished}} this interest. For example, Kentucky {{abolished the}} {{fee simple determinable}} and <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> by statute in 1960. An attempt to create such an interest is construed as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (see below), and a person who would have <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> at common law will instead have a right of entry.|$|E

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 New Biology 2 ̆ 2 {{has already}} made {{profound}} impact on the law. Cryonics and genetic engineering represent technological triumphs. The natural, organic process of dying is being replaced by a humanly engineered technological process for living. The dying phase of lite is prolonged until biological knowledge is available to reverse the dying phase and restore the living phase. Both cryonics and genetic engineering {{in their attempts to}} replace the organic process with the technological process disturb the delicate balance of the triad of lite which each individual experiences-faith, health, and justice. Since law is a basic tool to achieve justice among human beings, how should it respond to the health argument of the cryonics 2 ̆ 7 physician who views death as a disease which is curable? How should the law respond to the faith questions surrounding the cryonics patient? What am I? A block of ice. Who am I? A living, comatose patient or a dormant, static body with the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a <b>reverter.</b> Why am I? A new human being now endowed with immortality through the triumph of life over death founded on man 2 ̆ 7 s current faith in the God called Technology. Cryonics through its unbalancing of the traditional triad of lite poses formidable challenges to the major institutions of faith, health and justice. The practitioners in these institutions: clergy, physicians and lawyers must now reassess {{the rules of the game}} of life be they religious, medical or legal. This article offers insights to begin this reassessment...|$|R

50|$|Reversion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> created in the grant of a fee simple determinable. Although both result in the return of the land to the original grantor or his heirs, reversions occur upon the natural expiration of the grantee's estate, while the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> actively ends the grantee's otherwise-indefinite estate as a consequence of the grantee's failure to comply with the condition contained in the grant.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of future}} {{interest}} can only follow the fee simple determinable. The vesting {{of the future}} interest is determinable {{at the time of}} the grant, because reverter is automatic if the condition is broken—a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter,</b> therefore, is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities.|$|E
5000|$|The rule {{does not}} apply to {{interests}} in the grantor himself. For example, the grant [...] "For A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises, then to B" [...] would violate the rule as to B. However, the conveyance to B would be stricken, leaving [...] "To A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises." [...] This would create a fee simple determinable in A, with a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> in the grantor (or the grantor's heirs). The grant to B would be void as it is possible alcohol would be sold on the premises more than 21 years after the deaths of A, B, and the grantor. However, as the rule {{does not apply}} to grantors, the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> in the grantor (or his heirs) would be valid.|$|E

50|$|According {{to another}} theory, the farfan units in North Africa were {{originally}} Christian slaves and {{prisoners of war}} held by the Almoravid dynasty after its successful offensives against the Christians in Iberia. Units made out entirely of slaves or of recently freed men were relatively common both in North Africa and in al-Andalus so this theory {{of the origin of}} the farfan fits in an observable pattern. The history <b>of</b> <b>Reverter</b> de La Guardia, a Catalan nobleman who had been captured by the Almoravid army on a Spanish battlefield in the 1120s is one of the earliest examples of a Christian mercenary fighting in North Africa and it would support this scenario.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of Michigan {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} whether Quia Emptores ever became effectual {{in any part of}} the United States by express or implied adoption or as part of the common law {{did not have to be}} ascertained. It was clear that no such statute was ever needed in Michigan or in any of the western states, because no <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> or escheat in the party converying an estate ever existed. At all times, escheat could only accrue to the sovereign, which, in Michigan, is the state.|$|E
5000|$|The rule never {{applies to}} {{conditions}} {{placed on a}} conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance [...] "to the Red Cross, {{so long as it}} operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund" [...] would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the Fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise [...] "to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church" [...] would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the original conveyance was [...] "to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith does not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross" [...] this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void. Thus leaving John with a fee simple determinable and the grantor a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} the general inappropriateness of strictly adhering to any one predetermined standard in compensating owners whose property has been taken. Holmes' admonition is appropriate in this instance not because the reasons behind the standards have vanished, but because the courts, "from blind imitation" of these objective standards, have strayed from their reason for being. That reason is the just compensation requirement in the fifth amendment. Section II of this article compares United States Supreme Court opinions with other approaches to determine when, in general, compensation is "just" compensation. The {{purpose of this}} section is to urge that just compensation be equated with the fifth amendment's dictate of fairness and indemnity rather than with any one objective standard. Section III analyzes the rules the Restatement of Property and the courts have provided for deciding how a future interest holder should be compensated. The rules governing compensation for an owner of a <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> are emphasized throughout, since they represent the most egregious departure from the constitutional dictate. This section presents the condemnation of fee simple determinables as representative of the objective standards' failure in determining just compensation in all takings cases and proposes restructuring this approach by dethroning objective standards and emphasizing the equities of each case. Section IV reviews a recent article by Professors Goldberg and Merrill, and Daniel Unumb in which they support a "default rule" which gives the entire condemnation award to the grantee of a fee simple determinable thereby denying the owner of the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> any compensation. Section IV takes issue with their support of this rule and demonstrates that, despite their indications to the contrary, ex ante clauses could work effectively in a deed granting a fee simple determinable...|$|E
50|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, when {{interest}} {{loans were}} illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME wedset). A wadset was a loan masked as a {{sale of land}} under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a fee simple estate, in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would reconvey the estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to reconvey it to the reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an in personam right <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b>|$|R

40|$|Professor Gray, in {{the first}} edition of his great work, 2 ̆ 2 The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2 ̆ 2 Section 31 and following, contended that the Statute Quia Emptores by putting an end to tenure between feoffor and feoffee of an estate in fee simple, {{incidentally}} put an end to <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter</b> to the feoffer on failure of the condition in a determihable fee. Specifically he says that upon dissolution of an eleemosynary corporation a terminable gift to such corporation does not revert to the donor, as is said by Lord Coke, Co. LITT. 13 b, but escheats. For reversion depends on tenure, and the Statute by destroying tenure ends <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>reverter.</b> In his third edition, Section 40 a, he notes that since the second edition of his book three cases have held contra, [...] North v.
