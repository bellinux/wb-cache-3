40|$|Last year, {{the design}} and {{implementation}} details of a new modular sideband-separating mixer block, intended as an upgrade for the current single-ended ALMA Band 9 mixers, were presented at this conference. In high-frequency observation bands like ALMA Band 9 (600 - 720 GHz), which is strongly influenced by atmospheric noise, employment of sideband separating mixers can reduce, by roughly a factor of two, the integration time needed to reach a certain signal-to-noise ratio for spectral line observations. Alternatively, in the same integration time, a sufficiently larger selection of sources can be accessed. Two prototype mixer blocks were produced on a micro milling machine, and equipped with production Band 9 SIS mixer devices that have independently been tested in double-sideband mode. Here, we present {{the results of the}} first measurements, notably, the noise temperature, image rejection, LO <b>pumping</b> <b>balance</b> and IF response. We also present in detail a procedure of the image rejection ratio measurement, which is fast and can be used for single sideband mixers, so that a second IF chain is not required...|$|E

This interfacial resistance was found not to be negligible. Furthermore, both resistances showed sensitivity to temperature and relative humidity. The internal diffusion coefficient estimated from the results of water permeation experiments correlated well with the results obtained by the pulse field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) method.

40|$|ObjectivesModified {{ultrafiltration}} is {{a technique}} after cardiopulmonary bypass whereby blood withdrawn from the aortic cannula is passed across a semipermeable membrane to hemoconcentrate. Unblinded trials have suggested that modified ultrafiltration is efficacious for blood conservation. The objective of this trial {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a model testing modified ultrafiltration in which all members of the surgical team were blinded to the intervention. MethodsPatients (< 65 kg) undergoing procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to undergo either modified ultrafiltration (n= 29) or sham (circulation without an interposed filter, n= 36) for 15 minutes. The circuit was shielded from all members of the team except the perfusionist. A questionnaire was administered to determine the blinding success. ResultsModified ultrafiltration resulted in a removal of 1000 ± 251 mL of fluid and a reduction in the <b>pump</b> <b>balance</b> (1025 ± 807 vs 1804 ± 838; P <. 001) with an increase in hemoglobin immediately after intervention (increase of 7. 7 ± 8. 8 g/L in modified ultrafiltration vs 3. 8 ± 5. 1 g/L in sham; P=. 04). Introduction or increase in dose of vasopressors was more frequent in the modified ultrafiltration group (52 % vs 28 %; P=. 048). Differences in red cell transfusion rates between groups did not reach statistical significance (P=. 59). Blinding was successful for the anesthetist (blinding index 0. 13 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 11 – 0. 38] and the intensivist (blinding index, 0. 09 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 14 – 0. 31]) but not for the surgeon (blinding index, 0. 24 [95 % confidence interval, 0. 05 – 0. 42]). The compliance rate for the transfusion protocol was greater than 90 %.

This platform, PLAMER, has three main modules: Initialization module, consisting of different sub-modules to define the electrical system structure and to organize the input data {{of the rest of}} modules, PLAMER-bids, to read, aggregate and visualize market historical bids and also to prepare them for their future forecasted values, and PLAMER-clearing, for market clearing emulation using forecasted bids. PLAMER-clearing models the Iberian market based on a bid clearing mechanism with an inherent market splitting procedure. This market splitting is built with a bi-nodal simplification, one node representing the Spanish System and the other the Portuguese one. Both are simply connected by a unique equivalent interconnection line. The medium term clearing model uses a generation portfolio per generation company in terms of technologies, for supplying monthly demand for different load levels, and labour and non-labour periods.
