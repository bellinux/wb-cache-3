5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} {{of what to do with}} the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Harvey Johnson, Jr. {{was elected}} as Jackson's first African-American mayor. During his term, he {{proposed}} {{the development of}} a convention center to attract more business to the city.

50|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are 5.85 {{million people in the}} United States who cannot vote due to felony convictions, including 2.6 million who have completed their sentences but are disenfranchised in states with the most restrictive policies.

25|$|In 1914, Senator John Shafroth {{introduced}} a federal {{amendment that would}} require state legislatures to put women's suffrage on the state ballot if eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> signed a petition to that effect. The NAWSA endorsed the proposed amendment, whereupon the CU accused it of abandoning the drive for a national suffrage amendment. Amid confusion among the membership, delegates at the 1914 convention directed their dissatisfaction at Shaw.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Dade County repudiated Bryant's {{successful}} {{campaign of}} 20 years earlier and reauthorized an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting individuals from {{discrimination on the}} basis of sexual orientation by a seven-to-six vote. In 2002, a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law, called Amendment 14, was voted down by 56 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters.</b> The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal appellate court against a constitutional challenge but was overturned by a Miami-Dade circuit court in November 2008.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{replacement}} terminal in the works at the airport. A plan {{to develop a new}} airport terminal building was unveiled by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority in 2013. The replacement terminal would cost a reported $400 million and meet newer seismic standards and be further away from the runway as required by the Federal Aviation Administration. The new location is west of Hollywood Way on undeveloped property that has been used in recent years for parking. The Burbank City Council left it up to voters decide on the plan. Known as Measure B, the proposal went before Burbank city voters on November 8, 2016 and passed with 69 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> approving it.|$|E

500|$|Political parties, {{candidates}} and voters who have endorsed a particular candidate (or state) in presidential, parliamentary or European Parliament elections may file complaints with the State Electoral Commission regarding irregularities {{in the election}} process within 48 hours of a disputed activity. In the European Parliament elections, voter complaints are required to be endorsed by at least 100 voters (or five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters).</b> If the commission finds the complaint valid, it will order {{the part of the}} election process directly affected by the disputed activity to be repeated (possibly postponing the election date if there is insufficient time left). The commission must provide its decision within 48 hours after the complaint is submitted. The decision may be appealed before the Constitutional Court of Croatia within 48 hours of its receipt and once petitioned, the court must return a ruling within 48 hours. In local council elections, [...] complaints are processed by county, city or town electoral commissions (as appropriate). In mayoral elections, complaints are filed with the county electoral commission. This does not apply to Zagreb mayoral elections, where complaints are submitted to the State Electoral Commission (the case also in county prefect elections). The time allowances and appeals procedure are the same as for presidential and parliamentary elections.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 1940, when {{international}} attention {{was focused on}} the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Stalin claimed that the mutual assistance treaties had been violated, and gave six-hour ultimatums for new governments to be formed in each country, including lists of persons for cabinet posts provided by the Kremlin. Thereafter, state administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, followed by mass repression in which 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed.

2500|$|Initial Soviet occupations of the Baltic {{countries}} {{had occurred in}} mid-June 1940, when Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, followed by the liquidation of state administrations and replacement by Soviet cadres. Elections for parliament and other offices were held with single candidates listed and the official results fabricated, purporting pro-Soviet candidates' approval by 92.8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in Estonia, 97.6 percent in Latvia, and 99.2 percent in Lithuania. The fraudulently installed peoples assemblies immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union, with the annexations resulting in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic, and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. [...] The international community condemned this initial annexation of the Baltic states and deemed it illegal.|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 interim {{constitution}} specified {{the terms}} and conditions for the drafting of a permanent constitution.

The draft was criticized by the Thai Rak Thai party and supported by the Democrat party. Criticism of the draft was banned. The CNS attempted to link loyalty to the king with support for the draft, and ran a campaign with the slogan [...] "Love the King. Care about the King. Vote in a referendum.

50|$|The South African general {{election}} of 1948 {{was held on}} 26 May 1948 and saw the Nationalist Party together with the Afrikaner Party winning the {{general election}}s. Malan's Herenigde Nasionale Party (HNP) concluded an election pact with the Afrikaner Party in 1947. They won the elections with a very narrow majority of five seats in Parliament, although they only got 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> support. This {{was due to the}} loaded constituencies in cities, which was to <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> rural constituencies. <b>The</b> nine Afrikaner Party MPs thus made it possible for Malan's HNP to form a coalition government with <b>the</b> Afrikaner Party <b>of</b> Klasie Havenga. <b>The</b> two parties amalgamated in 1951 as the National Party although Havenga was not comfortable with NP policy to remove coloured <b>voters</b> from <b>the</b> common voters' roll.|$|R

25|$|In the November 1860 Presidential election, Kentucky voters gave native Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln {{less than}} one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote.

But, neither did they vote for native son John C. Breckinridge and his Southern Democratic Party, generally regarded as secessionists. In 1860, {{people in the state}} held 225,000 slaves, with Louisville's slaves comprising 7.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. <b>The</b> <b>voters</b> wanted both to keep slavery and stay in the Union.|$|R
