50|$|Circuit Merit 3 is {{generally}} regarded as the minimum acceptable for <b>public</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> service, and {{is used as a}} basis for drawing coverage boundaries. Where necessary, CM2 may be found tolerable for occasional calls, but this grade of transmission is clearly unsuitable as a service offering. In typical service areas so defined, users will experience transmission as poor as CM3 only when the mobile station is situated near the fringes of the area. They will enjoy better transmission throughout the bulk of the coverage area and, as a usual consequence, on most of their calls. Situationsin which fringe coverage areas pass through important localities heavily frequented by local mobile stations should be avoided since users may not find CM3 agreeable if experienced on any large proportion of their calls.|$|E

The <b>public</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> segment is then examined to illustrate a methodology for identifying a potential satellite addressable market, including capacity requirements for roughly sizing a satellite. It is postulated that satellites could serve this lower density (mobiles/sq. km), thin-route markets at a competitive cost and thus complement terrestrial systems in the urban and more densely populated areas to provide an integrated nationwide mobile service...|$|E

The experiment would establish network architecture, develop system and ground-segment technology, and define the technical characteristics needed to help structure the regulatory/institutional framework needed to enable a first-generation commercial satellite service.

40|$|Abstract: Communication via <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> is {{widespread}} in East Asian metropolis such as Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo. In {{the last ten}} years, the number of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> users has increased dramatically, with the younger generation in particular depending on the services available via <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones.</b> This paper explores {{the relationship between the}} voice and text messaging communications of these young consumers through their <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> and their interpersonal relations. It analyses how <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> usage affects relationships between respondents by comparing models of the cause-effect relationship of several latent factors in different environments, namely dependency on <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> communication, perception of friendships, individual factors and IT literacy. By applying a covariance structure analysis, the correlations between latent and observable variables can be successfully visualized. The results show that <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> have little influence on the perception of relationships among the younger generation, although somewhat different structures of interdependency exist in these metropolitan areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} respond to recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> users, three frequency bands are currently used for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> systems. We herein propose a three-frequency-band antenna that is useful for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> base stations. We first developed a two-band antenna called the Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (DMTLA) that consists of two simplified MTLA of different lengths. By attaching a parasitic element to the DMTLA based on the multi-band technique using parallel transmission line loading, we realize the three-band Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (3 -B DMTLA) for the base station antenna of a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> system.
