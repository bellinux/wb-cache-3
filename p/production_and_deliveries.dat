From the very start, Vaisala was an international business, exporting 95 percent of the production. As the Vaisala radiosonde became internationally renowned, the demand for them increased. In 1944, Prof. Väisälä established a company called Mittari Oy ("Gauge Incorporated") and set up manufacturing facilities for radiosonde systems. The first sounding system included a semi-automatic radiosonde receiver, a calibration device and a ground check set. The company employed 13 people at the time. Later, in 1955, the name of Mittari was changed to Vaisala.|$|E

As a result of the high demand for Model 3, in May 2016 Tesla Motors announced its decision to advance its 500,000 total unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X, and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned, in order to accelerate its target for Model 3 output.

50|$|Beaufighter {{production}} proceeded {{more smoothly}} than its forebear, {{as might be}} expected when the same sub-contracting companies took part in both programmes. The RAAF had considered the type as early as February 1939 and placed an initial order in June that year, before the prototype had even flown. The same supply problems that delayed the Beaufort ended any chance of the RAAF acquiring Beaufighters for the time being, and it wasn't until the end of 1942 that plans began to be laid for Beaufighter production. The Australian Government gave the go-ahead for manufacture of 350 Beaufighters on 30 January 1943 and preparations got underway in earnest. As the supply of engines from Britain was still uncertain at that time, a Bristol-built aircraft was re-engined with Wright GR-2600 Cyclones as insurance; in the event all Australian-built Beaufighters were fitted with imported Bristol Hercules engines. The first DAP Beaufighter flew {{for the first time on}} 26 May 1944 and <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>deliveries</b> slightly overlapped those of Beauforts, with the first two dozen Beaufighters being built and delivered concurrently with the last fifty-or-so Beauforts.

In this paper, we consider any production policy, when given any external demand as a vector-valued function of time.

Previously, a two-echelon supply chain model without setup of <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> is considered <b>and</b> a one-for-one inventory control policy {{is applied to the}} supply chain. In the inventory control policy, production is stopped when the warehouse inventory reaches the upper limit and is started again immediately after the inventory drops below the limit. Moreover, delivery to the retailer is stopped when the store inventory reaches the upper limit and is started again immediately after the inventory drops below the limit. The total cost that consists of inventory holding costs and lost sales cost is considered, and setup costs are not considered in the total cost. Once setup costs are introduced, the one-for-one inventory control policy is no longer appropriate. Then, this paper develops a new control policy for the two-echelon dual-channel supply chain with setup of <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery.</b> As performance measure, the total cost that consists of inventory holding costs, lost sales cost, <b>and</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> setup costs is considered, and the total cost calculated on the basis of Markov analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control policy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design case for arctic LNG transport, where liquefied gas is shipped from the Kharasevey terminal in Northern Russia to markets in US and Europe. Based on a fleet simulation model, the trade-off {{between the two}} main performance issues related to arctic transport are investigated; namely how to maintain transport system integrity in the harsh ice conditions, while maximizing the capacity utilization in a situation with considerable seasonal variations. The fixed contract, single destination base case shows that meeting the requirements for a robust solution implies a low degree of utilization in the summer season. To improve upon this situation, several mitigating strategies are evaluated, including vessel speed and size changes, fixed and seasonally varying contract and market mix schedules, revision stop re-scheduling, storage capacity extensions and backhauling. The results indicate a high payoff from renegotiating the initial fixed schedule contract {{to allow for a}} higher degree of seasonal variations in the LNG deliveries. Further, increased storage capacity in loading port, combined with winter revision stops will {{have a significant impact on}} both fleet utilization and total system integrity. Flexible contracts that implies seasonal deliveries to the UK will help ensure continuous <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>deliveries</b> in winter season.

40|$|Timely {{provision}} of quality products {{at the lowest}} prices possible has become the utmost competitive edge being pursued by virtually all manufacturing firms. They endeavour to speed up their <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>deliveries</b> of goods to end customers {{in order to make}} more money and even survive in the fierce competition arena. Although much {{progress has been made in}} operations management and a series of production planning approaches have been proposed to achieve various manufacturing operations goals, optimisation results are often rendered unrealistic and even misleading, for few studies have considered the overall corporate goal of shareholder wealth maximisation and the specific economic environments where manufacturing firms operate. Some critical factors closely related to interests of corporate owners, such as working capital management and capital structure, are rarely involved in an overwhelming majority of production planning problems. Moreover, the overlook of the effects of production planning results on the environment makes them more impractical and even unavailable in real-world manufacturing environments. To this end, the dissertation proposes a stochastic production planning model for the uncertain make-to-order production environment, with the focus mainly on the lot sizing decision-making policy. The primary goal of the optimization problem is to maximise the sustainable full interests of corporate owners, namely, the shareholder wealth, rather than to optimise some traditional local or short-term objective functions, such as work flow times, accounting costs, accounting profits and the like. To improve the generality and exactness of the proposed model, all involved uncertain random events are characterized by their own inherent statistical merits without any impractical assumptions on their distributions. The improvement of production planning is not the only one single source of the wealth-based business performance. There are also some other critical factors which can impose direct influences on shareholder wealth. Among these potential shareholder wealth drivers, we choose to examine the effective management of working capital and capital structure, for they are closely pertinent to a firm’s financial position and its cash flow status. In addition, environmental protection has in recent decades aroused extensively global attention because of its far-reaching impingements on the social and economic developments of the world. The carbon emission in production, especially its main component—carbon dioxide, is generally recognized as the most important emission source. To mitigate their diverse interference with the climate and the environment, a wide range of emission reduction measures, laws, and legislations has been enacted and implemented, making production planning optimisations more complicated. To better reflect the emerging production planning environment facing manufacturing firms, the emission trading system for carbon management, which has thus far become the most popular market-based carbon reduction mechanism, is incorporated into the proposed production planning model. To theoretically and analytically validate the proposed approach, the probability and convex theories are adopted to prove the convexity or concavity of the optimisation objectives and the relevant global optimal characteristics. Numerical experiments are further conducted to demonstrate the important implications of the proposed optimisation model to production planning in industrial practices. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Manufacturing Resource Planning(MRP II) is a informatics system which is use for planning of production activities at the long and middle period. In this study,effects of Material Requirement Planning and Manufacturing Resource Planning on the control activities were examined. In thestudies, it is aimed that designation technological structure of the companies, establishing the rivalry force and designation effectson the companies. For this aim, researchs were carried out on the companies that have MRP or MRP II, continual productionand especially have a assembly line. Total 93 companies that in the Ankara region and different industry areas have been added inthis study. In this study, a questionnaire that existenced 39 questions have been applicated about general informations, companyproperties, structure of the organization, general management and production management. The results which have been obtainedthe questionnaire have been transferred SPSS 15 Software. The results have been commented {{on the outcome of}} the SPSSprogramme. While the production activities have been maintained at present industry, date of <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>deliveries,</b> cost ofproduction, defining the capasity of production, commodity procurement and acquiring quality are quite important. On accountof this, enterprises have to make production planning before commencing the production for achieving analysis of when, bywhom, where, in which way, on which products, in which duration and steps the production will be implemented. All theactivities of enterprise functions start with what their obectives are and how to attain them. However, this is the beginning ofplanning process; so production acivities start with production planning initially as production is an enterprise function. Production planning should be defined as planning activity of optimal quantity usage of resources for preset requirements ofproduction. The plans which purvey production requirements to attain enterprise’s objectives are production plannings. All of theproduction activities that will be implemented in enterprise are realized according to production plans. Production plans leadmanagers and employees who are dealing with production activities. The importance of production planning has improved rapidly in parallel with the improvement of production systems. Thereasons that production planning must take place in a manufacturing enterprise inevitably may be summarized as follows:• Activity density and complexity of production systems• Coordination difficulty of activities in enterprises• Dependence among enterprices and improvement of relationships• Enlargement of consumer mass and diverse array of their demands Multidivision of procuration and distribution activities• Increase of maintanence, quality and price rivalry• The necessity of minimizing the loss of material, mechanical time and labour with the aim of making the enterprise workeconomicallyMRP is a planning method in production basically. The basic aim of MRP is furnishing that the material which are producedor bought may be ready before the next production step. This operation is achieved by predefining and considering eachproduction activity, abrogating spare times and backward calculation from the beginning. In MRP; it is supposed that charts aredependent on spare times. MRP facilitates employers to define fixed spare times. Hence, MRP is used for organizing complex activities occured inproduction process. MRP is a production planning system and it is not used for production tabulating. The developments in MRP II are capasity requirements planning and shop control system in addition to MRP in terms ofproduction planning. So many MRP II software firms use their special versions for shop control systems. Operating the real timed MRP system in its actual mode with consumer orders instead of estimated main pruduction planshas advantages as follows:• Operating the system is eased up by processing consumer orders one by one and more secured production charts areprepared with the data in decreasing number• It is immediately decided that the delivery dates are acceptable thanks to system’s operating consumer orders in real timedmode. • System gives short delivery date by meeting consumers’ needs immediately. Because of these determined reasons, inclusion of the computer technologies to the enterprise planning activities has becomean inevitable consequence. Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), Computer AidedManufacturing (CAM) and Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) systems have arisen through wide ranges of methods developedby especially advanced countries all around the world. MRP system has been a system that aims at not only ensuring the materialat the right time and place but also working effectively of the planning departments within the enterprise and most importantly,meeting the client demands on time and completely by performing an effective stock planning and order system on the enterpriselevel. Material Requirement Planning accepts the final product oriented demand that is determined by the main manufacturing planas input and makes the planning acoording to this input. Dependance of the part demands on the product demand and massproduction of them form a discontinous demand and make stock control methods that use economical order quantity inadequate. Material Requirement Planning system that is developed for these deficiencies secures the desired material to be ready at thedesired time and place. MRP is an interrelated operations group, decision rules and records that tranform the main manufacturingprogramme to the well-timed, clear requirements for the interdependent stock elements that form this programme and is arrangedfor meeting of these requirements as planned. MRP II is not a developed version of MRP but a second generation planning approach consisting of MRP as well. In otherwords, MRP II aims at developing all the activities as manufacturing, purchase, production planning, stock management,accounting and financial affairs within the organization in a harmony in accordance with a plan. It is a production management approach that consolidate closed cycle material requirement planning, production capacity andcash flow for meeting clients’ needs and is integrated with computer programmes fulfilling basic operational functions inaccordance with MRP II enterprise policy. The most important characteristic of ERP is its simulator charecteristic in addition toits being a financial and operational system. Thanks to this, the management can decide how different strategies will produce aneffect on the whole enterprise. In this study, the effects of material requirement planning and manufacturing resources planning on manufacturing planningand control activities are determined {{as a result of the}} overall surveys on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Ankara region. For this purpose, a survey sheet comprising of 39 questions and the general data of the enterprises, their characteristics andmanufacturing methods is prepared. It is noted that the content of the survey sheets are enclosed by questions that have notprivacy extent and an objection to answer in terms of enterprises.
