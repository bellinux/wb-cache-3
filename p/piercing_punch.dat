40|$|In this paper, Finite Element {{method and}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{have been used}} to study a hot forging method for fabrication of a spindle using reduced initial stock size. The forging sequence is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the hot rolled cylindrical billet is pre-formed and pierced in a closed die using a spherical nosed punch to within 20 mm of its base. This process of piercing or impact extrusion leads to high strains within the work piece but requires high press loads. In the second stage, the resulting cylinder is placed in a die with a flange chamber and upset forged to form a flange. The stock mass is optimized for complete die filling. Process parameters such as effective strain distribution, material flow and forging load in different stages of the process are analyzed. It is concluded from the simulations that minor modifications of <b>piercing</b> <b>punch</b> geometry to reduce contact between the punch and emerging vertical walls of the cylinder appreciably reduces the piercing load. In the flange chamber, a die surfaces angle of 52 ° instead of 45 ° is proposed to ensure effective material flow and exert sufficient tool pressure to achieve complete cavity filling. In order to achieve better compression, it is also proposed to shorten both the length of the inserted punch and the die “tongues” by a few mm. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Blanking and {{piercing}} are shearing {{processes in}} which a punch and die are used to modify webs. The tooling and processes are the same between the two, only the terminology is different: in blanking the punched out piece is used and called a blank; in <b>piercing</b> the <b>punched</b> out piece is scrap. The process for parts manufactured simultaneously with both techniques is often termed [...] "pierce and blank." [...] An alternative name of <b>piercing</b> is <b>punching.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In March 2016, Rhona tells Pierce Harris (Jonathan Wrather), Tess' widower, that Paddy was Tess' lover so <b>Pierce</b> <b>punched</b> Paddy. Later, Rhona {{discover}} Aaron and Chas {{knew that}} Paddy {{was having an}} affair. Not long afterwards, Rhona gets involved with Pierce who harbours a dark secret. Initially her friends and family think this a bad idea but come round when they see that Pierce and Rhona are happy together. In October, after Rhona and Pierce argue, she goes camping with Paddy, Marlon and Leo. However, Pierce arrives and they argue again. After Pierce leaves, Paddy and Rhona go after him and {{are involved in a}} pile up, caused by Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney) pushing her husband, James, from a bridge. Rhona and Paddy are badly injured but they all survive and Rhona continues her relationship with Pierce.|$|R
50|$|The OKC-3S is {{manufactured}} {{solely by}} the Ontario Knife Company and identical civilian versions {{are available for}} purchase. It bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife, {{though it is not}} fullered. It is larger, thicker and heavier than the M7 although slightly thinner and lighter than the current U.S. Army-issued M9. A sharper point helps penetrate body armor that many modern adversaries wear; while serrations near the handle help improve its function as a utility knife. In one demonstration, a prototype was able to <b>pierce</b> a <b>punching</b> bag covered with aircraft aluminum and a ballistic vest. The entire weapon is designed to be corrosion resistant, and weighs 1.25 lb with its sheath. The scabbard and grip are colored to match the Corps' coyote tan gear, compatible with both woodland and desert camouflage. The NATO Stock Number is 1095-01-521-6087.|$|R
2500|$|The gold Angel coins, {{which were}} first struck in Britain in 1465 and later dates, {{particularly}} of the reigns of James I and Charles I, are often found officially pierced in the centre, {{as illustrated in}} Coins of England 2001 {{to be used as}} touch pieces. The sovereigns of the House of Stuart used the ceremony to help bolster the belief in the [...] "Divine Right of Kings." [...] Charles I indeed issued Angels almost exclusively as touch pieces to the point where intact specimens are hard to come by. He was the first monarch to perform the ceremony in Scotland at Holyrood Palace on 18 June 1633. The size of the hole may indicate the amount of gold taken in payment by the jeweller or the mint for the work of <b>piercing</b> or <b>punching</b> and the provision of a ribbon or silk string.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} energy {{absorption}} properties of square tubes <b>pierced</b> by pointed <b>punches</b> under quasi-static conditions. In {{a series of}} tests, square section pyramidal punches and conically headed cylindrical <b>punches</b> were <b>pierced</b> slowly into square steel tubes having 40 x 40 mm 2 outside dimensions. Wall thicknesses of 1. 6 and 2. 5 mm were tested, {{and the length of}} tubes was varied. Some typical loads were plotted against deflection, and a number of interesting conclusions were drawn from the tests. Based on the test results and observations, preliminary theoretical considerations are presented. The theoretical results agree fairly with the experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of the tools for {{metallic}} materials cold trim, as a duration measure for assuring the adequate development of the technological process both the force plug or the matrix dimensional modifications measure are taken, but also the ridge height (the degree) which is determined by the tool wear degree. The fractures actually span through the area of tolerance {{from the edge of the}} punch to the edge of the die. The remaining two thirds of the stock thickness are called the breakoff. The upper surface is called the burnishing side, or punch side, and the bottom is the burr side. In every <b>punching,</b> <b>piercing,</b> or blanking operation, the burr side is always opposite the punch. ...|$|R

50|$|Encompassing a full {{city block}} along Grand Avenue, {{each of the}} four sides of the immense ten-story edifice is similar in design, divided into three {{horizontal}} sections. The facade's (west elevation's) three-story base rises with smooth walls pierced by elongated bays enclosing the first- and second-story windows, which are divided by decorative spandrels. Each bay is <b>pierced</b> by paired <b>punched</b> windows separated by limestone mullions at the third story. A series of wide granite steps with bronze handrails leads from Grand Avenue to the three central bays enclosing the entrances. The striking dark texture of the cast-bronze door framing and grill work above exhibit restrained classical detailing, and contrast with the light tones and smoothness of the pale-gray Indiana limestone walls.|$|R
40|$|As {{a unique}} and {{important}} member of the metal forming family, ring rolling provides a cost effective process route to manufacture seamless rings. Applications of ring rolling cover {{a wide range of}} products in aerospace, automotive and civil engineering industries [1]. Above the recrystallization temperature of the material, hot ring rolling begins with the upsetting of the billet cut from raw stock. Next a <b>punch</b> <b>pierces</b> the hot upset billet to form a hole through the billet. This billet, referred to as preform, is then rolled by the ring rolling mill. For an accurate simulation of hot ring rolling, it is crucial to include the deformations, stresses and strains from the upsetting and piercing process as initial conditions for the rolling stage. In this work, multi-stage FE simulations of hot ring rolling process were performed by mapping the local deformation state of the workpiece from one step to the next one. The simulations of upsetting and piercing stages were carried out by 2 D axisymmetric models using adaptive remeshing and element erosion. The workpiece for the ring rolling stage was subsequently obtained after performing a 2 D to 3 D mapping. The commercial FE package LS-DYNA was used for the study and user defined subroutines were implemented to complete the control algorithm. The simulation results were analyzed and also compared with those from the single-stage FE model of hot ring rolling...|$|R
