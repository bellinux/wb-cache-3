5|$|Thunderball {{begins with}} a meeting between Bond and his superior, M, during which the agent is told that his latest <b>physical</b> <b>assessment</b> is poor because of {{excessive}} drinking and smoking (up to sixty cigarettes a day). M sends Bond on a two-week treatment at the Shrublands health clinic to improve his health. At the clinic Bond encounters Count Lippe, {{a member of the}} Red Lightning Tong criminal organisation from Macau. When Bond learns of the Tong connection, Lippe tries to kill him by tampering with a spinal traction machine. Bond, however, is saved by nurse Patricia Fearing and later retaliates against Lippe by trapping him in a steam bath, resulting in the Count's second-degree burns and a week's stay in hospital.|$|E

25|$|The path to {{becoming}} a nurse practitioner in the United States begins by earning a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or other undergraduate degree, and requires licensure as a registered nurse (RN) and experience in the generalist RN role. Then, one must graduate from an accredited graduate (MSN) or doctoral (DNP) program. The typical curriculum for a nurse practitioner program includes courses in epidemiology; health promotion; pathophysiology; <b>physical</b> <b>assessment</b> and diagnostic reasoning; pharmacology; laboratory/radiography diagnostics; statistics and research methods; health policy; role development and leadership; minor acute and chronic disease management (e.g., adults, children, women's health, geriatrics, etc.); and clinical rotations, which varies widely depending on the program and population focus. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs include additional, basic biostatistics; research methods; clinical outcome measures; general care of special populations; organizational management; informatics; and healthcare policy and economics. DNP programs also require completion of a research project. Some nurse practitioners, {{as well as other}} APRN roles, may choose to pursue the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) as a terminal degree. The PhD in nursing focuses on nursing research and nursing education, while the DNP focuses more on clinical practice.|$|E
