5|$|WASP-44 was {{observed}} between July and November 2009 by the WASP-South, a station of the SuperWASP planet-searching program {{based at the}} South African Astronomical Observatory. Observations of the star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness. WASP-South, along with the SuperWASP-North station at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Islands, collected 15,755 <b>photometric</b> observations, allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve. Another set of observations yielded a 6,000 point <b>photometric</b> data set, but the light curve was prepared late and was not considered in the discovery paper.|$|E
5|$|Namaka is only 1.5% {{as bright}} as its parent dwarf planet Haumea and is about 0.05% its mass. If {{it turns out to}} have a similar albedo, it would be about 170km in diameter. <b>Photometric</b> {{observations}} indicate that its surface is made of water ice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Photometric</b> {{observations}} of Vesta {{were made at}} the Harvard College Observatory in 1880–1882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta {{to be determined by}} the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo.|$|E
5|$|The final {{instrument}} was the HSP, {{designed and built}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a <b>photometric</b> accuracy of about 2% or better.|$|E
5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the <b>photometric</b> brightness scale, and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the UBV <b>photometric</b> system.|$|E
5|$|It became {{apparent}} to the investigating science team that radial velocity data alone could not prove {{the existence of}} HAT-P-33b. As such, <b>photometric</b> observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight dimming was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited its star.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, <b>photometric</b> monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
5|$|Recent <b>photometric</b> and spectroscopic {{observations}} from 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk has formed around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles. The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a misaligned double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars. Thus, Pleione provides {{a rare opportunity to}} investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic studies first {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. Astronomers had made careful <b>photometric</b> measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected.|$|E
5|$|The {{observatory}} underwent major renovations and additions in 1956 and 1966 {{to accommodate}} the growing faculty (see architecture section below). In 1967, the 12inch telescope at the observatory made its last professional <b>photometric</b> observations. The University of Illinois' Astronomy Department {{moved out of the}} building in 1979. The same year the observatory received recognition by the National Register of Historic Places, 1986, thousands gathered at the site to observe Comet Halley's journey into the inner solar system.|$|E
5|$|The planet's transit of {{its primary}} was {{announced}} on 27 April 2011, {{based on two}} weeks of nearly continuous <b>photometric</b> monitoring with the MOST space telescope. The transits occur with the period (0.74 days) and phase that had been predicted by Dawson & Fabrycky. This {{is one of the}} few planetary transits to be confirmed around a well-known star, and allowed investigations into the planet's composition.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term <b>photometric</b> and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, the star developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, the star showed a decrease in brightness, beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, the star gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 {{images of}} the star WASP-13 by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the {{identification}} of WASP-13 as host to a potentially transiting object. <b>Photometric</b> follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded. Using HD 80408 as a reference star along with JGT measurements, the astronomers investigating the system were {{able to create a}} light curve for the transiting planet.|$|E

The amplitude of the radial velocity signal is inconsistent with stellar variations on stars with 55 Cancri A's low level of chromospheric activity.|$|E

25|$|However, {{attempts}} to replicate this observation strongly suggest the original claim was in error, meaning {{that at the}} present time the galaxy only has a <b>photometric</b> redshift estimate.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Kron (April 6, 1913 – April 9, 2012) was an American {{astronomer}} {{who was one}} of {{the pioneers}} of high-precision photometry with photoelectric instrumentation. He discovered the first starspot and made the first <b>photometric</b> observation of a stellar flare.|$|E
25|$|Photometria {{is a book}} on the {{measurement}} of light by Johann Heinrich Lambert published in 1760. It established a complete system of <b>photometric</b> quantities and principles; using them to measure the optical properties of materials, quantify aspects of vision, and calculate illumination.|$|E
25|$|Rapidly {{oscillating}} Ap stars (roAp stars) are a subtype of the Ap star {{class that}} exhibit short-timescale rapid <b>photometric</b> or radial velocity variations. The known periods range between 5 and 23 minutes. They {{lie in the}} δ Scuti instability strip on the main sequence.|$|E
25|$|The word {{aperture}} is {{also used}} in other contexts to indicate a system which blocks off light outside a certain region. In astronomy, for example, a <b>photometric</b> aperture around a star usually corresponds to a circular window around {{the image of a}} star within which the light intensity is assumed.|$|E
25|$|Lambert began {{conducting}} <b>photometric</b> {{experiments in}} 1755 and by August 1757 had enough material to begin writing. From the references in Photometria and the catalogue of his library auctioned after his death, {{it is clear}} that Lambert consulted the optical works of Newton, Bouguer, Euler, Huygens, Smith, and Kästner. He finished Photometria in Augsburg in February 1760 and the printer had the book available by June 1760.|$|E
25|$|The two worked together, {{looking at}} eclipsing binaries. At one point they found an irregularity, which they {{attributed}} {{to an area}} of colder temperature, a starspot. His observation and explanation were correct, but he was ahead of his time. It would be many years before the existence of starspots was accepted, and they became a popular research topic. They also made the first <b>photometric</b> observation of a stellar flare.|$|E
25|$|Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are {{frequently}} based on Hapke parameterization. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein found no {{strong evidence that}} {{a particular set of}} Hapke parameters derived from <b>photometric</b> data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by B. Hapke may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{test this}} {{hypothesis}} is to study the pulsations of variable blue stragglers. The asteroseismological properties of merged stars may be measurably different from those of typical pulsating variables of similar mass and luminosity. However, the measurement of pulsations is very difficult, given the scarcity of variable blue stragglers, the small <b>photometric</b> amplitudes of their pulsations and the crowded fields in which these stars are often found. Some blue stragglers have been observed to rotate quickly, with one example in 47 Tucanae observed to rotate 75 times faster than the Sun, which is consistent with formation by collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotation}} {{period of the}} primary is not known. Different <b>photometric</b> surveys have produced different results. Some show low amplitude variations with periods ranging from 7 to 21 hours, whereas others show no variability. However, the value obtained by Ortiz et al., about 10.5 hours, {{seems to be the}} most likely one. The rotational poles of Orcus probably coincide with the orbital poles of its moon, Vanth. This means that Orcus is currently viewed pole-on, which could explain the near absence of any rotational modulation of its brightness. If, however, the primary is tidally locked with the satellite, the rotational period will coincide with the 9.7-day orbital period of Vanth.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Edward Kron {{was born}} in Milwaukee on 6 April 1913, the son of Edmund Kron, a mechanic, and his wife Letty Dieterick Kron. He {{attended}} Lincoln High School in Milwaukee, and then University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1934. While there {{took advantage of the}} access to machine shops as part of his training to design and build a 6-inch telescope. After graduation, he received a scholarship to study astronomy for two years under Joel Stebbins. He published his first paper in 1935, a study of the <b>photometric</b> elements of Boss 5070, an eclipsing binary.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of methylene blue after {{the reaction of}} hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH0.4–0.7 is used to determine by <b>photometric</b> measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50mg/L (20ppb to 1.5ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60min. Ready-to-use kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). It should be observed that in this test, methylene blue {{is a product of}} reaction and not a reagent.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, {{extinction}} is {{the absorption}} and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by dust and gas between an emitting astronomical object and the observer. Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by Robert Julius Trumpler. However, its effects had been noted in 1847 by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, {{and its effect}} on the colors of stars had been observed by a number of individuals who did not connect it with the general presence of galactic dust. For stars that lie near the plane of the Milky Way and are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth, extinction in the visual band of frequencies (<b>photometric</b> system) is on the order of 1.8magnitudes per kiloparsec.|$|E
25|$|LED {{lighting}} systems {{are sensitive to}} heat. Due to the negative influences of heat on the stability of <b>photometric</b> performance and the light transmitting components, the importance of thermal design, stability tests, usage of low-UV-type LED modules and UV-resistance tests of internal materials has increased dramatically. For this reason, LED signal lamps must remain compliant with the intensity requirements for the functions they produce after one minute and after thirty minutes of continuous operation. In addition, UN Regulation 112 contains a set of tests for LED modules, including colour rendering, UV radiation, and temperature stability tests. According to UN Regulations 112 and 123, mechanical, electromechanical or other devices for headlamps must withstand endurance tests and function failure tests.|$|E
500|$|Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is {{considerably}} {{more difficult than}} simple photometry, which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters. When <b>photometric</b> data {{is all that is}} available (for example, the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring <b>photometric</b> redshifts. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in <b>photometric</b> filters and the necessary assumptions {{about the nature of the}} spectrum at the light-source, errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of , it would be brightest in the infrared rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, [...] Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See K correction for more details on the <b>photometric</b> consequences of redshift.) ...|$|E
500|$|The UBV <b>photometric</b> system {{measures}} {{the magnitude of}} stars through ultraviolet, blue, and yellow filters, producing U, B, and V values, respectively. Vega is one of six A0V stars {{that were used to}} set the initial mean values for this <b>photometric</b> system when it was introduced in the 1950s. The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as: [...] = [...] =0. In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region—wavelength range 350–850 nanometers, most of which can be seen with the human eye—so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000–4000Jy. However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared, and is near 100 Jy at 5micrometers.|$|E
500|$|The binary {{nature of}} Eta Carinae is clearly established, {{although}} the components {{have not been}} directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re-excitation in the surrounding nebulosity. Periodic <b>photometric</b> and spectroscopic variations prompted {{the search for a}} companion, and modelling of the colliding winds and partial [...] "eclipses" [...] of some spectroscopic features have constrained the possible orbits.|$|E
2500|$|Written in Latin, {{the title}} of the book is a word Lambert devised from the Greek: φῶς, φωτς (transliterated phôs, photos) = light and μετρια (transliterated metria) = measure.

[...] Photometria was the first work to accurately identify most fundamental <b>photometric</b> concepts, to assemble them into a coherent system of <b>photometric</b> quantities, to define these quantities with a precision sufficient for mathematical statement, and to build from them a system of <b>photometric</b> principles.
