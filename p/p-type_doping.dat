The primary objective of this report is to provide a convenient reference to aid in the determination of relative contributions to an observed GaSb Raman spectrum of SSCR scattering and bulk scattering for a range of excitation wavelengths, doping levels, and SSCR widths and types. Hence, Raman spectra of both n-type and <b>p-type</b> <b>doped</b> GaSb epilayers were obtained using 488 nm, 514. 5 nm, 647. 1 nm, and 752. 55 nm excitation radiation.
