To protect true seeds from being faked, more secure dual anti-counterfeiting technologies for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) <b>pelleted</b> <b>seed</b> {{were developed in}} this paper. Fluorescein (FR), rhodamine B (RB), and magnetic powder (MP) were used as anti-counterfeiting labels. According to their different properties and the special seed pelleting process, four dual-labeling treatments were conducted for two tobacco varieties, MS Yunyan 85 (MSYY 85) and Honghua Dajinyuan (HHDJY). Then the seed germination and seedling growth status were investigated, and the fluorescence in cracked pellets and developing seedlings was observed under different excitation lights. The results showed that FR, RB, and MP had no negative effects on the germination, seedling growth, and MDA content of the pelleted seeds, and even some treatments significantly enhanced seedling dry weight, vigor index, and shoot height in MS YY 85, and increased SOD activity and chlorophyll content in HHDJY {{as compared to the}} control. In addition, the cotyledon tip of seedlings treated with FR and MP together represented bright green fluorescence under illumination of blue light (478 nm).

The triars compared the effects of two lengths of ground cover, untreated, suppressed for a longer or shorter period with herbicides and burnt on the early establishment of lucerrne sown as bare or <b>pelleted</b> <b>seed.</b> It was found that small amounts of cover at sowing encouraged lucerne germination under high moisture conditions subsequent establishment and early survival was best on the burnt and chemically desiccated, plots. The cover was most useful where it was short (8 cm) and desiccated by long term paraquat or glyphosate treatments. Dense live cover was harmful to lucerne seedlings and smothered them within 5 weeks after sowing. Where recovery of the resident vegetation and weeds was rapid, as on the burnt and short term herbicide plots, lucerne establishnent and survivar was poor and surviviag plants were small and weak. Weed infestation was heavy both on burnt and herbicide treated plots, pointing to the need to introduce an early weed control programme with oversowing. Weeds were found to respond in a similar manner to lucerne to grass competition.

The effects of slugs were fourd to be most damaging during the first 4 - 5 weeks after sowing.

40|$|Background: Autologous {{chondrocyte}} transplantation (ACT) is {{the most}} commonly used cell-based surgical procedure for repair of articular cartilage defects. The challenges of this technique include dedifferentiation of chondrocytes following several in vitro passages, invasive means of transplantation, and inadequate cell retention leading to washout of transplanted cells. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a novel technique of transplanting high-density chondrocyte <b>pellets</b> <b>seeded</b> on a prefabricated, resorbable, rigid, 2 -dimensional template amenable to minimally invasive implantation. Methods: Chondrocytes were obtained from the costal cartilage of New Zealand white rabbits and expanded in vitro in monolayer culture. After 2 passages, chondrocyte suspension was centrifuged and a total of 1 × 106 cells condensed on the surface of a prefabricated, resorbable template of LactoSorb plate (0. 5 -mm thick, 4 -mm diameter). The construct was incubated for 24 hours in a culture medium before transplantation into circular 4 -mm diameter, 0. 5 -mm deep defects in a non–weight-bearing part of the femoral condyle. Control defects were left empty or implanted with LactoSorb alone. Macroscopic and histological evaluation was performed 4 weeks posttransplantation. Results: Macroscopically, boundaries of all defects were demarcated and distinguishable from adjacent intact cartilage. Regenerative tissue in experimental group appeared white, smooth, and uniform showing more resemblance to hyaline cartilage. Control groups revealed absent cartilaginous tissue and defects were filled with soft, fibrous tissue with an irregular surface. Histologically, the repair tissue in the control groups was fibroinflammatory with irregular surface and no evidence of continuous chondrocytic regeneration. Cartilage regeneration in the experimental defects revealed a continuous, high-density layer of chondrocytes surrounding the LactoSorb plates. Consistently with chondrocyte pellets grown for 4 weeks only, the amount of extracellular matrix deposition in the transplanted group was less than the normal cartilage. Conclusion: We have developed a novel approach for ACT, utilizing high-density chondrocyte <b>pellets</b> <b>seeded</b> on a prefabricated, rigid, 2 -dimensional resorbable carrier.

Adams' <b>Pellet</b> <b>Seeding</b> Operations on the Hopi, Papago and Navajo Reservations in 1944-1949. He made hundreds of photos for the purpose of promoting and advertising Dr. Adams' Invention. During this time Dr. Adams and Ray became good friends. in 1963 the Adam East Museum in Moses Lake, Washington asked Dr. for a portrait of him as Dr. Adams built the Museum. Ray volunteered to make the portrait for free in thanks for all that Dr. Adams did for him at the start of his career. The Portrait hung in the Adam East Museum until it was moved and now hangs in the new Adam East Museum.|$|R

40|$|Background: {{aluminum}} toxicity is {{the most}} important factor limiting the growth of plants in acid soils, whereas current treatments are unfeasible. For this reason, alternatives are sought for, among which homeopathic treatment. Aims: this study aimed at evaluating the influence of homeopathic preparations Alumina 6 cH, Alumina 12 cH, Calcarea carbonica 6 cH and Calcarea carbonica 12 cH on the germination and vigor of lettuce seeds subjected to toxic levels of aluminum in paper-solution. At the same time, it was sought to develop a new procedure to apply homeopathic preparations in plants (pelleting). Methods: the statistical design was entirely randomized (CRD) with 6 treatments and 4 repetitions. Treatments included: 1) pelleted seeds/talc + Alum 6 cH; 2) pelleted seeds/talc + Alum 12 cH; 3) pelleted seed/talc + Calc 6 cH; 4) pelleted seeds/talc + Calc 12 cH; 5) pelleted seeds/talc + distilled water; 6) non <b>pelleted</b> <b>seeds</b> (control). Variables evaluated were: germination percentage (GP), germination speed index (GSI) and radicle length (RL). Results: there was significant difference in GSI and RL Ã¢â‚¬â€œ variables that reflect the vigor of seeds - between the samples treated with homeopathic preparations and the controls Conclusions: homeopathic preparations Alumina 6 cH and 12 cH and Calcarea carbonica 6 cH and 12 cH had significant effect on the vigor of lettuce seeds subjected to stress conditions...|$|R
