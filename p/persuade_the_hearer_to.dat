40|$|Evidence from {{reasoning}} tasks {{shows that}} promises and threats both tend to receive biconditional interpretations. They also both display high speaker control. {{on the face}} of it, the only difference seems to be the positive or negative signing of the consequent. In a promise, the speaker tries to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> do something by holding out the prospect of a particular reward; in a threat, the speaker tries to refrain the hearer from doing something by holding out the prospect of a particular punishment. This paper investigates the respects in which conditional promises and threats differ further by means of an inference task. The credibility of the consequent was manipulated in order to examine whether the acceptability ratings of inferences based on promises and on threats would be equally affected. The results of the inference task and an analysis of the reasons people give for their answers suggest that the credibility of promises is less affected by the use of excessive consequents than the credibility of threats. In other words, promise remains debt, whereas threat is another matter. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this {{discussion}} of the Caperton case, I bring some of the amici curiae to center stage—in recognition of their supporting roles. Ordinarily, at this level, highly competent counsel represent both sides, and they tell the Justices {{what they need to}} know in deciding the case. In such circumstances, amici—if they appear at all—are likely to add little of substance. In some cases, the parties’ advocates may fail to explore the available arguments, and briefs amici may be the only well-argued guides to decision. Caperton lies outside both of these patterns. First-rate counsel on both sides, in their briefs and at oral argument, made the best points available, given the facts and the existing law. In my view, however, some of the amici in support of Caperton, et al. provided significant support in <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Court <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case and <b>to</b> decide for the petitioners.

5000|$|... ==Plot== In 1922, {{aspiring}} composer Kenneth Harvey (Don Ameche) travels {{from the}} Midwest to Greenwich Village, New York, where {{he hopes to}} interest famed composer Kavosky in his concerto. Kenneth wanders into a speakeasy owned by the brash Danny O'Hare (William Bendix), who wants {{to put on a}} musical extravaganza showcasing his singing sweetheart, Bonnie Watson (Vivian Blaine). Danny hopes that the show will make Bonnie a star and make up for the fact that he cost her an opportunity of playing a leading role for Ziegfeld. Danny's other main entertainer, Princess Querida (Carmen Miranda), mistakenly assumes that Kenneth is rich, although the few hundred-dollar bills he innocently flashes are the extent of his traveling money. Danny immediately targets Kenneth as a chump and begins to get friendly with him, but Bonnie disapproves and allows Kenneth to escort her home. At her apartment, Bonnie confesses that when she came to Greenwich Village, she had aspirations to become a poet, and advises Kenneth to be more careful about displaying his money. Danny, jealous of Kenneth and Bonnie's obvious attraction to each other, brings the gang up to Bonnie's apartment for a party, and Kenneth plays some of his concerto for them. The next morning, Danny arranges for Kenneth to move to the top floor apartment and begin writing songs for their show, although Bonnie stipulates that music from Kenneth's concerto must be withdrawn from the show if Kavosky likes it. Meanwhile, Hofer, a former violinist with Kavosky's orchestra, <b>persuades</b> <b>the</b> maestro <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Kenneth play, which Kavosky reluctantly does to get rid of Hofer. Hofer then lies to Kenneth, telling him that Kavosky wants to perform his concerto at Carnegie Hall, and that they should begin the orchestrations immediately. Kenneth works hard on his music, which he withdraws from Danny's show, even though Bonnie has already written the lyrics. Danny is infuriated, especially when he sees Bonnie and Kenneth kiss, but Bonnie is thrilled by Kenneth's seeming good fortune. Unknown to Bonnie, Danny, who continues to rehearse the numbers using Kenneth's music, is aware of the situation when Hofer swindles Danny out of his life savings, which Hofer (Felix Bressart) says is the down payment on the musicians' wages for the Carnegie Hall performance. Hofer disappears with the money, and Kenneth discovers his treachery after speaking to the surprised Kavosky. The heartbroken Kenneth is on his way home when he sees Hofer returning the money to Danny, who has realized that Bonnie is truly in love with Kenneth. The young composer misunderstands the situation and assumes that Danny and Bonnie were in on the swindle. While Kenneth is angrily packing, Querida questions him and learns of his misapprehension. She then gets him arrested by giving him some bootleg liquor to carry, and while Kenneth languishes in jail, Danny, Bonnie and the others step up their rehearsals and prepare to open the show. On opening night, Danny's right-hand man, Brophy, bails Kenneth out of jail, and the irate composer rushes over to the theater to confront Danny. As he watches from the audience, Kenneth is amazed to see Kavosky conduct his concerto, which has been turned into an elaborate number featuring Querida and Bonnie. Kenneth rushes backstage, where Danny reveals that Kavosky volunteered his services after learning of the swindle perpetrated by Hofer. Danny also advises Kenneth to make up with Bonnie, and after her final number, Kenneth embraces her in the wings.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} {{we will take a}} look at a {{particular}} epistemic usage of the French future tense.

Building upon Sperber & Wilson’s distinction between descriptive and non-descriptive usages of language and the notion of metarepresentation (1995 [1986]), we propose to analyze the function of the French futur putatif from our procedural pragmatics perspective. We posit that certain expressions, and among them the French future tense, possess a procedural algorithm that allows <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> reach different interpretations, depending on different contextualizations, which are obtained through relevance-searching. Such procedural instructions enable <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> easily draw <b>the</b> intended complex inferences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Request is one {{of speech}} act phenomena, which we {{encounter}} most frequently in everyday social interaction. When expressing a request, the speaker has an intention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> do something that is beneficial to him/her. In this circumstance, the speaker is impossing on the hearer; while <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> has <b>to</b> pay cost of carrying out the request. Brown and Levinson claim request as one kind of face threatening acts (FTA). Because {{of the nature of}} request, politeness strategy must be applied when expressing a request. There are four super strategies of politeness strategy defined by Brown and Levinson, i. e. bald on record, positive politeness, negative politeness, as well as off record. There are some reasons underlying the use of certain strategies. They are the urgency of the request itself, the relationship between the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> not <b>to</b> mention <b>the</b> speaker‟s willingness to lessen the imposition on <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> Yet, <b>the</b> use of the politeness strategies do not always work well. In other word, the speaker does not always gain what he wants...|$|R
