40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between ‘common practice’ as defined by a simple reading of PMBOK Chapter 11 and ‘best practice’ as approached (but not quite achieved) by two alternative guides (PRAM and RAMP) in terms of key points of contention in framing assumptions which everyone interested in project management as a whole ought to understand. An immediate purpose is helping readers to avoid some of the current confusion {{about the difference between}} ‘common practice’ and ‘best practice’. A longer term goal is influencing the shape of future project risk management guides, to enhance them individually, and to make them easier to use collectively. ‘Best practice’ definition is itself contentious. Other authors are encouraged to debate the definition of ‘best practice’ and explore the position of other guides. The framing assumptions are considered in terms of basic concepts: ‘probability’, ‘uncertainty’, ‘risk’, ‘optimisation’ and ‘opportunity’. A practical example of the implications is provided via analysis of the use of probability–impact (PI) matrices and associated <b>PI</b> <b>indices</b> (risk indices or scores). The use of <b>PI</b> <b>indices</b> is ‘common practice’, but it is a clear indication that ‘best practice’ is not being followed, for reasons clarified in this paper.

40|$|Background/Aim: The {{perfusion}} of tissue, {{especially the}} muscles of the lower limbs (LL), implies the blood flow that carries enough nutrition, energy materials and oxygen. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the decreased Doppler sonography parameters, resistance index (RI), and pulsatility <b>index</b> (<b>PI)</b> were significant as indicators of irreversible ischemia of LL. Methods. In 40 patients (mean age 66 ± 14. 9 years, 21 % women and 79 % men) with the signs of critical ischemia of LL, Lariche-Fontaine class III and IV, we performed contrast angiography of the LL arteries, and perfusion scintigraphy of LL using, thallium- 201, while we performed Doppler sonography to determine resistance index (RI), as well as pulsatility <b>index</b> (<b>PI).</b> After that, all the patients were treated with vasodilatation using Bergmann's solution within a 10 -day period. Following that, all the patients underwent the determination of haemodynamic <b>indices</b> RI and <b>PI</b> applying the methods of Doppler sonography. The obtained values of RI and <b>PI</b> <b>indices</b> revealed no clinical recovery which suggested the irreversibility of critical ischemia (unsuccessful therapy in 100 % of the patients), and clinical recovery which suggested the reversibility of the disease (unsuccessful therapy in 80 % of the patients). Results. The obtained values of PI = 0 - 0. 3 and RI = 0 - 0. 25 for the examined LL arteries were the indicators of irreversible ischemia. A significant correlation between the values of RI in the distal parts of a. tibialis anterior and posterior was proved, as well as between the decreased perfusion of LL determined by tallium- 201 (p < 0. 05, r = 0. 43), and a tibialis anterior (p = 0. 05, r = 0. 38). There was, however, no statistically significant correlation between the angiographic values and perfusion scintigraphy of LL. Conclusion. The obtained values of haemodynamic RI and <b>PI</b> <b>indices</b> should be a novel approach for introducing a new criteria for the assessment of reversible and irreversible critical ischemia of LL using the method of Doppler...|$|R
