5000|$|The boilersuit and shoe {{found with}} the body were, {{according}} to evidence provided by the Australian War Memorial, available to shipâ€™s officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers senior {{enough to have a}} watch keeping certificate. Tests on the remains of the boilersuit showed that the fabric had never been dyed, was probably white and the <b>press</b> <b>studs</b> were of a type manufactured by Carr Australia Pty Ltd in the 1930s and 1940s. RAN Dress Regulations published in the Navy List of December 1940 do not mention white boilersuits. There is evidence, however, that during the period, boilersuits were a popular working dress among RAN personnel. Many RAN engineer officers wore white boilersuits most of the time, and other officers, commissioned warrant officers and warrant officers also wore white boilersuits. Two former RAN officers recalled being issued with a white boilersuit twice a year, that these were fastened with four or five <b>press</b> <b>studs</b> and that some had <b>press</b> <b>studs</b> at the wrist, while others did not. Dress regulations for December 1940 state that RAN personnel on [...] "foreign" [...] (tropical) stations were issued with a pair of white canvas shoes, to be worn only on those stations. While veterans did not recall being issued with them or seeing them worn, photographs of RAN personnel from the period show some of them wearing white canvas shoes.|$|R
