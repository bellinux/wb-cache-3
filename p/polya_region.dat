40|$|RNase mapping {{experiments}} {{show that}} the bovine growth hormone (bGH) <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> forms an extensive hairpin loop. Mutants were prepared to change <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> pre-mRNA structure and cleavage site efficiency without altering necessary sequences. An inverted repeat which includes the poly(A) cleavage site was created by insertion of a linker upstream of the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> to compete with any wild-type secondary structure. RNA mapping analyses show alterations in the nuclease accessibility of this mutant at the natural site of cleavage. This mutant shows a 75 % drop in relative reporter gene expression at the steady-state protein and RNA levels. When the linker is inserted as a direct repeat, expression is equivalent to wildtype levels. To show that transcription was not terminated by the inverted repeat, the SV 40 late <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> was inserted downstream. These mutants show restored expression and processing at the downstream site. Our experiments reveal that the conformation of the poly(A) site pre-mRNA is important in mediating efficient cleavage-polyadenylation...|$|E
40|$|The {{stem cell}} leukemia (SCL) gene encodes a bHLH {{transcription}} factor with {{a pivotal role}} in hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis and a pattern of expression that is highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the zebrafish SCL locus together with the identification of three neighboring genes, IER 5, MAP 17, and MUPP 1. This region spans 68 kb and comprises the longest zebrafish genomic sequence currently available for comparison with mammalian, chicken, and pufferfish sequences. Our data show conserved synteny between zebrafish and mammalian SCL and MAP 17 loci, thus suggesting the likely genomic domain necessary for the conserved pattern of SCL expression. Long-range comparative sequence analysis/phylogenetic footprinting was used to identify noncoding conserved sequences representing candidate transcriptional regulatory elements. The SCL promoter/enhancer, exon 1, and the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> were highly conserved, but no homology to other known mouse SCL enhancers was detected in the zebrafish sequence. A combined homology/structure analysis of the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> predicted consistent structural features, suggesting a conserved functional role in mRNA regulation. Analysis of the SCL promoter/enhancer revealed five motifs, which were conserved from zebrafish to mammals, and each of which is essential for the appropriate pattern or level of SCL transcription...|$|E

40|$|Polyadenylation is an {{essential}} step for the maturation of almost all cellular mRNAs in eukaryotes. In human cells, most poly(A) sites are flanked by the upstream AAUAAA hexamer or a close variant, and downstream U/GU-rich elements. In yeast and plants, additional cis elements {{have been found to}} be located upstream of the poly(A) site, including UGUA, UAUA, and U-rich elements. In this study, we have developed a computer program named PROBE (Polyadenylation-Related Oligonucleotide Bidimensional Enrichment) to identify cis elements that may play regulatory roles in mRNA polyadenylation. By comparing human genomic sequences surrounding frequently used poly(A) sites with those surrounding less frequently used ones, we found that cis elements occurring in yeast and plants also exist in human <b>poly(A)</b> <b>regions,</b> including the upstream U-rich elements, and UAUA and UGUA elements. In addition, several novel elements were found to be associated with human poly(A) sites, including several G-rich elements. Thus, we suggest that many cis elements are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes, and human poly(A) sites have an additional set of cis elements that may be involved in the regulation of mRNA polyadenylation...|$|R

These duplexes {{are resistant to}} pancreatic RNase at 0. 5 M NaCl in native RNP, remain so after chemical deproteinization of the RNP digests, and then copurify with poly(A) on oligo(dT) -cellulose chromatography. Oligo(dT) -cellulose binding capacity of the oligo(U) -poly(A) duplexes is abolished by prior titration of the nonduplex <b>poly(A)</b> <b>regions</b> with excess poly(U). The oligo(dT) -purified fraction is 97. 5 mole % A + U and the [3 H]uridine-labeled component is resistant to redigestion by pancreatic RNase at 0. 5 M NaCl but not at 0. 01 M NaCl. After thermal denaturation, the [3 H]uridine-labeled chains become RNase-sensitive at 0. 5 M NaCl. Electrophoresis of [3 H]adenosine- or [3 H]uridine-labeled material in polyacrylamide gels containing 99 % formamide confirms that the oligo(U) sequences are not covalently linked to poly(A). Controls establish that the A-U duplexes are not formed artifactually during isolation of heterogeneous nuclear RNP or subsequent fractionation.

40|$|Background Although cytosolic DNA {{degradation}} {{plays an}} important role in decreasing transgene expression, the plasmid degradation pattern remains largely unexplored. Methods Illumina dye sequencing was employed to provide degradation site information for S 1 and cytosolic nucleases. S 1 nuclease provided a positive control for a comparison between the agarose gel method and sequencing approaches. Results The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> between the β‐lactamase gene and the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was identified as the most likely cut site for polyplex‐treated cytosol. The second most likely site, at the 5 ' end of the β‐lactamase gene, was identified by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Additional sites were detected in the OriC region, the SV 40 /poly(A) region, the luciferase gene and the CMV promoter. Sequence analysis of plasmid treated with cytosol from control cells showed the greatest cut activity in the OriC region, the β‐lactamase gene and the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> following the luciferase gene. Additional regions of cut activity include the SV 40 promoter and the β‐lactamase poly(A) termination sequence. Both cytosolic nucleases and the S 1 nuclease showed substantial activity at the bacterial origin of replication (OriC). Conclusions High‐throughput plasmid sequencing revealed regions of the luciferase plasmid DNA sequence that are sensitive to cytosolic nuclease degradation. This provides new targets for improving plasmid and/or polymer design to optimize the likelihood of protein expression. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Among host-dependent {{bacteria}} that have evolved by extreme reductive genome evolution, long-term bacterial endosymbionts of insects have the smallest (160 – 790 kb) and most A + T-rich (> 70 %) bacterial genomes known to date. These genomes are riddled with poly(A) tracts, and 5 – 50 % of genes contain tracts of 10 As or more. Here, we demonstrate transcriptional slippage at poly(A) tracts within genes of Buchnera aphidicola associated with aphids and Blochmannia pennsylvanicus associated with ants. Several tracts contain single frameshift deletions; these apparent pseudogenes showed patterns of constraint consistent with purifying selection on the encoded proteins. Transcriptional slippage yielded a heterogeneous population of transcripts with variable numbers of As in the tract. Across several frameshifted genes, including B. aphidicola cell wall biosynthesis genes and a B. pennsylvanicus histidine biosynthesis gene, 12 – 50 % of transcripts contained corrected reading frames {{that could potentially}} yield full-length proteins. In situ immunostaining confirmed {{the production of the}} cell wall biosynthetic enzyme UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide synthase encoded by the frameshifted murF gene. Simulation studies indicated an overrepresentation of poly(A) tracts in endosymbiont genomes relative to other A + T-rich bacterial genomes. Polymerase infidelity at poly(A) tracts rescues the functionality of genes with frameshift mutations and, conversely, reduces the efficiency of expression for in-frame genes carrying <b>poly(A)</b> <b>regions.</b> These features of homopolymeric tracts could be exploited to manipulate gene expression in small synthetic genomes...|$|R

40|$|Mouse polyoma virus {{contains}} a small double stranded DNA genome with {{early and late}} gene transcribed from opposite strands. During the viral life cycle there is a striking transition between early and late phases gene expression. At early times, genes encoded from the early transcription unit are predominantly expressed. After the onset of viral DNA replication, expression of genes encoded from the late transcription unit increases dramatically, far exceeding that from the early strand. Previous work {{has suggested that the}} regulation is post-transcriptional in nature. At late times, primary late-strand transcripts are inefficiently polyadenylated, leading to the generation of long, multi-genomic RNAs that downregulate early-strand gene expression by inducing RNA editing. My thesis researches present evidence that the inefficiently of late RNA polyadenylation at late times may also be due to RNA editing. The <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> of polyoma virus early-strand and late-strand RNA overlaps. RNAs in this overlapping region contain high level of inosines at late times in viral infection. RNAi knockdown of ADAR 1 influences the early-late switch pattern. Furthermore, viruses that are otherwise identical, but have their early and late poly(A) signals separated so as to eliminate overlap, exhibit decreased poly(A) site read-through in their late-strand RNAs and lose their early-late switch. This effect is strongly dependent on the distance of separation between the two polyadenylation signals, but not the sequences between them. These and other results indicate that <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> editing may underline the regulation of the polyoma virus life cycle, and it may represent a new form of gene regulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{regulation}} of poly(A) site choice occurs in an adenovirus recombinant encoding a miniature {{version of the}} major late transcription unit with two poly(A) sites, L 1 and L 3. Using deletion mutagenesis, we have looked directly for cis-acting elements regulating poly(A) site choice in this recombinant. From this work, we draw two main conclusions. First, elements other than the AAUAAA and downstream sequences of the L 1 poly(A) site are required for temporal {{regulation of}} poly(A) site choice during infection. Second, these regions function in two distinct modes during infection. The two regions enhance selection of the L 1 poly(A) site in an additive manner during an early infection, but deletion of either element abolishes the switch in poly(A) site choice during a late infection.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the chromosomal organization of genes that are expressed specifically in the asexual spores (conidia) of the Ascomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans, using two experimental approaches. In the first, 30 different recombinant clones, containing long nuclear DNA inserts {{and at least one}} spore-specific gene, were selected randomly. The total number of spore-specific genes present in each clone was then determined by RNA blot analysis. In the second approach, several chromosomal recombinant DNA libraries, having average insert lengths ranging from 1 to 15 kilobases, were constructed. The fraction of clones in each library having one or more spore-specific <b>poly(A)</b> +RNA-coding <b>regions</b> was then determined by colony or plaque filter hybridization with radiolabeled, spore-specific, complementary DNA. The results from these experiments were compared to statistical predictions {{based on the assumption that}} the spore-specific genes are randomly distributed in the Aspergillus genome.

40|$|Recognition of poly(A) {{sites in}} yeast pre-mRNAs is poorly understood. Employing an in vitro {{cleavage}} system with cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) and cleavage factor IA {{we show that}} the efficiency and positioning elements are dispensable for poly(A) -site recognition within a short CYC 1 substrate in vitro. Instead, U-rich elements immediately upstream and downstream of the poly(A) site mediate cleavage-site recognition within CYC 1 and ADH 1 pre-mRNAs. These elements act {{in concert with the}} poly(A) site to produce multiple recognition sites for the processing machinery, since combinations of mutations within these elements were most effective in cleavage inhibition. Intriguingly, introduction of a U-rich element downstream of the GAL 7 poly(A) site strongly enhanced cleavage, underscoring the importance of downstream sequences in general. RNA- binding analyses demonstrate that cleavage depends on the recognition of the <b>poly(A)</b> -site <b>region</b> by CPF. Consistent with in vitro results, mutation of sequences upstream and downstream of the poly(A) site affected 3 ′-end formation in vivo. A model for yeast pre-mRNA cleavage-site recognition outlines an unanticipated high conservation of yeast and mammalian 3 ′-end processing mechanisms...|$|R

In this work, we have characterized in detail the different RNA populations resulting from the expression of a tRNA-related SINE S 1 founder copy in Arabidopsis thaliana. The main population is composed of poly(A) -ending (pa) SINE RNAs, while two minor populations correspond to full-length (fl) or poly(A) minus [small cytoplasmic (sc) ] SINE RNAs. Part of the poly(A) minus RNAs is modified by 3 ′-terminal addition of C or CA nucleotides. All three RNA populations accumulate in the cytoplasm. Using a mutagenesis approach, we show that the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> and the 3 ′ end unique region, present at the founder locus, are both important for the maturation and the steady-state accumulation of the different S 1 RNA populations.

Using mass spectrometry sequencing we identified poly(A) binding proteins- 1 and - 4 (PABP 1 and PABP 4) in high abundance and good protein coverage from TTP immunoprecipitates. PABP 1 significantly enhanced TNF ARE binding by RNA EMSA and prevented TTP-initiated deadenylation in an in vitro macrophage assay of TNF poly(A) stability. Neomycin inhibited TTP-promoted deadenylation at concentrations shown to inhibit the deadenylases poly(A) ribonuclease and CCR 4. Stably transfected RAW 264. 7 macrophages overexpressing PABP 1 do not oversecrete TNF; instead they upregulate TTP protein without increasing TNF protein production. The PABP 1 inhibition of deadenylation initiated by TTP does not require the <b>poly(A)</b> binding <b>regions</b> in RRM 1 and RRM 2, suggesting a more complicated interaction than simple masking of the poly(A) tail from a 3 ′-exonuclease. Like TTP, PABP 1 is a substrate for p 38 MAP kinase. Finally, PABP 1 stabilizes cotransfected TTP in 293 T cells and prevents the decrease in TTP levels seen with p 38 MAP kinase inhibition.

We have {{carried out a}} detailed analysis on our database of 244 human pre-mRNA poly(A) signals in order to characterize elements in their downstream regions. We suggest that the downstream region of the mammalian pre-mRNA poly(A) signal consists of various simple elements located at different distances from each other. Thus, the downstream region is not described by any precise consensus. Searching our database, we found that ∼ 80 % of pre-mRNAs with the AAUAAA or AUUAAA core upstream elements contain simple downstream elements, consisting of U-rich and/or 2 GU/U tracts, the former occurring ∼ 2 -fold more often than the latter. Approximately one-third of the pre-mRNAs analyzed here contain sequences that may form G-quadruplexes.

Using expression vectors constructed with genomic DNA segments composed of the mu m polyadenylation signal region, we analyzed poly(A) site utilization and termination of transcription in stably transfected myeloma cells and in murine fibroblast L cells. We found that the gene segment containing the mu m poly(A) signals, along with 536 bp of downstream flanking sequence, acted as a transcription terminator in both myeloma cells and L cell fibroblasts. Neither a 141 -bp DNA fragment (which directed efficient polyadenylation at the mu m site), nor the 536 -bp flanking nucleotide sequence alone, were sufficient to obtain a similar regulation. This shows that the mu m <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> plays {{a central role in}} controlling developmentally regulated transcription termination by blocking downstream delta gene expression.

The results of this mapping show that 70 % of Arabidopsis genes use more than one poly(A) site, excluding microheterogeneity. Analysis of the poly(A) tags reveal extensive APA in introns and coding sequences, results of which can significantly alter transcript sequences and their encoding proteins.

This study examines sequence variation within these two genes in Eucalyptus globulus, an important species used in pulp and paper-making. Twenty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the exons of CCR, of which nine were neutral mutations and 12 were missense mutations. Six of the missense mutations affected highly conserved amino acids within the protein sequence of CCR. Eight SNPs were identified in the CAD 2 exons, six of which were neutral mutations and two which were missense mutations. One of the missense mutations affected a highly conserved amino acid within the protein sequence. In addition, 32 SNPs were identified in the CCR introns along with four insertion/deletions and two <b>polyA</b> length variation <b>regions.</b> Polymorphism affecting highly conserved amino acids may alter enzyme function and this molecular variation may be linked to variation in lignin profiles.

The minimally required domains for formation of this conformer were determined by mutational analysis. The <b>poly(A)</b> and DIS <b>regions</b> of the leader are the major determinants of this RNA conformation. Further biochemical characterization of this conformer revealed that both hairpins are disrupted to allow extensive long-distance base pairing. As the DIS hairpin {{is known to be}} instrumental for formation of the HIV- 1 RNA dimer, the interplay between formation of the conformer and dimerization was addressed. Formation of the conformer and the RNA dimer are mutually exclusive. Consequently, the conformer must rearrange into a branched structure that exposes the dimer initiation signal (DIS) hairpin, thus triggering formation of the RNA dimer. This structural rearrangement is facilitated by the viral nucleocapsid protein NC. We propose that this structural polymorphism of the HIV- 1 leader RNA acts as a molecular switch in the viral replication cycl...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the mRNA in the polysomes and the free cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein of Physarum polycephalum was studied by microinjection techniques. Labeled free cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein, prepared from donor plasmodia, was microinjected into unlabeled host plasmodia, and its fat was followed in the host ribonucleoprotein particles. Approximately one-half of the poly(A) -containing RNA [poly(A) +RNA] that originated from the microinjected particles was incorporated into the host polysomes by normal translational processes within 1 hr. Very short poly(A) sequences (approximately 15 nucleotide residues) were found in these poly(A) +RNA molecules. These short poly(A) sequences were sensitive to digestion with micrococcal nuclease, suggesting {{that they were not}} associated with protein. Because the poly(A) +RNA molecules of the microinjected free cytoplasmic mRNP had originally contained poly(A) sequences 50 - 65 nucleotides long and were associated with protein extensive poly(A) degradation and poly(A). protein complex dissociation must have occurred during their incorporation into the polysomes or during their translation. These results demonstrate a precursor-product {{relationship between}} free cytoplasmic mRNP and polysomal mRNA and suggest that the incorporation process in Physarum is accompanied by structural modifications in the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> of mRNA. They also imply that the polysome is a site for disruption of the poly(A). protein complex and poly(A) degradation...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{downstream}} of the lux structural {{genes in}} the Vibrio fischeri lux operon has been sequenced and a new lux gene (luxG) has been identified. A hairpin loop that begins with a <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> and ends with a poly(T) region and thus can function as a bidirectional termination site for luxG and a convergent gene is located immediately downstream of luxG. 3 ' S 1 nuclease mapping has demonstrated that the luxG mRNA was induced in a cell-density-dependent fashion consistent with it {{being part of the}} lux system and that the lux mRNA terminated immediately after the hairpin loop. The mRNA coded by an open reading frame convergent to luxG on the complementary strand was also shown by S 1 nuclease mapping to overlap the lux mRNA for at least 20 nucleotides before termination. Expression of DNA containing the hairpin loop, placed between a strong promoter and a reporter gene and transferred by conjugation into luminescent bacteria, demonstrated the very high efficiency of termination by this hairpin loop oriented in either direction. These results also demonstrate that the organization of the genes at the 3 ' ends of the lux operons of V. fischeri and V. harveyi has clearly diverged...|$|E
40|$|Scanning {{arrays of}} {{antisense}} DNA oligonucleotides provide a novel and systematic means to study structural features within an RNA molecule. We used {{this approach to}} probe {{the structure of the}} untranslated leader of the human immunode®ciency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA genome. This 335 nt RNA encodes multiple important replication signals and adopts two mutually exclusive conformations. The poly(A) and the dimer initiation signal (DIS) sequences of the leader RNA are base-paired in the long-distance interaction (LDI) conformation, but both domains form distinct hairpins in the branched multiple hairpins (BMH) conformation. An RNA switch mechanism has been proposed to regulate the activity of the DIS dimerization signal that is masked in one, yet exposed in the other conform-ation. The two RNA conformations demonstrate dis-crete differences in the array-based hybridization patterns. LDI shows increased hybridization in the <b>poly(A)</b> <b>region</b> and decreased hybridization in the DIS region when compared with BMH. These results provide additional evidence for the structure models of the two alternative leader RNA conformations. We also found a correlation between the ef®ciency of oligonucleotide hybridization and the accessibility of the RNA structure as determined by chemical and enzymatic probing in previous studies. The array approach therefore provides a very sensitive method to detect structural differences in related transcripts...|$|E
40|$|Both rat {{liver and}} Escherichia coli rRNA in 0. 1 m-sodium {{chloride}} were titrated with acid or alkali {{over the range}} pH 3 – 7 at approx. 0 °C. rRNA did not bind acid reversibly and hysteresis was observed, i. e. the plot of acid bound to rRNA against pH had {{the form of a}} loop showing that the amount of acid bound at a particular pH depended on the direction of the titration. Although the boundary curves were reproducibly followed on titration from pH 7 to 3 and from pH 3 to 7, points within the loop were `scanned', e. g. by titration from pH 7 to a point in the range pH 3 – 4 followed by titration with alkali to pH 7. It is inferred that the `lag' in the release of certain bound protons is at least 1 pH unit, that at least about 9 – 15 % of the titratable groups (adenine and cytosine residues) that are involved in this process and that the free energy dissipated in completing a cycle is approx. 4. 2 kJ/mol (1 kcal/mol) of nucleotide involved in hysteresis. The interpretation of the `scanning' curves was illustrated by means of a cycle of possible changes in the conformation of a hypothetical nucleotide sequence that allows formation of <b>poly(A)</b> ·poly(AαH+) -like <b>regions</b> in acidic solutions. It is also inferred that the extent of `hysteresis' might depend on the primary nucleotide sequence of rRNA as well as on secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} types 1 and 2 (HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, respectively) to repress host cell protein {{synthesis}} early in infection has been studied extensively and found to involve {{the activities of the}} UL 41 gene product, the virion-associated host shutoff (vhs) protein. To date, UL 41 homologs have been identified in the genomes of three other alphaherpesviruses: equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV- 1), varicella-zoster virus, and pseudorabies virus, but very {{little is known about the}} putative products of these homologous genes. Our earlier observations that no rapid early host protein shutoff occurred in EHV- 1 -infected cells led us to test EHV- 1 vhs activity more thoroughly and to examine the expression and function of the EHV- 1 UL 41 homolog, ORF 19. In the present study, the effects of EHV- 1 and HSV- 1 infections on cellular protein synthesis and mRNA degradation were compared at various multiplicities of infection in several cell types under an actinomycin D block. No virion-associated inhibition of cellular protein synthesis or vhs-induced cellular mRNA degradation was detected in cells infected with any of three EHV- 1 strains (Ab 4, KyA, and KyD) at multiplicities of infection at which HSV- 1 strain F exhibited maximal vhs activity. However, further analyses revealed that (i) the EHV- 1 vhs homolog gene, ORF 19, was transcribed and translated into a 58 -kDa protein in infected cells; (ii) the ORF 19 protein was packaged into viral particles in amounts detectable in Western blots (immunoblots) with monoclonal antibodies; (iii) in cotransfection vhs activity assays, transiently-expressed ORF 19 protein had intrinsic vhs activity comparable to that of wild-type HSV- 1 vhs; and (iv) this intrinsic vhs activity was ablated by in vitro site-directed mutations in which either the functionally inactive HSV- 1 vhs 1 UL 41 mutation (Thr at position 214 replaced by Ile [Thr- 214 [...] >Ile]) was recreated within ORF 19 or two conserved residues within the putative <b>poly(A)</b> binding <b>region</b> of the ORF 19 sequence were altered (Tyr- 190, 192 [...] >Phe). From these results we conclude that EHV- 1 's low vhs activity in infected cells is not a reflection of the ORF 19 protein's intrinsic vhs activity but may be due instead to the amount of ORF 19 protein associated with viral particles or to modulation of ORF 19 protein's intrinsic activity by another viral component(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mutant P 3 HR 1 is {{incapable}} of immortalizing B lymphocytes because of a 6. 8 -kilobase deletion in the BamHI W, Y, and H regions of the viral genome (M. Rabson, L. Gradoville, L. Heston, and G. Miller, J. Virol. 44 : 834 - 844, 1982). To characterize transcripts that are encoded in this <b>region,</b> <b>poly(A)</b> + RNA from the EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line JY was isolated, and this RNA was used to generate a cDNA library in lambda gt 10. By screening 500, 000 recombinant bacteriophages with the BamHI H fragment, we isolated 10 cDNA clones and characterized them in detail. One group of six cDNA clones was derived from a 2. 9 -kilobase early transcript encoded by the IR 2 repeat element and showed restriction site polymorphism for the enzyme SmaI. The second group consisted of four cDNA clones, all of which contained the BamHI-H right reading frame (BHRF 1), and used the polyadenylation signal at base pair 662 in the BamHI F fragment. Computer analysis of the hydrophobicity of the BHRF 1 protein revealed that {{it is likely to}} be a membrane protein. Northern blotting experiments with RNA from an EBV producer line, B 95 - 8, and a tightly latent lymphoblastoid B-cell line, IB 4, revealed that BHRF 1 is contained in at least two different mRNA species which can be detected during the latent cycle of EBV. These data and the recent characterization of a spliced transcript (containing five exons in common with other known latent messages [M. Bodescot and M. Perricaudet, Nucleic Acids Res. 14 : 7103 - 7113, 1986]) suggest that alternative splicing is used to generate transcripts containing BHRF 1, as for the EBV nuclear antigen 1 transcripts. Furthermore, the observation that a potential oncogene activated in human follicular lymphomas is homologous to the BHRF 1 -encoded polypeptide (M. L. Cleary, S. D. Smith, and J. Sklar, Cell 47 : 19 - 28, 1986) suggests a possible role for this putative viral protein in EBV-induced growth transformation of B lymphocytes...|$|R
