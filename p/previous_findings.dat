5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater was {{classified}} in the genera Meliphaga and then Lichenostomus until 2011. Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense taxon and nucleotide sampling confirmed <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> that Lichenostomus is not monophyletic. While five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, studies using the mitochondrial DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most {{closely related to the}} black-throated honeyeater (C. subfrenatus) and the obscure honeyeater (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus Caligavis. The bridled honeyeater (B. frenatus) and the Eungella honeyeater (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as Bolemoreus. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.|$|E

25|$|Brower {{studied the}} {{aerodynamics}} of Nyctosaurus and Pteranodon by comparing them to hang gliders. He concluded that both {{were unable to}} ascend or descend at high speed. He thought that they {{spent most of their}} time soaring rather than actively flapping. Brower thought Pteranodon itself to be entirely incapable of flapping flight. His conclusions contradicted the <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, at Michigan State University, John L. Sherry {{conducted}} a meta-analysis of studies about video game violence. He {{concluded that the}} influence of video game violence on aggression was minimal and <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of an effect may have been methodological in origin. For instance, smaller effects were found in experimental studies with longer exposure times, suggesting effects decreased over time.|$|E
30|$|Figure  12 {{also shows}} that the Outcomes, Stakeholders and Participation group was in second place in use in abstracts each year.

30|$|Finally, {{we discuss}} two {{possible}} channels that {{can explain the}} correlation between discrimination and the share of immigrants in the area by studying {{the evolution of the}} latter during the last decade. Information on the past distribution of immigrants within cities is only available at the census district level, thus first we need to confirm our <b>previous</b> <b>finding</b> at this higher level of aggregation. Column (3) in Table  5 presents the estimates for our basic specification using the share of immigrants at the census district level as explanatory variable. At this level, a 10 percentage points increase in the share of immigrants is associated with a 6 percentage points increase in the probability that an immigrant will be contacted. Thus our <b>previous</b> <b>finding</b> is reassured.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of increased {{risk of heart attack}} among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). FDA analysts estimated that Vioxx caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry remitted {{the case}} to the DCSD. In doing so the Ministry {{indicated}} that it regarded the DCSD's <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid. The Ministry also instructed the DCSD to decide whether to reinvestigate. On March 12, 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a Hillsborough Independent Panel {{was formed}} to review all evidence. Reporting in 2012, it {{confirmed}} Taylor's 1990 criticisms, while also revealing new details {{about the extent of}} police efforts to shift blame onto fans, the role of other emergency services, and the error of the first coroner's inquest. The panel's report resulted in the <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of accidental death being quashed, and the creating of a new coroner's inquest. It also produced two criminal investigations led by police in 2012: Operation Resolve to look into the causes of the disaster, and by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to examine actions by police in the aftermath.|$|E

25|$|Stein {{published}} {{an article on the}} biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would have to fly at least 10 miles an hour to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land on its hind feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that hadrosaurs were likely grazers rather than browsers appears to contradict <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> from preserved stomach contents {{found in the}} fossilized guts in previous hadrosaur studies. The most recent such finding before {{the publication of the}} Purnell study was conducted in 2008, when a team led by University of Colorado at Boulder graduate student Justin S. Tweet found a homogeneous accumulation of millimeter-scale leaf fragments in the gut region of a well-preserved partially grown Brachylophosaurus. As a result of that finding, Tweet concluded in September 2008 that the animal was likely a browser, not a grazer. In response to such findings, Purnell said that preserved stomach contents are questionable because they do not necessarily represent the usual diet of the animal. The issue remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) are {{a recently}} developed research method {{which are used}} to examine genetic associations with dependence, addiction, and drug use. These studies employ an unbiased approach to finding genetic associations with specific phenotypes and give equal weight to all regions of DNA, including those with no ostensible relationship to drug metabolism or response. These studies rarely identify genes from proteins previously described via animal knockout models and candidate gene analysis. Instead, large percentages of genes involved in processes such as cell adhesion are commonly identified. This {{is not to say}} that <b>previous</b> <b>findings,</b> or the GWAS findings, are erroneous. The important effects of endophenotypes are typically not capable of being captured by these methods. Furthermore, genes identified in GWAS for drug addiction may be involved either in adjusting brain behavior prior to drug experiences, subsequent to them, or both.|$|E

30|$|It is {{essential}} to emphasize {{at this point that}} this paper does not intent to revisit the <b>previous</b> <b>finding</b> in the current or capital account literatures. Instead, it draws on those finding only to obtain a reasonable set of additional explanatory and control variables along with commonly used determinants in the literature to find the determinants of global current account imbalances.|$|R
25|$|The German {{historian}} Ingo Haar {{believes that}} civilian {{losses in the}} expulsions have been overstated in Germany for decades for political reasons. Haar argues that during the Cold War the West German government put political pressure on the Statistisches Bundesamt to push the figures upward {{to agree to the}} unreliable Church Service figure of 2.3 million dead and missing. Harr disputes the statements of the German government and maintains that the lower estimates of 500-600,000 deaths already include post war deaths due to malnutrition and disease. He also maintains that the figures for the population of prewar Germany include 27,000 Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Harr points out that these issues were raised with the West German government, but the inflated numbers continued to be used when the demographic report was published in 1958 in order to agree with the <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> of the Schieder commission and the Church Search Service.|$|E
25|$|Certain drugs {{increase}} the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated {{in the cause of}} déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study by}} {{psychologist}} Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study participants were given pairs {{of male and female}} first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating <b>previous</b> <b>findings.</b> In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men {{and to a lesser extent}} women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of <b>previous</b> <b>findings,</b> some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job contexts of high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E
500|$|Breyer wrote separately, {{concerned}} that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the <b>previous</b> <b>findings</b> regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: [...] "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with {{an image of a}} nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?" [...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E
500|$|Russo & Russo {{from the}} Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia {{conducted}} a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing {{the effects of the}} carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to [...] "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" [...] than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. [...] A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their <b>previous</b> <b>findings.</b> After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.|$|E
