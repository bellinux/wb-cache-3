40|$|In {{this study}} we {{endeavour}} to expose the falseness of {{a certain sense of}} underlying inferiority in the company model advocated by the social economy. We will do so by describing and analysing certain “recent” management trends whose origins run {{from the end of the}} Second World War to the close of the 20 th century and which can be grouped into four tendencies. Teamwork training in the ‘forties, self-managed teams in the ‘eighties and the internal marketing in the ‘nineties could be seen as trends that lean towards democracy. We could classify <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>profits</b> and various collective incentive mechanisms (through profits or shares) as tendencies with a slant towards economic participation. Quality circles and total quality management could be considered trends that lie within a tendency towards excellence, in the sense that they require everyone’s involvement. Lastly, we would group trends such as values-based management and corporate social responsibility within a tendency that places particular emphasis on values. Our hypothesis is clear: the business approach represented by the “specific” management model employed in cooperative enterprises entails an implicit convergence of these tendencies and trends due to their particular emphasis on achieving the objectives of social and economic participation. By assuming this convergence, be it only in part, we would have to question the unfounded nature of democracy and participation, and the “competitive disadvantage” of the alternative model and its unacknowledged originality.

The study extends the configurational approach to SHRM to include the construct of the workforce philosophy as the factor that determines the coherence of HRM systems. Companies that have employee ownership as a central element and core HRM practice should do two things {{in order to ensure}} that their HRM system is coherent and potentially a high-performance work system (HPWS). First, these firms should propagate the idea that employees deserve to be co-owners and take employees seriously as such. Second, the HRM system should reflect this workforce philosophy: the HRM system should contain HRM practices that mirror the rights that make up the very construct of ‘ownership’. The core HRM practices of the ‘ownership-HPWS’, in addition to employee ownership, are: <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> decision-making, <b>profit</b> sharing, information sharing, training for business literacy and mediation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{special concern}} {{of this paper}} is to recalibrate the {{benefits}} and burdens of public-private partnerships as they remake inner city neighborhoods, by braking the rate at which urban land is being reclaimed from low-wealth residents by local government practices to disperse occupants, sweeping aside their tangible and intangible capital. Public oversight requirements have not kept pace with the dispossession, yet the costs that these development decisions impose on the social fabric of communities rend the shared networks necessary to residents’ abilities to meet basic social needs. This destruction of low-wealth communities is a form of equity-stripping, produced by local government policies to deploy land use powers and sink public subsidy into for-profit redevelopments that cater to wealthier in-movers. This paper explores community-based equity shareholding in public/private redevelopment projects. Community Equity Shares (CES) embody three principles. First, community equity shareholding recognizes limited rights in an existing community, akin to land ownership, as the basis for both <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the decision-making about the character of the redevelopment, and <b>profit</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the redevelopment projects that displace long-term residents. Second, by instantiating social and geographic community as ownership in the calculus of land-use, it is possible for residents in the district of a proposed redevelopment to parlay those shares for two purposes: for <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the decision-making about proposed redevelopment, and for <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>profits</b> from the displacing redevelopment project. The third principle is the addition of a player, the special-purpose Community Equity Corporation, comprised of all the community equity shareholders and wielding their limited powers in common, as participants in the redevelopment deal-making that, otherwise unchecked, would impose undue burdens including displacement upon the long-term residents of the targeted district. Community Equity Shareholding can be effectuated through changes in local governments’ redevelopment and procurement procedures, to more equitably adjust the calculus when government uses or threatens to use its land use powers to displace low-income communities as it re-engineers urban environs in concert with private developers...|$|R

It has enlisted the sentiments of the workmen employed on the side of the most careful regard by all of them to the general interest of the concern; and by its joint effect in promoting zealous exertion and checking waste, it has very materially increased the remuneration of every description of labor in the concerns in which it has been adopted. It is evident that this system admits of indefinite extension and of an indefinite increase in the share of profits assigned to the laborers, short of that which would leave to the managers less than the needful degree of personal interest in the success of the concern.

Financial participation is a generic term for the <b>participation</b> of employees <b>in</b> <b>profit</b> and enterprise results including equity of their employing firm. In general, there are two forms of employee financial participation: profit-sharing and employee share ownership (including options). While profit sharing is considered as an incentive for employees with positive individual and organizational level outcomes, employee share ownership adds to that a share holding element where employees may consider themselves as co-owners of the firm, including the possibility of voice and control. In this chapter we review the current literature on the impact of financial participation and show that in most cases the literature shows positive effects on outcomes. However, the literature also shows that financial participation is not a HR instrument that produces the results mainly in a generic way, but that the best results can be achieved when embedded in a configuration of HR policies and practices, which we call ‘high performance ownership system’...|$|R

It uses matched employeeestablishment data from the British economy.

The estimates indicate wage premium for the employees who work in establishments with participatory practices. The selectivity {{appears to be an}} important factor in the relationship between employee participation and wages. The estimates without selectivity correction suggest a lower wage premium than that suggested by selectivity corrected estimates. The selectivity corrected estimates show that employees in establishment with any one, two or all of the participatory practices earn a wage premium of 18 %, 32. 7 % and 55. 1 %, respectively. The estimates of the interaction model of participation and education indicate that an extra year of education earns lower wage premium in establishments with participatory practices than in establishments with no participatory practice.

40|$|The recent {{corporate}} law reform introduced {{different types of}} financial instruments, while aiming at increasing the recourse to capital markets and meeting the diversified requests of emerging categories of professional and sophisticated investors. The aforementioned financial instruments came to fall in a wide grey zone between stock and corporate bonds, although they differ from both because destined to specific professional investors instead of retail investors. The following research presents an analysis of some particular kinds of financial instruments, called “participating financial instruments” by artt. 2346, 2349 and 2351, civil code. The {{first part of the}} paper explores the content of the adjective “participating” because {{it is not clear whether}} “participating” is to be referred to the social organization or to the exposure to risk that these instruments entail. The latter interpretation eventually prevails. Consequently, “participating” is referred to participation, through the financial instrument, to corporate losses or profits. The issue of participating financial instruments is considered one among other equity-raising activities because the contributions from the instruments flow in the equity and, consequently, are exposed to risk, although the investor does not have the right to a final repayment. The relationship between issuer and subscriber of participating financial instruments goes beyond the credit-debt phenomenon, which instead pertains to bonds and securities similar to bonds, ruled by art. 2411, co. 3, civil code. In fact, the previous instruments entail a repayment obligation, although depending on the level of corporate losses or profits. Participating financial instruments are considered quasi-equity. This legal nature justifies the legislative provision that leaves to contractual freedom the opportunity of the investor’s <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the <b>profits</b> and, <b>in</b> case, some management rights (art. 2351 civil code). Moreover, the paper analyzes different typologies of possible subscriber contributions -in particular the characteristics of the contribution of services- as well as addressing their financial accounting and reporting in the balance sheet and the different and complex purposes that the issue of participating financial instruments intends to accomplish...|$|R
