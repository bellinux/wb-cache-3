40|$|Land {{salinity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} abiotic constraints that affect negatively crop production worldwide. Medicago genus, mostly composed by annual species, is of a real interest in improving soil fertility and maintaining pastures for livestock. We assessed adaptive traits for salt tolerance in 40 contrasted populations belonging to 6 Medicago species. In a common site, trial was performed in saline and non-saline soils where functional and fitness traits were recorded. Only M. ciliaris populations survived in the saline soil, highlighting the negative effect of even low salt levels at <b>plant</b> <b>lift.</b> ANOVA and PCA revealed that lifting rate, length branch at flowering time and total pod number might be involved in salt tolerance. The response to salt stress of Medicago was further studied by analyzing germination kinetics of 37 populations under five ranges of NaCl concentrations from 0 to 200 mM, during 7 days. Kaplan-Meier survivor curves and Cox PH models indicated that time to 50 % germination, germinability and germination synchrony are affected by the increase of salts. The risk of non-germinated seeds depends on species, populations and NaCl concentrations. Altogether, these results show that both salt level and exposition duration affect the phenotypical traits. Local adaptation may partly explain the patterns of salt tolerance. M. ciliaris is the most tolerant species, with a relatively high level of intraspecific variability for most studied traits...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correlate}} corm size and storage period of corms to allocation of assimilates {{in different parts}} of the plant an experiment was conducted during growth period of 2004 and 2005 in Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Treatments were four groups of corm size (3 - 6, 6 - 9, 9 - 12 and 12 - 15 g) either stored for a period of time before planting or sown directly without storage. Experiment was conducted in a Complete Randomized Block design with three replications. Results indicated that storing corms before planting had a negative effect on number, area, length and width of leaf and also on weight of leaf, weight of main shoot, weight of leaves of lateral shoots and total weight of plant. However, weight of corm, number and weight of lateral shoots and area of lateral leaf was not affected by storing the corms. Nevertheless, in the second year, number, length and weight of leaf on main shoot, number of cormlet, number, area and weight of leaf on lateral shoots, total weight of plant, corm weight, weight of main shoot and weight of lateral buds was reduced while leaf width were not affected. Effect of corm size on almost all measured parameters was positive and with increasing corm weight an increasing trend was observed in the above parameters.

Consequently, the compu-tational efficiency of the discrete-time lifting technique is improved, and the structures of the original problems can easily be recovered from their lifted solutions. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the investigation of the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation associated with a discrete-lifted system. ...|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{farmers and}} ranchers face an {{unprecedented}} risk environment. Extreme price volatility has impacted the cost of inputs for producers, {{as well as the}} prices they receive for farm commodities. Livestock producers face fluctuations forcing them to re-evaluate their business and marketing plans. Some face liquidation, due to declining profits stemming from high feed prices and reduced consumer demand. With a $ 1 per bushel swing possible in corn prices, feeder cattle prices could continue to be very volatile in the months to come (Feuz, 2011). At this point in the planting season there is still the potential to be short of corn, which means there could once again be a very tight corn supply to meet ethanol mandates, feeding needs and export demand. Input prices for producers also continue to fluctuate, including fuel and fertilizer. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, (first quarter 2011), farmers are seeing farm income and farmland values increase in 2011.

40|$|An {{inventory}} {{has been}} made of manual lifting situations in the cultivation and forcing of flower bulbs and bulb flowers. Originally this was the first part of a study with two objectives: (1) reduction of physical load of workers in flower bulb cultivation, due to manual handling of crates, and (2) uniformization of crates in bulb cultivation and bulb forcing. Meanwhile, a new study on uniformization of these crates has started (AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿). Therefore the original study was stopped after the inventory and two new studies were started: `Information supply for reduction of physical load during handling of crates in bulb flower production¿ and `Fitting Arbo-expertise in the AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿¿. First, an overview {{has been made}} of the most important situations in bulb cultivation and bulb flower production where crates are lifted or moved. Then, ten bulb flower or flower bulb producers and three mechanization companies were interviewed. Information is collected at the production companies concerning the physical load, due to manual handling of the crates and concerning motives for or against mechanization. Based on the collected data Lifting Indices (a standard for physical load because of lifting) were calculated. In all visited companies several types of crates were used. In eight companies at least one type of palletboxes was used. Beside these, most companies use several 60 x 40 cm and 50 x 75 cm crates. Most companies use several types of these crates with different heights. It is concluded that in bulb cultivation most crate handling situations are mechanized, since generally very heavy (1 x 1. 2 x 1 m) palletboxes are used. Particularly in small companies and in some minor crops manual lifting occurs. In these cases, health standards are always exceeded. However, it must be noticed that this work occurs only during a limited part of the year. In bulb flower production more manual lifting occurs, especially when flowers are produced in pot soil. During <b>planting,</b> <b>lifting</b> indices (LI) between 2. 8 and 3. 3 (about three times the permitted weight) were found. Moving crates in and out the greenhouse is often mechanized, but during manual moving the LI was between 4. 5 and 6. 5. During manual emptying of crates, filled with soil, LI was between 4. 4 and 6. 7. When flowers are forced in water, the weights are much lower and LI was between 1 and 2. According to the visited mechanization companies it is almost always possible to adapt stackers and de-stackers so that they can handle several types of crates. This applies to other processes as well, such as emptying, filling and cleaning the crates. The most important bottleneck for mechanization is a financial one, since mechanization not always results in labour saving sufficient to cover the investment costs...|$|R

40|$|The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is {{designed}} to bring about 1. 9 ML of Colorado River water per year to Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties in Arizona. CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the after bay of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the fore bay of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping <b>plants</b> downstream <b>lift</b> water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a canal pool. The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the fore bay of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with battery-operated electric motors. This was intended to contain water within each canal pool, if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the check gates causes surge waves in the canal. Some additional freeboard at the downstream end of each canal pool was provided to contain these surge waves. Increases in frictional resistance in the canal have reduced the available canal freeboard from design conditions. This study evaluated the available freeboard in the canal during steady conditions and during unsteady conditions, associated with a power outage. HEC-RAS was used to determine water surface elevations and available freeboard under both steady and unsteady conditions...|$|R
