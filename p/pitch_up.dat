5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's <b>pitch</b> (<b>up</b> and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} had to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> and consequently, lost airspeed as the result. These are the {{indications that}} a downdraft had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Civil Aeronautics Board, which concluded its probable cause was {{the loss of a}} 5/16 inch bolt which fell out of the elevator control mechanism during the climb from Chicago, resulting in an abrupt <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> followed by a stall and crash.|$|E

25|$|NTSB investigators' post-accident {{investigation}} {{showed that}} because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and <b>pitch</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to <b>pitch</b> <b>up,</b> but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the Model Z's crash during a speed run in December 1931 was due to an unexpected failure of the gasoline tank cap, which may have come loose and passed through the windshield. A bullet-proof windscreen and internal fuel caps {{were part of the}} new design. Analysis of motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, is inconclusive. Control surface flutter is a more likely cause. It is theorized that the gas cap struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to uncontrolled flutter in the right aileron which imparted undue stress on that wing, causing it to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> sharply and fail. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed. The 1932 R-1 and its sister ship, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z.|$|E

25|$|During {{his seven}} years in flight test, Chilstrom flew 147 {{different}} aircraft including X, Y, and production models from the United States, Germany, and Japan. Many German and Japanese aircraft captured during World War II were sent to Wright Field, and Chilstrom {{had the opportunity to}} fly and evaluate over twenty different models including the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the Messerschmitt Me 262, the A6M Zero, and the Kawasaki Ki-45 Nick. He flew the Fw 190 extensively and during his tenth flight on February 24, 1945, a malfunctioning trim switch nearly killed him. Chilstrom was landing at Wright Field when the elevator trim switch malfunctioned causing the nose to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> while the Fw 190 was dangerously close to the ground. After regaining control and climbing to a safe altitude, he identified the problem and determined the trim could also be driven to a full nose-down position. With full nose-down trim, Chilstrom had just enough control to successfully land the aircraft. Other Fw 190 pilots were not as fortunate as electrical problems in the trim switch caused or were suspected to have caused a number of crashes.|$|E
500|$|On November15, {{residents}} in Taiwan were urged to take precautions to minimize casualties. Prior to the storm's arrival, the USS Duncan, the USS Kitty Hawk, {{and two other}} aircraft carriers sought refuge in the Taiwan Strait. Despite attempts to escape the storm, large swells exceeding [...] battered the vessels, causing them to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> to 59degrees. At times, the waves crashed onto {{the deck of the}} USS Kitty Hawk. According to crewmen, waves up to [...] struck Taipei, leaving water marks on many buildings.|$|E
500|$|Thus did three-axis control evolve: wing-warping for roll (lateral motion), forward {{elevator}} for <b>pitch</b> (<b>up</b> and down) {{and rear}} rudder for yaw (side to side). On March 23, 1903, the Wrights applied for their famous patent for a [...] "Flying Machine", {{based on their}} successful 1902 glider. Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of three-axis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to, or even more significant, than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer. Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplane.|$|E

2500|$|... 24 May 1963: 60-6926 (Article 123) crashed near Wendover, Utah. The {{aircraft}} was flying a subsonic engine test flight when it entered a cloud, <b>pitched</b> <b>up,</b> {{and went out}} of control; the CIA pilot ejected successfully. [...] The investigation found that cloud vapor had formed ice in the pitot tube, causing the airspeed indicator to show an erroneous reading. The aircraft <b>pitched</b> <b>up</b> sharply and entered an unrecoverable stall. The pilot was wearing a standard flight suit for this low-altitude flight, and did not look suspicious to the truck driver that recovered him or the highway patrol office where he was taken.

2500|$|Many games, such as first- or third-person shooters, have {{a setting}} named [...] "invert mouse" [...] or similar (not to be {{confused}} with [...] "button inversion", sometimes performed by left-handed users) which allows the user to look downward by moving the mouse forward and upward by moving the mouse backward (the opposite of non-inverted movement). This control system resembles that of aircraft control sticks, where pulling back causes <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> and pushing forward causes pitch down; computer joysticks also typically emulate this control-configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{descended on}} a southwest heading over Danbury Municipal Airport, [...] Connecticut {{at an altitude}} of 2,000 feet. [...] Around two miles ahead, White spotted a pasture halfway up Hunt Mountain, a 900ft ridge running perpendicular to the Constellation's flightpath. [...] He aligned the aircraft using asymmetric thrust, told passengers to brace themselves, and descended into the upward-sloping hillside with wheels and flaps retracted. [...] At the last moment he jammed the throttles forward to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> the aircraft's nose, letting the Constellation pancake into the 15-percent slope.|$|E
2500|$|Tanker 130 had {{departed}} the Minden, Nevada {{air attack base}} at 2:29p.m. PDT with [...] of fire retardant for its sixth drop of the day, and arrived at the fire at 2:45p.m. The crew, Steven Ray Wass, Pilot, 43 years; Craig LaBare, Co-Pilot, 37 years; Mike Davis, Engineer, 59 years, made an initial spotting pass over the drop zone, then flew back for the drop, {{which was to be}} a 1/2 salvo, dispensing half of the onboard retardant. The drop run required the aircraft to make a perpendicular crossing of a ridgeline and then descend into a valley. A video of the accident shows the aircraft crossing the ridge and then pitching down to begin its drop of the retardant. Near the end of the drop, the nose of the aircraft began to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> to level attitude as the descent was arrested. The nose continued to <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> past level attitude, {{and at the end of}} the drop, the right wing began to fold upwards, followed less than one second later by the left wing. Two debris fields were found, one [...] in length and the other [...] in length. A post-impact fire in the first debris field consumed major portions of the wing and engine components; there was no fire in the second debris field, which included the fuselage and empennage.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the crew}} called out [...] "50 meters", the {{controller}} instructed [...] "level 101", telling the aircraft to terminate descent. At , another controller instructed [...] "Check altitude, level." [...] Simultaneously with this final call, the control column was pulled full aft, commanding max <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> from the aircraft, and the throttles were moved within one second from their flight idle positions to maximum power. The aircraft, {{due to the}} valley terrain, was actually [...] below the runway at this time. The Russian investigation surmised that at this moment the flight crew saw the trees through the fog, and instinctively reacted {{in an attempt to}} escape their grave predicament. The crew did not disengage the autopilot, but the action of commanding maximum <b>pitch</b> <b>up</b> on the control column overpowered it, causing the pitch channel to disengage. The control column briefly moved to neutral at this point, then moved full aft and remained there {{for the duration of the}} flight. According to the Polish report, the command [...] "level" [...] ordering a change to horizontal flight was issued at a time when the aircraft was at an altitude of about [...] above airfield level. Two seconds before the [...] "level" [...] command, the aircraft commander made the decision to go around. According to the Polish committee's findings, the command to level should have been issued 10 seconds sooner, when the aircraft was well below the glide path.|$|E
