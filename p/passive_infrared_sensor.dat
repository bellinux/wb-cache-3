30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{a number of}} studies on {{pedestrian}} counting have used devices such as <b>infrared</b> imaging <b>sensors</b> (Leykin and Hammoud 2006; Goubet et al. 2006), <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> (Hashimoto et al. 1998), laser sensors (Cui et al. 2007), ultrasonic sensors (Chen et al. 2008). In addition, there are commercial pedestrian counters using devices such as <b>infrared</b> imaging <b>sensors</b> (IRISYS people counter 2014), active <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> (PCW- 2 BX 03 directional people counter 2014), <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> (Eco counter 2014), piezo films (Acoustic slab sensor 2014) and laser scanners (LOTraffic 2014). In particular, binary <b>sensors,</b> such as <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> and piezo sensors, are among the simplest sensors, capable of detecting only {{the presence or absence of}} objects within the sensing region. Although binary sensors can neither detect the number of pedestrians nor identify individual pedestrians within the sensing region, they possess advantages such as low cost, simplicity, small size, and energy efficiency in comparison with other types of sensors. Therefore, methods for estimation of the number of pedestrians by using binary sensors have attracted attention. Since the capabilities of a single binary sensor are limited, as mentioned above, some researchers have considered using combinations of binary sensors for estimating the number of pedestrians together with their movement direction (Chen et al. 2008; Son et al. 2007; Lee 2009; Taniguchi and Nakano 2014). However, in these methods, the estimation accuracy significantly decreases in crowded environments where a large number of pedestrians move simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Many {{smart city}} {{lighting}} applications require {{information about the}} location of light poles, in particular about which light poles are neighbors along the street with respect to passing traffic. This paper addresses the problem of deriving the topology of light poles in a smart city, relying only on the data gathered from <b>Passive</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sensors</b> attached to the light poles. A statistical algorithm is presented and evaluated based on a data set gathered from a real deployment in a residential area...|$|R
50|$|Occupancy {{sensors to}} allow {{operation}} for whenever someone {{is within the}} area being scanned can control lighting. When motion {{can no longer be}} detected, the lights shut off. <b>Passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person. The control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned. Doors, partitions, stairways, etc. will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness. The best applications for <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> occupancy <b>sensors</b> are open spaces with {{a clear view of the}} area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360-degree coverage. Some occupancy <b>sensors</b> utilize both <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> and ultrasonic technology, but are usually more expensive. They can be used to control one lamp, one fixture or many fixtures.|$|R

50|$|All warm bodies emit {{electro-magnetic}} radiation: see thermal radiation.Since different objects will emit differently {{at different}} frequencies,we can often determine {{what type of}} object {{we are looking at}} based on its emittedradiationâsee spectroscopy. This principle underlies all passivemicrowave <b>sensors</b> and most <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors.</b> <b>Passive</b> is used in thesense that the sensor only measures radiation that has been emitted by otherobjects but does not emit any of its own.(A SAR sensor, by contrast, is active.)

5000|$|This {{style of}} tamper {{resistance}} is most {{commonly found in}} burglar alarms. Most trip devices (e.g. pressure pads, <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> (motion detectors), door switches) use two signal wires that, depending on configuration, are normally open or normally closed. The sensors sometimes need power, so to simplify cable runs, multi-core cable is used. While 4 cores is normally enough for devices that require power (leaving two spare for those that don't), cable with additional cores can be used. These additional cores can be wired into a special so-called [...] "tamper circuit" [...] in the alarm system.|$|R
50|$|The SLAM is {{equipped}} with a <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensor</b> (PIRS) that was specifically developed for the side-attack mode. The PIRS detects trucks and light armored vehicles by sensing the change in background temperature when a vehicle crosses in front of the PIRS port. The PIRS is directional and aligned with the EFP when the device is aimed. The side-attack mode is active when the SLAM selector switch is set to 4, 10, or 24 hoursâand the PIRS cover is removed to expose the PIRS.|$|E
50|$|Cadillac Night Vision on the DeVille was {{the first}} {{worldwide}} series production automotive night vision, however it was discontinued in 2004.

Information is displayed as a black-and-white image with warmer objects in white, while cooler objects appear black.

50|$|The SLAM has a {{built-in}} magnetic influence sensor, that allows it {{to be used as}} a full width belly attack munition against vehicles. It can be concealed along trails and roads where target vehicles operate and can be camouflaged with dry leaves, grass, and so forth without affecting EFP performance. Mud, gravel, water, and other debris that fill the EFP cup have minimal impact on EFP formation and effectiveness as long as the debris does not extend beyond the depth of the EFP cup. The magnetic sensor is designed to trigger detonation when it senses a vehicle passing overhead. For the EFP to form properly, it needs a minimum of 13 cm from the point of emplacement to the target. The bottom-attack mode is active when the selector switch is set to 4, 10, or 24 hours and the <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensor</b> (PIRS) trigger cover is in place.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{surveillance}} and tracking applications, wireless sensor nodes collectively monitor {{the existence of}} intruding targets. In this paper, we derive closed form results for predicting surveillance performance attributes, represented by detection probability and average detection delay of intruding targets, based on tunable system parameters, represented by node density and sleep duty cycle. The results apply to both stationary and mobile targets, and {{shed light on the}} fundamental connection between aspects of sensing quality and deployment choices. We demonstrate that our results are robust to realistic sensing models, which are proposed based on experimental measurements of <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors.</b> We also validate the correctness of our results through extensive simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a machine learning approach to water level estimation in a dual ultrasonic/passive <b>infrared</b> urban flood <b>sensor</b> system.

Since floods occur very rarely, we use a supervised learning approach to estimate the correction to the ultrasonic rangefinder caused by temperature fluctuations.

50|$|Other lights may be {{activated}} by <b>sensors</b> such as <b>passive</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>sensors</b> (PIRs), turning on {{only when a}} person (or other mammal) approaches.

PIR sensor activation can increase both the deterrent effect (since the intruder knows that he has been detected) and the detection effect (since a person will be attracted to the sudden increase in light). Some PIR units can be set up to sound a chime as well as turn on the light. Most modern units have a photocell so that they only turn on when it is dark.|$|R
