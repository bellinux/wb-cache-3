25|$|But {{the results}} of the first {{workplace}} {{studies have shown that the}} effectiveness of respirators all designs - is very fickle, and strongly depend on the correctness of their use (continuous use in polluted atmosphere, etc...), and on the leakage of contaminated air under the mask through the gaps between it and the worker's face. It was found that respirators' efficiency in the workplaces were much lower, as compared to laboratory conditions. This has led to revise the boundaries of the application of RPE different designs, and prompted to develop requirements for the organization of their application, fixing them in the national legislation.

25|$|The Bazaar and caravanserai were {{constructed}} {{as an integral}} part of the complex, initially to provide the construction workers with accommodation and facilities for their wellbeing, and later as a place for trade, the revenue of which supplemented the expenses of the complex. The area became a small town in its own right during and after the building of the Taj. Originally known as 'Mumtazabad', today it is called Taj Ganji or 'Taj Market'. Its plan took the characteristic form of a square divided by two cross axial streets with gates to the four cardinal points. Bazaars lined each street and the resultant squares to each corner housed the caravanserais in open courtyards accessed from internal gates from where the streets intersected (Chauk). Contemporary sources <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north eastern and western parts of the Taj Ganji (Taj Market) and it is likely that only this half received imperial funding. Thus, the quality of the architecture was finer than the southern half.|$|E
25|$|There were roughly three {{positions}} {{on the future of}} the Dutch economy. The CDA claimed that the reforms were finished and that the following cabinet would not have to take any serious measures. The VVD wanted to continue reforming to increase the performance of the Dutch economy. They wanted to continue to cut taxes and reduce bureaucracy. The opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL, joined by the ChristianUnion wanted to revert some of the measures and <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public sector, especially to the health care-sector and the poor. The PvdA and the GreenLeft however also announced that they wanted to reform part of the economy and welfare system. For instance several months before the elections, Wouter Bos, the leader of Labour Party, announced that he wanted to tax the elderly pension in such a way that rich elderly would pay more taxes on their pensions than poor elderly. The Dutch pension system consists of government supplied (AOW) and mandatory self-saved pensions. It is the latter portion Bos wanted to tax progressively. The proposal led to considerable controversy, both outside and within Bos' own party. Former minister and de Volkskrant columnist Marcel van Dam wrote a critical column on 22 June concerning Bos' proposal. The second man of the Christian Democratic Appeal Maxime Verhagen used soundbites from the proposal continually to emphasise that the PvdA was an unreliable partner for the elderly. Bos later moderated his plans: only new cases would pay taxes over their pension.|$|E

In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Age's interest in such topics as [...] "new socio-political thinking" [...] and [...] "New Economics", topics Rose discussed in his book Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus, issued by a European academic publisher.|$|E
500|$|Gawain's {{refusal of}} the Lady Bertilak's ring has major {{implications}} {{for the remainder of}} the story. While the modern student may tend to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in Pearl. This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a [...] "brygt sunne" [...] (line 1819), a [...] "fiery sun." [...] This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.|$|E

500|$|When Smallville first began, Lana was in {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with Whitney Fordman, the star quarterback of the football team. Kreuk believes that Lana truly {{was in love with}} Whitney when they first started dating, {{but by the time the}} audience first sees her in the pilot she is no longer in that same state of mind. Kreuk believes that by the time of the pilot Lana had grown “comfortable” with Whitney, and that was where their relationship ended. Though Lana had growing feelings for Clark, Kreuk feels that the producers rushed the coupling of Clark and Lana at the end of the second season. She believes that with everything that had happened throughout the season between the two characters, it seemed a bit of a stretch for Lana to just quickly fall into Clark's arms. The next season began to develop more of the relationship between Lex and Lana. Kreuk believes that Lana cares for Lex as a friend, and that she recognizes the [...] "undertones" [...] that Lex may be placing on their relationship, but that Lana tends to ignore them. Kreuk recognizes that Lex is a big part of Lana's life, and that Lana tries to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> good that Lex does and focus less on the darker aspects of his life.|$|E

2500|$|After {{dissolution}} of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving.

Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experienced distress (Pistole, 1996).

Schneerson proclaimed 1977 as a [...] "Year of Education" [...] and urged Congress to do the same. He stated that education [...] "must think in terms of a 'better living' not only for the individual, but also for the society as a whole. The educational system must, therefore, <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building of character, with emphasis on moral and ethical values.

Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counter-factual questions posed to them in a questionnaire.
