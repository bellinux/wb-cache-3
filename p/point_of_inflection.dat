It is a huge industry in terms of size and according to India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), it is valued at about US$395.96 billion.

2500|$|A simple {{example of}} a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection</b> is the {{function}} f(x) = x3. There is a clear change of concavity about the point x = 0, and we can prove this by means of calculus. The second derivative of f is the everywhere-continuous 6x, and at x = 0, [...] f′′ = 0, and the sign changes about this point. So x = 0 is a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{functions}} change concavity {{without having}} <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection.</b> Instead, {{they can change}} concavity around vertical asymptotes or discontinuities. Take, for example, the function 2x2/(x2 - 1). It is concave when |x| > 1 and convex when |x| < 1. However, it has no <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection</b> because 1 and -1 {{are not in the}} domain of the function.|$|R

2500|$|For the {{function}} f(x) = x4 [...] we have f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 0. Even though f'(0) = 0, {{this point is}} not a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection.</b> [...] The {{reason is that the}} sign of f(x) changes from negative to positive.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{function}} f(x) = sin(x) we have f(0) ≠ 0 and [...] f'(0) = 0. But {{this is not}} a stationary point, rather it is a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection.</b> This is because the concavity changes from concave downwards to concave upwards and the sign of f(x) does not change; it stays positive.|$|E

2500|$|For the non-depressed case (...) (shown in the {{accompanying}} graph), the depressed case as indicated previously is obtained by defining [...] such that [...] so [...] Graphically this corresponds to simply shifting the graph horizontally when changing between the variables [...] and , without changing the angle relationships. This shift moves the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection</b> and {{the centre of the}} circle onto the -axis. Consequently, the roots of the equation in [...] sum to zero.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are four}} basic forms of {{bifurcation}} associated with loss of structural stability or buckling {{in the case}} of structures with a single degree of freedom. [...] These comprise two types of pitchfork bifurcation, one saddle-node bifurcation (often referred to as a limit point) and one transcritical bifurcation. The pitchfork bifurcations are the most commonly studied forms and include the buckling of columns, sometimes known as Euler buckling; the buckling of plates, sometimes known as local buckling, which is well known to be relatively safe (both are supercritical phenomena) and the buckling of shells, which is well-known to be a highly dangerous (subcritical phenomenon). Using the concept of potential energy, equilibrium is defined as a stationary point with respect to the degree(s) of freedom of the structure. We can then determine whether the equilibrium is stable, as in the case where the stationary point is a local minimum; or unstable, as in the case where the stationary point is a maximum <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>inflection</b> or saddle point (for multiple-degree-of-freedom structures only) – see animations below.|$|E
