We use the 2000 and 2004 general elections to analyze the effect of market-level advertising on county-level vote shares.

Advertising elasticities are smaller than are typical for branded goods yet significant enough to shift election outcomes.

40|$|We {{estimate}} advertising {{effects in}} the context of presidential elections. This setting overcomes many data challenges in previous advertising studies, while arguably providing {{one of the most interesting}} empirical settings to study advertising's effects. The four-year presidential election cycle facilitates measurement in two ways. First, the gap between elections depreciates past advertising stocks such that large advertising investments are concentrated within relatively short periods. Second, the lack of political advertising between elections allows lagged advertising prices to serve as instruments that are safely independent of candidates' current advertising choices. To further aid estimation, the winner-take-all nature of the electoral college generates broad variation in advertising levels across states. We analyze the data using an aggregate discrete choice approach with extensive fixed effects at the party-market level to control for unobservable cross-sectional factors that might be correlated with advertising, outcomes, and instruments. The results indicate significant <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> exposures for the 2000 and 2004 general elections. Advertising elasticities are smaller than are typical for branded goods, yet significant enough to shift election outcomes. For example, if advertising were set to zero and all other factors held constant, three states' electoral votes would have changed parties in 2000, leading to a different president. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{consists of three}} essays {{within the field of}} economics of information privacy examined through the lens of behavioral and experimental economics. Rapid development and expansion of Internet, mobile and network technologies in the last decades has provided multitudinous opportunities and benefits to both business and society proposing the customized services and personalized offers at a relatively low price and high speed. However, such innovations and progress have also created complex and hazardous issues. One of the main problems is related to the management of extensive flows of information, containing terabytes of personal data. Collection, storage, analysis, and sharing of this information imply risks and trigger usersâ concerns that range from nearly harmless to significantly pernicious, including tracking of online behavior and location, intrusive or unsolicited marketing, price discrimination, surveillance, hacking attacks, fraud, and identity theft. Some users ignore these issues or at least do not take an action to protect their online privacy. Others try to limit their activity in Internet, which in turn may inhibit the online shopping acceptance. Yet another group of users gathers personal information protection, for example, by deploying the privacy-enhancing technologies, e. g., ad-blockers, e-mail encryption, etc. The ad-blockers sometimes reduce the revenue of online publishers, which provide the content to their users for free and do not receive the income from advertisers in case the user has blocked ads. The economics of privacy studies the trade-offs related to the positive and negative economic consequences of personal information use by data subjects and its protection by data holders and aims at balancing the interests of both parties optimising the expected utilities of various stakeholders. As technology is penetrating every aspect of human life raising numerous privacy issues and affecting a large number of interested parties, including business, policy-makers, and legislative regulators, the outcome of this research is expected to have a great impact on individual economic markets, consumers, and society as a whole. The first essay provides an extensive literature review and combines the theoretical and empirical evidence on the impact of advertising in both traditional and digital media in order to gain the insights about the effects of ad-blocking privacy-enhancing technologies on consumersâ welfare. It first studies the views of the main schools of advertising, informative and persuasive. The informative school of advertising emphasizes the <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on sales, competition, product quality, and consumersâ utility and satisfaction by matching buyers to sellers, informing the potential customers about available goods and enhancing their informed purchasing decisions. In contrast, the advocates of persuasive school view advertising as a generator of irrational brand loyalty that distorts consumersâ preferences, inflates product prices, and creates entry barriers. I pay special attention to the targeted advertising, which is typically assumed to {{have a positive impact on}} consumersâ welfare if it does not cause the decrease of product quality and does not involve the extraction of consumersâ surplus through the exploitation of reservation price for discriminating activities. Moreover, the utility of personalized advertising appears to be a function of its accuracy: the more relevant is a targeted offer, the more valuable it is for the customer. I then review the effects of online advertising on the main stakeholders and users and show that the low cost of online advertising leads to excessive advertising volumes causing information overload, psychological discomfort and reactance, privacy concerns, decreased exploration activities and opinion diversity, and market inefficiency. Finally, as ad-blocking technologies filter advertising content and limit advertising exposure, I analyze the consequences of ad-blocking deployment through the lens of the models on advertising restrictions. The control of advertising volume and its partial restriction would benefit both consumers and businesses more than a complete ban of advertising. For example, advertising exposure caps, which limit the number of times that the same ad is to be shown to a particular user, general reduction of the advertising slots, control of the advertising quality standards, and limitation of tracking would result in a better market equilibrium than can offer an arms race of ad-blockers and anti-ad-blockers. Finally, I review the solutions alternative to the blocking of advertising content, which include self regulation, non-intrusive ads programs, paywall, intention economy approach that promotes business models, in which user initiates the trade and not the marketer, and active social movements aimed at increasing social awareness and consumer education. The second essay describes a model of factors affecting Internet usersâ perceptions of websitesâ trustworthiness with respect to their privacy and the intentions to purchase from such websites. Using focus group method I calibrate a list of websitesâ attributes that represent those factors. Then I run an online survey with 117 adult participants to validate the research model. I find that privacy (including awareness, information collection and control practices), security, and reputation (including background and feedback) have strong effect on trust and willingness to buy, while website quality plays a marginal role. Although generally trustworthiness perceptions and purchase intentions are positively correlated, in some cases participants are likely to purchase from the websites that they have judged as untrustworthy. I discuss how behavioral biases and decision-making heuristics may explain this discrepancy between perceptions and behavioral intentions. Finally, I analyze and suggest what factors, particular websitesâ attributes, and individual characteristics have the strongest effect on hindering or advancing customersâ trust and willingness to buy. In the third essay I investigate the decision of experimental subjects to incur the risk of revealing personal information to other participants. I do so by using a novel method to generate personal information that reliably induces privacy concerns in the laboratory. I show that individual decisions to incur privacy risk are correlated with decisions to incur monetary risk. I find that partially depriving subjects of control over the revelation of their personal information does not lead them to lose interest in protecting it. I also find that making subjects think of privacy decisions after financial decisions reduces their aversion to privacy risk. Finally, surveyed attitude to privacy and explicit willingness to pay or to accept payments for personal information correlate with willingness to incur privacy risk. Having shown that privacy loss can be assimilated to a monetary loss, I compare decisions to incur risk in privacy lotteries with risk attitude in monetary lotteries to derive estimates of the implicit monetary value of privacy. The average implicit monetary value of privacy is about equal to the average willingness to pay to protect private information, but the two measures do not correlate at the individual level. I conclude by underlining the need to know individual attitudes to risk to properly evaluate individual attitudes to privacy as such...|$|E

First, we consider the Nash equilibrium {{of the situation in}} which the duopolistic firms compete simultaneously with two instruments, i. e. the prices and the advertising expenditures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} that the <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> comparative <b>advertising</b> are significantly diluted when a compared-to brand retaliates. Retaliation introduces sequencing in advertisements. We therefore evaluate sequelized advertisements (both comparative and noncomparative) alongside comparative advertisements and ordinary advertisements. We show that, given no threat <b>of</b> comparative <b>advertising</b> from competitors, sequelizing a popular advertisement may be as potent as comparative <b>advertising,</b> in terms <b>of</b> improving consumers’ recall as well as preference for the sponsored brand. Furthermore, an advertisement message may be directed at core benefits (and/or attributes) that a brand promises, or at a stylized theme or storyline that use peripheral cues to indirectly convey the brand’s deliverables. We incorporate this dimension of communication focus and conclude that while comparative advertisements are more effective with objective messages, noncomparative sequelized advertisements work better with thematic or story based messages. ...|$|R

A between-subjects experiment is conducted to test individuals’ responses to tailored versus generic advertisements for an unknown face-cream brand. The results show that tailoring is effective in influencing message attitudes, brand attitudes and purchase intentions, but only for Polish consumers. This tailoring effect is mediated by involvement with the message, message relevance and scepticism about the message. These findings suggest that tailored advertising can be used successfully in less marketing-savvy countries such as Poland, but that it may not be effective in more marketing-savvy countries such as the Netherlands...|$|R

This study also investigates the moderating <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> and firm reputation on the relationship. This study hypothesizes that both the between-firm and within-firm values of corporate social responsibility impact corporate financial performance. In addition, this study hypothesizes that bundling resources such as advertising and firm reputation enables firms to maximize the value of corporate social responsibility and, consequently, its impact on corporate financial performance. ^ The findings confirm the validity <b>of</b> the <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> corporate social responsibility on corporate financial performance.

Murrow School of Communication, Washington State UniversityAn {{online survey}} of {{undergraduates}} explored the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> recalled parent-child interaction regarding media on their critical thinking skills, beliefs about alcohol and sex and current reports of risky behaviors. Students completed the questionnaire three times during fall 2011. The SEM analyses {{were based on}} 676 students. The longitudinal data set was used to model a latent trajectory of drinking and risky behaviors. Students whose parents critiqued media content reported {{a higher level of}} critical thinking toward media sources and media content. More critical thinking toward media sources decreased the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on alcohol-related expectancies. More critical thinking toward media content decreased the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on sex-related expectancies, alcohol-related behaviors and risky sexual behaviors. Parents' mediation served as protective factor against the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on drinking via their effects on critical thinking toward media sources and alcohol-related expectancies. Negative mediation decreased risky sexual behaviors via its prior effects on critical thinking toward media content and sex-related expectancies. On the other hand, students whose parents endorsed media portrayal reported lower levels of critical thinking. Positive mediation predicted more risky sexual behaviors. Therefore, critical thinking toward media directly and consistently affected risky behaviors. Alcohol-related expectancies were related to sex-related expectancies. At time 1, more drinking predicted more risky sexual behaviors. However, the relationship did not stand the test of time. The analyses also revealed a linear decrease of drinking from time 1 to time 3. Developing critical thinking toward media is an effective approach to helping young people make good decision about their health. Although students' understanding <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> intent may be biased by the emotional aspect of decision making, critical thinking decreased the appeal <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on risky behaviors.

Empirical {{results show that the}} <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> on market shares is relatively short-lived, appearing to be substantially depreciated within one year for all firms. It is also found that advertising is less effective for foreign firms in the Indonesian market. ...|$|R

Despite a booming media industry aimed at young people, {{little is known about}} the uses and <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> these media and technologies. CCAM strives to better understand the role of media in children's {{and adolescents}}' lives. What are the intended and unintended <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising?</b> Which children are particularly susceptible to potential negative <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising,</b> pornography, and media violence? When do social media have positive and negative influences on young people? Researchers in CCAM have published dozens of articles and chapters that provide answers on questions like these.|$|R

Although for many advertisers word-of-mouth is viewed as an alternative to advertising, the authors show {{that it is possible to}} quantify the way in which word-of-mouth often complements and extends the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising.</b> The authors provide a simple approach to the measurement of postpurchase word-of-mouth sales effects and demonstrate how firms may be underestimating advertising effectiveness by ignoring such effects. Their approach illustrates how customer lifetime value models can provide an important tool to assess the long-term <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> campaigns. ...|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> consumer demand estimation error for new products in the context of production planning. An inventory model is proposed, whereby demand is influenced by price and <b>advertising.</b> The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> parameter misspecification of the demand model is empirically examined in relation to profit and service level feasibility. Faced with an uncertain consumer reaction to price and advertising, we find that it is safer to overestimate rather than underestimate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> price on demand. Moreover, under a service level constraint it is safer to overestimate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising,</b> whereas for strict profit maximization, underestimating the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> is the conservative approach...|$|R
