5|$|When {{the game}} is ready for release, the {{publisher}} sends copies of {{the final version of}} the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a <b>product</b> <b>recall,</b> if deemed necessary. The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.|$|E

25|$|Many {{solvents}} {{can lead}} to a sudden loss of consciousness if inhaled in large amounts. Solvents like diethyl ether and chloroform have been used in medicine as anesthetics, sedatives, and hypnotics for a long time. Ethanol (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused psychoactive drug. Diethyl ether, chloroform, and many other solvents (e.g. from gasoline or glues) are used recreationally in glue sniffing, often with harmful long term health effects like neurotoxicity or cancer. Fraudulent substitution of 1,5-pentanediol for the psychoactive 1,4-butanediol by a subcontractor caused the Bindeez <b>product</b> <b>recall.</b>|$|E
500|$|Public {{perception}} of the Cadbury brand had slipped through 2006-7 {{after a series of}} public relations blunders and product recalls. In mid-2006, a number of Cadbury lines were found to contain salmonella bacteria, originating from a leaking pipe at the company's factory in Marlbrook. The incident was widely reported in the media, and had a number of knock-on effects: 40people became ill, and a <b>product</b> <b>recall</b> costing £20 million was initiated. The failure of Cadbury to inform the Food Standards Agency for five months after the problem was discovered resulted in a £1 million fine from Birmingham's Crown Court, and the Food Standards Agency advised the company to improve their [...] "out of date" [...] contamination testing procedures.|$|E

The response asserted that Bethesda's submission to the ESRB was [...] "full, accurate, and comprehensive," [...] following the forms and requirements published by the ESRB, and that nothing was withheld. Bethesda stressed that there was no nudity in their game without a modification, that the company [...] "didn't create a game with nudity" [...] and did not intend for nudity to appear in their game. [...] "Bethesda can not control tampering with Oblivion by third parties," [...] the press release concluded.|$|E

2500|$|The new Colt first {{attempted}} {{to address some}} of the demands of the market with the production in 1989 of the Double Eagle, a double-action pistol heavily based on the M1911 design, which was seen as an attempt to [...] "modernize" [...] the classic Browning design. Colt followed this up in 1992 with the Colt All American 2000, which was unlike any other handgun Colt had produced before—being a polymer-framed, rotary-bolt, 9×19mm handgun with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds. It was designed by Reed Knight, with parts manufactured by outside vendors and assembled by Colt; its execution was disastrous. Early models were plagued with inaccuracy and unreliability, and suffered from the poor publicity of a <b>product</b> <b>recall.</b> The product launch failed and production of the All American 2000 ended in 1994.
