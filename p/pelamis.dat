5|$|Sea snakes do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought that <b>Pelamis</b> would be found there {{were it not for}} the cold {{currents}} off Namibia and western South Africa that keep it from crossing into the eastern South Atlantic, or south of 5° latitude along the South American west coast. Sea snakes {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed to be due to its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of salinity is also thought to be the reason why <b>Pelamis</b> has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This is unusual for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, <b>Pelamis</b> platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
500|$|Various {{systems are}} under {{development}} at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for wave power off Scotland's coasts. <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power (previously Ocean Power Delivery) are an Edinburgh-based company whose <b>Pelamis</b> {{system has been}} tested off Orkney and Portugal. Their second generation P2 <b>Pelamis</b> machines are [...] long and [...] diameter. Five tubes joined together by hinged joints float semi-submerged {{on the surface of}} the ocean and move relative to each other as waves pass down the length of the machine. This motion is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which drive generators inside the machine to produce electricity. Future wave farm projects around Scotland could involve an arrangement of interlinked 1 MW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable.|$|E

500|$|Scalation among {{sea snakes}} is highly variable. As opposed to {{terrestrial}} snake species that have imbricate scales {{to protect against}} abrasion, the scales of most pelagic sea snakes do not overlap. Reef-dwelling species, such as Aipysurus, do have imbricate scales {{to protect against the}} sharp coral. The scales themselves may be smooth, keeled, spiny, or granular, the latter often looking like warts. <b>Pelamis</b> has body scales that are [...] "peg-like", while those on its tail are juxtaposed hexagonal plates.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{industrial}} areas, including Zona Industrial de Amorim and Parque Industrial de Laundos, in the city's outskirts, {{next to the}} A28 Motorway. [...] Póvoa de Varzim has been noted internationally for its Renewable energy industry. The world's first commercial wave farm was located in its coast,}} [...] at the Aguçadora Wave Park. The wave farm used <b>Pelamis</b> P-750 machines. The project failed {{and was replaced by}} the windfloat project, a new proctotype on offshore wind farms, from a distinct company, that attained successful testing. Energie, a company headquartered in Póvoa de Varzim, developed a thermodynamic solar system combining solar energy and a heat pump to generate energy.|$|E
500|$|The Hydrophiinae {{are mostly}} {{confined}} to the warm tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, with a few species found well out into Oceania. [...] The geographic range of one species, <b>Pelamis</b> platurus, is wider than {{that of any other}} reptile species, except for a few species of sea turtles. It extends from the east coast of Africa, from Djibouti in the north to Cape Town in the south, across the Indian Ocean, the Pacific, south as far as the northern coast of New Zealand, {{all the way to the}} western coast of the Americas, where it occurs from northern Peru in the south (including the Galápagos Islands) to the Gulf of California in the north. Isolated specimens have been found as far north as San Clemente in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The Siadar Wave Energy Project was {{announced}} in 2009. This 4 MW system was planned by npower Renewables and Wavegen for a site 400 metres off the shore of Siadar Bay, in Lewis. However, in July 2011 holding company RWE announced they were withdrawing from the scheme, and Wavegen are seeking new partners. In early 2010 two areas were identified for substantial offshore wind development, in the Moray Firth basin and outer Firth of Forth. Shortly afterwards the Government earmarked eleven sites they expected {{to benefit from the}} construction of up to 8,000 offshore turbines by 2020. These included Campbeltown and Hunterston, four sites previously used for offshore oil fabrication at Ardersier, Nigg Bay, Arnish and Kishorn and five east coast locations from Peterhead to Leith. In May 2010 the [...] "Vagr Atferd P2" [...] <b>Pelamis</b> 750kW system was launched for testing by EMEC. The device weighs [...] and is [...] long.|$|E
500|$|At best, Hydrophiinae make {{difficult}} captives. Ditmars (1933) {{described them}} as nervous and delicate captives that usually refuse to eat, preferring only {{to hide in}} the darkest corner of the tank. Over 50years later, Mehrtens (1987) wrote, although they were rarely displayed in Western zoological parks, some species were regularly on display in Japanese aquariums. Available food supply limits the number of species that can be kept in captivity, since some have diets that are too specialized. Also, some species appear intolerant of handling, or even being removed from the water. [...] Regarding their requirements in captivity, the Laticauda species {{need to be able to}} exit the water somewhere [...] at about 29°C, along with a submerged shelter. Species that have done relatively well in captivity include the ringed sea snake, Hydrophis cyanocinctus, which feeds on fish and eels in particular. <b>Pelamis</b> platurus has done especially well in captivity, accepting small fish, including goldfish. However, care has to be taken to house them in round or oval tanks, or in rectangular tanks with corners that are well-rounded, to prevent the snakes from damaging their snouts by swimming into the sides.|$|E
500|$|Funding for the UK's {{first wave}} farm was {{announced}} by the then Scottish Executive on 22 February 2007. It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four <b>Pelamis</b> machines {{at a cost of}} over £4 million. The funding is part of a new £13 million funding package for marine power projects in Scotland that will also support developments to Aquamarine's Oyster and Ocean Power Technologies' PowerBuoy wave systems, AWS Ocean Energy's sub-sea wave devices, ScotRenewables' 1.2 MW floating rotor device, Cleantechcom's tidal surge plans for the Churchill barriers between various Orkney islands, the Open Hydro tidal ring turbines, and further developments to the Wavegen system proposed for Lewis as well as a further £2.5 million for the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) based in Orkney. This is a Scottish Executive-backed research facility that has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a tidal power testing station on the nearby island of Eday. At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as [...] "the first {{of its kind in the}} world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility." ...|$|E

50|$|Developed by the {{now defunct}} Scottish company <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power (formerly Ocean Power Delivery), the <b>Pelamis</b> {{became the first}} {{offshore}} wave machine to generate electricity into the grid, {{when it was first}} connected to the UK grid in 2004. <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power then went on to build and test five additional <b>Pelamis</b> machines: three first-generation P1 machines, which were tested in a farm off the coast of Portugal in 2009, and two second-generation machines, the <b>Pelamis</b> P2, were tested off Orkney between 2010 and 2014. The company went into administration in November 2014, with the intellectual property transferred to the Scottish Government body Wave Energy Scotland.|$|E
50|$|In 1766, Linnaeus {{published}} the original {{description of the}} yellow-bellied sea snake, naming it Anguis platura (Anguis meaning snake). In 1803, Daudin created the new genus <b>Pelamis</b> and assigned this species to it, referring to it as <b>Pelamis</b> platuros. In 1842, Gray described {{what he thought was}} a new species and called it <b>Pelamis</b> ornata (subsequently P. ornata became a synonym of P. platura).|$|E
50|$|In 2010, <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power began {{tests of}} the first <b>Pelamis</b> P2 machine at the European Marine Energy Centre, Orkney, Scotland. The machine was owned by the German utility company, E.ON, and was the UK's first {{commercial}} supply contract in the marine energy sector. In March 2010 <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power announced a second order for a P2 machine, from ScottishPower Renewables, part of Iberdrola Renovables. This second machine was first installed at EMEC in May 2012. The two utility companies announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the P2 <b>Pelamis</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|Developed by the Scottish company <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power, the <b>Pelamis</b> {{machine is}} made up of {{connected}} sections which flex and bend relative to one another as waves run along the structure. This motion is resisted by hydraulic rams which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors which in turn drive electrical generators. The three machines which made up the Aguçadoura Wave Park were each rated at a peak output of 750 kW, giving an installed peak capacity of 2.25 MW, enough to meet the average electricity demand of more than 1,500 Portuguese homes. The average output from a <b>Pelamis</b> machine will depend on the wave resource in a particular area. The higher the resource the higher the average output. According to information on the <b>Pelamis</b> web site, it appears that the average power output for a <b>Pelamis</b> wave machine is about 150 kW.|$|E
50|$|The word <b>Pelamis</b> is a {{feminine}} noun and means young or small tunny fish. In 1872, Stoliczka introduced the name <b>Pelamis</b> platurus (still the most used scientific name by scientists today), but used the incorrect ending -us instead of -a which {{a feminine}} noun requires. A few recent examples exist of scientists' beginning {{to use the}} grammatically correct name <b>Pelamis</b> platura, e.g., Bohme 2003 and the Reptile Database with its page headed <b>Pelamis</b> platura (Linnaeus, 1766), which includes an extensive synonymy of the different scientific names which {{have been used for}} the yellow-bellied sea snake. The same rules apply for the most recent taxonomic name of Hydrophis platura.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power (PWP) {{installed}} its prototype <b>Pelamis</b> 750 {{device on}} site for full-scale testing in August 2004. This wave energy conversion machine {{was the first}} in the world to generate electricity into a grid system from offshore wave energy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pelamis</b> Wave Power {{designed}} and manufactured the <b>Pelamis</b> Wave Energy Converter - {{a technology that}} uses the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity. The company was established in 1998 and had offices and fabrication facilities in Leith Docks, Edinburgh, Scotland. It went into administration in November 2014.|$|E
