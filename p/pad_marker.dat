These waves reflect the dynamic conflict between the outgrowth of a succession of parasite antigenic variants and their control by the host immune system. Although a contributor to these dynamics is the density-dependent differentiation from proliferative “slender forms” to transmissible “stumpy forms,” an absence of markers discriminating stumpy forms has prevented accurate parameterization of this component. Here, we exploit the stumpy-specific <b>PAD</b> 1 <b>marker,</b> which functionally defines transmission competence, to quantitatively monitor stumpy formation during chronic infections. This allows reconstruction of the temporal events early in infection. Mathematical modeling of these data describes the parameters controlling trypanosome within-host dynamics and provides strong support for a quorum-sensing-like mechanism. Our data reveal the dominance of transmission stages throughout infection, a consequence being austere use of the parasite's antigen repertoire...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConclusiond-Dimer {{levels may}} be the most {{sensitive}} inflammatory or hemostatic marker in providing a serologic indication of the extent of lower extremity atherosclerosis. SummarySome components of the hemostatic system, including tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and prothrombin 1. 2, as well as d-dimer, are increased in patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) compared with patients without <b>PAD.</b> Inflammatory <b>markers</b> such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A have been less consistently associated with PAD. The authors correlated levels of these hemostatic and inflammatory markers with ankle-brachial index (ABI) in 370 subjects with an ABI less than 0. 9 and 231 subjects with an ABI of 0. 9 to 1. 50. In patients without a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease the ABI, in an unadjusted analysis, was inversely associated with log d-dimer (P <. 001), log C-reactive protein (P <. 001), log prothrombin 1. 2 (P =. 001), and log fibrinogen (P =. 005). At multivariable regression analysis, CRP was associated independently with ABI only in patients with a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease and not in patients without a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. d-Dimer, however, was associated independently with ABI in patients with a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease and also in patients without a history of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. CommentThe results demonstrate that d-dimer levels are associated with the extent of lower extremity PAD as measured by ABI. The data suggest that patients with more severe PAD, as reflected by ABI, have ongoing fibrinolysis and thrombosis that is reflected in higher d-dimer levels...|$|R

In patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) undergoing antihypertensive treatment, aortic pressures parameters, heart rate-adjusted augmentation index (AIx 75), and unadjusted AIx were determined. The (aortic) systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ between PAD patients who were taking β-blockers (n= 61) {{and those who were}} not taking β-blockers (n= 80). In patients taking β-blockers, augmentation pressure and pulse pressure were higher than in patients who did not take β-blockers (augmentation pressure, P=. 02; pulse pressure, P=. 005). AIx 75 was lower in PAD patients taking β-blockers than in patients not taking β-blockers (P=. 04), while the AIx did not differ between PAD patients taking and not taking β-blockers.

40|$|Aim: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (<b>PAD),</b> a <b>marker</b> of elevated vascular risk, {{is highly}} prevalent in general practice. We aimed to investigate patient characteristics and outcomes of PAD patients treated {{according to the}} guidelines versus those who were not. Methods: The Patient Care Evaluation-Peripheral Arterial Disease Study (PACE-PAD) was a multicenter, cluster randomized, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with PAD in primary care, who were followed up for death or vascular events over 18  months. Guideline orientation was assumed if patients received anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, exercise training, and (if applicable) advice for smoking cessation and therapy of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, respectively. Results: Of the 5, 099 PAD patients (mean age 68. 0 [*]±[*] 9. 0  years, 68. 5 % male subjects) who were followed up, 22. 5, 34. 6, 30. 1, 7. 8, and 3. 5 % (1. 5 % not specified) were in Fontaine stages I, IIa, IIb, III, and IV. Comprehensive guideline orientation was reported in 28. 4 % only; however, patients in lower Fontaine stages received guideline-oriented therapy more often (I: 30. 3 %, IIa: 31. 6 %, IIb: 29. 1 %, III: 9. 8 %, IV: 18. 0 %). During 18  months, 457 patients died (224 due to cerebrovascular or coronary deaths), 319 had unstable angina pectoris, 116 myocardial infarction, and 140 an ischemic stroke event. In total, 24 % of patients had experienced any vascular event (19. 1 % a first event). Event rates did not differ between patients treated according to guidelines {{and those who were}} not. Conclusion: The present PAD cohort was a high-risk sample with an unexpectedly high rate of deaths and vascular events. While physicians appear to focus on the treatment of individual risk factors, rates of comprehensive PAD management in line with guideline recommendations are still suboptimal. Factors contributing to the lacking difference between outcomes in the guideline-oriented and non-guideline-oriented groups may comprise low treatment intensity or other reasons for unsatisfactory effect of treatment, misclassification of events, and patient’s noncompliance with therapy...|$|R

Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was done during 2010 - 2011 in the surgical units of Khorramabad Shohada Hospital. Fifty patients who had symptoms of PAD undergoing CT angiography and biochemical markers for them were measured. The investigated variables were family history, site of arterial obstruction, underlying diseases, smoking history, physical activity and stress level. A control group was considered for the study. The comparison was made between these two groups. Results: Aging showed a significant role in prediction of PAD (70 % sensitivity and 64 % specificity). Homocysteine had the highest sensitivity (80 %) in prediction of PAD, compared with other biomarkers. CRP (74 % sensitivity) was the best marker that had positive predictive value for PAD. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) showed a significant role in prediction of true positive cases of PAD (72 % sensitivity and 74 % specificity). HbA 1 C with 68 % sensitivity and 64 % specificity and TG with 50 % sensitivity and 44 % specificity could be considered as factors related with PAD. Conclusion: The levels of C-Reacative protein, homocysteine, and FBS were correlated with PAD, HbA 1 C and TG levels were associated with PAD, but lower than the previously named markers. In this study a significant relationship between lipoprotein levels and PAD was also observed. PAD was associated with sex and age...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPeripheral {{arterial}} disease (<b>PAD)</b> is a <b>marker</b> {{of increased}} risk of cardiovascular events and of poor prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The prevalence of unknown PAD among patients with CAD varies between studies according to the mode of diagnosis. AimsTo evaluate the prevalence of unknown PAD, diagnosed using the ankle-brachial index (ABI), in patients from the IPSILON study with a CAD diagnosis; to assess the profile of these patients; and to determine predictors of PAD. MethodsIPSILON was an observational, cross-sectional study. General practitioners measured ABI in 5679 consecutive adults aged 55 years or over with signs or symptoms suggestive of PAD (21. 3 %), a history of an atherothrombotic event (42. 1 %) or two or more cardiovascular risk factors (36. 6 %). This analysis focuses on the subgroup of patients with CAD and no other known overt atherothrombotic disease. ResultsA total of 1340 patients presented with isolated CAD. PAD (ABI< 0. 90) was diagnosed in 26. 6 % of these patients; 16. 2 % were asymptomatic. Older age, symptoms suggestive of PAD and cardiovascular risk factors {{were found to be}} independent predictors of PAD in multivariable analysis. ConclusionOver 26 % of patients with CAD present with unknown PAD, as diagnosed using ABI measurement. More than half of these patients are asymptomatic. Screening for PAD in patients with CAD will allow detection of a subpopulation at particularly high cardiovascular risk.

However, their role in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is not well established and some of them, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), have not been examined before in prospective epidemiological studies. Methods and results In the Edinburgh Artery Study, we studied the development of PAD {{in the general population}} and evaluated 17 potential blood markers as predictors of incident PAD. At baseline (1987), 1519 men and women free of PAD aged 55 – 74 were recruited. After 17 years, 208 subjects had devel-oped symptomatic PAD. In analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors and baseline cardiovascular disease (CVD), only C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, lipoprotein (a), and haematocrit [hazard ratio (95 % CI) corresponding to an increase equal to the inter-tertile range 1. 30 (1. 08, 1. 56), 1. 16 (1. 05, 1. 17), 1. 22 (1. 04, 1. 44), 1. 22 (1. 08, 1. 38) ] were significantly (P, 0. 01) associated with <b>PAD.</b> However, these <b>markers</b> provided very little prognostic information for incident PAD to that obtained by cardio-vascular risk factors and the ankle brachial index.

40|$|Background: Peripheral Arterial Disease (<b>PAD)</b> is a <b>marker</b> of {{systemic}} atherosclerosis with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This study was undertaken {{to identify the}} prevalence of PAD in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome {{and do not have}} previous history of coronary artery disease in order to identify the missed opportunity in treating these patients and potentially avoiding such cardiovascular events. Methods: We prospectively collected data from consecutive patients who presented with acute coronary events over 4 months. PAD was diagnosed if the Ankle-Brachial index was less than 0. 90 and/or if the patient had signs or symptoms suggestive for PAD. Risk factors and risk reduction therapy were compared between patients with and without PAD. Results: A total of 51 patients were recruited. The mean age for these patients was 62 years and 27 % were women. Prevalence of PAD was 45 %, of these, 61 % were asymptomatic. Prevalence of PAD in patients with no previous history of CAD was 48 %, of these, 64 % were asymptomatic. There was no difference in atherosclerotic risk factors between patients with PAD compared to patients without PAD. Utilization of risk reduction was suboptimal in patients with PAD; only 61 % were on aspirin, 48 % were on statin therapy, 43 % were on beta-blockers and 30 % were on angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors.

40|$|Mohammed Al-OmranDepartment of Surgery, King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaBackground: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (<b>PAD)</b> is a <b>marker</b> {{of advanced}} atherosclerosis with an elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Although intensive risk reduction therapy {{is critical in}} reducing the adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with PAD, the awareness of this information among all physicians is felt to be low. Given the role of family physicians (FP), general internists (GI), cardiologists (C), and vascular surgeons (VS) in treating patients with PAD, we sought to determine their perceptions and knowledge of risk reduction therapy in these patients. Methods and results: We conducted a cross-sectional self-administered survey of 84 physicians who work at a major teaching hospital. FP, GI, C, and VS represent 39 %, 33 %, 16 %, and 12 % of the surveyed physicians, respectively. The recommended targets of LDL-cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure in PAD patients were known to 37. 3 %, 94. 1 % and 35. 3 % of physicians, respectively. The majority of physicians reported to screen for risk factors in PAD. Although 86. 3 % of physicians would recommend antiplatelets therapy in PAD, only 17. 6 % would recommend angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; 25. 5 % would recommend nicotine replacement therapy for smokers and 62. 7 % would recommend statins. Compared to other specialties, cardiologists had the lowest threshold, whereas GI had the highest threshold for initiating antiplatelets and statins for patients with PAD. Conclusion: The perceptions towards risk reduction in PAD identify glaring knowledge and action gaps. Effective strategies to encourage health professionals to use risk reduction therapy are needed.

Sites included tidal freshwater forests, moderately salt-impacted forests at the freshwater–oligohaline transition, highly salt-impacted forests, and oligohaline marshes. Sediment accretion {{was measured by}} use of feldspar <b>marker</b> <b>pads</b> for 2. 5 year; accessory information on wetland inunda-tion, canopy litterfall, herbaceous production, and soil char-acteristics were also collected. Sediment accretion ranged from 4. 5 mm year− 1 at moderately salt-impacted forest on the Savannah River to 19. 1 mm year− 1 at its relict, highly salt-impacted forest downstream. Oligohaline marsh sediment accretion was 1. 5 – 2. 5 times greater than in tidal freshwater forests. Overall, {{there was no significant}} difference in accre-tion rate between rivers with contrasting sediment loads. Accretion was significantly higher in hollows than on hum-mocks in tidal freshwater forests. Organic sediment accretion was similar to autochthonous litter production at all sites, but inorganic sediment constituted the majority of accretion at both marshes and the Savannah River highly salt-impacted forest. A strong correlation between inorganic sediment accumulation and autochthonous litter production indicated a positive feedback between herbaceous plant production and allochthonous sediment deposition. The similarity in rates of sediment accretion and sea level rise in tidal freshwater forests indicates that these habitats may become permanently inun-dated if the rate of sea level rise increases.

40|$|The article {{reviews the}} burden of {{peripheral}} artery disease (PAD) and its association with diabetes, renal dysfunction, inflammation, and anemia. <b>PAD</b> is a <b>marker</b> of advanced atherosclerotic disease and {{is associated with a}} poor quality of life, ischemic events, and mortality. Polyvascular involvement is often observed in PAD patients (pts), and contributes to the greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Diabetes is a major risk factor for PAD, and the presence of PAD in diabetic pts is associated with unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes. In comparison to nondiabetic PAD pts, diabetic pts often have severe forms of PAD such as foot ulcers and gangrene, and more often have involvement of the distal extremities. Diabetes is often accompanied by anemia, particularly in the presence of impaired renal function. Chronic kidney disease and PAD share some common risk factors and frequently coexist. In PAD pts, renal dysfunction has been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality. Anemia is quite prevalent in PAD pts, especially in those with critical limb ischemia. The severity of anemia has been identified as an independent predictor of limb loss and mortality. C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the development of PAD and diabetes. Increased levels of CRP in diabetic pts intensify the risk for PAD development. Data regarding the prognostic role of CRP in PAD pts suggest that CRP is a better prognostic marker for short-term rather than long-term mortality. Considering the close relationship between diabetes, renal dysfunction, inflammation, and anemia in PAD pts, a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to improve quality of life and prevent ischemic events and fatal outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{increases the}} risk for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) early in life and the disease is likely to progress to advanced stages. Mechanisms responsible for premature PAD in diabetes are partly unknown. Leg ischaemia from PAD, together with other diabetic complications, is the key player in the pathway from ulceration to gangrene and infection, which ultimately results in major amputation. Infrainguinal bypass surgery (IBS) is carried out to restore leg perfusion and avoid amputations. Whether outcomes for this procedure are less favourable in patients with diabetes than in patients without diabetes is unclear. Aims: ‒To explore the impact of hyperglycaemia on outcome after IBS in patients with diabetes. ‒To assess amputation-free survival (AFS) after IBS for critical limb ischaemia. ‒To assess amputation-free survival (AFS) in patients with diabetes but without PAD during long term follow up. ‒To investigate if receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and advanced glycation end products (AGE) are increased in plasma and vein grafts in diabetes patients. ‒To investigate if the AGE-RAGE system predicts AFS and development of PAD, {{and if it is}} associated with AFS after IBS in patients with diabetes. Results: In Paper I, we demonstrated an association between hyperglycaemia the first 48 hours after IBS and increased risk for wound complications, graft occlusion and amputation or death during the first 3 months in 91 patients with diabetes. Patients in the highest quartile of glucose exposure had an odds ratio of 13 ‒ 14 in multivariate logistic regression. In Paper II, we performed a nationwide, population-based cohort study and compared postoperative AFS in patients with and without diabetes. The analysis included data for 1 840 patients from the Swedish Vascular Registry who, during 2001 – 2003, underwent their first unilateral, below-knee, IBS procedure for critical limb ischaemia. Of these patients, 742 had diabetes and 1, 098 did not. Patients were followed up until the end of 2005. Overall, 446 and 558 patients with and without diabetes, respectively, had undergone ipsilateral amputation or died {{by the end of the}} follow-up period. Patients with diabetes had a shorter AFS than patients without diabetes (2. 3 years, 95 % CI 1. 9 – 2. 8 years versus 3. 4 years, 95 % CI 3. 1 – 3. 7 years). The hazard ratio and incidence for ipsilateral amputation or death in patients with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, smoking and other confounding variables, was 1. 46 (95 % CI 1. 26 – 1. 69) and 30. 2 events per 100 person-years respectively. The incidence of amputation or death was 2. 8 per 100 person-years, (95 % CI 2. 0 to 3. 7) in the cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes who were free from PAD at start of follow up. In Paper III and IV we showed that S 100 A 12, a ligand to RAGE, is associated with AFS after IBS in patients with (n= 38) and without (n= 30) diabetes, and with AFS as well as development of PAD in a prospective longitudinal (10 -year) population-based cohort (n= 146) of patients with type 2 diabetes, free from signs of PAD at inclusion. Presence of AGE, RAGE and S 100 A 12 were demonstrated in saphenous vein tissue with no difference between patients with and without diabetes. Conclusions: Postoperative hyperglycaemia is associated with unfavourable outcome after IBS in patients with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with lower AFS after IBS for critical limb ischaemia. Plasma levels of S 100 A 12 and RAGE components are elevated in <b>PAD</b> disease and <b>markers</b> of RAGE and its ligands are found in vein tissue used for bypass. This is consistent with a role for S 100 A 12 in PAD complications by activation of the RAGE system. Higher plasma levels of S 100 A 12 and the combined effect of RAGE components seem to be associated with AFS in patients with diabetes. Further study is needed to find methods of reducing this excess risk and prolonging AFS...|$|R
