40|$|International audienceWinter wheat is {{one kind}} of {{important}} crop in China. It’s <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> is one key element to explain yield change. To obtain winter wheat <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> {{as soon as possible}} can provide scientific reference for our country’s making related policy. Basing on the cropping system in Shandong province, winter wheat is divided into two kinds “winter wheat sowed by machine-maize” and “people broadcast winter wheat-rice”. Using MODIS data, NDVI characters of winter wheat, garlic, greenhouse vegetable, from sowing till overwintering stage were analyzed. Together with NDVI characters of former stubble crops in middle September, extracting requirements were set up for winter wheat <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> which was sowed by machine this year. In view of the spectrum similarity between rice wheat and greenhouse vegetable from sowing stage till overwintering stage, rice wheat <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> of former year was extracted relying on the character of biomass rapid growth at jointing stage. Because of the “people broadcast winter wheat-rice” cropping system is very fixed in Shandong province, then the rice wheat <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> of former year can take the place of the rice wheat <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> this year. Two kinds of winter wheat area were merged, and tested by 284 groups of located spots data, the accuracy reached 94. 01 %. The result showed that it is feasible to extract winter wheat area before overwintering stage, and the time is 4 months earlier than using jointing stage NDVI...|$|R

40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} grain crops in Northeast China (NEC) and its cultivation is sensitive to climate change. This study aimed to explore the spatio-temporal changes in the NEC rice <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> over the period of 1980 - 2010 and to analyze their relationship to climate change. To do so, the CLUE-S (conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent) model was first updated and used to simulate dynamic changes in the rice <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> in NEC to understand spatio-temporal change trends during three periods: 1980 - 1990, 1990 - 2000 and 2000 - 2010. The changing results in individual periods were then linked to climatic variables to investigate the climatic drivers of these changes. Results showed that the NEC rice <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> expanded quickly and increased by nearly 4. 5 times during 1980 - 2010. The concentration of newly <b>planted</b> rice <b>areas</b> in NEC constantly moved northward and the changes were strongly dependent on latitude. This confirmed that climate change, increases in temperature in particular, greatly influenced the shift in the rice <b>planting</b> <b>area.</b> The shift in the north limit of the NEC rice <b>planting</b> <b>area</b> generally followed a 1 °C isoline migration pattern, but with an obvious time-lag effect. These findings can help policy makers and crop producers take proper adaptation measures even when exposed to the global warming situation in NEC. © 2014 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences...|$|R
