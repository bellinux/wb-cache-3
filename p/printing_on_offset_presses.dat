The {{characteristics of the}} new model were analyzed {{and the prospect of}} the Clapper-Yule mode was discussed. We proposed a new model, which was an enhancement of the classical Clapper-Yule model, which simulate optical dot gain of halftone prints by taking into account lateral scattering within the paper bulk and multiple internal reflections. The model we propose also takes into account the reflectance of inks at surface of the specific colors at specific rates. The model opens the way towards color separation of images to be reproduced. Several designs <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> an <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> demonstrate their applicability and their benefits...|$|R

40|$|Reproducing color {{images with}} {{embedded}} metallic patterns By combining a metallic ink and standard inks, one may create printed images having a dynamic appearance: an image viewed under specular reflection may be considerably {{different from the}} same image viewed under non-specular reflection. Patterns which are either dark or hidden become highlighted under specular reflection, yielding interesting visual effects. To create such images, one {{needs to be able}} to reproduce at non-specular reflection angles the same colors, by standard inks alone or in combination with a metallic ink. Accurate color prediction models need to be established which model the underlying physical phenomena in a consistent manner. To meet this challenge, we propose two models, one for predicting the reflection spectra of standard inks on coated paper and one for predicting the reflection spectra of a combination of standard inks and a metallic ink. They are enhancements of the classical Clapper-Yule model which models optical dot gain of halftone prints by taking into account lateral scattering within the paper bulk and multiple internal reflections. The models we propose also take into account physical dot gain and ink spreading for standard inks as well as the low reflectance of metallic inks at nonspecular reflection angles and the poor adherence of standard inks <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> top of a metallic ink (trapping effect). These models open the way towards color separation of images to be reproduced by combining a metallic ink and standard inks.

During {{the course of the year}} the newspaper stopped publishing to avoid going into debt and a relaunch was scheduled for the start of the Autumn term with a shift towards a free distribution model. This shift resulted in a wholesale change in how the newspaper was produced. For the first time the newspaper was <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> a web <b>offset</b> <b>press,</b> full colour printing was available and the newspaper was fully produced on computers not old fashioned light boxes. The initial circulation after the relaunch was around 5,000 copies distributed through cardboard stands around the various university campuses.

It also introduces a new medium for the creation and production of these works which was developed during this study. This investigation has been accomplished in the following ways: First, answers were sought to ten questions the author believed any artist considering the use of a rotary <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> as a means of producing these works would want to know. The answers were obtained through direct experimentation with a variety of plates which were processed by different procedures and then <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> a rotary <b>offset</b> <b>press.</b> The author concludes {{on the basis of this}} experimentation that when the artist 2 ̆ 7 s intentions for a specific work coincide with the capabilities of this production process as described in the answers, then this process can be considered aesthetically viable. Second, five-hundred copies of a sixteen page artists book were produced by the author to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this production process for a specific work. The results indicated that a substantial saving in labor, time, and expense was obtained when this process was employed. There were also substantial savings to the integrity of the work. The author concludes that this process is aesthetically and economically viable for the production of this type of artists book. Third, a survey of commercial printers was undertaken to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this process in cases where the artist does not have access to a suitable <b>offset</b> <b>press.</b> All the people interviewed indicated that their firms would be willing to accept for production plates imaged and processed by the artists. They also indicated that they would be willing to meet the artist 2 ̆ 7 s specifications for the work when these were obtainable, and that the total cost would be based principally on the hourly rate for the specific press being used. On the basis of these and other results of this survey, the author concludes that the production of original fine art prints and artists books by commercial lithographers can be aesthetically and economically viable for the production of certain works. Fourth, people professionally involved in the creation, printing, publishing, selling and collecting of these works were surveyed to assess their usage, awareness, and attitudes regarding their <b>offset</b> <b>press</b> production. The response data to one question in the survey allowed calculations to be made of the acceptability of this process to the total population of the types of people surveyed. As a result of these calculations, conclusions were made that seventy-six percent believe this process is acceptable for the production of original fine art prints. Similarly, one-hundred percent believe it is acceptable for the production of artists books. And fifth, the origins, principles, processing procedures, advantages, and disadvantages of a new medium for the creation and production of original prints and artists books are presented. This medium utilizes direct imaging techniques and light sensitive coated lithographic plates. It is presented for the first time in this study. Any artist wishing to learn about this new medium and any artist considering rotary offset production of original fine art prints or artists books, will find much useful in formation in this study. A portfolio of thirty prints accompanies this study to provide the reader with a firsthand view of the results of the experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{newspapers}} have been compelled {{to introduce a}} lot more process color to their pages. This coincides {{with the introduction of}} USA Today, but also with the fact that all forms of media, including television and magazines, have become significantly more colorful. There is considerable market pressure on newspapers to be colorful, as well. Continued audience interest and advertising dollars are at stake. This is not a trivial issue. At the same time, newspapers are being admonished to make sure that, if they do introduce color to their pages, then it should be of high quality. Low quality color is worse than no color at all. During most of this period, traditional, high end scanners comprised the only reasonable option available to address the task of generating color separation films. In recent years, with the improvement of microcomputer based technology, desktop scanning systems have become an option. The quality of the output of these systems has been suspect, however. On the other hand, it is generally acknowledged that these systems are improving. Of all the forms of lithographic printing, newspaper <b>printing</b> (coldset <b>offset</b> lithography <b>on</b> newsprint) is least {{able to take advantage of}} all the data that the upstream processes, particularly the color separation process, can provide. It represents the lowest level of reproduction fidelity. It has a shorter density range, requires a lower screening frequency, and is restricted to a more limited color gamut, for example, than the other forms of lithographic printing. This is due primarily to the substrate, newsprint, but also in part to news inks. Is it possible that today 2 ̆ 7 s desktop scanners now provide output whose quality level is sufficient for this printing process? Would readers show no preference for reproductions made from separations generated by these systems over those made from separations generated by high end scanning systems? That is the fundamental question addressed in this thesis. A common set of transparencies were separated through a high end system and a desktop system. Care was taken to prevent either system from being disadvantaged through parameter settings. The separations from both systems were stripped into a common test form, and <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> an <b>offset</b> newspaper <b>press.</b> Judges evaluated the pairs of images in a paired comparison test, indicating a preference for the high end generated image or the desktop generated image. The results indicate that readers do indeed continue to show a clear preference for images generated on a high end scanner. The reader is requested to take note of two caveats. First, this test represents a comparison of two scanning systems, not two families of scanners. The author found the two best scanners from each family that were available to him at the time of the test. The reader applies the findings of this test to the families of scanners that these two scanners represent at his or her own peril. Second, the reader is admonished to recognize that these are times of rapidly changing technology. The results of an experiment such as this could change as the technology advances...|$|R
