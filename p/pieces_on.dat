5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> {{the table in front}} of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E

White is ready to return the e5-pawn {{in order to develop}} his <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1–h8 diagonal for the Bc1.|$|E
5|$|The First World War Ottoman Turkish Army {{was badly}} underestimated by the Allies. During the war it would defeat {{forces from the}} British, French and Russian armies. Before the {{landings}} Gallipoli was defended by several divisions, based on infantry battalion strong-points overlooking potential landing beaches. By April 1915, the Turks had 82 fixed and 230 mobile artillery <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E

5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E
5|$|Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial, {{on display}} from February to September 2011, {{includes}} over 70 large-scale artworks {{and is the}} largest assemblage of Thornton Dial's work ever mounted. The exhibition contextualizes Dial as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk artist or outsider artist as many have portrayed him in the past. The <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> view in Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

5|$|Hubbard wrote all of {{the music}} for the album, with {{contributors}} utilizing instruments including synthesizers, bass, woodwinds, strings, and a bouzouki. She plays piano on the album. Most of the <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the album are of three to four minutes in duration. Wayne Isaak served as the Waterhouse Records publicist for the album. In publicity for the album, marketing compared Hubbard's musical writing style to that of Erik Satie. The album cover was marketed with a sticker on the outside wrapping advertising {{the fact that it}} was endorsed by Stanley Clarke.|$|E
5|$|In the Adler {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White {{has moved}} f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn {{on an open}} file. Black can then apply pressure on the e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram at right). The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.|$|E
5|$|Jade has {{a unique}} place in Chinese culture. The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the {{imperial}} collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artefacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty <b>pieces,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.|$|E

5|$|People of {{all ages}} played board games pitting two players against each other, {{including}} latrunculi ("Raiders"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta ("Twelve Marks"), involving dice and arranging <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> a grid of letters or words. A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus). Playing with dice {{as a form of}} gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the December festival of the Saturnalia with its carnival, norms-overturned atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} fire rapidly increased, when enemy {{vehicles}} {{could be seen}} moving towards the villa from the nearby woods; this in particular worried Frost, as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work, giving him no means of communication with his other detachments, including 'Nelson' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach. Fortunately for the British, Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment, placing the <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> specially designed trolleys.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1933 press release, {{from the}} {{beginning}} Poedjangga Baroe was meant to include various types of literary works, including fictional prose, poetry (in both modern and traditional forms), non-fiction literary reviews and critiques, research, and opinion <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> language and literature. The original run of Poedjangga Baroe published more than 300 poems and, in special editions, several poetry anthologies; although prose was less prominent, Poedjangga Baroe published five dramas, one novel, and several short stories. Along with individual scholarly articles, the magazine also published special editions dedicated to collections of essays on the Indonesian emancipation figure Kartini and the Bengali literary figure Rabindranath Tagore; the latter was published {{on the occasion of}} Tagore's death.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} <b>pieces</b> <b>on</b> a narrow front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, {{the forces of}} Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it.|$|E
