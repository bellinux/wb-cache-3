50|$|Die {{and punch}} shapes affect the force during the <b>punching</b> <b>process.</b> The punch force {{increases}} {{during the process}} as the entire thickness of the material is sheared at once. A beveled punch helps in the shearing of thicker materials by reducing the force {{at the beginning of}} the stroke. However, beveling a punch will disort the shape because of lateral forces that develop. Compound dies allow multiple shaping to occur. Using compound dies will generally slow down the process and are typically more expensive than other dies. Progressive dies may be used in high production operations.

40|$|In recent years, Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) {{have been}} used for the {{lightweight}} structural design and manufacturing in automotive industry. This class of sheet metals are prone to edge fracture during stamping production, and the fracture often occurs at much lower strain than that predicted based on the forming limit curves. The uncertainty in predicting edge fracture represents a great challenge in the application of AHSS. This dissertation is focused on the better understanding of edge fracture phenomenon through experimental observation and computer modeling with the consideration of microstructure effect. In this dissertation, Hole Expansion (HE) test was used to investigate the mechanisms of edge fracture of two AHSS, Dual Phase DP 780 and DP 980. The HE test includes two processing steps: hole punching and hole expanding. The <b>punching</b> <b>process</b> creates holes of various sheared edge morphologies, which are the input to the hole expanding process, along with the intrinsic property of material, produce a joint effect on the crack initiation and propagation on the sheared edges during HE test. The hole <b>punching</b> <b>process</b> was first investigated. The sheared edges were analyzed with image processing, and the relative heights of sheared four edge zones were measured, which were used to determine the strain distributions of sheared edges. The <b>punching</b> <b>process</b> was further simulated with FEA, and referenced with the experimental observations. Fracture mechanism of hole <b>punching</b> <b>process</b> was deduced. The process of crack initiation and propagation in hole expanding process was studied the next. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe cracks on the sheared edges. FEA simulation was applied to investigate the effect of sheared edge geometry on the stress evolution in the hole expanding process. The interaction of two neighboring parallel cracks in the crack propagation process was analyzed to explain the effect of crack population on the main crack propagation. To investigate the microstructure effect on the edge fracture, the dual phase grain structure and its effect on mechanical properties and fracture behavior of DP steels were analyzed. Based on HE test results and observed DP steel grain structures, a criterion to predict edge fracture was proposed. This criterion includes mesoscale grain structure features of DP steels, and it can be applied to predict the HE test results of DP steels. The heterogeneous microstructures of DP steels were built into the Representative Volume Element (RVE) models to study the effects of microstructure parameters and fracture mechanisms on macroscale mechanical properties of DP steels, with damage based failure criteria applied to constituent ferritic and martensitic phases...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} optimal clearance design of micro-punching die by abductive network and SA method. Design/methodology/approach: The punching data (input) and wear size (output) were collected for a training database. In order to select proper clearance to evaluate the wear of die, the abductive network was used to establish an efficient relationship between input parameters and output result. This can help to predict wear size under any degree of clearance and hence to replace worn punches and dies at the right time. A simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithm with a performance index is then applied to the neural network for searching the optimal clearance parameters, and obtains rather satisfactory result as compared with the corresponding experiment verification. Findings: This study aims to identify the relationship between clearance and service life of micro punches using the Neural Network, and to find relational data involving the service life of punches and punching parameters in non-metal blanking processes. The result can be used to estimate optimal clearance between punch and die for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the practical <b>punching</b> <b>processes</b> with different <b>punching</b> conditions were carried out for a set of training data. A trained model exhibited a relationship between service life and clearance of micro punch and die through an abductive network system. The predicted value of wear by abductive network is very close to the actual experimental value, with an error of less than 8 %. This result satisfies the required standard for IC factory production. Originality/value: A good clearance design not only increases the quality of product manufactured, but also reduces product’s burr. As a result, the wear of punches and dies can be greatly reduced and the life expectancy of punching dies increased...|$|R
