50|$|As special civil servants, JSDF {{personnel}} are paid according to civilian pay scales {{that do not}} always discriminate between ranks. At times, JSDF salaries are greater for subordinates than for commanding officers; senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) with long service can earn more than newly promoted colonels. Pay raises {{are not included in}} Defense Agency budgets and cannot be established by military planners. Retirement ages for officers below general/flag rank range from fifty-three to fifty-five years, and from fifty to fifty-three for enlisted personnel. Limits are sometimes extended because of personnel shortages. In the late 1980s, the Defense Agency, concerned about the difficulty of finding appropriate <b>post</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>employment</b> for these early retirees, began providing vocational training for enlisted personnel about to retire and transferring them to units close to the place where they intend to retire. Beginning in October 1987, the Self-Defense Forces Job Placement Association provided free job placement and reemployment support for retired JSDF personnel. Retirees also receive pensions immediately upon retirement, some ten years earlier than most civil service personnel. Financing the retirement system promises to be a problem of increasing scope in the 1990s, with the aging of the population.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{structure}} and trends {{of the labor market}} in China in the economic transition. Based on two large-scale repeated surveys, we cover a variety of rarely explored issues related to the labor market in China. These issues include labor market participation and various employment such as second jobs and <b>post</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>employment,</b> labor supply issues like working hours, work efforts, and wages, and also issues related to jobs, such as job matching mechanisms, job turnover, and job training. Lastly, we also investigate unemployment and layoffs. We find that the market system is playing an increasing role in the labor market, but state-owned sector is the least market oriented in labor demand and supply system. Further reforms are needed in order to move toward a higher degree of labor market. This study provides a fairly complete picture of the Chinese labor market and should be important for further researches in this area...|$|E
