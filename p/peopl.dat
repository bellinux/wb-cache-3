The Lanjo river was their source of water for the {{agricultural}} and domestic uses. Lanjwani people due to tribe fight moved toward Dera Gazi Khan, Layyah, Bhakkar, Rajapur, Khanpur, Rahim Yar khan, Bahawalpur in Punjab, all districts in Sindh, and Dera Bugati, Jafar abad, Nasir Abad, Sibi districts in Balochistan, Pakistan. Might be some lanjwani <b>peopl</b> migrated to Africa, now-days many Lanjwani people are living in Zimbabwe country in Africa and intermarried with local people, and their descendants are called Langwani. Might be hundreds year ago Lanjwani people migrated to Europe and America along as a Sinti (Sindhi) and other Indian Sub- continent tribes (Gypsies). In Erupe and Americas lot of families using tribes name Lanjoni and Langoni, very close to Lanjwani and Langwani.

40|$|Early voting is a form a convenience voting in the United States that began as a reform to avoid long lines at the polls and to increase turnout. Unfortunately,  the {{empirical}} studies looking at early voting and other forms of convenience voting indicate that,  if anything,  these reforms have a negative impact on voting turnout. This is because people who want to vote will vote. A marginal reduction in the cost of voting does not inspire thousands of would‐be non‐voters to cast a ballot. Moreover,  early voting diminishes the effect of Election Day as a civic event,  which causes some folks who intend on voting to procrastinate so long that they forget to vote altogether. The usefulness of Professor Smith’s report is limited by several problems. First,  his analysis was done assuming the last Sunday and Monday before the election would not be early voting days. To what extent would his results change after taking into account these two early voting days?   The report suffers a fundamental logical flaw  –  eliminating some early voting days does not mean that all the voters that cast a ballot on those days will not vote.
