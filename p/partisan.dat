5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the <b>Partisan</b> General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač <b>Partisan</b> Detachment was the only <b>Partisan</b> or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E
5|$|Both the <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters and the <b>Partisan</b> General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina {{were based}} {{in the area of}} operations, with Tito's Supreme Headquarters {{directly}} controlling the 1st Proletarian Brigade, and the General Staff, commanded by Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, controlling the <b>Partisan</b> detachments in East Bosnia under the overall direction of the Supreme Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|More pro-Chetnik coups {{occurred}} {{in the second half}} of April. The first was in one of the remaining battalions of the Romanija <b>Partisan</b> Detachment, followed by all three battalions of the Zvijezda <b>Partisan</b> Detachment. The political commissars of every company were killed. By the start of May, coups had also {{occurred in}} battalions of the Kalinovik <b>Partisan</b> Detachment and the Foča Volunteer Detachment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, Yugoslav <b>Partisans</b> in Croatia did not have support of Croats. The {{majority}} of <b>partisans</b> on the territory of Croatia were Croatian Serbs. However, in 1943 Croats started to join <b>partisans</b> in larger numbers. On the territory of the Independent State of Croatia, 75-80% of <b>partisans</b> were ethnic Serbs. In 1943, number of Croat <b>partisans</b> in Croatia increased, so in 1944 they composed 61% of <b>partisans</b> on the territory of Croatia, while Serbs made 28%.|$|R
50|$|On 22 December 1941 {{forces of}} Muslim militia from Hisardžik, {{commanded}} by Pačariz, and from Sjenica successfully repelled the attack of <b>Partisans</b> {{who tried to}} capture Sjenica. In this battle 18 <b>Partisans</b> were captured. Pačariz occasionally visited them in Sjenica prison. In February 1942 Pačariz was engaged by the command of Italian forces in Prijepolje to go to Sjenica and escort 18 <b>Partisans</b> who were captured on 22 December 1941. Italians intended to exchange captured <b>Partisans</b> for captured Italians. He escorted 13 <b>Partisans</b> to Prijepolje, leaving 5 wounded <b>Partisans</b> in Sjenica. All <b>Partisans</b> Pačariz brought to Italians were shot in Purića stream, below Srijetež.|$|R
50|$|As the Albanian <b>partisans</b> and Yugoslav <b>partisans</b> were on {{the rise}} and the Germans {{reducing}} its aid to the Balli Kombëtar, Shehu was gradually losing his territory to the <b>partisans.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with the <b>Partisan</b> 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the <b>Partisan</b> force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other <b>Partisan</b> forces withdrew {{in the direction of}} Goražde.|$|E
5|$|A {{resistance}} movement soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak <b>Partisan</b> Detachment was formed near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by a {{resistance movement}} in occupied Europe. This sparked {{the beginning of the}} Yugoslav <b>Partisan</b> movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E

50|$|The Estonian <b>partisans</b> was a {{military}} group that took up arms first against the Nazis and later against the Soviets. The Estonian <b>partisans</b> were not only ethnic Estonians, but also Ingrians, Latvians, Russians, and Jews. During World War II, the Estonian <b>partisans</b> fought against the German, and Soviet forces. After the Second World War, Estonian <b>partisans</b> took actions directed against Soviet rule within Estonia. Many members of the Estonian <b>partisans</b> saw themselves as the armed wing of the Estonian people in its struggle for Estonian independence.|$|R

5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, mopping up and repelling local <b>Partisan</b> attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the <b>Partisan</b> 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more <b>Partisan</b> positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Trio and {{the joint}} Italian-Chetnik offensive, the Partisans formed three more Proletarian Brigades, {{consisting}} mainly of Montenegrins. Operation Trio contributed to {{the decision of the}} <b>Partisan</b> Supreme Headquarters to withdraw to western Bosnia in the <b>Partisan</b> Long March, which commenced in late June 1942.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other <b>Partisan</b> organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all <b>Partisan</b> organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to <b>Partisan</b> control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including <b>Partisan</b> resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
50|$|The Allies may build <b>partisans,</b> forcing Germany to {{garrison}} Belgrade and Athens {{to prevent}} BRP loss. <b>Partisans</b> {{may also be}} built in the USSR or France. A common house rule was to allow <b>partisans</b> in Poland to represent the Warsaw Uprising.|$|R
5000|$|The eunuchs {{were not}} content with just {{removing}} the <b>partisans</b> from government. In 169, they persuaded the 13-year-old Emperor Ling that the <b>partisans</b> were intent on rebellion. [...] The leading <b>partisans,</b> including Li, Du, Fan Pang (范滂), were arrested and executed. Overall, about 100 people lost their lives. Many <b>partisans</b> hid, {{with the assistance of}} an underground network who largely renamed anonymous even later, but included such eventually-important figures as Yuan Shao and Kong Rong. The <b>partisans</b> who were not on the arrest rolls had their liberties further restricted.|$|R
50|$|According {{to a book}} {{published}} in 1955 by an Italian ministerial committee on the tenth anniversary of the Liberation, casualties in Italy among the Resistance movement amounted to 35,828 <b>partisans</b> killed in action or executed, and 21,168 <b>partisans</b> mutilated or left disabled by their wounds. Another 32,000 Italian <b>partisans</b> had been killed abroad (in the Balkans and, to a lesser extent, in France). 9,980 Italian civilians {{had been killed in}} reprisals by the German and Fascist forces. In 2010, the Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro of the Italian Ministry of Defence recorded 15,197 <b>partisans</b> killed; however, the Ufficio dell'Albo d'Oro only considered as <b>partisans</b> the members of the Resistance who were civilians before joining the <b>partisans,</b> whereas <b>partisans</b> who were formerly members of the Italian armed forces (more than half those killed) were considered as members of their armed force of origin.|$|R
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged <b>partisan</b> activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in <b>partisan</b> fighting.|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{became a}} <b>Partisan</b> in February 1943, joining {{the newly formed}} 10th Krajina Brigade. With the brigade, she fought in the Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika and Livno areas {{and served as a}} nurse. In September 1943, Bursać was wounded in the leg while {{throwing}} hand grenades during an attack on the German base at Prkosi in northwestern Bosnia. As she was being transported to a field hospital at Vidovo Selo, she sang <b>Partisan</b> songs. Bursać's wound soon developed gangrene, and she died at the hospital on 23September 1943. She was proclaimed a People's Hero of Yugoslavia the following month. Schools, streets and organisations were named in her memory following the war, commemorating her service to the <b>Partisan</b> cause.|$|E
5|$|I/28 {{captured}} Vlasenica on 28 April, but {{was almost}} immediately attacked {{from the east}} by two <b>Partisan</b> divisions. A third <b>Partisan</b> division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at Šekovići, 30kilometres north-west of Vlasenica. Both II/28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica, where II/28 relieved the battered I/28 and then surrounded Šekovići. After a 48-hour battle, during which II/28 was decimated, the town was taken.|$|E
50|$|More recent {{publications}} {{have cast}} {{the events in}} a different light, stating that the <b>Partisans</b> selected Dražgoše as a scene to challenge the German forces. The villagers asked the <b>Partisans</b> forces to leave the village, but they refused; then, when the German forces attacked, the <b>Partisans</b> fled. According to Corsellis and Ferrar, the <b>Partisans</b> believed that uprisings {{such as the one}} at Dražgoše and the resulting reprisals turned the population against the Germans. The Catholic populace considered that the <b>Partisans</b> staged such uprisings in or near Catholic villages deliberately so that Catholics would be targeted by reprisals.|$|R
5000|$|War {{broke out}} between <b>Partisans</b> and Chetniks {{during the first}} half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin <b>Partisans</b> went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav <b>Partisans.</b> Fighting between <b>Partisans</b> and Chetniks {{continued}} through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of [...] "anti-communist militia" [...] and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to Mostar, where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the <b>Partisans,</b> but were dealt a heavy defeat.|$|R
50|$|The {{estimates}} of the number of Slovene <b>Partisans</b> differ. Despite solid support among Slovenes, the numbers of Slovene <b>Partisans</b> was quite small and increased only in the latter stages of the war. There were no more than 700-800 Slovene <b>Partisans</b> in August 1941, about 2000 in the end of 1941, 5,500 in September 1943, at the time of the capitulation of Italy. According to Slovene Historical Atlas, published in 2011, in summer 1942 there were 5,300 Slovene <b>partisans</b> and 400 members of the Home Guard, a year after in summer 1943 there was unchanged number, i.e. 5,300 Slovene <b>partisans,</b> but the number of members of the Home Guard increased to 6,000, also there were 200 members of the Slovene Chetniks, in autumn 1943 (after the capitulation of Italian army) there were 20,000 Slovene <b>partisans,</b> 3,000 members of the Home Guard and no Slovene Chetniks left, while in summer 1944 there were 30,000 Slovene <b>partisans,</b> 17,000 members of the Home Guard and 500 members of the Slovene Chetniks, and in winter 1945 the number of Slovene <b>partisans</b> increased to 34,000, while the number of members of the Home Guard and members of the Slovene Chetniks was unchanged.In December 1944, there were 38,000 Slovene <b>Partisans,</b> which was the peak number.|$|R
5|$|In the Podrinje region, {{encompassing}} the Drina basin, a <b>Partisan</b> {{district committee}} had been formed on 29 June, {{to oversee the}} local uprising and form <b>Partisan</b> detachments. After collecting weapons and ammunition, the detachment's first action was to attack the gendarmerie station in Bogatić on 7 August, disarming the gendarmes and capturing more weapons. Due to {{the scope of the}} local uprising, on 9 August the detachment was renamed the Podrinje <b>Partisan</b> Detachment. They disarmed the re-equipped gendarme platoon at Bogatić on 10 August, and then carried out the destruction of town archives, telephone lines and bridges in the district. By 14 August, the detachment's ranks had swelled to about 360 fighters in six companies, the occupation forces and local collaborators were finding it difficult to use the road from the district centre Šabac to Loznica due to <b>Partisan</b> ambushes, and the railway line between the two towns was out of action.|$|E

5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation <b>Partisan</b> Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic <b>Partisan</b> unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the <b>Partisan</b> forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the General Staff. On that basis, the existing <b>Partisan</b> units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation <b>Partisan</b> Detachments of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September, II/27 was {{assaulted}} unsuccessfully by the Partisans at Matkovac. After {{the first}} week of September, most of the division's fighting power was shifted to the western boundary of the security zone to meet <b>Partisan</b> incursions. The division succeeded in dislodging <b>Partisan</b> units from Slatna and Međeđa and allied Chetniks captured Skurgić. After relief by NDH forces, the division's fighting regiments withdrew to Brčko for rest and refit. As a result of the shift to the western area of the security zone, the zone's southern area was quickly overrun by <b>Partisan</b> forces. Zvornik and Tuzla had fallen by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|On 8–9 May 1942, another pro-Chetnik coup {{occurred}} in the recently created Zenica <b>Partisan</b> Detachment, and about 30 communists and their supporters were killed. About 100 remaining <b>Partisan</b> fighters from the Ozren and Zenica detachments were incorporated into the 3rd East Bosnian Shock Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Operation Maibaum had {{not only}} stopped the <b>Partisan</b> 3rd Corps from {{crossing}} the Drina into Serbia, it had scattered the <b>Partisan</b> formation. On 6 May, V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division {{to return to the}} security zone north of the Spreča.|$|E
50|$|Many violent episodes followed, {{sometimes}} pitting fascists against fascists and <b>partisans</b> against <b>partisans.</b> Well {{known among}} {{these is the}} Porzûs massacre. Communist <b>partisans</b> of the division Natisone (the SAP brigade 13 martiri di Feletto), attached to the Yugoslavian XI Corpus by orders of Togliatti, after reaching the command {{of one of the}} many Osoppo Brigades, massacred 20 <b>partisans</b> and a woman, claiming that they were German spies.

50|$|The Belgian Army of <b>Partisans</b> (Armée belge des <b>partisans),</b> {{better known}} as the Armed <b>Partisans</b> (<b>Partisans</b> Armés) or PA was a group of the Belgian {{resistance}} during World War II and affiliated to the Belgian Communist Party.

50|$|This {{caused the}} Italian fascist {{authorities}} {{to organize a}} brutal offensive against the <b>Partisans</b> in Summer 1942, with 80.000 well-armed Italian troops to combat some 2,500 to 3,000 poorly-armed <b>Partisans.</b> The Italians shot on the spot all Slovenes caught with arms or forged documents, relatives of <b>Partisans</b> and thousands of young Slovene men were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. With the aid of Slovene collaborationist forces, the fascist authorities also managed to kill some 1,000 <b>Partisans.</b>|$|R
