5|$|Prospectors George Grimes and Moses Splawn {{were the}} first to {{discover}} gold in the forest at the eponymous Grimes Creek on August 2, 1862. Subsequent gold discoveries at Rocky Bar in 1863 and Atlanta in 1864 increased the rush of people to Idaho, and in 1863 Idaho City, with a population of 6,267, surpassed Portland, Oregon as the largest city in the Pacific Northwest. The Idaho gold rush was largely over by 1870, and the population of the Boise Basin fell from 16,000 to 3,500. In 1898 the forest's first gold dredge was built in Placerville and followed by several others. By 1951, when the last dredges shut down, at least 2.3 million ounces (65.2 million grams) of gold had been produced from the Boise Basin area. Silver was mined along the Crooked River from 1882 until 1921, but a silver mine at Silver Mountain proved unsuccessful. Following a shortage of mercury during World War II, mines in the Stibnite area became the country's largest producer of tungsten and second largest source of mercury. The most important known <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> of niobium and tantalum in the United States is located in Bear Valley. From 1953 until 1959, dredges there produced $12.5 million ($ today) in niobium, tantalum, and uranium. Other minerals mined in the forest include antimony and molybdenum.|$|E

25|$|Mani 1965 {{reported}} the panning for gold by local miners in Siruvani River of Attappadi. Detailed studies {{to assess the}} economic potential of Attappadi area was carried out subsequently by Geological Survey of India. However, no primary gold prospects were identified. Nair 1993 carried out the geomorphologic mapping combined with panning of Siruvani River {{which led to the}} discovery of primary gold mineralization in epigenetic quartz vein in Puttumala. The veining, mineralization and associated lithology of this deposit appear to be typical of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit. On the basis of mode of occurrence two types of gold mineralization are recognized in Attappadi, (1) Primary gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins intruding to AS and PGC. (2) <b>Placer</b> <b>deposit</b> along the bank of Siruvani River.|$|E
50|$|<b>Placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are sourced from {{pre-existing}} gold {{deposits and}} are secondary <b>deposits.</b> <b>Placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are formed by alluvial processes within rivers and streams, and on beaches. <b>Placer</b> gold <b>deposits</b> form via gravity, with {{the density of}} gold causing it to sink into trap sites within the river bed, or where water velocity drops, such as bends in rivers and behind boulders. Often <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are found within sedimentary rocks and can be billions of years old, for instance the Witwatersrand deposits in South Africa. Sedimentary <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are known as 'leads' or 'deep leads'.|$|R
50|$|Early Spaniards {{extracted}} gold from <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> using indigenous labour, deaths {{related to}} mining {{contributed to a}} population decline among native Mapuches.

500|$|Monazite (...) , {{which is}} mostly phosphate, is a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> of sand {{created by the}} {{transportation}} and gravitational separation of eroded granite. Monazite as a LREE ore contains 2% (or 3%) yttrium. The largest deposits were found in India and Brazil in the early 20th century, making those two countries the largest producers of yttrium {{in the first half}} of that century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, William Greeneberry [...] "Green" [...] Russell led a {{party of}} Cherokee gold seekers from the State of Georgia to search for gold along the South Platte River. In {{the first week of}} July 1857, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> near the mouth of Little Dry Creek (in present-day Englewood) that yielded about 20 troy ounces (622grams) of gold, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region.|$|E
2500|$|In 1858, several {{parties of}} gold seekers {{bound for the}} California Gold Rush panned small amounts of gold from various streams in the South Platte River Valley {{at the foot of}} the Rocky Mountains in then western Kansas Territory, now {{northeast}} Colorado. The gold nuggets initially failed to impress the gold seekers, but rumors of gold in the Rocky Mountains persisted, and several small parties explored the region. In the summer of 1857, a party of Spanish-speaking gold seekers from the New Mexico Territory worked a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> along the South Platte River about [...] above Cherry Creek (in what is today the Overland Park neighborhood of Denver.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Drift mining {{methods were}} used {{extensively}} to mine <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> {{during the early}} years (1899- [...] ) of the Nome mining district. During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> were buried too deeply for surface placering. In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter. Many miners tunneled into deep <b>placer</b> <b>deposits,</b> bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw. Most of the ground in Nome is permafrost. By drift mining, miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the large}} pieces of silver were found in a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> (unusual for silver, and unique for such large masses) the Spanish colonial {{government}} maintained that the silver was an artificial treasure trove and so belonged to the crown.

The court case dragged on for years, and in the meantime, Spanish soldiers ejected the miners.|$|E
50|$|Alluvium {{can contain}} {{valuable}} ores such as gold and platinum {{and a wide}} variety of gemstones. Such a concentration of valuable ores is termed a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Madre de Dios, located east {{the town}} of Máfil in Chile, is a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> of gold that has been mined several times since its {{discovery}} in 1556. The bedrock of the Madre de Dios area is made of metamorphic and crystalline rocks of Paleozoic age {{all part of the}} Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex. These rocks are covered with thick layers of glacial gravel from the Tertiary. Gold eroded from the gravel have deposited in nearby streams, thus giving origin to the <b>placer</b> <b>deposit.</b> The deposit was discovered by Spaniards in 1556 but was not mined extensivelly until the late 19th century.|$|E

50|$|More than 60 {{deposits}} of gold {{are found in}} the territory of the krai. Most of them are <b>placer</b> <b>deposits.</b> The richest in <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> is {{the southern part of the}} krai. The following gold-placer sites are distinguished here: Kommisarovsky (the Pogranichnaya river), Fadeyevsky (the Fadeyevka river), Krinichny (the Bolshaya Rudnevka river), Nakhodkinsky (the Korobkovka river), and Soboliny (the Sobolinaya river). Okean Artel and Primorsky Mine are engaged in gold extraction. Gold is also extracted from complex {{deposits of}} tungsten ores.|$|R

50|$|Placer mining is the {{technique}} by which gold that has accumulated in a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> is extracted. Placer deposits {{are composed of}} relatively loose material that makes tunneling difficult, and so most means of extracting it involve the use of water or dredging.|$|E
50|$|To form a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit,</b> the {{particles}} desired must show a marked density {{contrast with the}} gangue material, which is able to be transported away from the trap site. Only if the deposit is winnowed in this way can the minerals be concentrated to economic levels.|$|E
50|$|Black sand is {{sand that}} is black in color. One type of black sand is a heavy, glossy, partly {{magnetic}} mixture of usually fine sands, found {{as part of}} a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit.</b> Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a volcano, consists of tiny fragments of basalt.|$|E
2500|$|The heavy {{minerals}} within the source sediments attain an economic concentration by accumulation within low-energy environments within streams and most usually on beaches. In beach <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> the lowest energy zone {{on the beach}} is the swash zone, where turbulent surf washes {{up on the beach}} face and loses energy. In this zone, heavier grains accumulate because they are denser than the quartz grains they occur with and become stranded. It {{is for this reason that}} beach <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are often referred to as [...] "strand-line deposits".|$|R
50|$|The Montrose Placer Mining Company {{was formed}} to mine gold from <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> along the Dolores River. Hydraulic mining, a popular method of {{exploiting}} <b>placer</b> <b>deposits,</b> required water to be efficiently transported, often using wooden flumes to maintain the necessary volume and pressure. Cliffside flumes were developed in California, using trestles and brackets (called bents) at regular intervals to support the flume box. The flume connected with a six mile long ditch, both designed to provide water for miners in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado.|$|R

50|$|Gold panning, {{or simply}} panning, {{is a form}} of placer mining and {{traditional}} mining that extracts gold from a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> using a pan. The process is one of the simplest ways to extract gold, and is popular with geology enthusiasts especially because of its cheap cost and the relatively simple and easy process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} gold {{production in}} Alaska occurred in Windham Bay and Sumdum Bay in 1870-71 subsequent to an 1869 gold <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> discovery {{at the two}} locations.

50|$|In 1877, two prospectors {{collected}} {{float in}} the area of the future Opportunity Mine near Hillsboro, New Mexico, which was assayed at $160 per ton in gold and silver. Soon, ore was discovered at the nearby Rattlesnake vein and a <b>placer</b> <b>deposit</b> of gold was found in November at the Rattlesnake and Wicks gulches. Total production prior to 1904 was about $6,750,000.|$|E

25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a {{low-energy}} zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, {{if they are going}} to be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|R
50|$|Cassiterite (SnO2), the {{tin oxide}} form of tin, {{was most likely}} the {{original}} source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of tin ores are less abundant sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process. Cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as <b>placer</b> <b>deposits</b> because it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the accompanying granite. Cassiterite is usually black, purple or otherwise dark in color, and these deposits can be easily seen in river banks. Alluvial (<b>placer)</b> <b>deposits</b> could be easily collected and separated by methods similar to gold panning.|$|R
