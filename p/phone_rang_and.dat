Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> <b>and</b> I got the call. It's exciting.

500|$|She entered The Factory with Warhol, who complimented {{her on her}} {{appearance}} as she was uncharacteristically wearing makeup. Morrissey told her to leave, threatening to [...] "beat the hell" [...] out of her and throw her out otherwise.

2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go in back of the Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> <b>and</b> a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E

His mother Jenny asked why Ryan left the light on and her boyfriend Colin, who Ryan did not get along with, suggested he might be having panic attacks having experienced them himself at Ryan's age. This finally gave Ryan a reason to like him. One day Ryan felt unsafe at home alone with the impression of the scary beings around. He typed the number 23553110 into the phone's Sat Spy thinking it might be a postcode but the phone came out with the sound of screaming people. One morning the <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> <b>and</b> when Ryan answered the words 'The time is nearly up.' came in a menacing whisper. Ryan became fearful that he was going to die but did not want to give up the phone. The <b>phone</b> <b>rang</b> <b>and</b> played the same message about time nearly up when he was left home alone.|$|E

My bags were packed and I was out on the street. Three hours and three days later and it was the {{imaginary}} man in a snake dance. The recipe: the kid said he'd been standing on the same corner for a thousand nights. I haven't seen him for a while, guess nothing much came of it - hope he's alright.

Nobody knew, the lighting and sound guys didn't know, the organizers didn't know. I just grabbed the microphone and shouted, 'Jimmy Paaaage' and went straight into the song. I loved that. That's what you call dangerous, that's living on your reflexes." ...|$|E
