40|$|The {{law for the}} Modernisation of the Social Health Insurance System 2003 ("GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz – GMG" 2003) provides, {{among other}} measures, for a {{noticeable}} increase in co-payments and also for a reduction of <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> claiming <b>exemptions</b> from co-payments. Against this backdrop, {{the authors of the}} paper present, at the start, the varying news on co-insurance payments held by different political groups. Thereafter, the theoretical foundations of co-payments are described. Finally, on the basis of extensive empirically founded computations, the effects of the new co-payment rules (together with relevant new exemptions) are compared with the effects of the rules still in force. Social Health Insurance System, co-payment, public finance...|$|R
30|$|In the 2005 election, the Danish People’s Party {{strengthened}} {{its position}} {{in relation to the}} other right-wing government parties, and was invited back to negotiations concerning immigration policy by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. In 2006 the three parties arrived at an agreement that generated another Circulation Document. This document (Danish Ministry of Refugees, Immigrants and Integration 2006) signalled further steps in a more restrictive direction. Applicants for naturalization should henceforth declare that they have not committed any criminal acts, and the requirements regarding conduct were tightened even further. A prison sentence of 18  months or more currently implies permanent exclusion from the opportunity to obtain citizenship through naturalization (Section 19). In addition, the applicant must be financially self-sufficient, {{in the sense that he}} or she should not have received any welfare benefits for more than one of the last five years (Section 23).g A further change involved the condition that the applicant’s familiarity with Danish society, culture and history should be documented in the form of a separate indfødsretsprøve (citizenship test). This test is a supplement to the even more rigid language proficiency requirements that have come into force by raising the standards defined by the regulations from 2002. The <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemptions</b> have been reduced and are only granted to applicants who can document that they suffer from ‘a physical or mental illness of a very grave character’ (Section 24).|$|R
40|$|In {{this essay}} I have {{investigated}} and analysed {{the legal framework}} concerning the <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> making <b>exemptions</b> from the prohibition of discrimination in the labor market. I have used the legal dogmathic method {{in order to get}} a full review of the existing sources of law. I have presented the principle of equality within the EU aswell as a review of the national Discrimination Act in Swedish legislation. Furthermore, some attention has been given the different forms of exemption rules that exists. During the essay, it has been established that the impact from the court practise from the Court of Justice of the EU in this area is of a great significance for the judgements and legislation in Sweden. It has also been established that the principle of proportionality plays a big part in the assesment of whether an act is to be considered as discriminatory or if it constitutes a legal exemption from the prohibition of discrimination...|$|R
