5|$|At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet {{team won}} all seven of its games, earning the gold medal. Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Before 1964, the tie-breaking <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament the <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> changed to take all games into consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, an {{experimental}} <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> developed to measure degrees of consciousness, the procedure involving stimulating the brain with a magnetic pulse, measuring resulting waves of electrical activity, {{and developing a}} consciousness score based on {{the complexity of the}} brain activity.|$|E
30|$|Further in this paper, a {{distributed}} iterative {{resource allocation}} <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> considered. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> {{based on the}} above definition of marginal cost of utility for RNs. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> described in details in Algorithm 1.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{structure}} of <b>procedures</b> <b>is</b> central to the foundations of problem soling. In this paper we explore three principle means for teaching procedures: telling, canned loops, and procedural abstraction. The most straightforward way to teach a <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> by telling how to accomplish it in a high level goal-oriented language. In the method of canned loops the control structure that is needed for the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> supposed and the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> deduced. In the method of procedural abstraction the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> abstracted from protocols of the procedure on examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{mathematical}} logic behind a hierarchical planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> used to derive production volumes of consumer products. The {{essence of the}} planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> that first a commitment is made concerning the production volume {{for a family of}} similar products and in a second stage the committed production volume is allocated among the products within the product family. A computationally attractive <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> developed to compute the aggregate production volume and the allocated quantities, such that some target customer service level <b>is</b> achieved. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> based on a combination of exact reasoning, approximation schemes and empirical findings. Numerical results showing the excellent performance of the <b>procedure</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R
5|$|The Mountaineer {{operated}} {{in conjunction with}} the ChicagoWashington/Newport News James Whitcomb Riley between Chicago and Cincinnati. Beyond Cincinnati, at a Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C) yard in Ashland, Kentucky, the two trains were decoupled and then proceeded separately to Catlettsburg, Kentucky and points east, with the Mountaineer roughly twenty-five minutes behind the Riley. Westbound the <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> reversed.|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} {{arising out}} of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president. The new <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> enacted through the 12th Amendment, which {{became a part of}} the Constitution in June 1804, and was first followed in that year's presidential election.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{detection}} of step changes in the variances and in the correlation structure {{of the components of}} a vector of time series. Two <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> considered. The first is based on the likelihood ratio test and the second on cusum statistics. These two <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> compared in a simulation study and we conclude that the cusum <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> more powerful. The <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> illustrated in two examples. ...|$|R
40|$|W-CDMA and SW-CDMA air {{interfaces}} {{are based}} on {{code division multiple access}} and as in all spread spectrum systems the initial acquisition <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> a challenging issue. This <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> identified as cell search in W-CDMA and beam search in SWCDMA. Although the terrestrial air interface W-CDMA and the satellite one SW-CDMA are very similar, the suggested cell/beam search <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> different. In this paper, the two <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> introduced and the numerical results are shown both in single path and in multipath propagation environments. Cell search and beam search <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> compared in terms of time to acquisition and receiver complexity...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a problem}} of testing whether one life {{distribution}} possesses ‘more IFR’ property than the other is considered. A new test <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> proposed {{and the distribution of}} the test statistic is studied. The performance of the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> evaluated in terms of Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency. The consistency property of the test <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> established. It is observed that the new <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> better than the existing procedure in the literature...|$|R
5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for the {{province}}s of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E

5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{scientists}} in Australia successfully implanted a Poitou donkey embryo created by artificial insemination {{in the womb}} of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. The <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> unusual because {{it is often difficult}} for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In May 2008, it was {{revealed}} that a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack, since only 32,767 different keys were generated. The security weakness was caused by changes made in 2006 by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings. The complete resolution <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger of his left hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday {{afternoon}} with new rules in place. Just as in years before, the qualifying <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} appointment, Ramon Perellos became {{very active in}} {{correcting}} cases of corruption and abuse within the Order. One such case involved the request by knights to receive graces and be nominated to the title of Gran Croce di Grazia (literally: great cross by grace). This title implied that a graced knight could replace a knight of the Great Cross upon the latter's death. This <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> not well reputed among elder knights who spent their lifetime {{at the service of}} the Order, and resulted in many of them retiring to return to their homelands and leave their inheritances to their respective families, against the rules of the Order. The pleas of Perellos to eliminate such prejudicial recommendations were considered legitimate by Pope Innocent XII who agreed to forbid them.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{was triggered}} by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal vivisection, before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, the <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> practiced by the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, and then by the Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E
