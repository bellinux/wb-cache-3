5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only <b>perches</b> in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run quickly into nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} mainly eats fish, {{including}} small cyprinids, pikes, roaches, eels, budds, <b>perches,</b> burbots, sicklebacks and muddy loaches (Misgurnus and Cobitis). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.|$|E
50|$|The yellow <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens), {{commonly}} referred to as <b>perch,</b> is a freshwater perciform fish native to much of North America. The yellow <b>perch</b> was described in 1814 by Samuel Latham Mitchill from New York. Yellow <b>perch</b> are closely related, and morphologically similar to the European <b>perch</b> (Perca fluviatilis); however, the two are recognized as independent species based on anatomical and genetic differences. Other common names for yellow <b>perch</b> include American <b>perch,</b> coontail, lake <b>perch,</b> raccoon <b>perch,</b> ring-tail <b>perch,</b> ringed <b>perch,</b> and striped <b>perch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{red gurnard}} <b>perch</b> or jock stewart, Helicolenus percoides, is a {{rockfish}} {{of the family}} Sebastidae, found on the continental shelves of Australia and New Zealand at depths of between 20 and 750 m. Its length is up to 47 cm. Also called Ocean <b>Perch,</b> Coral Cod, Coral <b>Perch,</b> Reef Ocean <b>Perch,</b> Red <b>Perch,</b> Red Rock <b>Perch,</b> Red Gurnard Scorpionfish, and Sea <b>Perch.</b>|$|R

The species is a popular quarry for anglers, and has been widely introduced beyond its native area, into Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. They have caused substantial damage to native fish populations in Australia and have been proclaimed a noxious species in New South Wales.|$|R
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} flies solitarily, {{with wings}} held in a {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and <b>perches</b> on fence posts or on other low <b>perches.</b> When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The lesser yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin {{typically}} <b>perches</b> in {{a prominent}} location {{low to the}} ground, often flicking its wings and tail. It is very active and does not stay still for long. The female has been reported as being fairly tame, while the male is more wary of human contact.|$|E
5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, the turtle drops {{to the bottom of}} its water body or <b>perches</b> on an underwater object and sleeps.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, Waller and {{two other}} people were chosen to find a {{location}} for Bloomsburg's Rosemont Cemetery. They chose a hill immediately north of Bloomsburg, which was partly his land, so on August 1, 1855 he sold them 2 acres and 33.5 <b>perches</b> of land to the Rosemont Cemetery Company for $490.

5|$|The black drongo {{is found}} {{predominantly}} in open country and usually <b>perches</b> and hunts {{close to the}} ground. They are mostly aerial predators of insects but also glean from the ground or off vegetation. They are found as summer visitors to northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan but are residents from the Indus Valley until Bangladesh and into India and Sri Lanka. Some populations show seasonal movements that are poorly understood. The black drongo {{can be found in}} savannas, fields, and urban habitats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perch</b> is {{a common}} name for fish of the genus Perca, {{freshwater}} gamefish belonging to the family Percidae. The <b>perch,</b> {{of which there are}} three species in different geographical areas, lend their name to a large order of vertebrates: the Perciformes, from the Greek perke, simply meaning <b>perch,</b> and the Latin forma meaning shape. Many species of freshwater gamefish more or less resemble <b>perch,</b> but belong to different genera. In fact, the exclusively saltwater dwelling red drum {{is often referred to as}} a red <b>perch,</b> though by definition <b>perch</b> are freshwater fish. Though many fish are referred to as <b>perch</b> as a common name, to be considered a true <b>perch,</b> the fish must be of the family Percidae.|$|R
50|$|A small {{aquaculture}} {{industry in}} the US Midwest contributes about 90,800 kg (200,180 lbs) of yellow <b>perch</b> annually, but the aquaculture is not expanding rapidly.The yellow <b>perch</b> is absolutely crucial {{to the survival of}} the walleye and largemouth bass in its range. Cormorants feed heavily on yellow <b>perch</b> in early spring, but over the entire season, only 10% of their diets is <b>perch.</b> Cormorants and anglers combined harvest 40% of age-1 and age-2 yellow <b>perch</b> and 25% of the adult yellow <b>perch</b> population in Lake Michigan. Total annual mortality of adult yellow <b>perch</b> has not changed since cormorant colonization.|$|R
25|$|Results {{from recent}} {{research}} using genetic MtDNA analysis indicate Australian bass and estuary <b>perch</b> do belong {{in a separate}} genus to golden <b>perch</b> and Macquarie <b>perch,</b> and has resulted in Australian bass and estuary <b>perch</b> being placed back into a resurrected Percalates genus.|$|R
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an abrupt and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high <b>perches.</b> The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species <b>perches</b> in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed <b>perches.</b> It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are quite {{similar to those of the}} gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
50|$|The <b>perch</b> is a predatory species.

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and <b>perches</b> behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female <b>perches</b> on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally <b>perches</b> facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found {{on a wide variety}} of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E

40|$|I {{studied the}} effects of temperature, pH, {{competition}} and predation on Eurasian <b>perch</b> (Perca fluviatilis) in 30 lakes in Norway during 1981 - 2001. The study lakes were situated in two different areas in southern Norway; four lakes in Aust-Agder county in southernmost Norway were explored during 1981 - 1984 and 26 lakes in Hedmark county in south-eastern Norway were investigated during 1992 - 2001. The study lakes varied considerably in pH, temperature, fish species composition, and <b>perch</b> abundance and size composition. In addition to field surveys, behavioural studies of <b>perch</b> were conducted at Karlstad University in 2006 - 2007. The field studies revealed that temperature affected recruitment of <b>perch</b> as strong year-classes of <b>perch</b> generally occurred in summers with high temperatures. Temperature also affected <b>perch</b> behaviour {{as indicated by the}} low gillnet catches (CPUE) of <b>perch</b> atlow temperature. This effect on CPUE was also supported by results from the aquaria experiments, where swimming and feeding activity of <b>perch</b> was low at low temperature. In a study of four lakes, growth was positively related to temperature in the lake with an allopatric <b>perch</b> population, but not in three lakes where <b>perch</b> occurred sympatrically with roach. pH also affected recruitment. In the four lakes in Aust-Agder, one strong year-class of <b>perch</b> occurred in all lakes in a year with especially high pH in spring and early summer. Adult mortality was also affected by pH, as old <b>perch</b> were less abundant in lakes with late spring pH= 5. 5 - 5. 8 than in lakes with pH 5. 8. The size and growth of adult <b>perch</b> were negatively affected by low pH, whereas abundance of large, potentially predatory <b>perch</b> was positively related to pH. The field studies indicated that roach influence <b>perch</b> populations. When coexisting with roach, <b>perch</b> were mainly littoral. In lakes where roach dominated (by number), there was no growth – temperature correlation, but there was such a correlation in lakes without roach. In lakes with sympatric roach, age-specific weight of <b>perch</b> and the growth of 2 + <b>perch</b> were negatively related to the proportion of roach in the gillnet catches. In the aquaria experiments, swimming and feeding activity of <b>perch</b> were lower than that of roach at all temperatures tested, and the difference was most pronounced at 4 and 8 °C. The aquaria experiments indicated that <b>perch</b> had a lower feeding efficiency and that they generally occupied positions closer to the bottom than roach...|$|R
40|$|The Indiana {{waters of}} Lake Michigan were sampled weekly from May until August in 2009, 2011, and 2012 to {{determine}} the extent of yellow <b>perch</b> reproduction and the role Indiana waters play in yellow <b>perch</b> life history. Experimental gill nets were used to collect fish before, during, and after the spawning season from randomly selected sites along the Indiana shoreline. Yellow <b>perch</b> were then taken to an onshore processing station where they were weighed, measured, and visually examined to determine sex and maturity. Maturity stages of adult yellow <b>perch</b> were used to estimate the timing and duration of yellow <b>perch</b> spawning. Yellow <b>perch</b> population demographics were also compared to determine if different groups of yellow <b>perch</b> were present before and after the spawn. My data suggests that yellow <b>perch</b> spawning is strongly influenced by temperature and that Indiana waters are seasonally used by adult yellow <b>perch</b> for feeding.

5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from <b>perches</b> {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely <b>perches</b> on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the major}} groups of teleosts, the Elopomorpha, Clupeomorpha and Percomorpha (<b>perches,</b> tunas and many others) {{all have a}} {{worldwide}} distribution and are mainly marine; the Ostariophysi and Osteoglossomorpha are worldwide but mainly freshwater, the latter mainly in the tropics; the Atherinomorpha (guppies, etc.) have a worldwide distribution, both fresh and salt, but are surface-dwellers. In contrast, the Esociformes (pikes) are limited to freshwater in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Salmoniformes (salmon, trout) are found in both Northern and Southern temperate zones in freshwater, some species migrating {{to and from the}} sea. The Paracanthopterygii (cods, etc.) are Northern Hemisphere fish, with both salt and freshwater species.|$|E

40|$|Landing on {{lighting}} columns like nature’s birds is {{a desirable}} capability {{which can only}} extend the uses of unmanned aerial systems. This thesis investigates what the most effective form of <b>perching</b> on existing street furniture with a VTOL UAV and how the <b>perch</b> site can be recognised using low cost off the shelf sensors. Additionally to this, the UAV in question will have to execute the <b>perch</b> without relying on GPS data. The work conducted here covers an extensive design review which selects a bird claw like gripper to sustain the <b>perch.</b> In order for the UAV to {{know where it is}} in relation to the <b>perch</b> site without relying on GPS data, a Raspberry Pi and PiCamera were used to detect common features which are found on top of a lighting column. Using a search and <b>perch</b> algorithm which was developed specifically for the task of <b>perching</b> on lamp post projection brackets, the on-board microprocessor controlled the UAV over the <b>perch</b> site and gradually descended into the <b>perch</b> position. The <b>perched</b> position and approach was also tested to ensure the <b>perching</b> element could cope with various weather conditions. The testing was conducted in a wind tunnel with the UAV mounted in various <b>perched</b> positions and the moment the UAV would slip, the wind speed were measured and analysed which highlighted an interesting prediction method. During the <b>perching</b> development the addition of a gantry style test-rig was also developed to ease the algorithm development with minimal incidents. The final result is a search and <b>perch</b> algorithm which is initiated when the VTOL UAV is within the vicinity of a lamp post at which point the on-board vision processing and control system takes over, removing the burden from the UAV operator to ensure a collision free <b>perch...</b>|$|R
