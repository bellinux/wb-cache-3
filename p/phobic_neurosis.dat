40|$|A case of {{claustrophobia}} in a 45 -year old male tuberculous in-patient receiving antituberculous drug is reported. The patient {{presented with}} the clinical features of claustrophobia after eighteen months of therapy. Isoniazid was, probably, the most likely cause since. The symptoms recurred on reintroduction of INH containing regimens. There was no recurrence of symptoms on resumption of non-Isoniazid regimen. Neurop 3 ychi. -Uric side-effects due to Isoniazid are well-known but <b>Phobic</b> <b>neurosis</b> due to Isoniazid was not reported till now...|$|E
40|$|The authors, a {{psychiatrist}} and a clinical psychologist, have successfully treated two cases of <b>phobic</b> <b>neurosis</b> by simple behaviour therapy consisting of Jacobson's muscle relaxation technique and systemic desensitisation, at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur. The two patients, who were literally housebound because of the unpleasant symptoms of their illness, were able to mobilise themselves again following therapy. The authors feel that general practitioners with some basic training in these methods {{will be able to}} bring relief to such afflicted patients. Using the same technique, other conditions such as insomnia, alcoholism and sexual deviations can also be treated...|$|E
40|$|Although {{anxiety and}} the <b>phobic</b> <b>neuroses</b> are {{classified}} as separate entities, most patients with phobic anxiety also suffer from an elevation of their general (free floating) level of anxiety, and nearly all patients with generalized anxiety may experience an aggravation of their anxiety, often to panic intensity.

40|$|The authors discuss {{fear from}} the {{theoretical}} and clinical aspects of psychiatry. In {{an attempt to}} understand the phenomenon of pathological fear, contemporary theories and experience are taken into account, differentiating such fear from that having a basis in reality. Anxiety signals are discussed which stimulate the ego to mobilize defense in dangerous situations. The significance of fear arising from the super ego (from the conscience) is discussed separately. An elaboration is presented on real and existential fear. Fear {{as a source of}} suffering is examined in the clinical context, with particular attention to disorders and psychiatric disturbances in which fear is the dominant symptom (especially in anxiety and <b>phobic</b> <b>neuroses).</b> Several therapeutic approaches are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|Eleven in-patients of the {{hospital}} for Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases, Hyderabad, who presented with psychiatric symptoms resulting in maladjustment were examined and placed in different diagnostic groups. There were five psychotics and six neurotics. Out of the five psychotics, three were manic and two were depressive. Among the six neutrotics, three were depressive and one each of anxiety, obsessive compulsive and <b>phobic</b> <b>neurosis.</b> All the patients improved on withdrawal of anti-tuberculosis drugs {{and there was no}} recurrence or symptoms on reintroduction of anti-tuberculosis drugs other than isoniazid. On re-introduction of Isoniazid, symptoms recurred. The psychiatric disorders were most likely due to Isoniazid and they were neither dose nor duration related. However, Isoniazid may be readministered in the less severe forms along with appropriate drugs to control psychiatric side-effects...|$|E
40|$|Five {{new cases}} of reading {{epilepsy}} (RE) are reported. This is an epilepsy syndrome belonging {{to the group of}} idiopathic localization-related epilepsies. They all have some interesting features which contribute {{to the understanding of the}} pathomechanism and nosology of this specific type of reflex epilepsy. In our first patient the precipitating effect of texts in unknown languages depended upon phonematic intricacy. With our second case, changes of script within the text (Latin to Greek) increased the precipitating effect. The visual aura experiences reported in vague terms by some patients with RE may represent ictal dyslexia. For case three RE had been misdiagnosed as <b>phobic</b> <b>neurosis.</b> Even if a patient has a history of development dyslexia, and ictal dyslexia is a feature of the seizures, the onset of RE is not during primary school age but at puberty. Our fourth patient's manifestation factor of (late-onset) RE was a change of scriptural environment (Kyrillic to Latin). Unilateral myocloni were observed with bilateral spike wave discharge in RE, and carbamazepine possibly increased the epileptic response in RE. With the co-occurrence of RE and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in case five, the clinical features of both syndromes remained separate. All five patients responded well to treatment with valproic acid, and all confirmed that the syndrome has no tendency to deteriorate in long-term follow-up...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} introduction of social phobia into France. My analysis is concerned with how this diagnosis, which is inconsistent with the psychoanalytic model that dominates French psychiatry, is increasingly being accepted by French physicians and patients. I argue that the diagnosis social phobia offers physicians and patients a justification for life difficulties that was not provided by existing diagnoses such as <b>phobic</b> <b>neurosis,</b> obsessional neurosis or 'normal' shyness. In 2003 - 4 I carried out one year of fieldwork in North America and France. During this time I conducted participant observation and interviews with clinicians and members of a social phobia support group. Throughout this thesis, it is my objective to understand the disorder from three perspectives: historical, ethnographic, and sociocultural. First, I examine French psychiatrists' claims that social phobia has existed in French psychiatric literature since the nineteenth century. I investigate the efforts of these French psychiatrists {{to prove that the}} diagnostic category has a legitimate place in French medicine. Second, I look at how a small group of Parisian psychiatrists who practice cognitive and behavioural therapy are fighting for greater awareness and acceptance of social phobia. Promoting social phobia is a means of spreading awareness of their therapeutic model. Their aim is to unseat psychoanalysis from its dominant position in French psychiatry. Many individuals prefer cognitive and behavioural therapists' explanations of social phobia symptoms to those of psychoanalysts because they are less stigmatizing and their predicted outcomes more optimistic. But many French clinicians reject the diagnosis social phobia and prefer psychoanalytic explanations for patients' symptoms. Some see it as a 'fashionable' disorder overly promoted by the pharmaceutical industry. Third, I investigate how social phobia is related to cultural behavioural ideals and societal expectations. I look at how these factors lead more people to become concerned about the symptoms of social phobia than in the past. In the end, I explain that French physicians and patients are choosing social phobia from among other possible labels for this set of symptoms. The way that they describe this diagnosis, however, blends multiple therapeutic models and they create an explanation of the disorder which most thoroughly and positively describes patients' experiences...|$|E
50|$|Pseudoneurotic {{schizophrenia}} is {{a mental}} disorder categorized {{by the presence}} of two or more symptoms of mental illness such as anxiety, hysteria, and <b>phobic</b> or obsessive-compulsive <b>neuroses.</b> It is often acknowledged as a personality disorder. Patients generally display salient anxiety symptoms that disguise an underlying psychotic disorder.|$|R
