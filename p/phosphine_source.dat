30|$|Nanoscale {{building}} blocks have attracted much interest {{due to their}} potential applications in replacement of traditional materials in the coming next few decades. However, {{most of the work}} in the synthesis of nanocrystals using solution-phase chemical method is focused on VI-II semiconductor systems and noble metals [1]. Transition metal phosphides exhibit unique catalytic, optical, electronic, and magnetic properties depending on their phases [2]. For example, Fe 3 P is ferromagnet that has a high transition temperature (Tc = 716 K) [3], while FeP 2 is a small-bandgap semiconductor with a Tc of 15 K. Some preparation methods have been developed for the interest of studying the size-property relations of nanoscale iron phosphides. For example, Gu et al. [4] prepared 200 nm orthorhombic FeP via solvothermal synthesis employing FeCl 3 and Na 3 P at 180 °C. Luo et al. [5] synthesized nanocrystalline Fe 2 P in a similar way at 180 °C. Hu et al. [6] obtained a mixture of iron oxide nanoshells and hollow iron phosphide nanoparticles using sonichemistry method. Brock et al. [3] prepared FeP nanoparticles via a de-silylation route using a highly reactive <b>phosphine</b> <b>source,</b> P(SiMe 3) 3. Later, Brock [7] found that trioctylphosphine (TOP), which is a less-reactive reagent compared with P(SiMe 3) 3, can be used as <b>phosphine</b> <b>source</b> as well as surfactant and solvent in the preparation of MnP and FeP using metal carbonyls as metal source. Liu et al. [8] synthesized FeP nanorods by injecting Fe(CO) 5 /TOP into hot solution of TOP and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Hyeon et al. [9] studied the relation between the injection rate and length of Fe 2 P nanorods synthesized using a syringe pump. Fe 2 P nanorods can also be prepared without using a syringe pump as shown in the work of Whitmire et al. [10] who developed a single-source organometallic method to control morphology by varying the ratio of tri-n-octylamine (TOA) to oleic acid (OA) in a one-pot reaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} ZnGeP 2 /GaP double and {{multiple}} heterostructures on GaP substrates by organometallic {{chemical vapor deposition}} is reported. These epitaxial films were deposited at a temperature of 580 C using dimethylzinc, trimethylgallium, germane, and <b>phosphine</b> as <b>source</b> gases. With appropriate deposition conditions, mirror smooth epitaxial GaP/ZnGeP 2 multiple heterostructures were obtained on (001) GaP substrates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) studies of the films showed that the interfaces are sharp and smooth. Etching study of the films showed dislocation density {{on the order of}} 5 x 10 (exp 4) cm(sup - 2). The growth rates of the GaP layers depend linearly on the flow rates of trimethylgallium. While the GaP layers crystallize in zinc-blende structure, the ZnGeP 2 layers crystallize in the chalcopyrite structure as determined by (010) electron diffraction pattern. This {{is the first time that}} multiple heterostructures combining these two crystal structures were made...|$|R
40|$|Single crystal GaAsl-zPx layers {{have been}} grown epitaxially from the vapor phase {{in a novel}} apparatus, using gaseous arsine and <b>phosphine</b> as <b>sources</b> of arsenic and phosphorus. These layers exhibit the highest quality, and the widest range of {{controlled}} resistivity et reported for solid solutions in this system. Vegard's law is obeyed over the entire composition range. At room temperature, the change from a direct to an indirect transition across the band gap occurs at the value, x = 0. 44. Electron mobilities in these layers are high; a sample containing 27 % GaP, for instance, had a room temper-ature mobility of 4900 cm 2 /v-sec, and a 69 % gallium phosphide alloy had a mobility of 700 cm 2 /v-sec at room temperature. Both {{n- and p-type doping}} have been obtained, with hydrogen selenide gas and zinc vapor as the sources of donor and acceptor impurities, respectively. In this apparatus it is also easy to prepare multi layered structures incorporating layers of different resistivity and/or composition...|$|R
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{is concerned with}} the highly lattice-mismatched growth of InP on GaAs-substrates by metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) using TMIn and precracked <b>phosphine</b> as the <b>source</b> materials. Here the objective was to deposit device-suitable InP-layers with low surface roughness, dislocation density and electrical conductivity. Growth-optimization of InP on GaAs was carried out by applying a multitude of characterization methods, amongst others atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Hall-effect-measurements. In particular, {{for the first time the}} dependence of the surface morphology on the growth parameters was investigated systematically. A growth model was formulated in order to explain the corresponding observations. Furthermore, the influence of both the growth parameters and a post-growth anneal on the optical and structural properties of the deposited InP-layers was investigated. Finally AlInAs/GaInAs-HEMT-structures (High Electron Mobility Transistors) were deposited and processed for the first time on the InP buffer-layers optimized as described above, which demonstrated the device-suitability of the deposited InP/GaAs-heterostructures. All in all a contribution was achieved in solving the main problem for the implementation of InP-based devices on GaAs-substrates. The predestination of the growth-method MOMBE for highly lattice-mismatched systems was also demonstrated. (orig.)

40|$|In this paper, the {{electrical}} and optical properties of undoped and in-situ doped amorphous SiC films are presented. The films are prepared by using mixture of methane (CH 4) and silane (SiH 4) as C and Si <b>sources,</b> <b>phosphine</b> (PH 3) and diborane (B 2 H 6) as doping gases. The bandgap, optical constant and absorption coefficient {{of the films}} are measured and a strong dependence on the layer composition and doping gas level is observed. The current versus voltage (I-V) and capacitance versus voltage (C-V) characteristics of a-Si x C 1 -x films are measured on Al/Si x C 1 x /Al and Al/a-Si x C (1 -x /Si/Al capacitors. At high field, the Frenkel-Poole effect {{is more likely to}} be the conduction mechanism for Si-rich films, while the Schottky effect for C-rich films. For the p-type doped, the Frenkel-Poole effect is the only conduction mechanism, while for the n-type doped films the effect is less clear. An increase in dielectric constant is observed when the Si/C ratio increases. Using the conductance method the interface trapped density (D it) is calculated and about 1. 61 x 10. The flatband voltage (V FB) and the threshold voltage (V T) are determined as well. The obtained results show V FB = 8. 1 V and it slightly decreases with increasing silane flow rate, V T is about 10. 8 V and increases with decreasing silane flow rate...|$|R
