5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>action.</b> Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Niš in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that might result in <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>action</b> by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January– February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows for a comprehensive assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>action</b> to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E

However, buildings, through occupancy, {{are subjected to}} degradation which poses unique challenges {{with regard to the}} security, health and productivity of the occupants; thus, impacting on the immediate environment and economy at large. The paper presents a review of barriers to effective maintenance of residential building facilities. Findings revealed that poor or non-existent pre-construction facility management provisions, financial constraints, lack of government support and late implementation of facilities management, hinder regular and efficient management of dwellings. Other barriers identified are the utilisation of non-professional facility managers and poor administration of a service charge account. The study provides evidence for professionals in the real estate sector to take necessary <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>actions</b> against mismanagement of residential buildings and facilities so as to prevent degradation...|$|R

The levers for new behaviours can be surprisingly simple, although addressing root causes may require more fundamental reforms.

Britain feared that Russian expansionism in the region would eventually threaten the Empire in India. In response, Britain undertook a number of <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>actions</b> against perceived Russian ambitions, including the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–1842), the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880) and the British expedition to Tibet (1903–1904). During this period, Britain also sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe, particularly against Russian expansionism, who at the expense of the waning Ottoman Empire had ambitions to [...] "carve up the European part of Turkey".

40|$|Abstract. Invasive {{species can}} inflict {{significant}} costs on agriculture. Approaches to prevent introduction and/or to contain introduced species {{can also be}} very costly. Approaches to managing invasive-species problems include <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>actions</b> against potential invaders in foreign locales, border activities such as inspections to prevent introductions across international boundaries, domestic monitoring and control to prevent establishment if introductions occur, management of domestically established introductions through use of various forms of interference (e. g., vector control, enemies, pathogens, symbionts, endophytes, hosts, and/or physical factors perhaps as part of areawide management programs), and combinations of these approaches. This paper focuses on providing applicable quantitative decision support {{to the process of}} establishing efficient protocols for border protection under the severe uncertainty and resource constraints that characterize the inspection process. In this paper, a hybrid info-gap model is used in conjunction with stochastic dominance to develop a cost-effective protocol for invasive-species detection efforts.
