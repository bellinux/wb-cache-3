During the <b>Pre-operational</b> Stage of {{cognitive}} development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information. Children’s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved. By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, {{towards the end of the}} second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the <b>Pre-operational</b> Stage.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pre-operational</b> {{stage is}} sparse and logically {{inadequate}} {{in regard to}} mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The <b>Pre-operational</b> Stage is split into two substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of [...] "why?" [...] and [...] "how come?" [...] This stage is when children want the knowledge of knowing everything.|$|E
2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in de-icing mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line de-icing circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the de-icing converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The de-icing disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be de-iced must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ de-icer requires a de-icing line equipment <b>pre-operational</b> testing before being installed.The lines being de-iced must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process. Out of the five lines, four have three de-icing circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipment’s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of communication failure. Flexible stimulation sequences used for control logic and MMI validation, <b>pre-operational</b> testing and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|E

5000|$|Cognitive skills: the way {{in which}} a child organizes information. Cognitive skills include problem solving, creativity, {{imagination}} and memory. They embody {{the way in}} which children make sense of the world. Piaget believed that children exhibit prominent differences in their thought patterns as they move through the stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor period, the <b>pre-operational</b> period, and the operational period.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the <b>pre-operational</b> version of the services has been realised {{by a series of}} projects launched by the European Commission and partly funded through the EU's 7th Framework Programme (FP7). These projects were geoland2 (land), MyOcean (marine), SAFER (emergency response), MACC and its successor MACC II (atmosphere) and G-MOSAIC (security). Most of these projects also contributed to the monitoring of Climate Change.|$|E
50|$|The ELISA suite are {{microsatellites}} {{and thus}} all four were launched {{on a single}} Soyuz ST-B rocket, along with Pleiades-1 and SSOT. The ELISA programme is a demonstration system {{to pave the way}} for a planned radar monitoring system called CERES. The ELISA satellites are in a Low Earth orbit a few kilometres from each other to record radar and radio transmissions. Since 2014, they are used as a <b>pre-operational</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent to Operation Opera, the {{destruction}} of a <b>pre-operational</b> nuclear reactor inside Iraq by the Israeli Air Force, the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, countered criticism by saying that [...] "on no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction against the people of Israel." [...] This policy of pre-emptive action against real or perceived weapons of mass destruction became known as the Begin Doctrine.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the ARTAS system, a Central ARTAS software Maintenance and Operational Support (CAMOS) service for those versions of ARTAS that are in <b>pre-operational</b> or operational use was created. CAMOS collects the ARTAS system data and parameters needed to ensure the exchanges of surveillance data between the States implementing ARTAS and provides software enhancements to the commonly developed ARTAS System for functionality required by changes in the technical environment or common user needs.|$|E
50|$|According to Jean Piaget, {{thinking}} {{develops in}} 4 stages from childhood to young adulthood. Piaget named these stages sensory-motor, <b>pre-operational,</b> concrete-operational, and formal-operational. Development of formal-operational thinking {{is considered to}} continue until approximately until the 25th year of life. Subsequent researchers have concentrated on the now famous question of Kohlberg: Is there a life after 25? In CDF, the development of post formal-operational thinking in an adult is indicated primarily {{by the presence of}} dialectical thinking.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, Packet Switch Stream (PSS) was an X.25-based packet-switched network, {{provided}} by the British Post Office Telecommunications and then British Telecommunications starting in 1980. After a period of <b>pre-operational</b> testing with customers (mainly UK universities and computer manufacturers at this early phase) the service was launched as a commercial service on 20 August 1981. The experimental predecessor network (EPSS) formally closed down on 31 July 1981 after all the existing connections had been moved to PSS.|$|E
50|$|In April 2015, a Japanese court {{rejected}} {{a complaint against}} the restart.On May 28, 2015, The Nuclear Regulation Authority approved the station’s emergency plans, which was the last regulatory hurdle remaining before restarts could happen. Owner Kyushu Electric Power Company then had all approvals necessary for restart.On July 7, 2015, fuel loading of Sendai unit #1 began. The NRA completed its <b>pre-operational</b> examinations and gave Kyushu Electric Company {{the green light to}} place fuel inside the reactor vessel.|$|E
50|$|Following {{compulsory}} {{service in}} the Reicharbeitsdienst (German Labour Corps) in Northern Germany he enlisted in the Luftwaffe and trained as a fighter pilot. After <b>pre-operational</b> training at Ergänzungsjagdgruppe Ost (Training Fighter Wing - East) {{in the spring of}} 1942 during which he survived a major crash, he was transferred on 28 July 1942 as an Unteroffizier to 8./Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing) flying near Rostov on the Eastern Front. This squadron was commanded by Günther Rall, the third most successful fighter pilot in history.|$|E
50|$|During further <b>pre-operational</b> testing, severe {{vibration}} of {{the fuel}} channel gags was detected. The fuel channel gags are valves which are gradually closed to restrict the flow of gas through a fuel channel {{in order to maintain}} the channel gas outlet temperature as the nuclear fuel is used up. Modifications to produce a fluidically generated bias force to stop the gags vibrating took time to design, test and implement, delaying the planned start up date. The station began generating electricity on 5 February 1976.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{atmospheric}} models is the High Resolution Limited Area Model, abbreviated HiRLAM, which is frequently used in Europe. HiRLAM comes in many versions, that’s {{why it is}} better to speak about [...] "a" [...] HiRLAM rather than [...] "the" [...] HiRLAM. Each version is maintained by a national institute such as the Dutch KNMI, the Danish DMI or Finnish FMI. And each institute has several versions under her wing, divided into categories such as: operational, <b>pre-operational,</b> semi operational and for research purposes.|$|E
50|$|The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) {{is part of}} the Copernicus Programme and {{provides}} continuous data and information on atmospheric composition.
