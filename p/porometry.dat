5000|$|Capillary flow <b>porometry,</b> {{also known}} as <b>porometry,</b> is a {{characterization}} technique based on the displacement of a wetting liquid from the sample pores by applying a gas at increasing pressure. It is widely used to measure minimum, maximum (or first bubble point) and mean flow pore sizes, and pore size distribution of the through pores in membranes [...] nonwovens, paper, filtration and ultrafiltration media, hollow fibers, ceramics, etc.|$|E
50|$|In {{capillary}} flow <b>porometry</b> an inert gas {{is used to}} displace a liquid, {{which is in the}} pores. The pressure required to empty the pore corresponds to the pressure necessary to evacuate the liquid from the most constricted part of the pore. This most constricted part is the most challenging one and it offers the highest resistance to remove the wetting liquid. This parameter is very relevant in filtration and similar applications since {{it is important to know}} the smallest diameter of the through pores.|$|E
50|$|The {{selection}} of the wetting liquid is important as it determines the measureable pore size range for a given pressure. Some common wetting liquids used in capillary flow <b>porometry</b> include water, alcohols, silicone oil and perfluoroethers. The use of water and/or alcohols present the disadvantage that they can evaporate and therefore the samples can partially dry before the actual <b>porometry</b> test begins. Also water, for instance, has a relatively high surface tension (γ= 72 dynes/cm) compared to perfluoroethers (e.g. γ= 16 dynes/cm), which means {{that in order to}} measure the same pore size using water as a wetting liquid it is required to apply 4 times more pressure than when using a perfluoroethers. Silicone oil does not present the evaporation drawback but its high viscosity makes the cleaning of the equipment parts in between different measurements not easy. Perfluoroethers have very low surface tensions and low vapour pressures, which makes them immune to the problem of evaporation. In general they do not react with samples neither cause their swelling. In principle there is no universal wetting liquid and the choice of one or another depends on the application and the type of sample to be characterized. Nevertheless it is important to use always the same wetting liquid when comparing results.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} measure the pore size by {{capillary}} flow <b>porometry</b> {{it is necessary to}} impregnate the samples with a wetting liquid. An inert gas flow is used to displace the liquid that is in the pores and the pressure required to empty the most constricted part of the pore is measured. The most constricted part of the pore is the most challenging one because it offers the highest resistance to remove the wetting liquid. This parameter is very important in filtration and similar applications since it is essential to know the smallest diameter of the through pores.|$|E
50|$|This {{measured}} pressure permits {{obtaining the}} pore diameter, which is calculated {{by using the}} Young-Laplace formula P= 4*γ*cos θ*/D in which D is the pore size diameter, P is the pressure measured, γ is the surface tension of the wetting liquid and θ is the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample. The surface tension γ is a measurable physical property and depends on the wetting liquid used. The contact angle θ depends on {{the interaction between the}} material and the wetting liquid. In capillary flow <b>porometry,</b> in opposition to mercury intrusion porosimetry, the wetting liquid enters spontaneously the pores of the sample ensuring a total wetting of the material, and therefore the contact angle of the wetting liquid with the sample is 0 and the previous formula can be simplied as: P= 4*γ/D.|$|E
50|$|Canopy {{temperature}} {{depression is}} highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in warm, {{low relative humidity}} environments where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling of up to 10 °C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using infrared thermometry. However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative humidity environments because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences {{in the rate of}} CO2 fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. <b>Porometry</b> can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks.|$|E
5000|$|Capillary flow <b>porometry</b> permits obtaining several {{parameters}} and information in one individual and fast measurement. In general, a measurements with the wet sample (impregnated with wetting liquid) {{is carried out}} first. It is normally known as the [...] "wet run" [...] and {{the representation of the}} gas flow vs. the applied pressure is the so-called [...] "wet curve". After the wet run the measurement of the same sample in dry state is carried out in order to register and analogous [...] "dry curve". The half-dry curve is calculated and represented by dividing the flow values with respect to the applied pressure by 2 and it is also represented in the same graphic.From the representation of the three curves it is possible to identify relevant information about the sample: the maximum pore size (or first bubble point) is recorded when gas flow through the sample is detected (please see explanation about FBP above), the mean flow pore size corresponds to the pore size calculated at the pressure where the wet curve and the half dry curve meet (it corresponds at the pore size at which 50% of the total gas flow can be accounted), and the minimum pore size results from the pressure at which the wet and the dry curve meet (from this point onwards the flow will be the same because all the pores have been emptied).|$|E

40|$|Gas-liquid <b>porometry</b> is {{the most}} common method for characterizing {{microfiltration}} membranes. This thesis provides a new approach to analyze data from gas-liquid <b>porometry.</b> Here, we combine <b>porometry</b> results with porosity measurement to determine the transport through the membranes. The pore size distribution and porosity measurements were performed for a range of membranes from straight through to asymmetric membranes. There was high discrepancy between the measured pore size and manufacturer data. Our study also examined the effect of asymmetry in pore size distribution of the membranes as compared to symmetric membranes. The asymmetric membranes were found to give smaller pore size compared to symmetric membranes. The orientation of asymmetric membranes provided different results for the mean pore size. A comparison between the classical approach and modified approach to analyze the data and thus in the estimation of transport parameter was made. Better correlation of measured and estimated transport parameter was found for modified approach as compared to classical approach. In addition modified approach determines the tortuosity for each pore size range during the estimation of transport parameters. The average tortuosity of the membranes under study varied from 0. 707 to 6. 48 with larger nominal pore membranes having higher values compared to smaller ones. This research also studied the transport of particles through the symmetric membranes. Theoretical model based on sieving was examined. The actual rejection increased for more tortuous membranes in comparison to theoretical rejection prediction with the difference being greater for the highest tortuosity. With this study, we hope to further elucidate the characterization of membranes via <b>porometry</b> and hope to provide useful information regarding the development and end use of these membranes...|$|E

Sap-flow, <b>porometry</b> and stable isotope tracer measurements were made on 18 tree and eight shrub species from seven ecosystem types. Coupled with environmental data, our findings revealed {{that most of these}} species transpired at night. For some species and circumstances, nighttime leaf water loss constituted a signifi-cant fraction of total daily water use.
