5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain <b>pharmacodynamic</b> traits with MDMA.|$|E

25|$|Topical {{administration}} is sometimes defined {{as both a}} local application location and local <b>pharmacodynamic</b> effect, and sometimes merely as a local application location regardless of location of the effects.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{relationship}} has been stated between the degree and duration of gastric acid inhibition, as measured by monitoring of the 24-hour intragastric pH in <b>pharmacodynamic</b> studies, {{and the rate of}} healing and symptom relief reported.|$|E
25|$|Geriatric {{patients}} (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin {{compared to}} young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax {{values that are}} 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater <b>pharmacodynamic</b> response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{the safety}} and {{efficacy}} of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques. Significant advances in monitoring and new anesthetic agents with improved pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> characteristics also contributed to this trend. Standardized training programs for anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists emerged during this period. The increased application of economic and business administration principles to {{health care in the}} late 20th and early 21st centuries led to the introduction of management practices such as transfer pricing to improve the efficiency of anesthetists.|$|E
25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating <b>pharmacodynamic</b> or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E
25|$|While {{caffeine}} {{does not}} directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1–D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with 1 adenosine A1 receptor and 1 dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with 2 adenosine A2A receptors and 2 dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer {{has been identified as}} a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its psychostimulant effects and its <b>pharmacodynamic</b> interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants.|$|E
25|$|All statins {{have the}} same {{pharmacophore}} so the difference in their <b>pharmacodynamic</b> effect is mostly based on the substituents. The activity of each statin {{is dependent on the}} binding affinity of the compound for the substrate site and the length of time it binds to the site. Type 2 statins havejk unique fluorophenyl group that causes additional polar interaction between the enzyme and the statins, which results in a tighter binding to the enzyme. The newest statin, rosuvastatin has a unique polar methane sulfonamide group, which is quite hydrophilic and confers low lipophilicity. The sulfonamide group forms a unique polar interaction with the enzyme. As a result, rosuvastatin has superior binding affinity to the HMGR enzyme compared to the other statins, which is directly related to its efficiency to lower LDL cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacodynamics}} of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. Water-soluble peptide hormones cannot {{penetrate the}} fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect {{the nucleus of}} target cells through their interaction with the cell’s surface receptors. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The <b>pharmacodynamic</b> action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. From there, the compound hormone-receptor diffuses into the nucleus, where it either alters the expression of genes or activates processes that send signals {{to other parts of}} the cell. Different types of AAS bind to the AAR with different affinities, depending on their chemical structure. Some AAS such as metandienone bind weakly to this receptor in vitro, but still exhibit AR-mediated effects in vivo. The reason for this discrepancy is not known.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before SSRIs are rather promiscuous {{in that they}} also bind to the homologous NET and DAT, although with much lower affinity than to their principal target SERT. The selectivity of SSRIs for SERT is really interesting where {{only one or two}} different functional group substituents are sufficient to convert an SSRI into a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with higher affinity to NE. SSRI antidepressants all have the same mechanism of action and are at least 10-fold more selective for 5-HT re-uptake inhibition than for NE re-uptake inhibition. However, despite the sharing of the same mechanism of action, SSRIs differ in their potency and selectivity in inhibiting 5-HT re-uptake and many of them have important effects on other transporters and receptors. SSRIs are structurally diverse with clear variations in their <b>pharmacodynamic</b> and pharmacokinetic profiles, which leads to differences among them in their half-lifes, clinical activity, adverse effects and drug interactions, which explains the differences in their efficacy and tolerability among patients. However, all SSRIs are clinically equal {{when it comes to their}} efficacy over time.|$|E
25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of unchanged drug in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The terminal half-life in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in synovial fluid is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in synovial fluid 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can explain why some users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short plasma half-life. The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer <b>pharmacodynamic</b> half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E
500|$|Serotonin is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{involved in}} multiple states including aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and vomiting. In humans {{the effects of}} excess serotonin were first noted in 1960 in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and tryptophan. The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the central nervous system. It was originally suspected that agonism of 5-HT1A receptors in central grey nuclei and the medulla {{was responsible for the}} development of the syndrome. Further study has determined that overstimulation of primarily the 5-HT2A receptors appears to contribute substantially to the condition. The 5-HT1A receptor may still contribute through a <b>pharmacodynamic</b> interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes. Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS norepinephrine concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may also play a role; NMDA receptor antagonists and GABA have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome. [...] Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and overdoses, and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.|$|E

2500|$|The FDA Paper titled [...] "Safety Assessment of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)Released from PVC Medical Devices" [...] {{states that}} [...] Critically ill or injured {{patients}} {{may be at}} increased risk of developing adverse health effects from DEHP, not only by virtue of increased exposure relative to the general population, {{but also because of}} the physiological and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> changes that occur in these patients compared to healthy individuals.|$|E
2500|$|In a phase 1 {{clinical}} trial, 41 {{patients with}} advanced cancer metastasised to liver were administered RNAi delivered through lipid nanoparticles. The RNAi targeted two genes encoding key proteins {{in the growth}} of the cancer cells, vascular endothelial growth factor, (VEGF), and kinesin spindle protein (KSP). [...] The results showed clinical benefits, with the cancer either stabilized after six months, or regression of metastasis in some of the patients. [...] <b>Pharmacodynamic</b> analysis of biopsy samples from the patients revealed the presence of the RNAi constructs in the samples, proving that the molecules reached the intended target.|$|E
2500|$|The β-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonists {{all have}} similar therapeutic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> actions {{in patients with}} cardiovascular disorders. They vary greatly in their pharmacokinetic properties, as they demonstrate a high range of values in plasma protein binding, the percent of drug eliminated by metabolism or unchanged in the urine and hepatic extraction ratio. [...] Each of the β-blockers possesses at least one chiral centre and {{a high degree of}} enantioselectivity when binding to the β-adrenergic receptor. For those β-blockers containing a single chiral centre, the (-) enantiomer has a much higher affinity in binding to the β-adrenergic receptor than the (+) enantiomer. All β-blockers used systemically are delivered as racemate, except for timolol.|$|E
2500|$|Tryptophan and 5-HTP are {{precursors}} to serotonin and {{can cause}} a rise in serotonin. [...] When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, {{this can lead to}} levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRI's are taken with SRA's (Serotonin Releasing Agents) such {{as in the case of}} MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated due an SRA, since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less Serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact <b>pharmacodynamic</b> effects of Citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>pharmacodynamic</b> {{response}} to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an agonist or an antagonist. [...] For example, the supraspinal analgesic properties of the opioid agonist morphine are mediated by activation of the μ1 receptor; respiratory depression and physical dependence by the μ2 receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the κ receptor. [...] Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ1 and μ2 for example) providing even more [...] specific responses. [...] Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (e.g. the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid morphine exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while ketazocine exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors. [...] It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, {{each with its own}} unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as N-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmacodynamic</b> (PD) {{biomarkers}} {{can measure}} the direct interaction between {{a drug and}} its receptor. <b>Pharmacodynamic</b> biomarkers reveal drug mechanisms, if the drug has its intended effect on the biology of the disease, ideal biological dosing concentrations, and physiologic response/resistance mechanisms. <b>Pharmacodynamic</b> biomarkers are particularly relevant in drug mechanisms of tumor cells, where <b>pharmacodynamic</b> endpoints for drug interventions can be assessed directly on tumor tissues. For example, protein phosphorylation biomarkers indicate alterations in target protein kinases and activation of downstream signaling molecules.|$|E
50|$|If two {{individuals}} {{have the same}} blood level of a medication there may still be differences {{in the way that}} the body responds due to <b>pharmacodynamic</b> differences; <b>pharmacodynamic</b> responses may also be influenced by racial and cultural factors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmacodynamic</b> {{tolerance}} {{begins when}} the cellular {{response to a}} substance is reduced with repeated use. A common cause of <b>pharmacodynamic</b> tolerance is high concentrations of a substance constantly binding with the receptor, desensitizing it through constant interaction. Other possibilities include a reduction in receptor density (usually associated with receptor agonists), or other mechanisms leading to changes in action potential firing rate. <b>Pharmacodynamic</b> tolerance to a receptor antagonist involves the reverse, i.e., increased receptor firing rate, an increase in receptor density, or other mechanisms.|$|E
