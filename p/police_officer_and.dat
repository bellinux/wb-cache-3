40|$|The current {{research}} examined {{the influence of}} prior relationship on perceptions of stalking, and compared the perceptions of laypersons, nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> <b>and</b> specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> Two studies employed experimental designs where participants were presented with one of three vignettes in which {{the nature of the}} prior relationship was manipulated so that the perpetrator and victim were portrayed as strangers, acquaintances, or ex-partners. Participants comprised 101 nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 108 laypersons in Study 1, <b>and</b> 49 specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 49 nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Study 2. Findings indicate that nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> laypersons shared the common misperception that stranger stalkers present a greater threat to the personal safety of their victims than acquaintance or ex-partner stalkers. Specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> were less susceptible to common misperceptions and believed that intervention was more necessary. Specialist <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> also believed that the perpetrator’s behavior would cause the victim more alarm or personal distress than nonspecialist <b>police</b> <b>officers...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles <b>police</b> <b>officer,</b> <b>and</b> several psychics.

James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
