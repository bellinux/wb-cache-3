40|$|This study {{describes}} a new back-to-back static synchronous compensator (BTB STATCOM) system with asymmetrically structured converters and develops its mathematical model. BTB STATCOM uses pulse-width modulation technology for a rectifier station along with multipulse technology for an inverter station. The authors propose a control {{strategy for the}} following three control variables: DC voltage and both active and reactive rectifier powers. In the rectifier station, input-output linearisation via the feedback control law is applied for independent control of the active and reactive powers. Conversely, the controller is not applicable for maintaining the DC voltage because of its irregularity. They design an alternative indirect damping controller for the reactive current within the inverter station. The proposed controller improves the stability margin and decreases the oscillation of DC voltage with a degraded reactive current tracking performance of the inverter. Using simulation, they validate the proposed method, comparing its effectiveness {{to that of a}} <b>proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative</b> <b>controller.</b> They investigate the semi-globally exponential stability of the damped internal dynamics using a parameter-dependent Lyapunov (PDL) function. Using a composite Lyapunov function based on the PDL function, the uniform boundedness of the output regulation error as well as the closed-loop stability is established.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for designing feedback control systems using frequency domain models, a quadratic cost function, and a parameter optimization computer program. FORTRAN listings {{for the computer}} program are included. The approach {{is applied to the}} design of shock position controllers for a supersonic inlet. Deterministic or random system disturbances, and the presence of random measurement noise are considered. The cost function minimization is formulated in the time domain, but the problem solution is obtained using a frequency domain system description. A scaled and constrained conjugate gradient algorithm is used for the minimization. The approach to a supersonic inlet included the calculations of the optimal proportional-plus integral (PI) and <b>proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative</b> <b>controllers.</b> A single-loop PI controller was the most desirable of the designs considered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to design the}} controllers like Adaptive PI, Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) for the conical tank (Non-linear Process) to maintain the liquid level in tank. The level control becomes quite typical due to the nonlinear shape of tank i. e. the rate of rise {{of water in the}} narrow part is high and gets reduced as height increases thus causing non-linearity in the level. The time constant and gain vary as a function of level. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are widely used in many industrial control systems for several decades. Fuzzy logic {{is one of the most}} successful applications of fuzzy set in which the variables are linguistic rather than numeric. The design of intelligent control systems has become an area of intense research interest. The development of an effective methodology for the design of such control systems undoubtedly requires the synthesis of many concepts from artificial intelligence. The most commonly used controller in the industry field is the <b>proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative</b> (PID) <b>controller.</b> Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) provides an alternative to PID controller, especially when the available system models are inexact or unavailable. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is based on a set of control rules (fuzzy rules) among linguistic variables...|$|R

Also rapid advances in digital technologies have given designers the option of implementing controllers using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which depends on parallel programming. This method has many advantages over classical microprocessors. In this research, A model of the fuzzy PID control system is implemented in real time with a Xilinx FPGA (Spartan- 3 A, Xilinx Company, 2007). It is introduced to maintain a constant speed to when the load varies.,The model of a DC motor is considered as a second order system with load variation as a an example for complex model systems. For comparison purpose, two widely used controllers “PID and Fuzzy” have been implemented in the same FPGA card to examine the performance of the proposed system. These controllers have been tested using Matlab/Simulink program under speed and load variation conditions. The controllers were implemented to run the motor as real time application under speed and load variation conditions and showed the superiority of Fuzzy-PID...|$|R
