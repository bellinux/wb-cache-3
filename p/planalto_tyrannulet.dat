50|$|The Yungas tyrannulet {{resembles the}} <b>planalto</b> <b>tyrannulet,</b> {{but has a}} {{different}} voice. Being recently described {{it has not yet}} been rated by BirdLife International; however, it has been suggested it should be considered vulnerable, because it occurs in low densities within a small range that is subjected to extensive habitat destruction.|$|E

50|$|The <b>planalto</b> <b>tyrannulet</b> (Phyllomyias fasciatus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is {{widespread}} in wooded habitats of eastern Brazil, extreme north-eastern Bolivia, eastern Paraguay, and far north-eastern Argentina. It is generally common (typically the commonest Phyllomyias in its range), and consequently rated as least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN. There are three relatively distinctive subspecies, differing in measurements, plumage and voice, {{and it is possible}} they are better regarded as separate species. It can be separated from other members of its genus found in its range by the combination of a greyish-tinged forecrown and an all-black bill.|$|E
