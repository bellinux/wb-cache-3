40|$|This thesis explores three {{spin-off}} novels {{inspired by}} Jane Austen s Pride and Prejudice, Alexandra <b>Potter</b> <b>s</b> Me and Mr Darcy, Shannon Winslow s The Darcys of Pemberley and Maya Slater s The Private Diary of Mr Darcy. Through close-readings {{of the character}} of Mr Darcy, and comparing and contrasting the re-interpretations of him with the original character in Pride and Prejudice, I argue that by taking it upon themselves to give Mr Darcy a new story and a new life they are taking an active role in reading Pride and Prejudice and making the change from reader to author. I argue that the authors have taken liberties in changing the character in order to make him more compatible with the fantasies they are trying to fulfill. My analysis has shown how the authors of these novels show loyalty to the character and to Austen herself, by defending his actions and arrogance, and how his arrogance and pride survive the re-imaginings of his character. Through giving Mr Darcy a new story and new destiny, the authors are contributing in keeping the character, and the original novel, alive beyond the original pages of Pride and Prejudice. This thesis is inspired by the field of reception study devoted to Pride and Prejudice and a suggestion to future focus on spin-off literature and fan-fiction in this field...|$|R
