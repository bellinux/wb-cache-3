50|$|Veronica peregrina is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by several common names including neckweed, American speedwell, <b>purslane</b> <b>speedwell</b> and hairy <b>purslane</b> <b>speedwell.</b> It is native to the Americas, and is known on other continents as an introduced species and a common weed. It can be weedy in its native range as well, growing on roadsides, on fields, and in other disturbed habitat. It is an annual herb growing from a taproot. The two subspecies are defined generally {{on the basis of}} hairiness: ssp. xalapensis is coated in glandular hairs and ssp. peregrina is a hairless variety. The plant produces erect stems up to about 30 centimeters tall. The leaves vary in shape from linear to lance-shaped to spoon-shaped with smooth or serrated edges; the lower leaves are borne on petioles. The inflorescence is a loose terminal raceme of flowers and lance-shaped bracts. The flowers are generally white and 2 or 3 millimeters wide.|$|E

The objectives of first study were {{to determine the}} diversity and abundance of WAW and to evaluate the effect of delaying herbicide applications on nitrogen supply and no-till corn response. Research was conducted in 2010 and 2011 at 14 sites in eastern Kansas. A factorial arrangement of three herbicide application dates (Nov. -Mar., April, and May) and five N rates were used. The three most abundant WAW across sites were henbit, <b>purslane</b> <b>speedwell,</b> and horseweed. Delaying herbicide application until April significantly reduced early corn N uptake by 52 mg N plant- 1, chlorophyll meter readings at silking by 3. 4 %, and grain yield by 0. 48 Mg ha- 1 across sites. An additional 16 to 17 kg N ha- 1 was needed to maintain yield if herbicide application was delayed until April. Starter and foliar micronutrient fertilization can potentially increase corn and soybean yield. The objectives of the second study were to evaluate crop response from combinations of starter and foliar fertilizers that contain N-P-K mixtures with and without a blend of micronutrients at four sites for each crop under irrigated conditions. No early corn growth or yield increase was attributed to application of micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B) {{beyond what was achieved}} with N-P-K starter fertilization. There was an increase in soybean height (8 cm) and yield (293 kg ha- 1) with starter fertilizer containing N-P-K plus micronutrients over the control. No increase in corn or soybean yield was obtained with foliar fertilization. The objective of the third study was to compare soil mobility and changes in soybean nutrient concentration in the leaf and seed from Mn and Zn sources (EDTA and oxysulfate) at two sites. Zinc sources were more mobile in the soil. Both Zn sources increased seed Zn concentration. Manganese oxysulfate increased seed Mn concentration. However, soybean trifoliolate leaf and seed Mn concentration decreased with soil-applied Na 2 EDTA and MnEDTA. This response was attributed to formation of FeEDTA and increased Fe supply that reduced root Mn absorption. Manganese EDTA is not recommended for soil application...|$|E
