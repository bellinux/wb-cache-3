Cassava roots {{are known to be}} low in micronutrients such as vitamin A, iron, and zinc. Micronutrient deficiencies threaten the lives of millions of poor households and those located in remote rural areas of SSA often not targeted by fortification programmes. This paper presents results from an ex-ante evaluation of nutrition and health benefits of increased vitamin A status of cassava roots through biofortification for at-risk-target-groups using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) approach. Results showed that Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) causes an annual loss of about 553, 000 years of “healthy ” life in Nigeria with children constituting more than forty percent. Biofortified cassava would reduce VAD by 4. 42 %, 11. 73 %, and 3. 14 % for children, pregnant women, and lactating women respectively in the <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario.</b> Results for the optimistic scenario are 28. 79 %, 76. 39, and 20. 45 % respectively. The biofortification of cassava roots would result in annual gains of about 33, 000 years of “healthy”life and avert 166 child deaths per year for the <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> and about 220, 000 years life and 1272 child deaths per year for the optimistic scenario.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate whether an informal care leave arrangement (ICLA) is socially profitable or not. A methodology for doing such an analysis is Cost-Benefit analysis where all social benefits and costs are estimated, so they can be subtracted to arrive at the net social value. In this study, due to severe data limitations, only some benefits and costs are included in our analysis, making it a restricted cost-benefit analysis. In addition, several assumptions are made to arrive at estimates for costs and benefits. The two main scenarios (the optimistic scenario and the <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario)</b> of our analysis differ with respect to which particular assumptions are made concerning (i) the average utilization of the informal leave care arrangement, (ii) the degree to which informal care postpones the need for formal institutional care, and (iii) how the employment participation rate is affected by the informal care leave arrangement. The annual net social value for an individual participating in the informal care leave arrangement for the two scenarios in our restricted cost-benefit analysis are: 4305 Norwegian kroner (optimistic scenario) and - 9243 Norwegian kroner (<b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario).</b> It follows that depending on the assumptions made, the informal care leave arrangement can be both socially profitable or/and socially unprofitable...|$|E

To cope with them, simulations were performed {{for the present}} and scenario-built weather conditions that include a <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> of precipitation decrease in the next 25 years. In a former study, the irrigation scheduling simulation model ISAREG was calibrated for two maize varieties: the water stress-resistant hybrid Kn- 2 L- 611 and the water stress-sensitive hybrid H 708. Both are subjects of this study, which compares four irrigation scheduling alternatives: (1) refilling the soil reservoir and adopting a management-allowed depletion fraction (MAD) of 0. 47; (2) refilling the soil reservoir and adopting MAD ¼ 0. 33; (3) partially refilling the soil reservoir and adopting MAD ¼ 0. 47; and (4) crop without irrigation. For the very dry year and the present climate all alternative irrigation schedules behave similarly but for the average year, alternatives 1 and 3, allowing a larger soil water depletion with MAD ¼ 0. 47, require less water than the alternative with MAD ¼ 0. 33. However, analysis of impact on yields using simulations relative to every year during 1970 – 1992 shows that alternative 2 leads to less impact on yields. The results of simulations were compared with irrigation schedules presently advised {{in the region and}} show that the latter do not fully cover crop requirements in dry seasons, when some yield decrease occurs. Simulations for the <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario</b> show that all three irrigation scheduling alternatives can easily accommodate the foreseen changes mainly by selecting suitable irrigation dates. The results of simulations do not allow selecting one among the three alternatives as the best irrigation scheduling strategy but are useful for later building an information system for farmers using actual weather data. Relative to the rainfed crop, the results indicate that yield impacts highly increase for the <b>pessimistic</b> <b>scenario,</b> particularly for the water stresssensitive hybrid H 708. The results indicate that vulnerability to climate change is higher for non-irrigated crops and that coping with possible rainfall decreases requires adopting less sensitive crop varieties, including when deficit irrigation would be applied for water saving...|$|E
