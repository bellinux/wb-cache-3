5000|$|Unlike {{some other}} markets, such as stocks and shares, the {{majority}} of transactions in the <b>philatelic</b> or <b>stamp</b> market take place informally, by mail order or in retail environments, and therefore {{the size of the}} market is difficult to determine.

[...] The number of collectors worldwide was estimated at 30 million in 2004. In 2009, Adrian Roose of Stanley Gibbons estimated the figure at 48 million including 18 million in China. It is not known how many of these are serious collectors.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{stocks and}} shares, the {{majority}} of transactions in the <b>philatelic</b> or <b>stamp</b> market take place informally, by mail order, or in retail environments, and therefore {{the size of the}} market is hard to determine. The market is certainly much smaller than the financial markets but it is not trivial. It has been estimated at £5 Billion. The majority of these transactions, however, are likely to be low value items rather than investments. In a 2007 interview, Mike Hall of Stanley Gibbons estimated that [...] "About $1 billion of rare stamps trade annually in the $10 billion-a-year stamp market."
