40|$|Kaolinite {{intercalation}} compounds {{were prepared}} by intercalating fatty acids and quaternary ammonium salts into kaolinite layers, using methanol-grafted kaolinite as the precursor. Meanwhile, massive lamellas were exfoliated during the intercalation process. The interlayer structure, chemical bonding and morphology of kaolinite {{before and after}} intercalation were characterized in detail. As the alkyl chain length increases, the basal spacing of kaolinite increases gradually. The morphology analysis indicated that the ionic type of intercalation agent has a more important influence on the morphology change of kaolinite than their alkyl chain length. The initial kaolinite layers were mostly transformed into nanoscrolls in the product intercalated with stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (STAC).

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, the {{suitable}} arrangement of probes to measure case depth of shaft-like materials by using four-point probes method was considered. In the induction hardening process, case depth {{is essential for}} its quality control. It needs great time and labor to measure hardness distribution in the sectional area with cutting the samples. In the previous paper, we have proposed a procedure to evaluate case depth of shaft-like materials by using four-point probes method. This study was aimed at enhancement of sensitivity of evaluation. The potential drop for various probe arrangements {{on the surface of}} shaft-like materials was analyzed by using finite element method. The surface hardened shaft was modeled as a two layered structure having different electrical resistivity in surface hardened layer and inner untreated part. The value of resistivity obtained from experiment using carbon steel was used for numerical calculation.

In particular the work is aimed at optimising the probe geometry in order to improve the probe response both in terms of linearity and in terms of spatial resolution to step changes in phase distribution.

40|$|Raman {{scattering}} in {{optical fibres}} {{provides a means}} of measuring continuous temperature distributions over extended distances. However, in many applications {{it has been found}} that the background transmission properties of the optical fibre either change after deployment of the fibre or vary over time due to ageing effects. Changes in the fibre transmission can be distinguished from thermal effects by measuring the Rayleigh backscatter, which is relatively insensitive to temperature. The combined use of Raman and Rayleigh data is discussed here {{in the context of a}} particularly simple and cost-effective sensor design, where a single, fixed optical filter and a single light source are used for both measurement modes. The Rayleigh backscatter measurement allows the accurate correction of background transmission changes in a <b>probe</b> <b>arrangement</b> that includes several splices between different fibres with different attenuations. In this way, the temperature in a 290 °C test region is accurately recovered from the anti-Stokes Raman signal.

40|$|A tapered plastic {{multimode}} fiber (PMMA) optical sensor is proposed and demonstrated for continuous monitoring of solutions based on different concentration of sodium chloride and glucose in deionized water The tapered PMMA fiber was fabricated using an etching method involving deionized water and acetone {{to achieve a}} waist diameter and length of 0. 45 mm and 10 mm, respectively, and was used to investigate the effect of straight, U-shape, and knot shape against concentration for both sodium chloride and glucose. The results {{show that there is}} a strong dependence of the electrolytic and non-electrolytic nature of the chemical solutions on the sensor output. It is found that the sensitivity of the sodium chloride concentration sensor with the straight tapered fiber probe was 0. 0023 mV/%, which was better than the other <b>probe</b> <b>arrangements</b> of U-shape and knot. Meanwhile, the glucose sensor performs with the highest sensitivity of 0. 0026 mV/wt % with the knot-shaped tapered fiber probe. In addition, a tapered PMMA probe which was coated by silver film was fabricated and demonstrated using calcium hypochlorite (G 70) solution. The working mechanism of such a device is based on the observed increment in the transmission of the sensor that is immersed in solutions of higher concentration. As the concentration varies from 0 ppm to 6 ppm, the output voltage of the sensor increases linearly from 3. 61 mV to 4. 28 mV with a sensitivity of 0. 1154 mV/ppm and a linearity of more than 99. 47 %.

The In 2 S 3 and ZnS nd layers were prepared by the spray ion layer gas reaction ILGAR technique from Indium chloride InCl 3, Indium acetylacetonate In acac 3 and Zinc acetylacetonate, respectively. The surface photovoltage signals of Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 were larger for the Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 ZnS nd In 2 S 3 than for the Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 In 2 S 3 layer system showing that a ZnS nd layer additionally passivated the Cu In,Ga S,Se 2 surface.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the frontal and sensorimotor cortices and motor learning, hemodynamic responses were recorded from the frontal and sensorimotor cortices using functional near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while healthy subjects performed motor learning tasks used in rehabilitation medicine. Whole-head NIRS recordings indicated that response latencies in the anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (aDMPFC) were shorter than in other frontal and parietal areas. Furthermore, the increment rate of the hemodynamic responses in the aDMPFC across the 8 repeated trials significantly correlated with those in the other areas, {{as well as with the}} improvement rate of task performance across the 8 repeated trials. In the second experiment, to dissociate scalp- and brain-derived hemodynamic responses, hemodynamic responses were recorded from the head over the aDMPFC using a multi-distance <b>probe</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Six probes (a single source probe and 5 detectors) were linearly placed 6 mm apart from each of the neighboring probes. Using independent component analyses of hemodynamic signals from the 5 source-detector pairs, we dissociated scalp- and brain-derived components of the hemodynamic responses. Hemodynamic responses corrected for scalp-derived responses over the aDMPFC significantly increased across the 8 trials and correlated with task performance. In the third experiment, subjects were required to perform the same task with and without transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the aDMPFC before the task.

40|$|Case-mounted fiber-optic sensors {{have been}} used by {{aircraft}} engine manufacturers mainly to monitor blade vibration in fans and compressors. The simplest <b>probe</b> <b>arrangement</b> is a spot probe where, typically, a center fiber transmits laser light, and the outer fibers collect the reflected light from the blade tips and transmit it to a photodetector. Because the spot of incident light is fixed in space, whereas the blade deflects dynamically, the reflected light will originate from slightly different portions of the blade tip under different operating conditions. Unless corrections are developed to compensate for this effect, some error in vibratory tangential amplitude will occur. For monitoring vibrations, this error is usually not critical. However, when steady-state blade deflections are being measured, {{it is very important to}} fix the spot on the blade tip at a particular location because the operating speed blade deflections are evaluated against a low-speed reference run. The change in speed usually implies a significant change in the blade orientation and possibly its shape brought about by the aerodynamic and centrifugal loading. It is most convenient to select the blade s leading and trailing edges as the fixed points for which deflections will be evaluated. To capture the blade edges at various speeds, the light probe must be movable. This was achieved by mounting the probe in an eccentric hole in a bushing that fit the fan case in the region that overlapped the path of the blade edge. The probe was actuated to search for a blade edge while all the blades were viewed on an oscilloscope. The blade edge was considered to be captured when a pulse associated with a particular blade was significantly reduced in magnitude but was clearly distinguishable from the background noise level. By tracing the axial position of either blade edge, one could extend the deflection measurement to two dimensions: axial and tangential. These blade deflection measurements were obtained during a wind tunnel test of a fan prototype...|$|E

40|$|Particle {{concentration}} measurements with underwing probes on {{aircraft are}} impacted by air compression upstream {{of the instrument}} body {{as a function of}} flight velocity. In particular for fast-flying aircraft the necessity arises to account for compression of the air sample volume. Hence, a correction procedure is needed to invert measured particle number concentrations to ambient conditions that is commonly applicable for different instruments to gain comparable results. In the compression region where the detection of particles occurs (i. e. under factual measurement conditions), pressure and temperature of the air sample are increased compared to ambient (undisturbed) conditions in certain distance away from the aircraft. Conventional procedures for scaling the measured number densities to ambient conditions presume that the particle penetration speed through the instruments' detection area equals the aircraft speed (True Air Speed, TAS). However, particle imaging instruments equipped with pitot-tubes measuring the Probe Air Speed (PAS) of each underwing probe reveal PAS values systematically below those of the TAS. We conclude that the deviation between PAS and TAS is mainly caused by the compression of the probed air sample. From measurements during two missions in 2014 with the German Gulfstream G- 550 (HALO – High Altitude LOng range) research aircraft we develop a procedure to correct the measured particle concentration to ambient conditions using a thermodynamic approach. With the provided equation the corresponding concentration correction factor ξ is applicable to the high frequency measurements of each underwing probe which is equipped with its own air speed sensor (e. g. a pitot-tube). ξ-values of 1 to 0. 85 are calculated for air speeds (i. e. TAS) between 60 and 260 m s− 1. From HALO data it is found that ξ does not significantly vary between the different deployed instruments. Thus, for the current HALO underwing probe configuration a parameterisation of ξ as a function of TAS is provided for instances if PAS measurements are lacking. The ξ-correction yields higher ambient particle concentration by about 15 – 25 % compared to conventional procedures – an improvement which can be considered as significant for many research applications. The calculated ξ-values are specifically related to the considered HALO underwing <b>probe</b> <b>arrangement</b> and may differ for other aircraft or instrument geometries. Moreover, the ξ-correction may not cover all impacts originating from high flight velocities and from interferences between the instruments and, e. g., the aircraft wings and/or fuselage. Consequently, it is important that PAS (as a function of TAS) is individually measured by each probe deployed underneath the wings of a fast-flying aircraft...|$|E
