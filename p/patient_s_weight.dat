40|$|Generally, {{there are}} two {{criteria}} which are widely used to determineDM 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weight</b> of interest, i. e. competenceand consensus. Various studies related to determine DM 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weight</b> of interest based on competence or consensusseparately have been conducted. Each criterion has its own advantages. The advantage of using competence as acriterion is DMs who have high competence based on their consistence on the decisions made will have high of interest weight. Meanwhile, consensus criterion emphasizes a DM/s contribution to a group without consideringthe DM 2 ̆ 7 s ability or competence. Considering the advantages of both criteria, this study developed a model to determine DM 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weight</b> of interestby considering the DM 2 ̆ 7 competence and consensus in a GDM. This study used 2 group decision making cases totaling in 6 groups consisting of 5 people each. Collected data was then processedusing DM 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weight</b> of interest determination method based on competence and consensus. A model was thendesigned using regression method and fuzzy method. Therefore, a model to determine DM 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weight</b> of interest was obtained by considering competence and consensus.

Maternal figures perceptions were then compared to their child <b>s</b> actual <b>weight</b> status. Factors that influence maternal figures perceptions were examined through focus groups discussions with maternal figures at four Merced County Head Start Centers.

40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human <b>patient</b> (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|R

This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of methazolamide, an anti-carbonic anhydrase drug, for treating patients with AS. Methods: Two <b>patients,</b> called as <b>S</b> and L, were diagnosed with active AS based on BASDAI and BASFI assessments, radiographic data and other clinical indices. They took methazolamide tablets at a dose of 25 mg twice every day. Results : <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASDAI score fell from 5. 4 to 4. 4, while patient L's BASDAI fell from 2. 4 to 2. <b>Patient</b> <b>S's</b> BASFI score change from 2. 7 to 2. 9, while patient L's BASFI score fell from 1. 2 to 0. 2.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{function}} of conflict prevention performed by keywords and key-expressions within medical consultations. Doctor-patient interaction within medical consultations {{can be interpreted as}} a problem-solving discussion, as it is oriented to the solution of a certain health problem. As such, medical consultations are based on an argumentative discussion, in which, roughly speaking, both parties try to reason together in order to find a solution for the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health problem. In this sense, a non-mixed dispute (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004) often arises, in which doctor and patient discuss a standpoint, normally advanced by the doctor, about the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> diagnosis or therapy. Problem-solving, however, is not the only possible interaction scheme (Rigotti and Rocci 2006) that can be involved in doctor-patient consultations. Indeed, other more confrontational interaction schemes are possible, which may also tend to real controversies; these cases are often triggered by the asymmetry of competences and knowledge which is typical of the relationship between doctors and patients. Such situations, of course, affect the quality of the consultation, because the issue at stake ceases to be the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health, and becomes the relationship between the patient and the doctor (in terms of trust, reliability, etc.). Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health and, thus, more in general, may contradict the raison d être of the health system. Thus during the medical consultation conflicts need to be avoided both by doctor and patient. The choice of keywords and key-expressions appears to be a crucial step within a strategy of conflict prevention. In fact, thanks to their close link to the relevant endoxa, their ability to trigger inferences, and their centrality within the argumentative structure of persuasive texts, keywords can be very important tools in the creation of emotive arguments and the prevention of conflict. Relying on examples from real-life consultations, this paper shows how keywords and key-expressions realize this function...|$|R
