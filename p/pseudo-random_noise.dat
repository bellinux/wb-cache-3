Those for any particular geographical area can be easily calculated by comparing the GPS-measured position to a known surveyed location. This correction is also valid for other receivers in the same general location. Several systems send this information over radio or other links to allow L1-only receivers to make ionospheric corrections. The ionospheric data are transmitted via satellite in Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) (available in North America and Hawaii), EGNOS (Europe and Asia) or Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) (Japan), which transmits it on the GPS frequency using a special <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>noise</b> sequence (PRN), so only one receiver and antenna are required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{possible}} idea {{is presented}} here for deal-ing with clock skew problems on synchronous digital sys-tems. Nakao et al. recently reported that independent neu-ral oscillators can be synchronized by applying temporal random impulses to the oscillators [1]. We regard neural oscillators as independent clock sources on LSIs; i. e., clock sources are distributed on LSIs, {{and they are}} forced to syn-chronize through the use of random noises. We designed neuron-based clock generators operating at sub-RF region (< 1 GHz) by modifying the original neuron model to a new model that is suitable for CMOS implementation with 0. 25 -µm CMOS parameters. Through circuit simulations, we demonstrate that the clock generators are certainly syn-chronized by <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>noises.</b> 1...|$|R

The system shares {{the advantages of}} the correlating receiver of the direct sequence spread spectrum system and COFDkt modul-ation. A feature of the new system is the use of a <b>pseudo-random</b> Gaussian <b>noise</b> signal as a channel sounding probe to measure the complex channel transfer jimction for frequency domain equalization. The equalizer uses the least squares auto-regressive algorithm, which has been modtJied to accommodate the multi-carrier OFDM signal structure for frequency domain equalization. In this paper, an outline {{of the structure of the}} COFDM system and the method of frequency domain equalization are described.

The theoretical advantages regarding dynamical consistency are surveyed, applying equally well to the square root method in the analysis step. A fundamental problem due to the limited size of the ensemble subspace is discussed, and novel solutions that complement the core method are suggested and studied.

40|$|Superconducting {{circuits}} with Josephson junctions {{are promising}} candidates for developing future quantum technologies. Of particular interest {{is to use}} these circuits to study effects that typically occur in complex condensed-matter systems. Here we employ a superconducting quantum bit—a transmon—to perform an analogue simulation of motional averaging, a phenomenon initially observed in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. By modulating the flux bias of a transmon with controllable <b>pseudo-random</b> telegraph <b>noise</b> we create a stochastic jump of its energy level separation between two discrete values. When the jumping is faster than a dynamical threshold set by the frequency displacement of the levels, the initially separate spectral lines merge into a single, narrow, motional-averaged line. With sinusoidal modulation a complex pattern of additional sidebands is observed. We show that the modulated system remains quantum coherent, with modified transition frequencies, Rabi couplings, and dephasing rates. These results represent the first steps towards more advanced quantum simulations using artificial atoms. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Stimuli were displayed on Sony GDM-C 250 calibrated monitor, driven by an Apple G 5 PowerPC running Matlab 7 (Mathworks, Inc.). The Psychtoolbox library [1, 2] was used for stimulus control. For the purposes of the categorization task, <b>pseudo-random</b> Gaussian <b>noise</b> was added to the stimuli. We represented stimuli as vectors of luminance values, with a value of 0 standing for the background luminance, and- 1 and 1 standing for the lowest and highest luminance values achievable on the monitor, respectively. Stimuli were generated by summing the template and noise components s = t + n (1. 1) where s is the stimulus, t the template, and n the noise. The vector n had independent and identically distributed Gaussian elements with mean 0 and standard deviation σ. To avoid clipping luminance values because of the limited range of computer monitors, we kept template contrast very low, so that low noise contrasts would be sufficient to induce less-than-perfect performance. ...|$|R

Seven subjects aged 22 - 48 years with normal vision were tested binocularly. Motion onset and motion reversal were employed as modes of stimulus presentation. For both, <b>pseudo-random</b> one-dimensional <b>noise</b> patterns whose peak power was at 5. 2, 2. 6, 1. 3, 0. 325 and 0. 1625 cycles per degree (cpd) were stimuli. Contrasts were 70 % and 5 %. Active electrodes were placed at Oz, 5 cm to the left of Oz, 5 cm to the right of Oz and a frontal midline position (Fpz) and referenced to linked mastoids. Transient motion reversal elicited a prominent positive response present in all subjects and at low contrasts. Motion onset VEPs have a complex waveform which may be either predominantly positive or negative. The most important variables in determining whether a prominent positivity or negativity is present in the motion onset VEP are the contrast and the spatial frequencies.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this program}} were: to verify the model of off schedule compressor variable geometry in the T 700 turboshaft engine nonlinear model; {{to evaluate the use}} of the <b>pseudo-random</b> binary <b>noise</b> (PRBN) technique for obtaining engine frequency response data; and to design a high performance power turbine speed governor using modern control methods. Reduction of T 700 engine test data generated at NASA-Lewis indicated that the off schedule variable geometry effects were accurate as modeled. Analysis also showed that the PRBN technique combined with the maximum likelihood model identification method produced a Bode frequency response that was as accurate as the response obtained from standard sinewave testing methods. The frequency response verified the accuracy of linear models consisting of engine partial derivatives and used for design. A power turbine governor was designed using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method of full state feedback control. A Kalman filter observer was used to estimate helicopter main rotor blade velocity. Compared to the baseline T 700 power turbine speed governor, the LQR governor reduced droop up to 25 percent for a 490 shaft horsepower transient in 0. 1 sec simulating a wind gust, and up to 85 percent for a 700 shaft horsepower transient in 0. 5 sec simulating a large collective pitch angle transient...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} article (Duifhuis, 1970) results' concerning the audibility of harmonics in a periodic pulse have been presented. Each {{of the lower}} harmonics could be perceived separately, whereas the high harmonics were heard together as one complex signal. High harmonics, however, appeared to be perceptible as a part-tone (see P. 12) they were spectrally suppressed. This phenomenon was attributed to time analysis, the resolving power of which increases with decreasing frequency resolution, and conversely. The present experiment is meant to give additional {{evidence in support of}} the previous findings. Therefore, we carried out a similar experiment using stimuli having the same frequency amplitude spectrum as the periodic pulse, but with a different time pattern. For these stimuli we chose a special type of <b>pseudo-random</b> binary <b>noise,</b> built up out of maximum length sequences (see, e. g., Golomb, 1967; Bilsen, 1967). The period T of the noise was variable. For the sequence length we chose 27 - 1 127. This value determines the envelope of the frequency amplitude spectrum of the periodic noise. With the chosen value this spectrum is flat up to the 50 th harmonic. The difference with a periodic pulse is found in the phase spectrum (and in the time pattern). The phases of the harmonics of periodic noise are pseudo-randomly distributed whereas the harmonics of a periodic pulse have equal phases. To the extent that the ear performs an analysis of the frequency power spectrum, there should be no difference between the audibility of harmonics in either periodic noise or in periodic pulses. In case of time analysis, however, considerable discrepancies are likely to be found...|$|R
