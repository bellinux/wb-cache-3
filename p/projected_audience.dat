40|$|BACKGROUND: Clark and Wells' {{cognitive}} model of social anxiety proposes that socially anxious individuals have negative expectations of performance {{prior to a}} social event, focus their attention predominantly on themselves and on their negative self-evaluations during an event, and use this negative self-processing to infer that other people are judging them harshly. AIMS: The present study tested these propositions. METHOD: The study used a community sample of 161 adolescents aged 14 - 18 years. The participants gave a speech {{in front of a}} pre-recorded audience acting neutrally, and participants were aware that the <b>projected</b> <b>audience</b> was pre-recorded. RESULTS: As expected, participants with higher levels of social anxiety had more negative performance expectations, higher self-focused attention, and more negative perceptions of the audience. Negative performance expectations and self-focused attention were found to mediate the relationship between social anxiety and audience perception. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support Clark and Wells' {{cognitive model}} of social anxiety, which poses that socially anxious individuals have distorted perceptions of the responses of other people because their perceptions are coloured by their negative thoughts and feelings...|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{explored}} the utility {{and meaning of}} the imaginary audience phenomenon among college students. Study 1 examined {{the psychometric properties of}} the Imaginary Audience Scale used for college student samples. The second study correlated imaginary audience scores with a global measure of personality and also compared the accuracy of self measures, social anxiety measures, and a measure of formal reasoning to predict imaginary audience scores. Results indicated that Imaginary Audience Scale scores met conventional standards of validity and reliability in these samples of postadolescent indi-viduals. As expected, imaginary audience behavior was related to measures of social anxiety, the self, and personality. Furthermore, imaginary audience scores were more strongly related to these measures than to an index of formal reasoning. These results suggest that imaginary audience experiences that persist into late adolescence and early adulthood may {{have more to do with}} social anxiety than with cognitive development.

40|$|Focusing on the Southern Plains in {{the nineteenth}} century, Jacki Rand proposes a study on Kiowa {{responses}} to military invasion and the reservation system as a colonized people reacting against a colonizing agent. Additionally, Rand alludes to her investigation yielding new insight as Kiowa reactions to colonialism were in essence covert strategies of adaptation and maintaining traditional cultural values {{in the face of}} repeated onslaught. For some, however, this argument will fall somewhat short of these goals. One of the difficulties in assessing the contribution of Rand 2 ̆ 7 s study is determining its <b>projected</b> <b>audience.</b> She begins her narrative with a jargoned and rather turgid section that highlights the major theoretical 2 ̆ 2 buzzwords 2 ̆ 2 without providing either a clear definition or interpretation of these terms or how they will apply to her investigation.

Additionally, the first chapter is also indicative in some ways of Rand 2 ̆ 7 s oversimplification of certain issues. For example, she states 2 ̆ 2 U.

40|$|Dougal Graham’s Full, Particular and True Account of the Rebellion in the Years 1745 - 46 is a ‘forgotten’ text of {{considerable}} {{historical and cultural}} significance. Between Christmas and Candlemas of 1745 / 1746 the West Central Lowlands experienced {{the presence of the}} Jacobite army, with those retreating from Derby reinforced by new recruits from the north east and French and Irish forces – about 80, 000 in all. Quartered round Stirling in the depths of winter, this put considerable strain on local resources. With money and supplies from Glasgow, the rebels occupied Stirling, besieged the Castle, and fought off a British army at Falkirk, but then had to retreat north of the Forth, ultimately to face annihilation {{at the hands of the}} Duke of Cumberland. The Account was composed by an inhabitant of Stirlingshire and published in Glasgow six months after Culloden. It seems to be the earliest connected narrative of the 1745 Rebellion produced in Scotland. The text shows clear evidence that the target audience was not a literary, or even necessarily literate elite, but the ‘meaner sort’ in the Glasgow hinterland, routinely supplied by chapmen with such cheap ‘sma’ books’. The Account reads almost like a special supplement for a 1746 tabloid. Unashamedly populist, it provides acceptably accurate information, entertainment, and a degree of sectarian triumphalism. It is journalistic, racy and fast moving with most of the editorial comment (in the form of supplementary poems) added at the end so as not to impede the action. The language is a somewhat archaic demotic Scots, written in the form of octosyllabic couplets, as used by Blind Harry and David Lyndsay, apparently the preferred reading matter of potential customers. This thesis will argue that since Dougal Graham’s Account can reasonably be regarded as reflecting the views of its projected clientele, the common people of the western Lowlands, it is scarcely feasible to achieve a full picture of Scotland in the aftermath of the rising without considering the text. It is therefore unfortunate that it was regarded as lost throughout the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and ignored in the twentieth. This thesis presents the first modern edition of Graham’s Account, in the form of a glossed and annotated transcript of the 1746 edition. The introductory essay considers myths about the author that developed in the subsequent century, and which are entirely at odds with a reading of the material. It looks at the way the book was promoted, both in contemporary advertising and in the prefatory material within the text, and goes on to consider the <b>projected</b> <b>audience</b> and potential customer base. Finally the circumstances surrounding the publication of the second edition are investigated, throwing further light on the situation in Scotland seven years after Culloden...|$|E
