The keyer is designed to hold a video screen (below the keyer) and a <b>photographic</b> flash <b>lamp</b> (above the keyer).|$|R
50|$|Sealed Ni-Cd cells {{may be used}} individually, or {{assembled}} into {{battery packs}} containing two or more cells. Small cells are used for portable electronics and toys (such as solar garden lights), often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells. When Ni-Cd batteries are substituted for primary cells, the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells. Miniature button cells are sometimes used in <b>photographic</b> equipment, hand-held <b>lamps</b> (flashlight or torch), computer-memory standby, toys, and novelties.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} report [1], we introduced {{the application of}} thermal wave imaging to adhesion disbonds and corrosion in aircraft. In the present paper, we describe the application of pulse-echo thermal wave imaging to NDT of aging aircraft. The technique uses high-power <b>photographic</b> flash <b>lamps</b> as a heat source and an IR video camera as a detector. The flash lamps launch pulses of heat into {{the skin of the}} aircraft and the IR camera images the returning thermal wave reflections from subsurface defects. The system also includes electronic hardware and software for carrying out the time-gated imaging and real time analysis of the defects. It also has the ability to image large areas in short times. The current inspection speed enables the imaging of over 90 feet of a 16 â€³ strip of aircraft per hour. Here we present some examples of airframe defects, both for metal and composite structures...|$|R
25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, {{the lifetime}} of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, <b>photographic,</b> and projection <b>lamps</b> may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.|$|R
