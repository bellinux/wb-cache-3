50|$|A {{high voltage}} power supply {{is one that}} outputs {{hundreds}} or thousands of volts. A special output connector is used that <b>prevents</b> <b>arcing,</b> insulation breakdown and accidental human contact.

Some high voltage power supplies provide an analog input {{that can be used to}} control the output voltage. High voltage power supplies are commonly used to accelerate and manipulate electron and ion beams in equipment such as x-ray generators, electron microscopes, and focused ion beam columns, and in a variety of other applications, including electrophoresis and electrostatics.|$|R

50|$|Undesired or {{unintended}} electric arcing {{can have}} detrimental effects {{on electric power}} transmission, distribution systems and electronic equipment. Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices susceptible to arcing are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for transient currents, <b>preventing</b> <b>arcing.</b> If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.|$|R

The twenty-four GaAs cathodes emit electrons in sequence, then are combined on axis by a rotating field (or 'funnelled'). In addition to its ultra-high vacuum requirements, the multicathode DC electron gun will place high demand on the electric field symmetry, the magnetic field shielding, and on <b>preventing</b> <b>arcing.</b> In this paper, we discuss our results from a 3 D simulation of the latest model for this gun.

40|$|Electrotransformation {{also known}} as {{electroporation}} is the most reliable and efficient tool for plasmid DNA uptake. Electrotransformation efficiency is function of many factors which include (1) number of cell washes prior to electroporation, (2) electroporation cell number, (3) electroporation DNA amount, and (4) cell growth phase. Those factors have limitedly been concomitantly investigated in E. coli DH 10 B strain. This study is aimed to explore above key factors to define the optimal conditions for high electrotransformation efficiency. The results showed that electrotransformation efficiency of E. coli DH 10 B was enhanced to 1. 5 x 10 (9) cfu/µg by washing cells three times with 15 ml of 10 % glycerol. This washed off extra salts from cell suspension and enhanced electrotransformation by <b>preventing</b> <b>arcing</b> and enhancing cell resistance while ensuring minimal level of conductivity. Early exponential phase at 0. 15 OD 600 was the best growth phase for enhancing electrotransformation of E. coli DH 10 B.

50|$|As the lineman {{approaches}} the wire, an arc will form between {{them as the}} worker is charged. This arc can be debilitating, and the worker must immediately bond himself electrically to the line to <b>prevent</b> further <b>arcing.</b> A worker may use a conducting wand during the approach to first make the connection.

This <b>prevents</b> any <b>arcing</b> on the power pins, prolonging their lifespan. The proximity detection pin is also connected to a switch that is triggered upon pressing the physical disconnect button when removing the connector from the vehicle. This causes the resistance to change on the proximity pin which commands the vehicle's onboard charger to stop drawing current immediately before the connector is pulled out.|$|R
50|$|E85 ethanol {{is used in}} engines {{modified}} to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas {{in countries such as}} Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare magnesium, aluminum, and rubber parts in the fuel system. Fuel injection control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). Stainless steel fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of terne fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to <b>prevent</b> <b>arcing,</b> as well as flame arrestors positioned in the tank's fill pipe, are sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Snubbers are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, snubbers will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. Snubbers are also often used to <b>prevent</b> <b>arcing</b> across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|E

40|$|Relays and {{switches}} {{are of interest}} in applications such as test equipment, radar, communications, and power systems, amongst others. Unlike solid state switches, mechanical relays provide galvanic isolation across the power ports. This characteristic is important because, for safety reasons, electrical codes stipulate that loads in certain power applications must be disconnected by open gaps. This requirement imposes significant isolation, heat dissipation, tribology and reliability constraints on a relay. The objective {{of this research is}} to explore power handling by a MEMS device in a relay context. This work presents concepts, analytical performance models, fabrication processes and design rules for MEMS relays capable of hot-switching inductive loads in power applications. To this end, a horizontal-displacement, electrostaticallyactuated, MEMS relay for make-break power switching applications is presented. The MEMS-relays are etched in (100) Si through a combination of KOH etching, and DRIE, bonded to a glass substrate, and plated with a 10 /pm thick buffer film of either copper or nickel-cobalt, and a 1 - 2 [mu]m thick film of a platinum-family metal such as palladium, rhodium, and alloyed palladium (palladium-cobalt). The relays feature { 111 }-plane silicon-etched electrical contacts. The { 111 }-plane contacts provide travel of 30 - 80 [mu]m, which <b>prevents</b> <b>arcing.</b> Their oblique geometry introduces contact wipe, which is known to enhance the contact reliability. Further, the contact geometry allows for an enhanced metallization process which provides lower on-state contact resistance than traditional horizontal displacement Mems-relays. Experimental relays exhibit a best-case total on-state contact resistance of 130 m[omega], a response time of 750 [mu]s, a settling time of 3 ms, electrical isolation in excess of 1 kV (tested to 997 V with available equipment), a hot switched current of 800 mA using resistive loads, and a hot switched current of 350 mA using a 1 mH inductive load. The relays have been hot-switched in excess of 10 ⁵ cycles without signs of performance degradation. by Alexis Christian Weber. Thesis (Ph. D.)
