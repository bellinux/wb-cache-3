5000|$|Wide format {{printers}} (large format printers) {{are generally}} accepted {{to be any}} computer-controlled printing machines (printers) that support a maximum <b>print</b> <b>roll</b> width of between 18" [...] and 100". Printers with capacities over 100" [...] wide are considered super wide or grand format. Wide format printers are used to print banners, posters, trade show graphics, wallpaper, murals, backlit film (duratrans), vehicle image wraps, electronic circuit schematics, architectural drawings, construction plans, backdrops for theatrical and media sets, and any other large format artwork or signage. Wide format printers usually employ some variant of inkjet technology to produce the printed image; and are more economical than other print methods such as screen printing for most short-run (low quantity) print projects, depending on print size, run length (quantity of prints per single original), {{and the type of}} substrate or print medium. Wide format printers are usually designed for printing onto a roll of print media that feeds incrementally during the print process, rather than onto individual sheets.|$|E
40|$|In 2008, a {{prototype}} machine demonstrating {{the application of}} roll-to-roll technology in micro-contact printing was developed. In this research, the prototype machine was upgraded by designing and machining a device that could fabricate a flat stamp with significantly less variance. The <b>print</b> <b>roll</b> wrapping system was reconfigured in order to capture the stamp with uniform force and good alignment. The motion control for the print roller and impression roller was also improved. In addition multi-layer printing with the updated machine was tested. This thesis focuses on the general design of the updated system and the measurement of key components of the systems {{as well as the}} print quality. Results demonstrate that the flat stamp can achieve the flatness of ± 16 [micro]m with thickness of 1194 [micro]m; that the wrapping process can guarantee a print roller roundness error in the 20 [micro]m range; that the distortion of the print using the updated system is approximately 3. 8. The multi-layer printing test did not achieve acceptable results owing to a lack of proper control of the machine. However, initial trials, achieved alignment errors of 1017 [micro]m along the printing direction and 113 [micro]m across the printing direction. by Wenzhuo Yang. Thesis (M. Eng.)

50|$|Another {{documented}} use of 1,2,3-TCP {{was as a}} “branching” or {{curing agent}} in polysulfide polymers (Kirk Othmer Chemical Encyclopedia, 2001). Polysulfide polymers {{have been used as}} the “standard sealant for virtually all aircraft fuel tanks and bodies” since the 1950s. Also, “one of the first large-scale applications of the liquid polysulfides was as a binder for rocket fuel,” from 1946 until 1958. Summary tables published by Kirk Othmer (2001) list the properties of a number of Morton Thiokol LP series of polysulfide polymer-based sealers, with concentrations of the branching agent (1,2,3-TCP) ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 percent. Liquid polysulfide polymers are used mainly as sealants in manufacturing applications, including applications related to double-paned windows, boat hulls and decks, <b>printing</b> <b>rolls,</b> integral aircraft fuel tanks, and aircraft bodies.|$|R

40|$|Liquid alloy {{circuitry}} is {{an exciting}} new field of research. It {{is one of the}} technologies that strives to make a commercial production of reliable, stretchable circuits possible. The making of liquid alloy circuits is, today, a somewhat tedious handicraft that is time-consuming and not suited for mass production. In this diploma thesis a new method to produce liquid alloy circuitry is presented; <b>print</b> and <b>roll.</b> The circuits consists of Galinstan paths embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Conductive paths are printed in a two step sequence on semi-cured PDMS and then covered with uncured PDMS and exposed to a final curing step. <b>Print</b> and <b>roll</b> produces circuits that are of equal quality as the circuits made with the old method, with a speed and ease superior to the old method. Furthermore advantages and disadvantages with printing on partly cured PDMS substrates are discussed. Partly cured PDMS substrates is important for the <b>print</b> and <b>roll</b> process since it enables the use of uncured PDMS to cover the printed circuit. Using uncured PDMS as a cover-material makes it possible to print the circuits on flat substrates and to use a pick and place machine to place components on the circuit-paths. Some tests with pick and place placing of both large and small components were conducted with varying results...|$|R

The second mark, known as the changeover cue, is placed about 1 second before the end. Each mark lasts for precisely 4 frames (0.17 seconds).|$|R

50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and <b>print</b> <b>rolls.</b> Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Compatibility and performance attributes are key factors in developing a rubber formulation for a particular application.|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{recognition}} of a person {{by the use of}} distinctive physical and behavioral characteristics is called biometrics. Two of the important challenges in biometrics are {{recognition of}} identical twins and matching of latent fingerprints to their exemplar <b>prints</b> (<b>rolled</b> or slap <b>prints).</b> The contributions of this dissertation are focused on these two topics. Identical (monozygotic) twins are a result of a single fertilized egg that splits into two cells, each one giving birth to one individual. Identical twins have the same deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thus their genotypic features (features influenced by the genetic material) are the same. However, some of their phenotypic features (features influenced by the fetal environment) may be different. Thus, it is essential to determine which biometric traits (either by themselves or in combination with other traits) have the ability to distinguish identical twins and the extent of their ability for this discrimination. The first contribution of this dissertation is an evaluation of the performance of biometric systems in the presence of identical twins for the three most commonly used biometric modalities, namely fingerprint, face and iris. Identical twins are shown to be a challenge to current face recognition systems. On the other hand, fingerprint and iris matching of identical twins show performanc...|$|R
