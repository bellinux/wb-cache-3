50|$|The {{absence of}} a thymic shadow on chest X-rays is also {{indicative}} of X-SCID. In a normal child, a distinctive sailboat shaped shadow near the heart can be seen. The <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> in normal patients will gradually decrease in size because {{the need for the}} <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> diminishes. The decrease {{in the size of the}} <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> occurs because the body already has a sufficient number of developed T-cells. However, a patient with X-SCID will be born with an abnormally small <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> at birth. This indicates that the function of <b>thymus</b> <b>gland,</b> of forming developed T-cells, has been impaired.|$|R

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{role of the}} thymus in myasthenia gravis, and {{the mechanism}} of therapeutic effect of thymectomy, are incompletely understood. Nevertheless, thymectomy is a valuable treatment modality in selected patients with generalised myasthenia gravis. There are several types of thymectomy operation, but no one operative approach is clearly superior to the others. Total removal of the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> is essential. Additional excision of associated mediastinal and cervical tissue, that may harbor ectopic thymic rests, is a controversial surgical issue. Surgeons that advocate thymectomy through small, cosmetically favourable, incisions usually believe that simple removal of the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> is an adequate operation. Surgeons that emphasise the importance of removing extrathymic tissue, {{in addition to the}} <b>thymus</b> <b>gland,</b> usually favour greater operative exposure through a median sternotomy.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the superficial}} lymph nodes {{differs from that}} of the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> during the various phases of life of the mouse. In male and female Strong A mice the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> regresses with age, but the superficial lymph nodes do not. During pregnancy the thymus undergoes an accelerated temporary regression, but regenerates soon {{after the end of the}} lactation period (earlier in non-lactating post-partum females). The superficial lymph nodes show a lesser temporary regression which, however, does not become evident until after parturition. Their regeneration occurs after the lactation period, and after a corresponding period in non-lactating post-partum females. The difference in behaviour of the thymus and of the superficial lymph nodes is probably an indication of the greater sensitivity of the thymus to the increased output of adreno-cortical hormones which occurs during pregnancy. Repeated injections of cortisone acetate into the intact animal induce a response in the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> and superficial lymph nodes similar to that evoked by pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) play an {{important}} role in innate and adaptive immunity, however the expression of TLR 4 in piglets of different ages is still unknown. In this study, the tissue samples of 11 organs including heart, liver, spleen and so on were collected from 32 piglets of 4 different ages (8, 18, 30 and 35 days old). Real-time PCR was used to compare and analyze the expression of TLR 4 both in different tissues and growing periods of piglets which aimed at discussing the function of TLR 4 in immune responses in the piglets of development periods as well as showing the relationship between the expression level and piglets sensitivity to different subtypes E. coli. The results showed that TLR 4 gene was expressed in all the tissues and high levels of expression were detected in immune organs such as lung, lymph node, <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> and spleen. In addition in 8 days old piglets, the expression level of TLR 4 in immune organs such as lung, spleen, kidney and <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> was relatively high.

40|$|ObjectivePatients {{frequently}} have an “enlarged thymus” incidentally identified on imaging. We {{sought to determine}} whether thymectomy is appropriate in patients with diffusely enlarged <b>thymus</b> <b>glands.</b> MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing thymectomy without myasthenia gravis at 1 institution over 15 years. ResultsOf 117 patients undergoing thymectomy, 109 patients had complete data. Thirty-six had a gland judged by the surgeon to be diffusely enlarged, and 73 had a discrete mass. Of the 36 diffusely enlarged <b>thymus</b> <b>glands,</b> 18 (50 %) {{occurred in patients with}} no symptoms referable to the thymus. No patient (0 / 18; 0 %) with an asymptomatic diffusely enlarged <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> had a pathologic diagnosis that would have required resection (8 normal; 10 “hyperplasia”). Of the 18 symptomatic patients with diffusely enlarged glands, 4 (22. 2 %) harbored lymphoma, but none harbored thymoma or other tumor (P < . 05; symptomatic vs asymptomatic). Of the 73 patients with discrete masses, 45 (61. 6 %) were symptomatic, and both the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients had a high rate of pathologic diagnoses that represented an indication for resection (53. 3 % and 42. 8 %, respectively, harbored thymoma or other tumor). Of the 25 (of 109) patients initially having a diagnosis of thymic hyperplasia, only 3 (12 %) had true follicular hyperplasia on re-review of the pathologic condition. Interestingly, an autoimmune disorder developed in 2 (67 %) of these 3 patients on long-term follow-up. ConclusionsAsymptomatic patients with diffusely enlarged <b>thymus</b> <b>glands</b> can be followed up expectantly because they have a negligible incidence of significant thymic disease; symptomatic patients with diffusely enlarged <b>thymus</b> <b>glands</b> may have lymphoma, so biopsy is appropriate. Half of patients with a discrete mass have tumors requiring resection; imaging advances would be useful to better differentiate among patients within this group...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{clinical}} and thymic histological features of 23 patients who underwent thymectomy for myasthenia gravis {{have been examined}} and compared. Eighty-two per cent of patients with a non-neoplastic gland containing numerous germinal centres improved postoperatively, whereas 83 % of patients with a non-neoplastic gland containing no germinal centres deteriorated or died. Glands with only slight involution and containing numerous germinal centres were more commonly seen in young female patients. The evidence relating thymic histological appearances with the postoperative progress of patients with myasthenia gravis is reviewed. An association between myasthenia gravis and the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> was first suggested by Weigert in 1901. Although Schumacher and Roth (1913) reported the clinical improvement of a patient with myasthenia after removal of an enlarged non-neoplastic gland, {{it was not until}} the reports of Blalock et al. (1939) and Keynes (1949) that the beneficial effect of thymectomy was fully appreciated. Keynes concluded that, although the connection between myasthenia and abnor-malities of the <b>thymus</b> <b>gland</b> was well estab-lished, there was no clue to how or why the gland acquired its abnormal function.
