Tests indicated limited instances of faecal and other forms of microbiological contamination in sections of the water-supply network. Indications were also found that the network in this area could intermittently be subjected to pollution from unknown sources although incidences were limited and not prolonged. Tests on the bulk water supply from the utility to the consumer water network indicated no faecal contamination in the bulk supply. In general the supply quality tested indicated no risk to consumers. However, the insanitary condition of containers as well as the manner of storing and handling of the containerised water led to contamination of water supplies.

40|$|The {{water sector}} in many {{developing}} countries in the world is characterised by inadequacies and inefficiencies in service delivery (Gardner-Outlaw and Engelman, 1997). These among other things are reflected by disrupted flow of water, frequent system breakdown, long waiting periods for connection, escalating unaccounted for water losses in the distribution networks, unsatisfactory customer relations and haphazard water projectsâ€™ implementation and Botswana is no exception. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the impact of institutional arrangements on water service delivery at household level in villages of Botswana based on a case study of Kanye and Molapowabojang. Empirical data was obtained by employing qualitative approach from January to April 2007. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions and document review were the main tools for data collection. Three indicators of coverage levels, reliability of water supply and consumer satisfaction were used in assessing the efficiency of water service delivery. Two main water supply sources are used by households in Kanye and Molapowabojang â€“ <b>public</b> <b>standpipes</b> and private connections. However majority of the households in Molapowabojang depend on <b>public</b> <b>standpipes</b> mainly because private connections hardly pump out water. Despite this fact, most households prefer to have a higher level of service, the private connection for the convenience it offers, as it does not require walking out of the compound to obtain water. The study findings revealed that the current institutional set up to rural water service delivery at household level is relatively efficient in terms of water reticulation infrastructure provision, functioning sources, access to and use of water (time and distance) and to a very limited extent, willingness to pay to sustain existing service levels. Although there is water reticulation infrastructure in the two villages, there are short comings in their operation and maintenance as well the ability to meet user preferences. The efficiency of the approach is in doubt as communities are to a very limited extent involved in the planning, implementation, operation and maintenance and evaluation of their water supply systems. Responsibility for these activities is seen to rest with the Department of Water Affairs and the District Council which are seen as inefficient. The study therefore is of the opinion that the current institutional arrangement is inadequately performing in the management of water supply schemes and service delivery at household level. This can be redressed by affording rural communities and private sector greater involvement in decisions relating to the water service delivery. There needs to be a reassessment and reorientation of existing institutional structures related to water supply. In addition, there is need for understanding the level of water development in the country. Though it is important to separate the roles of service provision from regulation and resource management, it is imperative to understand the level at which service provision is at.

50|$|About 88% of {{the urban}} {{population}} in Ghana have access to at least basic drinking water. However, disparities exist between urban and rural safe drinking water access. According to the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of 2011, urban dwellers {{are more likely to}} have access to safe drinking water than the rural dwellers at 91% and 69%, respectively. Consequently, dependency on unsafe water sources is higher in rural areas. The turbidites of most local surface waters in rural areas are greater than 200 NTUs (nephelometric turbidity units) and contain high microbial and fecal contamination, putting children and the rest of the population at high risk for water-related diseases. Compared to the rest of the country, the three northern regions of Ghana are particularly deprived of clean drinking water, with one in ten children dying before their fifth birthday due to some water-related illnesses. In the main Northern Region of Ghana alone, 32% of the 2.5 million residents lack access to improved water sources and must often resort to contaminated drinking-water. Regarding sanitation, only 14% of the total population of Ghana are using an improved sanitation facility as of 2010.This table presents the classifications of improved and unimproved water sources in Ghana since the end of the Millennium Development Goals, according to the WHO and UNICEF.

What are the main urban challenges Kenya faces? Are Kenyan urbanization trends leading to inclusive cities? Urban challenges in Kenya Urban growth challenging service delivery In terms of urbanization patterns, Nairobi continues to be the major city while other big towns remain attractive for rural migrants. However, small and secondary towns (20 to 200 000 inhabitants) are now growing faster. An important factor in the growth of small and secondary towns is the extension of big cities' metropolitan areas. They can no longer be neglected by development programmes. Balanced urbanization will also require Provincial capitals to play a role as regional hubs. Therefore, their capacities urgently need to be strengthened.

40|$|The {{scarcity}} of water—in both quantity and quality—is a problem {{not just in}} poor countries, but also countries considered middle-income and rich. The Kingdom of Jordan is a middle-income country trying to upgrade access and quality of public water supplies; its Zarqa Governate is home to nearly 750, 000 people, 95 % of whom live in urban areas currently served by water taps in homes and at <b>public</b> <b>standpipes.</b> <b>Public</b> water service is limited; with about half the families having access to publicly supplied potable water less than 40 hours per week. Supply disruptions and concerns about drinking water quality lead households to obtain potable and domestic water from other sources. Tanker trucks deliver bulk water by the cubic meter, while water treatment vendors provide potable water in relatively large containers of up to 20 liters. Finally, bottled water can be purchased in relatively small containers (from ~ to 4 liters). The current study examines the effects of increased availability and improved quality of publicly supplied water. We use a discrete-continuous Almost Ideal Demand System that accounts for {{all four of the}} major sources of water: the public system, tankers, vendors who sell treated water, and sources of bottled water. Some 1214 households were interviewed in Fall 2009 regarding their use and perceptions of different water sources; 948 provided complete information used in our modeling. We find that improvements in the public system will lead to increases in the quantity demanded of water from the public system. Improving hours of service from less than seven hours a day to 12 hours per day will result in a 3. 9 % increase in quantity demand for the full sample. Improving portability of publicly supplied water from 2. 2 on the Likert scale (quite dissatisfied) to 4. 0 (quite satisfied) will increase quantity demanded by 8. 6 % for the full sample. Simultaneous improvements in both dimensions will increase quantity demanded by over 10 % for both groups. Given the low price of public water relative to other sources, these improvements in the delivery system potentially represent a large cost savings to households even as the quantity of water consumed increases...|$|R
40|$|Water and {{sanitation}} services provide a cost-effective solution for alleviating {{the impact of}} water-borne diseases. Actually, for water supply projects a top-down approach is followed, giving priority to deliver sufficient quantities of water, increasing its availability by investment in new systems. Little {{attention is paid to}} the functioning of these systems on the long-term, and its maintenance and operational constraints. In this paper, a methodology was developed to technically assess water supply systems based on four criteria, namely availability, capacity, continuity and condition. The practicality of the approach is demonstrated by a technical assessment of a number of water supply systems in the Vhembe District in South Africa. The systems consist of piped distribution systems with <b>public</b> <b>standpipes,</b> mostly fed by groundwater. In general, it can be concluded that the performance of the systems, although relatively new, is poor. The availability (criterion 1) of the drinking water is a problem due to poorly constructed boreholes or disagreement on the payment of the operational cost after construction. In most villages the capacity (criterion 2) of the installed infrastructure is sufficient, although storage volume is in some villages too small. The continuity (criterion 3) of the water supply is threatened by disputes about payment of diesel for the pump and maintenance and repair of the pump. Finally, the condition (criterion 4) is poor mostly due to taps at the standpipes which are damaged and require frequent replacement. Despite the simplicity of the proposed assessment methodology, it provides rapid insight in the state of a system and is ideal for bench marking the performance of different systems in different regions. Furthermore, the quantitative measures of the four different criteria allow system operators and planners to rapidly pinpoint the reasons for poor performance and to take the appropriate corrective action. The used weighting factors in this demonstration are arbitrary – different users could adapt them to their own specific situations without invalidating the overall approach to technical assessment suggested in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Stool {{disposal}} {{practices have}} been shown to be associated with childhood diarrhoea. However, efforts to promote improved hygiene behaviour are hampered by a lack of understanding of what determines those behaviours. Data from 2793 household interviews with mothers of children from the town of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso were analyzed to examine what differentiated mothers who reported using safer stool disposal practices from those who did not. Three 'outcomes' were considered: where the child was reported to defaecate; where the mother reported disposing of the child stools; and whether excreta were observed in the compound. Regression models were developed to identify those factors with the strongest independent associations with the outcomes. There was a consistent association between the source of water and the outcomes. Mothers with access to a tap in the yard reported using safe hygiene practices three times more often than mothers using wells outside the compound and twice as often as mothers who used <b>public</b> <b>standpipes</b> or wells within the yard. The source of water showed a similar pattern of association with observations of faecal matter in the environment. Improved sources of water may contribute to safer stool hygiene by reducing the time spent on water collection or by encouraging mothers to conform to higher standards of hygiene. Other factors which played a role in predicting the hygiene behaviour of mothers were the husbands' occupation, the number of health education sessions that she had attended, her zone of residence and family ownership of certain valuable objects. These factors are likely to be related and to be, to some extent, proxies for the real determinants of her behaviour. A model of the cultural, psycho-social and infrastructural proximate determinants of hygiene behaviour is proposed. Data from focus group discussions suggested that the main purpose of hygienic behaviour is to conform to existing norms of social etiquette. Trials of interventions based on changing such norms are needed to test whether this is an effective means of promoting of safer hygiene practices. hygiene behaviour stool disposal diarrhoea Burkina Faso...|$|R

40|$|According to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 924 {{million people}} lived in slums in 2001. Population growth in these {{settlements}} {{is much greater than}} in other urban areas. The estimates suggest that this figure may rise to 1. 5 billion by 2020 (Payne, 2005). This rapid increase is expected despite ?slum upgrading? efforts that have been taking place for decades, though inconsistently and with disruptions over time. There is a prolific literature on informal settlement areas, but research on access to essential services such as water and sanitation (WS) in these areas is very limited. Most studies consider issues of access in connection to urban poverty, an approach that often reduces the discussion to the income and expenditure constraints faced by households. Examining access to WS in the slums spurs an appreciation of the multidimensional nature of the problem, including income poverty, infrastructural limitations, asset ownership and housing quality. Moreover, developments in the slums concern every aspect of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This paper examines the conditions of access to water in the slums of the developing world. It has three goals. The first is to identify the objective and policy-related challenges that hinder progress in the provision of safe, affordable, continuous and easy access to water in countries where there is a sizeable slum population. The second is to explore the existing systems of provision in informal settlements and to discuss the weaknesses and strengths of each. The third is to make policy recommendations. Though the discussion on access to sanitation is limited, this is not to deny the importance of that issue. Besides, water and sanitation services are often intrinsically linked and therefore are provided together by network utilities. The discussion reveals the failure of public policies as well as markets to provide satisfactory solutions to the problems of access to a safe, affordable and continuous water supply. In many countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa, access to safe water through household connections declined in the 1990 s. Achievements in access rates in many Asian and African economies are the due to widespread use of public water points such as <b>public</b> <b>standpipes</b> and kiosks.

Section 2 provides a general discussion of informal settlements and outlines the growth of slum development and trends in access to water supply since 1990. Section 3 examines changing public policies towards squatter settlements and the challenges such settlements pose. Section 4 presents the problems associated with the existing market-based water supply arrangements in countries where a sizeable proportion of the urban population resides in informal settlement areas.
