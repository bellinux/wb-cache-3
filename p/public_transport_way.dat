30|$|As {{contracting}} of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> services {{increases in}} sophistication, {{there is a}} growing focus on an increasing number of key performance indicators that emphasis service quality. Although contracts won under competitive tendering or by negotiation are assessed on a number of evaluation criteria, cost efficiency still remains the main basis for selecting a preferred operator. There has been a limited effort to identify the service quality influences that really matter to users of <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> <b>Ways</b> of incorporating the packaging of service quality offer an improved and behaviourally richer way of representing the role of underlying dimensions of quality in establishing how well a contracted service is delivering services to satisfy customers. In this paper we present a way of doing this using a construct called a Customer Service Quality Index (CSQI), in which a stated preference survey together with actual experience in using <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> is used to obtain preference weights for each significant attribute defining service quality, and which is used then to establish a CSQI for each sampled user, and by aggregation, the performance on service quality of each operator. Such a measure should be considered by regulators when both assessing the merits of each operator’s bid {{in order to avoid the}} real risk that cost efficiency dominates at the expense of gains in service performance and in ongoing monitoring of performance.|$|R

40|$|The traffic {{situation}} {{in urban areas}} has become a large problem over the recent years. Especially congestion during rush hours is becoming quite visible. Often, {{this can not be}} solved by simply building more roads, as most urban areas do not have the available physical space required. One way of solving these problems can be to focus on decreasing the number of vehicles. This can be done by increasing the amount of people traveling in each vehicle, or focusing on alternative transportation such as bicycle or <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> Another <b>way</b> of utilising the existing infrastructure, is to improve the control of the traffic flow. In this thesis we present a prototype case-based reasoning (CBR) system for the purpose of controlling the traffic lights in an urban intersection. The system uses historical vehicle counts, obtained from an intersection in the city of Trondheim, before using this knowledge in order to make new signal plans for the intersection. jCOLIBRI is used as framework for the development of our CBR-system and evolutionary algorithms are used for weighting the case base. The traffic simulator Aimsun is used for the evaluation of our solution.

30|$|Bus lane access will be {{a benefit}} to society as long as spare {{capacity}} is used without delaying buses. The toll-road incentive leads to lower income for the toll-road company. This company has a loan {{that is used to}} build roads and to support <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in different <b>ways.</b> When income is reduced, either the rate per paying vehicle must be increased, or the period of payment prolonged. In both cases there is a cross subsidy between payers and non-payers. Free ferries are different from free toll-roads. The ferry cost should cover the marginal cost of transporting the vehicle and persons in the vehicle. If fewer pay, the rate per paying vehicle is increased or the subsidy from the province or government must increase. Free parking means that municipal income per parking space is reduced, that fewer parking spaces are available to other paying users, and reduced circulation. The cost of the free parking incentive for municipalities may thus exceed the value of the incentive for the EV owner.|$|R
40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> and the {{periphery}} have a troubled relation. In {{search for a}} more sustainable mobility, the idea of re-shaping the city is more appealing than the idea of re-shaping <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> for the ‘car-oriented’ periphery is considered utopian, {{with a lack of}} density as the knockdown argument. The Belgian region of Flanders certainly seems to prove this. An inefficient bus network covers almost the entire territory, but only 15 % of its costs. Two types of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> have remained somewhat successful: the train connections between cities and the bus lines within cities. The periphery, in which mobility is situated on an in-between scale remains dependant on the car. Is <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> for suburbia an impossible task? New concepts such as Light-Rail Transit (LRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) have emerged over the last decades. They blur the lines between classic PT concepts, and are able to adapt themselves to the structure of the contemporary city. The region of Klein-Brabant is a typical peri-urban nebula, lacking a legible structure. The difficulty of defining this specific spatial condition, requires planners to propose a new spatial vocabulary for this type of territory. This research-by-design shows how the infrastructure of a regional <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> system (LRT) can become the backbone of Klein-Brabant after the sprawl. From a theoretical point of view, intermodality has a great potential, as it increases the number of possible connections exponentially. In reality however, organizational issues prevent peripheral <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> networks from functioning as a real ‘network’. The assumption of overcoming these issues allows to discover the spatial potential of intermodality. It stimulates the nodal function of a station in a network, expanding its role as a carrier of (sub) urban programs. In Flemish planning practices, many master plans for small-scale station areas are currently being developed by municipalities, trying to enlarge their capacity as an urban center by transforming their mobility nodes. The relevance of a light rail network for Klein-Brabant is to a great extent related to the dispersed urbanity of the region. This kind of network functions through a large number of nodes at a small scale. These nodes ground the concept of mobility, making it tangible on a specific location, and within a network their role is increasingly important. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> thus gives <b>way</b> to nodal development, as a sustainable alternative to the ribbon development along secondary roads. The paper elaborates on a specific scenario for LRT implementation, namely heavy to light rail transformation, as part of a bigger research by design. Spatial morphologies are tested and proposed through this scenario. This design proposal is part of an ongoing research project, called ORDERin’F (Organizing Rhizomic DEvelopment along a Regional pilot network in Flanders). status: publishe...|$|R

In contrast, what often discourages <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> use are inconvenience and restrictions, lack of information, disadvantages of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and personal preferences.

40|$|Abstract:- The <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> {{reform is}} very {{important}} to increase the use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> mode. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> problems include: an overall lack of capacity, lack of quality and choice, severe traffic congestions and insufficient fund to renew and repair vehicles. Generally, the comfort and quality of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> fleet is poor, and many of the vehicles are dilapidated and dirty. Whereas those who can least afford to travel may be prepared to suffer such indignities, people who can pay to travel by their own vehicles, or by taxi, would seldom find any temptation to use public. Increasingly, patronage will be confined to the poorest members of society, thereby further eroding service levels and comfort. Most of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> users are captive passengers, who use the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> because they have no choice to travel by other modes. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> system in Yogyakarta and Bandung were analyzed by counting <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles and occupancies, interviewing the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> passengers, drivers and institutional staffs, who involve in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> management.
