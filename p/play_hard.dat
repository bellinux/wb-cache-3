40|$|Folk wisdom {{suggests}} <b>playing</b> <b>hard</b> to get is {{an effective}} strategy in romantic attraction. However, prior research has yielded little support for this belief. This article seeks to reconcile these contrasting views by investigating how 2 hitherto unconsidered factors, (a) the asymmetry between wanting (motivational) and liking (affective) responses and (b) the degree of psychological commitment, can determine the efficacy of <b>playing</b> <b>hard</b> to get. We propose that person B <b>playing</b> <b>hard</b> to get with person A will simultaneously increase A’s wanting but decrease A’s liking of B. However, such a result will only occur if A is psychologically committed to pursuing further relations with B; otherwise, <b>playing</b> <b>hard</b> to get will decrease both wanting and liking. Two studies confirm these propositions. We discuss implications for interpersonal attraction and the interplay between emotion and motivation in determining preferences...|$|R

Los Angeles was four games behind eighth-place Portland, but only three games ahead of last-place Phoenix and New Orleans. Only five Western teams had ever made the playoffs after a start of 17–25 or worse, the last being Denver in 2004–05 when they went 32–8 to finish 49–33. Their {{defensive}} rating, points per 100 possessions, was ranked only 20th in the league. The Lakers won their next three home games after they dropped D'Antoni's offense and played without any system. [...] "We play basketball. The system is move the ball, <b>play</b> <b>hard</b> defense, space the floor and who's open shoots. It's not a difficult thing", said D'Antoni. The coach moved Nash off the ball and made him more of a spot-up shooter, while Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense. The defense was also more energized. Bryant had at least 10 assists in all three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. He missed a triple-double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other. Prior to the role change, Bryant had been leading the league in scoring though much of the first 42 games. Howard and Bryant credited the meeting in Memphis with bringing the team together.|$|E

Chetan Chauhan, India's team manager said his players were [...] "agitated and upset by... the incompetent umpires here... that they will not officiate again in the series". Ponting was questioned over the wrong decision, the racism row, and especially the wicket of Ganguly during which he held his finger up to indicate to Mark Benson that Ganguly has been caught. Ponting was aggressive towards the Indian journalists, lashing out at them for [...] "questioning my [...] integrity". The Australian players faced much questioning as a result of the fallout of the incident. The Australian team maintained that they <b>play</b> <b>hard</b> but fair. In regards to the racism issue, Ponting denied he did anything wrong by singularly reporting Harbhajan Singh for being abusive. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials as it is widely agreed that racism is unacceptable anywhere in the world. After criticism of the Australian team in multiple media continued, a shocked Ponting promised to ensure that his side's conduct is not seen to be arrogant in future matches. Peter Roebuck, a columnist in The Sydney Morning Herald, branded Ponting as [...] "arrogant" [...] and insisted that be stripped of the captaincy.|$|E
