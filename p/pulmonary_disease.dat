There has been no study on the {{adherence to}} GOLD guidelines for COPD treatment in Turkey. Objectives: To investigate the rates of adherence to GOLD 2010 guidelines for COPD treatment among pulmonologists. Design: A multi-center, cross-sectional, observational study {{was carried out in}} eleven pulmonary outpatient clinics across Turkey. Adherence to GOLD was evaluated through hospital records. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Results: Study included 719 patients (mean age: 62. 9 ± 9. 7 years; males 85. 4 %) of whom 16 was classified as GOLD Stage I, 238 as II, 346 as III, and 119 as IV, and only 59. 5 % received appropriate treatment. Rates of guideline adherence varied across GOLD stages (I, 6. 3 %; II,  14. 7 %;  III,  84. 4 %; and IV, 84 %). Causes of inappropriate therapies were overtreatment (Stage I, 100 % and Stage II, 91. 1 %), undertreatment (Stage III, 3. 3 % and Stage IV, 10. 9 %) and lack of treatment (Stage II, 3. 8 %; Stage III, 2. 3 %; and Stage IV, 5. 9 %). The most preferred regimen (43. 4 %) was long-acting β 2 -agonist-inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Overall, 614 patients (89 %) received treatment containing inhaled corticosteroid. Conclusion: Pulmonologists in Turkey have low rates of adherence to GOLD guidelines in COPD treatment. Inappropriateness of therapies was due to overtreatment in early stages and excessive use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in all disease stages.

5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>disease</b> or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} use of drugs for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> in {{children}} who were exposed to antidepressants in utero with non-exposed children. Some studies suggest an association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and the occurrence of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> later in life. Antidepressants are thought {{to be involved in the}} development of the respiratory rhythm generator and the maturation of surfactant formation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The pharmacy prescription database IADB. nl was used for a cohort study. The use of drugs for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> in children after in utero exposure to antidepressants was compared to children with no antidepressant exposure in utero. Drugs for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> were applied as a proxy for disturbed development of the respiratory tract. RESULTS: A small but significant increase in the incidence risk ratio (IRR) of {{the use of}} drugs for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> was found after anytime in utero exposure to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (1. 17; CI 951. 16 - 1. 18). IRR also was increased for specific use of SSRIs in the first trimester (1. 18; CI 951. 17 - 1. 20). IRR increase for children who were exposed to tricyclic antidepressants was not statistically significant. As sample size was rather small in both groups, the effect size is modest and may also be confounded by maternal smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Children exposed to SSRIs in utero use significantly more drugs for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially when exposure occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the increased use of such drugs may also be related to other factors...|$|R

40|$|Many studies try to {{identify}} cancer diagnostic biomarkers by comparing peripheral whole blood (PWB) of cancer samples and healthy controls, explicitly or implicitly assuming that such biomarkers are potential candidate biomarkers for distinguishing cancer from nonmalignant inflammation-associated diseases. Multiple PWB gene expression profiles for lung cancer/inflammation-associated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> were used for differential mRNAs identification and comparison and for proportion estimation of PWB cell subtypes. The differentially expressed genes (DE genes) between lung cancer/inflammation-associated pulmonary patients and healthy controls were reproducibly identified in different datasets. For these DE genes observed in lung cancer/inflammation-associated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases,</b> more than 90. 2 % were differentially expressed between myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, with at least 96. 8 % having consistent directions of regulation (up- or down-regulations) in myeloid cells compared to lymphoid cells, explainable by the shifted populations of PWB cell subtypes under the disease conditions. The comparison of DE genes for lung cancer and inflammation-associated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> showed that the overlapping genes were 100 % consistent {{in the sense of}} direction of regulation. The differential blood mRNAs observed in lung cancer and in inflammation-associated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases</b> were similar, both mainly reflecting the difference between myeloid cells and lymphoid cells predominantly determined by PWB cell population shifts. Thus, the strategy of comparing cancer with healthy controls may provide little information of the ability of the identified candidate biomarkers in discriminating cancer from inflammation-associated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
