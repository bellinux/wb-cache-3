40|$|Connections {{between the}} Law, rights and {{development}} {{are complex and}} may call for different interpretations in a globalisation context. People? rights, or Human rights, which are subjective rights must be distinguished from objective rights, {{even if they are}} clearly interdependent and their compatibility is debated. An integral part of economic development is the earning of rights and the effectiveness of theses rights. There are, however, different understandings as to what constitutes rights and thus an intense debate over their universality. The present paper presents, in a general way, the connections between development, the rights of agents and the Law in the current context of globalisation. It also attempts to apply this analytical matrix to the Law and the rights for food.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{approach in the}} Business courses has distressed students searching for humanistic contents in Applied Social Sciences area of knowledge. One can observe this in the Materials and <b>Patrimonial</b> Properties <b>Management</b> course taught during the Business Administration program. This situation becomes still worse when the course is offered on Fridays evenings. This study dealt with four classes (morning and evening sessions) in two private institutions. The course was taught according to two procedures: a) professor centered, and b) participant centered. The same activities were scheduled in a distinctive way. The {{results indicated that the}} students' achievement were (statistically significant at 1 %) superior in the participant centered procedure (P 2) in comparison to the professor centered procedure (P 1). Very low investments for designing and planning the didactic materials made possible to produce better achievement of the students...|$|R
40|$|The Marine Reserve of Cerbère-Banyuls, {{like the}} whole of the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) from the Western Mediterranean, {{represents}} a refuge for dusky grouper populations. Since the installation of the moratorium prohibiting its fishing in 1993, the density of population increase regularly (7 in 1985, 50 in 1998 and 193 in 2001). For a few years, the interest of scientists has been growing (observations of reproductive behaviours, density surveys) (Culioli and Quignard, 1999; Garcia-Rubies et al., 1999; Harmelin et al., 2002; Lenfant et al., 2003). However, a lack of knowledge is evident on the behaviour of the dusky grouper, in particular during the winter period. We carried out a survey by acoustic telemetry on 6 groupers between September 2005 and June 2006. This method, which allows the data acquisition of continuous detections over a long period (several months), showed (i) a strong sedentary behaviour of largest individuals and (ii) a high sensitivity to variations of environmental conditions (storms). In term of <b>patrimonial</b> species <b>management</b> like for the dusky grouper, a sedentary behaviour consolidates and encourages the conservation and the protection of the essential habitat of this species. However, it seems that a part of the population does not adopt this sedentary behaviour throughout the year. They begin to colonise sites outside the marine reserve...|$|R

It {{currently}} {{has a population of}} about 8. 486. 866 and presents several complex problems of space organization, so that specific studies are needed to understand its reality. The Historical Center of Lima is locus of <b>patrimonial</b> <b>management</b> policies since the eighties. In this context, the Jirón de la Unión Street, the main of this urban space, deserves to be analyzed. The principal aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the new uses of Jirón De La Unión Street, in the historical center of Lima. The methodological procedures used to carry out this research were: bibliographical, cartographic, photographic and documentation surveys, together with outdoor researches to characterize the use of the soil and related landscape. A first observation was the predominant commercial use of the current Jirón de la Unión Street...|$|E
40|$|A {{concrete}} and efficient experiment {{designed to protect}} the wetlands of the Garonne basin, the « Garonne Vivante » programme concerns 67 ecologically interesting sites, totalising 4000 ha in the Midi-Pyrénées and Aquitaine regions. It has been financially supported by the European Community since 1990 in application with directive n° 79 / 409 /C. E. E. concerning the preservation of wild birds. The project's emergence, the drawning up of its contract as well as its operational and organisational management, are analysed. Talking into account recent results as regards the understanding of natural and anthropised river ecosystems, this operation as been redeployed taking advantage of the motivation and implication of local personnalities and of the new legislation and regulations prospects (laws on water and quarries, etc.) as well as the new incentives (agricultural-envi- ronnemental measures). Having started out as an emergency and punctual protecting operational, this action can in the medium or long run, result in the <b>patrimonial</b> <b>management</b> of the Garonne corridor.

40|$|The Bohemian nobility in {{the second}} half of the 19 th century. Noble estate in the Bohemia at the turn of the ages: The {{analysis}} of economic conditions of three aristocratic families. The second half of the 19 th century and early 20 th century is a time of transformation, with one phase of economic, social and societal history ending in Austria in 1848. This newly emerging world full of changes must also be addressed by the Bohemian nobility, which is also one of the groups affected by these changes. Abolition of forced labor and the subsequent purchase of land lead to the release of an unprecedented amount of free capital. The Bohemian nobility look for business disciplines in which they invest this free capital, but at the same time they must deal with the transfer of their landed property from <b>patrimonial</b> <b>management</b> to economic estate. The nobility is therefore forced to innovate their agricultural production, forest production and to improve the management of their estates; they invest their free capital not only in manufacturing, but also in industries unrelated to the agricultural operation of their ancestral estates, while also investing in the construction of railways. The nobility address their position in the new local governmental and self-governing structures of the monarchy. Count Chotek family [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Through the {{in-depth}} analysis {{of the features of}} Huabei rural industrialization, the unique factory regime in Baigou, Hebei, and the resulting special workers, this paper reveals two dilemmas the migrant workers in Baigou and larger Hubei area face: Because of the interpersonal network of labor market, personalized trade, familial labor process, and <b>patrimonial</b> <b>management,</b> the workers are unable to become either industrial working class or citizens. Facing this special group of workers, we still believe in their power of self-liberation. Drawing on Touraine’s action sociology and sociological intervention, and Burawoy’s public sociology and praxis-oriented research, we modify “sociological intervention ” according to the reality of Chinese society and propose the methodology of “strong sociological intervention ” whose vehicle is “Baigou Migrant Worker Night School. ” The night school provided workers with courses of labor law, English, and computer based on their actual needs. Labor law is the core to evoke the self-consciousness of the workers. Through communications in the night school and workers ’ real living circumstances, we collected their true information and treated it as the source of sociological knowledge. After three sessions of night school training, workers showed changes in skills, social, and psychological aspects, laying a foundation for the growth of self-consciousness. Keywords Factory regime. Publics. Social action. Sociological intervention It was the night of October 15 th, 2005 when I entered my classroom and saw all my students already there waiting for me. They were gossiping with each other and laughing excitedly. “ Hello everyone, ” Isaid, “ so {{nice to see you again}} in English class of our night school. Last week we have learned how to make friends with strangers. Now I’d like two students to perform the situation to help us review unit 2. Those who raise their hands first get to choose their own partner. ” A moment of silence occurred, and students began to look around th...|$|E
