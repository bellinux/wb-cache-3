60|$|A wanton {{outrage that}} had been {{committed}} by the Burmese showed how intent they were upon hostilities. Owing to the unhealthiness of the islet of Shapuree, the sepoys stationed there had been withdrawn; and the Company's <b>pilot</b> <b>vessel,</b> Sophia, was ordered to join the gunboats off that island. Four deputies from the Burmese court arrived at Mungdoo, on the opposite shore; and these invited {{the commander of the}} Sophia to come on shore, in order that they might talk over with him, in a friendly way, the situation of affairs. He unsuspectingly accepted their invitation and landed, accompanied by an officer and some native seamen. The party were at once seized and sent prisoners to Aracan, where they were detained for a month, and then sent back to Mungdoo.|$|E

50|$|In 1910 the 58 ft {{motor boat}} California {{was built for}} the pilots. In 1935 three {{schooner}} <b>pilot</b> <b>vessels</b> were maintained to provide rotating five-day watches on the bar near the lightship with two, the large schooner California and Gracie S. being regulars with Adventuress as reserve.

The Woods Hole Sentry can descend to 4,500 metres and allows a higher payload as it does not need a support ship or the oxygen and other facilities demanded by human <b>piloted</b> <b>vessels.</b> Robots in space include the Mars rovers which could carry out sampling and photography in the harsh environment of the atmosphere on Mars.|$|R
