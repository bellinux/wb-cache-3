2500|$|The Barahonas granddaughter, {{who wished}} {{not to be}} identified, came forward and {{described}} the abuse as [...] "a <b>persistent</b> <b>pattern</b> of psychological and physical abuse." [...] She {{was six years old}} when the twins arrived at the Barahonas' home. The granddaughter was a regular visitor and witnessed the torture of the twins, even stating that [...] "the twins would be stripped naked and forced to walk around the living room." [...] Jorge Barahona forced everyone to watch the naked twins. Another time during the granddaughter's visit, Jorge tried to drown Victor in the swimming pool and at another time, Jorge and Carmen wrapped rope around Victor's neck, choking him [...] "until he fainted". The granddaughter also said that the twins were only given milk and bread to eat.|$|E
2500|$|Workplace {{bullying}} is a <b>persistent</b> <b>pattern</b> of mistreatment {{from others}} in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm. [...] It can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical school bully, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, bullying in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates. Research has also investigated {{the impact of the}} larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization. [...] Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture.|$|E

50|$|In addition, the {{computation}} law of reachable optimality {{gives out}} {{the boundary between}} complexity model, chaotic model and determination model. When RAYG is the Optimal Choice computation, and the reaching pattern is a persistently positive experience path, persistently negative experience path, or mixed <b>persistent</b> <b>pattern</b> experience path, the underlying computation shall be a simple system computation adopting determination rules. If the reaching pattern has no <b>persistent</b> <b>pattern</b> experienced in RAYG regime, the underlying computation hints there is a chaotic system. When the optimal choice computation involves non-RAYG computation, it's a complexity computation driving the compound effect.|$|E

Implementations of FSM in Object-Oriented (OO) languages have been widely studied since the classical State design pattern has been introduced. Various design patterns were derived from the State pattern, however, the focus was always on object’s behavior. This paper proposes the <b>Persistent</b> State <b>Pattern,</b> an extension to the State <b>pattern</b> where <b>persistent</b> data is taken on account. The <b>Persistent</b> State <b>Pattern</b> integrates classical and enterprise design patterns, and it is conceived for enterprise applications.

The jet lag type requires sleepiness and wakefulness at inappropriate times relative to the local time zone; there must be repeated travel more than one time zone away. The shift work type requires excessive sleepiness during the desired wake period and an inability to sleep during the desired sleep period, both due to changing shift work or night shift work.|$|E

Both the victim and the victimizer justify cruel actions {{based on what they}} have been led to believe is “actual" [...] inferiority. Hallie argues that cruelty is created by an {{imbalance}} of power, or hierarchy. According to his view, the opposite of institutionalized cruelty is freedom from the cruel relationship, not just kindness.|$|E

In the autonomous setting, such objects are variously known as almost-invariant sets, metastable sets, <b>persistent</b> <b>patterns,</b> or strange eigenmodes, and {{have proved to}} be important in a variety of applications. In this current work, we explain how to extend existing autonomous approaches to the nonautonomous setting. We call the new time-dependent slowly mixing objects coherent sets as they represent regions of phase space that disperse very slowly and remain coherent. The new methods are illustrated via detailed examples in both discrete and continuous time...|$|R

The scandal emerged in late 1995 and received nationwide attention by 1997, eventually resulting in an investigation by Human Rights Watch. Hundreds of people {{were involved in the}} incidents that occurred in North Philadelphia in the early 1990's.

The brain’s memory of {{horizontal}} eye position appears to be represented by persistent neural activity in a network known as the neural integrator, which is localized in the brainstem and cerebellum. Existing experimental data are reinterpreted as evidence for an “attractor hypothesis” that the <b>persistent</b> <b>patterns</b> of activity observed in this network form an attractive line of fixed points in its state space.

In addition, the distribution of maxima and minima in the moving average signal is investigated. In all cases, <b>persistent</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed in these probability measures and it is suggested that such variables be considered for better analysis and possible prediction of the trends of the signal. ...|$|R

Concentrated sources of coarse-grained sediment, derived from relict fluvial stratigraphy or densely grouped relict inlet channels excavated from the shoreface, may both enable persistence of nearshore bathymetric anomolies and control multi-km-scale undulations in shoreline curvature, which in turn affect gradients in wave-driven alongshore sediment transport that drive long-term shoreline chang...|$|R

50|$|Stefan Rahmstorf, a {{professor}} of ocean physics at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, stated that a low-pressure system that dumped the rain was locked into place by a disturbance with the global wind pattern. Linking the weather to the concurrent drought conditions in Russia, he said pressure systems stay locked in place, causing a <b>persistent</b> <b>pattern</b> of weather in an area. He also stated that this planetary wave resonance is not a local effect but spread around the whole (northern) hemisphere. When a “resonance” episode occurs, half a dozen peaks and troughs of high or low pressure form around the hemisphere. This explains why {{some parts of the}} world become unseasonably hot or cold and others unusually dry or rainy.|$|E
