25|$|The bagel {{came into}} more general use {{throughout}} North America {{in the last}} quarter of the 20th century with automation. Daniel Thompson started work on the first commercially viable bagel machine in 1958; bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, Murray Lender, and Florence Sender leased this technology and pioneered automated production and distribution of frozen bagels in the 1960s. Murray also invented <b>pre-slicing</b> the bagel.|$|E
5000|$|All four {{brothers}} - Hyman, Sam, Harry and Marvin - entered the family's bagel business, called H. Lender's and Sons. Harry Lender died in 1958 and the brothers began freezing bagels {{for sale in}} 1960. Murray also {{came up with the}} idea of <b>pre-slicing</b> bagels. [...] Murray Lender and his family sold Lender's Bagels to Kraft Foods in 1984. The brand was acquired by the Pinnacle Foods Group in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Further {{refinements}} were developed, such as <b>pre-slicing</b> the bagels {{and packing}} them in polyethylene bags {{to keep them}} fresh after thawing, and the bakery began selling the packaged frozen bagels in supermarkets. To introduce bagels to an unfamiliar public, the Lender family would prepare and distribute them in supermarket aisles. The plastic bagged, frozen six pack of pre-sliced Lender's Frozen Bagels began to gain market share, and by 1959 supermarket sales accounted for half of the sales. New varieties of bagels were invented, and production was switched over to rotary ovens, rather than labor-intensive open, flat ovens.|$|E

Tofu, Chinese cabbage, bean sprouts, and {{vermicelli}} are normally included in the hot-pot. Lamb is <b>pre-sliced</b> paper-thin into unbroken pieces and served on the table. Eaters pick up some <b>pre-sliced</b> raw lamb using chopsticks, put it in the boiling hot-pot, and remove it as soon as the lamb changes color. Each person has a small bowl to hold sauce for the cooked lamb; the sauce is normally a mixture of sesame sauce, chili oil, leeks, and more.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} silage {{conservation}} method on silage composition and animal performance {{were examined in}} two experiments. In Experiment 1, unwilted, flail-chopped silages made with or without an additive (sodium nitrite and hexamethylene tetramine) were compared with wilted, round-bale silage. The dry matter (DM) concentration of round bale silage (460 g/kg) was {{higher than that of}} flail silage (214 g/kg) and this restricted fermentation and N solublisation. When fed to growing cattle, intake (P 0. 05). Steers fed round-bale silages had higher LW gain (1. 0 kg/day) than those fed flail (0. 7 kg/day) or precision-chopped silage (0. 8 kg/day; P< 0. 05). Efficiency of utilization of DM for LW gain was similar for all silages. <b>Pre-slicing</b> at baling had no effect on animal performance. It is concluded that the increased performance by cattle offered silages made by the wilted round-bale system was largely due to higher voluntary intake. peer-reviewedThis research was partially funded {{by a grant from the}} Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture and Marketing...|$|E

5000|$|The {{processed}} {{variety of}} American cheese {{is sold in}} three basic packaging varieties: individually-wrapped cheese slices (which are not sliced from a block of cheese, but rather slabs of processed cheese which are formed from a viscous processed cheese which only solidifies between the wrapping medium); small, <b>pre-sliced</b> blocks of 8 to 36 slices; and large blocks meant for use behind deli counters. The individually-wrapped cheese slices are, typically, the least like traditional cheese. Small blocks of <b>pre-sliced</b> (e.g., 8-36 slices), unwrapped American cheese are also marketed, often with the branding [...] "deluxe" [...] or [...] "old-fashioned"; this variety of American cheese is similar in ingredients and texture to that of modern block American cheese. Before {{the advent of the}} individually-wrapped variety, this was the typical variety that Americans purchased. Hence, some people refer to this as [...] "classic" [...] or [...] "traditional" [...] American cheese.|$|R
50|$|Grocery {{stores and}} supermarkets, in many countries, sell {{prepackaged}} or <b>pre-sliced</b> bread, cakes, and other pastries. They can also offer in-store baking and basic cake decoration.

50|$|The dish was {{introduced}} to Korea around 1930s during the Japanese rule period, but the thick, Japanese-style tonkatsu failed to seize popularity. don-gaseu became popular in the 1960s, with the spread of gyeong-yangsik—light western food— restaurants. The dish, although called by Japanese-derived name don-gaseu, followed western pork cutlet recipes {{such as those of}} Austrian schnitzel: thinned by pounding before breaded and deep-fried. It was not <b>pre-sliced,</b> and served with bread. Western-style appetizer soup was served before the dish. Don-gaseu developed into two distinct varieties. In 1977, gyeong-yangsik-style don-gaseu with thin meat became a popular menu in gisa-sikdang—drivers' restaurant, similar to transport café, for taxi drivers— with the addition of chili peppers and kimchi as an accompaniment. As gyeong-yangsik restaurants nearly disappeared, this style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in drivers' restaurants and bunsik-jip (snack restaurants). Second style of don-gaseu, with thicker meat and served <b>pre-sliced</b> following the Japanese method, was made popular in 1983 by a restaurant called Myeongdong Dongaseu. This style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in authentic Japanese restaurants.|$|R
50|$|Lunch meats—also {{known as}} cold cuts, luncheon meats, cooked meats, sliced meats, cold meats and deli meats—are precooked or cured meat, often {{sausages}} or meat loaves, that are sliced and served cold or hot on sandwiches or on party trays.

25|$|A bread clip is {{a device}} {{used to hold}} plastic bags, {{such as the ones}} <b>pre-sliced</b> bread is {{commonly}} packaged in, closed. They are also commonly called bread tags, bread tabs, bread ties, bread crimps, or bread-bag clips. By sealing a bag more securely than tying or folding over its open end, the clip or tie may preserve its contents longer. The bread clip was invented in 1952 by Floyd Paxton of Yakima, Washington. Paxton never patented the device.|$|R
50|$|Bread {{is a very}} {{important}} part of the Scandinavian table, primarily rugbrød, which is sour-dough rye bread. It is a dark, heavy bread which is often bought <b>pre-sliced,</b> in varieties from light-coloured rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. It forms the basis of smørrebrød, which is closely related to the Swedish smörgås. Some toppings are served on franskbrød, a very light, crusty wheat bread. The bread is usually buttered, though for some variants a spread of lard is customary.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- {{we propose}} a new {{computational}} approach to estimating editing efficiency by Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR). This approach focuses exclusively on secondary {{structure in the}} vicinity of edited sites, where editing efficiency is equated with stability of the local structure. As a <b>pre-sliced</b> RNA is being transcribed and elongated, its structure is almost continually changing. As such, local structures of edited sites may change dynamically during transcription. Our notion of stability of local structures is defined in terms of how much such structures change during transcription. We show by computational simulation that stability of structures {{in the vicinity of}} edited sites correlate moderately highly with editing efficiency. Our result confirms recent findings based on laboratory experiments on the significance of secondary structures on editing by ADAR. It further suggests an innovative approach of detecting dynamic structural motifs that can change during a biological process such as transcription...|$|R
50|$|Bread {{is a very}} {{important}} part of the Danish table. It is enjoyed at home, in the workplace or in restaurants and is usually based primarily on rugbrød, which is sour-dough rye bread. It is a dark, heavy bread which is sometimes bought <b>pre-sliced,</b> in varieties from light-colored rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. Rugbrød forms the basis of smørrebrød (see above). Many people still bake at home, particularly boller, which are small bread rolls, and often the traditional kringle, which is a pastry filled with Zante currants and remonce paste. The Danish franskbrød (lit: French-bread) are leavened wheat breads, roughly equivalent to white bread. Franskbrød are available in many varieties, ranging from whole wheat to pumpkin, chestnut, or poppy-seed sprinked loaves and loaves containing maize, müsli or honey. Some loaves are made with alternative wheat sorts like emmer or spelt and some contains small amounts of low-gluten grains such rye. Leavened brown loaves are also referred to as franskbrød. People often eat jam with cheese on crusty white bread for breakfast, and also very thin slices of chocolate, called pålægschokolade. Because of the popular rye bread, Danes eat less wheat bread than most other western countries, even though bread is part of most daily meals.|$|R
40|$|A shopping-habits {{survey was}} {{completed}} at selected California WIC clinic sites. Although {{the survey was}} given to WIC program participants from all racial or ethnic groups, tests revealed that a representative sample was obtained only {{from members of the}} Hispanic population, who make up the largest ethnic group served by the California WIC Program. Consequently, the study presented herein is restricted to the shopping habits of Hispanic California WIC Program participants. This study identified the specific brand preferences of the WIC population for the cereals and juices offered by the California WIC Program and to find out if families with two or more people on WIC would be able to handle buying larger quantities of the same food in one shopping trip, thus allowing the program to issue fewer food instruments for the same quantity of food and decrease the number of transactions at the grocery store. An attempt was also made to assess the utilization of farmers'Â’ market coupons. The characteristics included in this study were family income, language preference, household size, and head-of-household education level. Results of this survey indicate capacities to obtain larger quantities of food on one shopping trip; clear preferences for specific brands of plastic-bottled, shelf-stable juices over frozen juices; and preferences for specific cereal brands and types. Additionally, the survey results suggest that <b>pre-sliced</b> processed American cheese may be an acceptable alternative to cheese in block form. These observations, together with reasons given for limited use of farmerÂ’s' market assistance, suggest the possible presence of time-utility trade-offs in low-income California Hispanic shopping plans.

50|$|Fermented pork {{back fat}} {{that is used}} to make salami has very high {{saturated}} fatty acid and cholesterol content, which can increase {{the risk of heart disease}} and pancreatitis. However, it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami. Olive oil consists of a much larger amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which allows this substitution to create a healthier product. Salami is considered slightly acidic due to lactic acid that is present. In salami where the pork back fat was substituted for extra virgin olive oil, it has shown to have a lower pH of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 making the salami more acidic. These lower pH levels are healthier for humans as higher populations of lactic acid bacteria inhibit the spread of spoilage microorganisms.There have also been cases that have showcased some of the possible health dangers of salami. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection of a husband and wife was traced back to the consumption of dry fermented salami made with pork meat after the couple was hospitalized for bloody diarrhea. There was also an outbreak of E. coli O157 in 1994 with 17 cases all occurring from the consumption of <b>pre-sliced</b> salami that was processed by one company. A research investigation of the factory where the salami was processed found that all processing techniques and production methods complied with all regulations and there was no evidence of contamination after processing.|$|R
