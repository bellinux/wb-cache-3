5000|$|Piston <b>pumps</b> and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{reciprocating}} pumps that use a plunger or piston to move media through a cylindrical chamber. The plunger or piston is actuated by a steam powered, pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric drive.|$|R

It is often used where a relatively small quantity of liquid is to be handled and where delivery pressure is quite large.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a <b>pump</b> <b>plunger.</b> Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The suction valve ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge valve ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of biodiesel on some tribology characteristics of a bus diesel engine with a mechanically controlled fuel injection system. The tests have been performed on a fully equipped engine test bed, on a fuel injection test bed and on a discharge coefficient testing device. The tested fuel was neat biodiesel produced from rapeseed. Attention {{was focused on the}} biodiesel influence on the <b>pump</b> <b>plunger</b> surface roughness, on the carbon deposits in the combustion chamber, on the injector and in the injector nozzle hole. The <b>pump</b> <b>plunger</b> surface was analyzed by experimentally determined roughness parameters and by a microscope. The carbon deposits at fuel injector and in the combustion chamber were examined using endoscopic inspection. The deposits in the injector nozzle were investigated indirectly by measuring the nozzle discharge coefficient. Numerical simulation has been performed in order to estimate the influence of the discharge coefficient variation on the computed injection characteristics. The obtained results indicate that biodiesel usage may even improve the <b>pump</b> <b>plunger</b> lubrication conditions. Furthermore, the carbon deposits in the combustion chambers did not vary significantly in quantity but they were noticeably redistributed. Finally, it was found out that the variation of the nozzle discharge coefficient has {{to be taken into account}} only if high accuracy of numerical simulation is desired...|$|E

5000|$|Rotary piston and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> use a crank {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump.

Introduction: The {{following is a}} design for a tool to be of convenience for general machine shop use; such as pressing in bushings, shafts, mandrills, or tight fitting pins of any kind. It has a maximum power of seven tons and a sixteen inch throw. The cylinders are strong enough for pumping up to one thousand pounds pressure per square inch. It is to be operated by the hand, the effort being exerted thru a medium of oil instead of water. Computations. If 7 ton is the desired working pressure, then 7 X 2000 lbs. = 14000 lbs. the desired maximum pressure in pounds in the cylinder. The desired effort (45 lbs.) is to be exerted on a plunger thru a lever, in which the resistance bears a ratio to the effort of 1 : 3. If 45 lbs. is the maximum effort to be exerted on the lever, then 3 x 45 lbs. = maximum effort to be exerted on the lever, then 3 x 45 lbs. = 135 lbs., the resulting force exerted on the <b>pump</b> <b>plunger.</b> The desired area of <b>pump</b> <b>plunger</b> is ¼ square inch.

40|$|The {{performance}} of biodiesel in a single-cylinder diesel engine was studied and optimized by varying the engine settings, including the injection timing, injection pressure, and fuel <b>pump</b> <b>plunger</b> diameter. The engine emissions {{were found to}} be lowered for particulate matters (PM) and hydrocarbon (HC) with the use of biodiesel, but an obvious increase in the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) was observed, particularly at high engine loadings. The results revealed that individual adjustment of the above-mentioned parameters could not acquire a good balance between PM and NOx emissions. On the other hand, multiparameter engine adjustment with the consideration of their cross-interactive effects can keep the benefit of reducing PM and HC without increasing NOx emission and sacrificing fuel combustion efficiency. © 2006 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} {{is now one}} of {{the most}} powerful manufacturing control systems in the current trend. In present competitive and challenging market, industries needs to improve their strength and must concentrate on to their process flows. Lean manufacturing is the solution to improve their quality and increasing profit for manufacturing over the international market. Lean manufacturing provides varieties of tools and strategies which can help in identification of waste, reduction or elimination of waste, manufacturing product with better quality, lowering the product cost, reducing human effort and reducing product manufacturing time. This paper demonstrates various lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing is a precise approach for economical utilization of raw product and eliminating waste through continuous improvement, and aimed to provide qualitative product to the customers. Lead time is the time spent between the original customer order and final delivery of the product. Project work is being carried out at XYZ organization in Gaziabad,U. P,India. Lean manufacturing is a production practice that considers expenditure of resources for any goal other than creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful and thus a target for elimination. Lead time is calculated by adding value added time and non-value added time. Delivery valve is a non-return valve between the high pressure for the fuel injection system and <b>pump</b> <b>plunger.</b> On observing the present system of delivery valve production the current lead time was calculated and was found to be 14. 60 days. The lean tools that are applied in this project are First-In-First-Out (FIFO), a method for organizing the component buffer where the oldest entry or bottom of the stack is processed first which eliminates inventory which in turn reduces the lead time and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to map the present and the future state. Application of these lean tools has resulted in the reduction of lead time by one day i. e. 13. 60 days. Keywords: Lead time, Value Stream Mapping, First-In-First- Out, Customer Takt Time...|$|E
