50|$|<b>Piezo</b> <b>{{ignition}}</b> {{is a type}} of ignition that is used in portable camping stoves, gas grills {{and some}} lighters, and potato cannons. <b>Piezo</b> <b>ignition</b> uses the principle of piezoelectricity, which, in short, is the electric charge that accumulates in some materials in response to high pressure. It consists of a small, spring-loaded hammer which, when a button is pressed, hits a crystal of PZT or quartz crystal. Quartz is piezoelectric, which means that it creates a voltage when deformed. This sudden forceful deformation produces a high voltage and subsequent electrical discharge, which ignites the gas.|$|E
50|$|A propane-operated {{flamethrower}} is {{a relatively}} straightforward device. The gas is expelled through the gun assembly by its own pressure and is ignited at the exit of the barrel through <b>piezo</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Piezoelectric {{transducers}} and actuators {{are often}} {{made of the}} complex oxide PZT (lead zirconate titanate). These transducers are used in applications such ultrasound imaging and some microphones. PZT is also sometimes used for <b>piezo</b> <b>ignition</b> in lighters and gas grills.|$|E
50|$|No {{external}} {{electric connection}} is required, though wires are sometimes used {{to locate the}} sparking location away from the crystal itself. <b>Piezo</b> <b>ignition</b> systems can be operated by either a lever, push-button or built into the control knob. An electric spark is usually generated once per turn of the knob or press of the button.|$|E
50|$|To relight {{the burner}} if the pilot light {{goes out and}} the {{optional}} <b>piezo</b> <b>ignition</b> fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing {{in the case of}} a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.|$|E
50|$|A spark {{is created}} by {{striking}} metal against a flint, or by pressing a button that compresses a piezoelectric crystal (<b>piezo</b> <b>ignition),</b> generating an electric arc. In naphtha lighters, the liquid is sufficiently volatile, and flammable vapour is present {{as soon as the}} top of the lighter is opened. Butane lighters combine the striking action {{with the opening of the}} valve to release gas. The spark ignites the flammable gas causing a flame to come out of the lighter which continues until either the top is closed (naphtha type), or the valve is released (butane type).|$|E
5000|$|Liquid-operated flamethrowers use {{a smaller}} propane tank to expel the liquid. For safety reasons, the propane tank {{is behind the}} {{combustible}} liquid tanks {{in order to prevent}} being hit by a bullet. The propane is fed to two tubes. The first opens in the napalm tanks, providing the pressure necessary for expelling the liquid. [...] The other tube leads to an ignition chamber behind the exit of the gun assembly, where it is mixed with air and ignited through <b>piezo</b> <b>ignition.</b> This pre-ignition propane line {{is the source of the}} flame seen in front of the gun assembly in movies and documentaries. As the napalm passes through the flame, it is ignited and propelled towards the target.|$|E
