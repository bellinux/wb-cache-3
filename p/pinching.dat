5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. <b>pinching)</b> or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it may be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by <b>pinching</b> him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E

Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, <b>pinching</b> pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-instrumental {{reliability}} of the digitalized <b>pinch</b> muscle strength dynamometer. Method Th irty normal subjects were examined for <b>pinch</b> strength, using both the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer. The participants performed all <b>pinch</b> strength tests in the seated position as recommended by the American Society of Hand Th erapists (ASHT). Th ree successive measurements were taken for each hand. Th e mean of the three trials was used for data analysis. Th e <b>pinch</b> strength tests performed used a repeated measure design and measurements were taken by each rater. Results The relationship between the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer in <b>pinch</b> strength was reliable (the ICC were 0. 821 and 0. 785 in rater 1 and rater 2 respectively). Th e relationship between the fi rst session and second session in <b>pinch</b> strength using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer was reliable (the ICC were 0. 872 and 0. 886 in rater A and rater B respectively). Th e relationship between rater A and rater B in <b>pinch</b> strength using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer was reliable (the ICC was 0. 754). Conclusion The <b>pinch</b> strength measurement using the digitalized <b>pinch</b> dynamometer is reliable within the rater and between raters. Th us, the Preston <b>pinch</b> gauge and the digitalized dynamometer measure grip strength equivalently, {{and can be used}} interchangeably...|$|R
40|$|<b>PINCH</b> is a five LIM domain protein {{involved}} in the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. It {{has been shown that}} <b>PINCH</b> interacts with integrin-linked kinase and Nck 2. Here we describe a new isoform of <b>PINCH,</b> which we call <b>PINCH</b> 2. Therefore, we rename <b>PINCH</b> to <b>PINCH</b> 1. <b>PINCH</b> 2 has an overall similarity of 92 % to <b>PINCH</b> I and contains five LIM domains like <b>PINCH</b> I. While protein and gene structure of the <b>PINCH</b> homologues are very similar and well conserved during evolution, we observed differential expression pattern of the mRNAs. Based on northern hybridization of mouse embryo RNA, <b>PINCH</b> I is already detectable at E 8. 5. It is highly expressed during later stages of development and in all adult mouse tissues analyzed, with the highest levels in heart, lung, bladder, skin, and uterus. In contrast, significant <b>PINCH</b> 2 expression starts at E 14. 5. In adult mice it is widely expressed, similar to <b>PINCH</b> I, but absent from spleen and thymus. In situ hybridization confirmed the Northern data and showed differential expression of <b>PINCH</b> 1 and <b>PINCH</b> 2 in embryonic intestine. Finally, we demonstrate that <b>PINCH</b> 2 localizes to focal adhesions in NIH 3 T 3 cells and to Z-disks in primary rat cardiomyocytes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|At 0530 {{elements}} of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division with tank support, launched a new assault to capture the village of Grainville-sur-Odon. After shelling and close quarter street fighting, the Scots secured the village by 1300 hours; German counter-attacks followed but were repulsed. At 0600 the Germans began two strong flanking attacks, {{with the intention of}} <b>pinching</b> out the British salient. Kampfgruppe Frey on the eastern flank, launched an attack north of the Odon, supported by Panzer IVs of the 21st Panzer Division. This reached the villages of Mouen and Tourville but the British counter-attacked from the direction of Cheux, resulting in confused heavy fighting throughout the day. Frey's battle group managed to gain control of Mouen and British counter-attacks supported by tanks halted any further advance but were unable to retake the village. British patrols found Marcelet partly empty, the German front line having been pulled back towards Carpiquet.|$|E

40|$|Individuals often <b>pinch</b> with {{preferred}} <b>pinch</b> techniques {{based on}} their experience and familiarity. However, researchers believe that <b>pinch</b> force exertions are not comparable across different <b>pinch</b> techniques. Hence, {{it is possible to}} <b>pinch</b> objects with incompatible <b>pinch</b> techniques during manual handling. This increases risks of developing musculoskeletal disorders. The preceding problem substantiates the need for a comprehensive understanding of definitions, categorisations and capacities of different <b>pinch</b> techniques. Nevertheless, the knowledge on <b>pinch</b> techniques appears to be highly dispersed and not compiled to a level systematic enough for further research. Thus, this review aims to develop a consolidated theoretical groundwork on <b>pinch</b> techniques. It presents an anthology of terminologies, previous findings and concepts underpinning different <b>pinch</b> techniques. While much research is still required, it is believed that an improved understanding on <b>pinch</b> techniques is now within sight, due to, in part, a structured review of their definitions, classifications and capacities...|$|R

40|$|Repetitive, high-force <b>pinch</b> grip exertions {{are common}} in many {{occupational}} activities. The goal {{of the current study}} was to quantify the relationship between lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span (distance between thumb and index finger) and lateral <b>pinch</b> grip strength. An experiment was conducted in which 40 participants performed maximal lateral <b>pinch</b> grip exertions at 11 levels of grip span distances (0, 10 %, [...] . 100 % of maximum functional lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span distance). The results show a significant effect of lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span, with strength at the maximum functional lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span 40 % higher than that found at the smallest lateral <b>pinch</b> grip span considered. Between these two endpoints, strength increased monotonically with increasing <b>pinch</b> grip span. The application of these results in <b>pinch</b> grip design criteria for both high-force and long-duration exertions is discussed. Potential applications of this research include the design of hand tools and controls for which significant force is appliedcby the user...|$|R
25|$|Android's default user {{interface}} is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, <b>pinching,</b> and reverse <b>pinching</b> to manipulate on-screen objects, {{along with a}} virtual keyboard.

40|$|Background: Data on the {{physical}} strength capabilities are essential for design-ing safe and usable products and are useful {{in a wide range}} of clinical settings especially during treatment of disease affecting the function of the hand. The purpose of this study was to determine peak lateral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions in a healthy Iranian children and young adult population. Methods: The study was conducted among 511 participants (242 males and 269 females) aged 7 - 30 years. Measurements were carried out with both dominant and non-dominant hands in standard sitting posture using a B&L <b>pinch</b> gauge. Two repetitions of each strength measurement were recorded for each condition and the average value of the two trials was used in the subsequent analysis. Results: The results showed significant differences in the <b>pinch</b> strength data in terms of the age, gender and hand dominance. The lateral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions by females were 68. 4 %, 68. 8 %, 78. 8 % and 81. 8 % of those exerted by males, respectively. Strength exertions with the non-dominant hand were 6. 4 %, 5. 2 %, 6. 6 % and 5. 1 % lower than strength exertions of the dominant hand for the lat-eral <b>pinch</b> strength, key <b>pinch</b> strength, tip-to-tip <b>pinch</b> strength and three-jaw <b>pinch</b> strength exertions, respectively. Conclusion: These findings can be used to fill the gaps in strength data for Iranian population...|$|R

The predictive equation expressing maximum handgrip force in relation to upper limb location and gender has been developed on the basis of accessible data. By adopting the predictive equation of the maximum handgrip force, an analysis of <b>pinch</b> force values in relation to upper limb location was also performed. The developed relationship could be very useful in assessing maximum <b>pinch</b> forces for creating norms in sport, rehabilitation and occupational settings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivePrognostic markers for {{pancreatic}} ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) {{have failed}} to accurately predict patient prognosis. Recently, interest has developed in the accuracy of integrin-associated <b>PINCH</b> protein expression in human cancers as a predictive marker of tumour status. The goal {{of this study was}} to define the expression of <b>PINCH</b> protein in PDA. MethodsHuman PDA samples and orthotopic tumours from a murine model were analysed by immunohistochemistry for <b>PINCH</b> expression. In the animal model, <b>PINCH</b> expression was compared between primary and metastatic tumours. In the human samples, <b>PINCH</b> expression was correlated with stage, nodal involvement, margin status and overall survival. ResultsIn the murine model, there was greater <b>PINCH</b> expression in metastatic tumours than in primary tumours. In the human PDA samples, greater staining for <b>PINCH</b> in the tumour cells was correlated with higher T status. Additionally, high <b>PINCH</b> expression in the stroma was associated with decreased overall survival. ConclusionsFindings of increased <b>PINCH</b> protein in more advanced stages of human PDA, as well as in metastatic tumours in the animal model, support the hypothesis that <b>PINCH</b> is an important controller of cell survival and migration. Additionally, the importance of the differential expression of <b>PINCH</b> in the human tumour and stroma warrants further evaluation...|$|R

25|$|During spinal shock, {{the bladder}} is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, a spinally {{mediated}} voiding reflex ensues, {{although there is}} no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by <b>pinching</b> or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E
