40|$|We have {{developed}} a new litmus paper test (DipTest) for detecting Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water samples by performing enzymatic reactions directly on the porous paper substrate. The <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> consists of a long narrow piece of cellulose blotting paper coated with chemoattractant (at bottom edge), wax hydrophobic barrier (at the top edge), and custom formulated chemical reagents (at reaction zone immediately below the wax hydrophobic barrier). When the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> is dipped in water, E. coli in the water sample is attracted toward the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> due to a chemotaxic mechanism followed by the ascent along the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> toward the reaction zone due to a capillary wicking mechanism, and finally the capillary motion is arrested at {{the top edge of}} the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> by the hydrophobic barrier. The E. coli concentrated at the reaction zone of the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> will react with custom formulated chemical reagents to produce a pinkish-red color. Such a color change on the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> when dipped into water samples indicates the presence of E. coli contamination in potable water. The performance of the DipTest device has been checked with different known concentrations of E. coli contaminated water samples using different dip and wait times. The DipTest device has also been tested with different interfering bacteria and chemical contaminants. It has been observed that the different interfering contaminants do not have any impact on the DipTest, and it can become a potential solution for screening water samples for E. coli contamination at the point of source...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Currently, {{hygienic}} {{conditions of}} public tableware and kitchenware {{have become a}} hot social concern. This work aimed at solving existing problems in detecting the presence of bacteria, a constant-temperature incubator for the <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> method was designed and a related temperature-control system was developed. Firstly, the detection method and working principle of the incubator were elaborated upon. Using a <b>paper</b> <b>strip,</b> Escherichia coli (E. coli) was collected from the tableware to be examined. The <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> was then placed in the incubator for a constant-temperature culture. Through chromogenic reaction, the hygienic condition of the tableware could be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by analyzing the image information on the <b>paper</b> <b>strip.</b> Subsequently, {{with regard to the}} heater band, a wrapping pattern was designed and a suitable material was chosen. Three types of temperature sensors were compared, and a platinum resistor was finally selected and installed at the proper position. Additionally, an electronic thermostat was chosen. Conclusively, the designed incubator, which integrated the constant-temperature culture and image acquisition system, could detect the temperature accurately, reliably, and conveniently in real time, and could also detect the hygienic condition of public tableware rapidly and effectively.
