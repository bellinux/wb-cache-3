50|$|Partial liquid {{ventilation}} (PLV) involves {{filling the}} lungs with a fluid. This fluid is perfluorocarbon, also called Liquivent or <b>Perflubron.</b> The liquid has some unique properties. It {{has a very}} low surface tension, similar to surfactant, a substance that is produced in the lungs to prevent the alveoli from collapsing and sticking together during exhalation. It also has a high density, oxygen readily diffuses through it, {{and it may have}} some anti-inflammatory properties. In PLV, the lungs are filled with the liquid, the patient is then ventilated with a conventional ventilator using a protective lung ventilation strategy. This is called partial liquid ventilation. The hope is that the liquid will help the transport of oxygen to parts of the lung that are flooded and filled with debris, help remove this debris and open up more alveoli improving lung function. The study of PLV involves comparison to protocolized ventilator strategy designed to minimize lung damage.|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that <b>perflubron</b> increases the solubility of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, as reflected by their blood/gas partition coefficient (lambda(Bl:g)). Fresh whole-blood samples were drawn from eight volunteers and mixed with <b>perflubron</b> to obtain concentrations of 1. 2 %, 1. 8 %, and 3. 6 % by volume (equivalent to in vivo doses of 1. 8 to 5. 4 g/kg, which represent up to twice the intended clinical dose range).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) of fluorine- 19 allows for the mapping of oxygen partial pressure within perfluorocarbons in the alveolar space (Pao(2)). Theoretically, fMRI-detected Pao(2) can be combined with the Fick principle approach, i. e., a mass balance of oxygen uptake by ventilation and delivery by perfusion, to quantify the ventilation-perfusion ratio (Va/Q) of a lung region: The mixed venous blood and the inspiratory oxygen fraction, which are equal for all lung regions, are measured. In addition, the local expiratory oxygen fraction and the end capillary oxygen content, both of which may differ between the lung regions, are calculated using the fMRI-detected Pao(2). We investigated this approach by numerical simulations and applied it to quantify local Va/Q in the perfluorocarbons during partial liquid ventilation. METHODS: Numerical simulations were performed to analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} Va/Q calculation and to compare this approach with another one proposed by Rizi et al. in 2004 (Magn Reson Med 2004; 52 : 65 - 72). Experimentally, the method was used during partial liquid ventilation in 7 anesthetized pigs. The Pao(2) distribution in intraalveolar <b>perflubron</b> was measured by fluorine- 19 MRI. Respiratory gas fractions together with arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken to quantify oxygen partial pressure and content. Using the Fick principle, the local Va/Q was estimated. The impact of gravity (nondependent versus dependent) of <b>perflubron</b> dose (10 vs 20 mL/kg body weight) and of inspired oxygen fraction (Fio(2)) (0. 4 - 1. 0) on Va/Q was examined. RESULTS: In numerical simulations, the Fick principle proved to be appropriate over the Va/Q range from 0. 02 to 2. 5. Va/Q values were in acceptable agreement with the method published by Rizi et al. In the experimental setting, low mean Va/Q values were found in <b>perflubron</b> (confidence interval [CI] 0. 08 - 0. 29 with 20 mL/kg <b>perflubron).</b> At this dose, Va/Q in the nondependent lung was higher (CI 0. 18 - 0. 39) than in the dependent lung regions (CI 0. 06 - 0. 16; P = 0. 006; Student t test). Differences depending on Fio(2) or <b>perflubron</b> dose were, however, small. CONCLUSION: The results show that derivation of Va/Q from local Po(2) measurements using fMRI in <b>perflubron</b> is feasible.

Methods Sheep previously sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) were challenged with HDM aerosols to induce early asthmatic responses. At the maximal responses (characterised {{by an increase in}} lung resistance), the sheep were either not treated or treated with one of the following; nebulized S- 1226 (perflubron&# 8201;+&# 8201; 12 % CO 2), nebulized perflubron&# 8201;+&# 8201;medical air, 12 % CO 2, salbutamol or medical air. Lung resistance was monitored for up to 20 &# 160;minutes after cessation of treatment. In additional na&# 239;ve sheep, a segmental bronchus was pre-contracted with methacholine (MCh) and treated with nebulized S- 1226 administered via a bronchoscope catheter. Subsequent bronchodilatation was monitored by real time digital video recording. Results Treatment with S- 1226 for 2 &# 160;minutes following HDM challenge resulted in a more rapid, more profound and more prolonged decline in lung resistance compared with the other treatment interventions.

30|$|Importantly, {{there are}} {{apparently}} conflicting results regarding {{the effect of}} liquid ventilation during ARDS in the literature. In 2006, Kacmarek et al. [22] demonstrated that partial liquid ventilation did not improve outcome as compared to conventional mechanical ventilation and recommended against its use in ARDS patients. In the latter study, partial liquid ventilation was performed after lung filling with 10  ml/kg or 20  ml/kg of <b>perflubron,</b> with high values of positive end-expiratory pressure (13 cmH 2 O) and relatively high tidal volumes for gas ventilation (≈[*] 8 – 10  ml/kg). In addition, patients were repeatedly derecruited by abrupt decreases in PEEP from 13 to 0  cmH 20, with putative air trapping [23]. Our strategy was completely different as we performed TLV rather than partial liquid ventilation, and we used the pressure and volume-control mode of the ventilator [16]. This led to much lower and likely safer airways pressures, averaging 15  cmH 2 O at end-inspiration, which is approximately 2 times lower than previously observed during partial liquid ventilation in ARDS patients [22]. In addition, hypothermic TLV {{is expected to be}} instituted for very short periods only to induce hypothermia after cardiac arrest, which makes it much easier to implement than prolonged liquid ventilation.|$|E

Methods: Subjects (N = 492) with hemoglobin concentrations of 12 - 15 g/dl undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures with 20 ml/kg or greater expected blood loss were randomized into two groups. Control patients were transfused intraoperatively at a hemoglobin concentration less than 8. 0 ± 0. 5 g/dl or at protocol-defined, physiologic triggers. PFC-treated patients first underwent acute normovolemic hemodilution to hemoglobin of 8. 0 ± 0. 5 g/dl, followed by dosing with <b>perflubron</b> emulsion (1. 8 g/kg). When hemoglobin reached less than 6. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl, an additional 0. 9 -g/kg dose was given. PFC patients were transfused at hemoglobin less than 5. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl or at predefined physiologic triggers. After surgery, hemoglobin was maintained at 8. 5 ± 0. 5 g/dl or greater in all patients until discharge. Efficacy endpoints included the number of allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation units transfused {{and the percentage of}} subjects avoiding transfusion. Results: Both groups had similar hemoglobin concentrations at screening (13. 5 ± 1. 0 g/dl) and at discharge: 10. 8 ± 1. 2 g/dl (PFC) and 11. 1 ± 1. 3 g/dl (control). At 24 h, more patients in the PFC group avoided allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation erythrocyte transfusions (53 % vs. 43 %, P < 0. 05), and fewer erythrocytes were transfused (1. 5 ± 4. 8 vs. 2. 1 ± 3. 9 units; median, 0 vs. 1 unit; P = 0. 013). By day of discharge, these differences were not significant in the intent-to-treat population, but overall there were less allogeneic and preoperative autologous donation erythrocyte transfusions in the PFC group (696 vs. 846 units). In the protocol-defined target population (n = 330 subjects with blood loss ≥ 20 ml/kg), significantly greater avoidance of any erythrocyte transfusion was maintained through day of hospital discharge (26 % vs. 16 % in the PFC and control groups, respectively; P < 0. 05), and there was also a significant {{reduction in the number of}} erythrocyte units transfused (3. 4 ± 2. 9 vs. 4. 9 ± 2. 4 units; median 2 vs. 4 units; P < 0. 001).

Methods: Twenty neonatal swine were randomized to receive cardiopulmonary bypass with or without liquid ventilation. In the liquid-ventilated group, a single dose of <b>perflubron</b> was administered before bypass. The control group was conventionally ventilated. Each animal was placed on nonpulsatile, hypothermic bypass. Low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass was performed for 60 minutes. The flow rate was returned to 125 ml/kg per minute, and after warming to 37 ° C, the animals were removed from bypass. Hemodynamic and ventilatory data were obtained after bypass to assess the effects of liquid ventilation. Results: Without liquid ventilation, cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and static pulmonary compliance compared with prebypass values. Input pulmonary resistance and characteristic impedance increased in these control animals. At 30, 60, and 90 minutes after bypass, the animals receiving liquid ventilation showed significantly increased cardiac output and static compliance and significantly decreased input pulmonary resistance and characteristic impedance compared with control animals not receiving liquid ventilation. Conclusions: Liquid ventilation improved pulmonary function after neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass while increasing cardiac output. The morbidity associated with cardiopulmonary bypass may be significantly reduced if the adverse pulmonary sequelae of bypass can be diminished. Liquid ventilation may become an important technique to protect the lungs from the deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998 : 115 : 528 - 35...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of partial liquid ventilation (PLV) in adult patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have evaluated gas exchange {{and the safety of}} PLV in adult patients with severe respiratory failure whose gas exchange was partially provided by extracorporeal life support (ECLS). This is the first experience with adult patients who were not on ECLS. METHODS: Intratracheal <b>perflubron</b> in a total dose of 30. 1 +/- 7. 1 ml/kg was administered over a period of 45 +/- 9 hours to nine adult patients with mean age = 49 +/- 4 years and mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio = 128 +/- 7 as part of a prospective, multicenter, phase I-II noncontrolled trial. RESULTS: Significant decreases in mean (A-a) DO 2 (baseline = 430 +/- 47, 48 hour = 229 +/- 17, p = 0. 0127 by ANOVA) and FiO 2 (baseline = 0. 82 +/- 0. 08, 48 hour = 0. 54 +/- 0. 06, p = 0. 025), along with an increase in mean SvO 2 (baseline = 75 +/- 3, 48 hour = 85 +/- 2, p = 0. 018 by ANOVA) were observed. No significant changes in pulmonary compliance or hemodynamic variables were noted. Seven of the nine patients in this study survived beyond 28 days after initiation of partial liquid ventilation whereas 5 patients survived to discharge. Three adverse events [hypoxia (2) and hyperbilirubinemia (1) ] were determined to be severe in nature. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that PLV may be performed safely with few related severe adverse effects. Improvement in gas exchange was observed in this series of adult patients over the 48 hours after initiation of PLV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPatients with {{pulmonary}} infection often {{present with}} ventilation and perfusion abnormalities, which can impair intravenous antibiotic therapy. Intra-tracheal (IT) administration {{has met with}} obstacles, such as inadequate delivery to affected lung regions and the disruption of gas exchange. We hypothesized that IT administration of a gentamicin (G) /perfluorochemical (PFC) suspension (GPFC) would effectively deliver and distribute gentamicin to the lung, while maintaining gas exchange and non-toxic serum levels. In addition, we sought to compare serum G and lung levels and distribution of G when GPFC is administered at the initiation of partial liquid ventilation (PLV) vs. during PLV. To test this hypothesis, 17 newborn lambs were ventilated by PLV with <b>perflubron</b> (LiquiVent®) for 4 h using three different G (5 mg kg− 1) administration techniques: IT slow-fill (SF) (n= 6; GPFC over 15 min at start of PLV), IT top-fill (TF) (n= 6; GPFC 10 – 65 min after start of PLV), intravenous (IV) (n= 5, aqueous injection at start of PLV). Serum levels of gentamicin were obtained 1, 15, 30 and 60 min after administration, and hourly thereafter {{for the remainder of}} the protocol (4 h). Arterial blood gas and pulmonary function measurements were obtained throughout the protocol. At the conclusion of the protocol, representative samples from each lung lobe, the brain and kidney were homogenized and assayed for gentamicin. All results are presented as the mean ± sem; P < 0 · 05. Over time, serum gentamicin levels were greatest (P < 0 · 05) in IV (11 · 0 ± 2 · 3 μg ml− 1), followed by TF (2 · 3 ± 0 · 1 μg m− 1) and SF (0 · 8 ± 0 · 1 μg ml− 1). The percentage of the administered dose remaining in the lungs after 4 h was greater (P < 0 · 05) following IT delivery (SF 23 · 8 ± 4 · 3 %, TF 13 · 7 ± 2 · 5 %) as compared to IV (3 · 7 ± 0 · 5 %). These findings suggest that for a given dose of G, both SF and TF delivery methods of GPFC can enhance pulmonary, relative to systemic, antibiotic coverage...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{evaluated}} gas exchange, pulmonary function, {{and lung}} histology during perfluorocarbon liquid ventilation (LV) {{when compared with}} gas ventilation (GV) {{in the setting of}} severe respiratory failure. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of LV in the setting of respiratory failure has been evaluated in premature animals with surfactant deficiency. However, very little work has been performed in evaluating the efficacy of LV in older animal models of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A stable model of lung injury was induced in 12 young sheep weighing 16. 4 +/- 3. 0 kg using right atrial injection of 0. 07 mL/kg of oleic acid followed by saline pulmonary lavage and bijugular venovenous extracorporeal life support (ECLS). For the first 30 minutes on ECLS, all animals were ventilated with gas. Animals were then ventilated with either 15 mL/kg gas (GV, n = 6) or <b>perflubron</b> ([PFC], LV, n = 6) over the ensuing 2. 5 hours. Subsequently, ECLS was discontinued in five of the GV animals and five of the LV animals, and GV or LV continued for 1 hour or until death. MAIN FINDINGS: Physiologic shunt (Qps/Qt) was significantly reduced in the LV animals when compared with the GV animals (LV = 31 +/- 10 %; GV = 93 +/- 4 %; p < 0. 001) after 3 hours of ECLS. At the same time point, pulmonary compliance (CT) was significantly increased in the LV group when compared with the GV group (LV = 1. 04 +/- 0. 19 mL/cm H 2 O/kg; GV = 0. 41 +/- 0. 02 mL/cm H 2 O/kg; p < 0. 001). In addition, the ECLS flow rate required to maintain the PaO 2 in the 50 - to 80 -mm Hg range was substantially and significantly lower in the LV group when compared with that of the GV group (LV = 14 +/- 5 mL/kg/min; GV = 87 +/- 15 mL/kg/min; p < 0. 001). All of the GV animals died after discontinuation of ECLS, whereas all the LV animals demonstrated effective gas exchange without extracorporeal support for 1 hour (p < 0. 01). Lung biopsy light microscopy demonstrated a marked reduction in alveolar hemorrhage, lung fluid accumulation, and inflammatory infiltration in the LV group when compared with the GV animals. CONCLUSION: In a model of severe respiratory failure, LV improves pulmonary gas exchange and compliance with an associated reduction in alveolar hemorrhage, edema, and inflammatory infiltrate...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanisms of disease progression and the efficacy of interventions {{there is a need}} to develop and refine imaging methods for phenotyping animal models of complex traits associated with pulmonary hypertension. To investigate pulmonary arterial tree structure-function in this context, a high resolution micro-CT scanner has been utilized for imaging anesthetized small animals and excised organs maintained in a near-physiologic state. In this study, the X-ray CT system and image reconstructions were used to evaluate hypoxia induced changes in vascular architecture and mechanics in Fawn Hooded rats from which the lungs were removed after three weeks in an exposure chamber with inspired O 2 of 21. 0 % (normoxic) or 11. 5 % (hypoxic). The pulmonary arterial tree was filled with perfluorooctyl bromide (<b>Perflubron)</b> for x-ray contrast and the isolated lungs were imaged with the intravascular pressure, P, ranging from 5 to 30 mmHg. Methods were developed to identify and locate individual vessel segments within the pulmonary arterial tree and to measure their diameters as a function of pressure. The complexity of the pulmonary arterial tree is remarkable. Thus, three-dimensional volumetric images provide very complex data sets. A method for summarizing the image data for more than a million vessel segments is necessary. An approach based on the fractal characteristics of the pulmonary arterial network is developed herein. It involves measuring the diameters of the larger trunk vessel and the smaller branch at each bifurcation and the distances between bifurcations along the longest pulmonary arterial pathway, beginning at the pulmonary artery and ending with the terminal arteriole. Then, assuming self-consistency within the pulmonary arterial tree, the whole tree structure may be extrapolated. This is accomplished by measuring the diameter, D, versus length, x, from the main pulmonary arterial inlet over the range of pressures. The equations D(x,P) = D(0,P) (1 + αP) (1 - x/Ltot) c and D BR (x,P) = DBR (0,P) (1 + αP) (1 - x/Ltot) c are then fit to the data, where α is vascular distensibility and D, DBR, Ltot and c are morphometric parameters descriptive of the tree architecture. The parameters also provide inputs to a hemodynamic model that can be used to determine how the structural features represented by the parameters influence pressure-flow relationships within the pulmonary arterial tree. Morphometric analysis of lungs from normal and chronically hypoxic Fawn Hooded rats indicated that decreased vessel distensibility was the key feature of hypoxic remodeling. This type of analysis promises to be a useful tool for providing insight into pulmonary arterial structure-function relationships associated with pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
