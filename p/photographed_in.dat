City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) were essentially silent films, although they were made with soundtracks consisting of music and sound effects, with talking sequences in the latter film. Chaplin's last five films were all talking pictures. Aside from A Countess From Hong Kong, all of Chaplin's films were <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> 35mm black-and-white.|$|E

5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the group was <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{animation}} {{was created}} by then-unknown animator John Muto. Because of the film's low budget, Muto created all of the film's animation sequences himself. Muto made frequent use of airbrush techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style. For sequences in which live-action and animation were combined, the actors were <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> tight head-on and profile shots, and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam's work on Monty Python's Flying Circus. Muto also credits The Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration.|$|E

La Salle came to explore a portage between the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, and Father Ribourde, who traveled with La Salle, marked trees along the way.

5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland {{as a gesture}} of solidarity with the artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> their company. In 1983, {{as a gesture of}} support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E

He had other long-term mistresses, including an Australian beauty queen with whom he was <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> public.

The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, the USSR State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino SSSR) {{authorized}} the production of Solaris, with a length of , equivalent to a two-hour-twenty-minute running time. The exteriors were photographed at Zvenigorod, near Moscow; the interiors were photographed at the Mosfilm studios. The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were <b>photographed</b> <b>in</b> Japan, in September and October 1971, at Akasaka and Iikura in Tokyo. The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World Expo '70 but the trip was delayed. The shooting began in March 1971 with cinematographer Vadim Yusov who also photographed Tarkovky's previous films. They quarreled so much on this film that they ended up never working together again.
