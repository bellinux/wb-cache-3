500|$|Charlie's {{relationship}} with Angelo {{has been a}} focal point in her storylines. They originally date, but break up after Angelo kills Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Charlie becomes jealous when Angelo begins dating May Stone (Alin Sumarwata) and Anderson told Inside Soap that [...] "Charlie's feelings for Angelo are complex." [...] Charlie cannot fight her attraction to Angleo and the actress claimed that the couple would not have broken up {{if it had not}} been for Jack's death. Anderson also stated that the storyline sees a new side to Charlie, jealousy. She decides to get in the way of his new relationship. Anderson went on to explain: [...] "She admits part of her wanted to cause trouble, but Angelo is still attracted to Charlie and they sleep together." [...] The actress also defends Charlie's actions claiming she did not intentionally set out to hurt May. Charlie and Angeo's relationship dynamic becomes strained after Charlie refuses to give Angelo an [...] "easy life." [...] Although they have a [...] "great connection between them", Anderson felt Angelo would not put up with Charlie for long because she can be [...] "quite bossy." [...] She also said [...] "Charlie's got the good end of the stick and poor Angelo is in for a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> ride!" ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas Wolk from Pitchfork Media {{commented that}} the DVD was [...] "a lot closer to the mark [...] A lot of the fun of her career has always been its visual side." [...] Don Shewey from Rolling Stone said, [...] "The video {{exemplified}} the fact that there's no-one like Madonna, who can turn the music video in to an art-form." [...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, this is a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans." [...] Bönz Malone from Spin said, [...] "Celebration: The Video Collection is a reminder that Madonna is, and always will be, a true video artist. You cannot ignore her contribution to the music video art form." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic gave the DVD four and a half stars out of five, and commented that [...] "it is indeed a celebration of Madonna's career and some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created."

5000|$|... immigrantsdon’t seem to lavish a whole pile of {{investment}} on outward appearances. Thus, their corner shops are not pretty. There’s no clean-edged shelving with recessed LED lighting, bells ‘n’ whistles displays {{of the latest}} products, or space-age refrigerated cabinets that look like something Michael Jackson might have used to attempt to defy the aging process. Inside the Chinese corner shop things are <b>pretty</b> basic. <b>Rough</b> and ready—worse than that, things are old and tacky and somewhat ramshackle.|$|R
40|$|Verso in pencil: Auckland. This is {{the third}} attempt I have made at this view from the Domain, a very <b>pretty</b> kind of <b>rough</b> botanical garden of some extent. The large building, the House of Assembly. The Man of War lay in the stream, but the Pier and Merchantmen are more to the left. Flax, Titree, tree ferns, aloes, and Norfolk pines running wild with geraniums etc all over the place. My only regret I can’t finish it more but have already spoilt one in so doing...|$|R

We'll {{have to move}} in the field of education. Move into the professions and move into politics. Move in {{anything}} that any other race has to have to survive. That was a protest idea and inspiration. I was trying to inspire Black people to move up higher. Don't be satisfied with the mediocre...Before the freedom fights started, before the Martin Luther King days, I had to lead a lot of protest meetings. In order to get my message over, there were things that were almost dangerous to say, but you could sing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late in 1976 Snow got {{in trouble}} by wearing illegal {{advertising}} on his cricket clothing, and more when he published an autobiography Cricket Rebel, which was highly critical about the administration of Sussex County Cricket Club and the M.C.C. at Lord's. He called for better playing conditions, improved pay, four-day county matches and international umpires. He also married his wife Jenny, having delayed because [...] "the wife of a regular Test cricketer has a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> time... with the husband away half the summer and most winters". He still had a formidable reputation in Australia and was recruited by Tony Greig for Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. The secret came out at a party held by Greig during the rain affected Sussex vs Australians [...] match of 1977 and there was widespread condemnation by the press and cricketing authorities. Before {{the start of the}} 1978 season Snow and Greig had their Sussex contracts cancelled and successfully went to court with Mike Procter when the T.C.C.B. tried to ban them from First-class cricket. He did not play in any of the [...] "Supertests", but was regular for the World XI and WSC Cavaliers in the one-day games, hitting 42 and taking 3/30 to help win the final against Australia at Canberra in 1977–78.|$|E

Similarly, {{those of}} you who in your long {{vacations}} have ever stayed near Dumblane will be, I think, disappointed in no small degree by this study of the abbey, for which I showed you the sketch at last Lecture. You probably know that the oval window in its west end is one of the <b>prettiest</b> pieces of <b>rough</b> thirteenth-century carving in the kingdom; I used it for a chief example in my lectures at Edinburgh; and you know that the lancet windows, in their fine proportion and rugged masonry, would alone form a study of ruined Gothic masonry of exquisite interest.|$|R
60|$|Harry Pallant {{was never}} more desperately {{in love with}} his wife Louie than on the night of that {{delightful}} dance at the Vernon Ogilvies'. She wore her pale blue satin, with the low bodice, and her <b>pretty</b> necklet of <b>rough</b> amber in natural lumps, which her husband had given her for a birthday present just three days earlier. Harry wasn't rich, and he wasn't able to do everything that he could have wished for Louie--a young barrister, with no briefs to speak of, even if he ekes out his petty professional income with literary work, can't afford to spend very {{much in the way of}} personal adornment upon the ladies of his family--but he loved his pretty little wife dearly, and nothing pleased him better than to see Louie admired as she ought to be by other people. And that evening, to be sure, she was looking her very sweetest and prettiest. Flushed a little with unwonted excitement, in the glow of an innocent girlish flirtation, as she stood there talking to Hugh Ogilvie in the dim recess by the door of the conservatory, Harry, watching her unobserved from a nook of the refreshment-room, thought he had never in his life seen her look more beautiful or more becomingly animated. Animation suited Louie Pallant, and Hugh Ogilvie thought so too, as he half whispered his meaningless compliments in her dainty little ear, and noted the blush that rose quickly to her soft cheek, and the sudden droop of her long eyelashes above her great open hazel-grey eyes.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well! I did {{not strike}} the road, unfortunately. I saw your {{lights in the}} {{distance}} and cut across some fields. It was <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> in the dark, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> on a fellow," [...] {{said another}} voice--Ned's voice--in a choked {{sort of a}} way. [...] "Upon my word, Edith, I don't see how I'm {{going to keep it}} up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's <b>pretty</b> <b>rough,</b> I know; but there's {{no other}} way out of it. You'd treat us the same or worse if the tables were turned, and we're bound {{to take care of}} ourselves." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{approached}} the land again through <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> water, and then steered {{directly across the}} lake at its narrowest part to the eastern side, and were soon partly under the lee of the mountain, having paddled about twenty miles. It was now about noon.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is. Why, you've known me {{only a few}} days.... Dad {{would be}} mad. Like as not he'd knock you down.... I tell you, Lin, my dad is--is <b>pretty</b> <b>rough.</b> And just {{at this time of}} the races.... And if Wildfire beats the King! ... Whew!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say so, Mark! Well, I {{should not}} like such work as that. The prize fighters are a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> lot, {{but to go}} to such dens as those {{is enough to make}} one shudder. But that does not explain where you have been now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I remember. Do you know, I {{thought it}} <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> at the end, {{especially}} on Ram Spudd. I liked him. I sent him two pounds of tobacco to the penitentiary last week; {{you can get}} it in to them, you know, if you know how." ...|$|E
60|$|This was <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> sport, for {{the combatants}} fought {{as if their}} lives and {{fortunes}} depended upon the victory, and although they did not often seriously injure one another, {{there must have been}} many a sore head and bruised leg and arm after the battle was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there are}} no steps to take," [...] said March, with a melancholy smile. [...] "The steps are stopped; that's all."

6000|$|He {{accepted}} the balm of her compassion like a candid and innocent man: [...] "Yes, it was <b>pretty</b> <b>rough.</b> But I didn't mind it, except on your account.

6000|$|... "We're in a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> country," [...] he said, [...] "and a {{man gets}} {{into the habit of}} having his own way here. But listen to me!

6000|$|The {{captain had}} {{probably}} no very clear {{notion of what}} this meant, but simply felt {{it to be a}} critical edge of some sort.

6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} me," [...] he declared, [...] "like {{a man who}} has had a <b>pretty</b> <b>rough</b> time, and I believe he had in his younger days, but I do not believe that he is really either hard or cynical. He has some odd views as regards charity, but upon my word they are logical enough." ...|$|E
