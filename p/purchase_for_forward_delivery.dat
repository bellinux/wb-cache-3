Wright and Williams conjectured that {{inventories}} are held in locations far from the central market on these occasions. In these locations the spot price {{is lower than the}} price <b>for</b> <b>forward</b> <b>delivery</b> because transport costs are temporarily high. This hypothesis has not been directly tested, because prices <b>for</b> <b>forward</b> <b>delivery</b> are not normally available at non-central locations. This paper uses an example where these prices exist to test the hypothesis. The evidence, from the late nineteenth century corn markets in Chicago and New York, strongly supports the conjecture.

Trading in the US began in the mid 19th century, when central grain markets were established and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (also called spot or cash market) or <b>for</b> <b>forward</b> <b>delivery.</b> These <b>forward</b> contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today's exchange-traded futures contracts.

At the same time there has been a surge in the development of digitalisation and the convergence of computing and telecommunications technologies available for use in education. This paper discusses the outcomes of a case study, conducted in a School of Health Studies within a northern English University, which identified the extent to which `non-traditional¿ students access on-line learning facilities, such as virtual learning environments and library networks, and what factors enhanced or formed barriers to access. `Non-traditional¿ students, for the purpose of this study, were defined as mature students who were returning to higher education after a considerable break.

It propose a model of an electricity retailer considering a future scenario where controlled charging of an aggregate of electric vehicles (EV) becomes a viable option. The retailer plans <b>for</b> <b>purchase</b> of electricity from the spot market while hedging its risks in the financial market, specifically the forward market. In a planning environment where the retailer has to make decisions <b>for</b> <b>purchase</b> of <b>forward</b> contracts ahead of spot market clearing, it faces uncertainties from spot market prices and customer demand. A stochastic programming approach with a financial risk measure is used {{to take into consideration}} the uncertainties described. A case study using the model is performed, the results of which indicate that EV customers and the retailer would benefit monetarily with increasing penetration of electric vehicles. The studies consecutively show that this is also the case when increasing fraction of customers opting for variable price contracts...|$|R

40|$|Until the mid- 90 s, {{the more}} active among the Brussels-listed stocks were traded in {{parallel}} segments: "spot" (that is, with t + 3 settlement) and "forward" (periodic settlement {{at the end}} of a two- or three-week period). The forward market was cheaper, deeper, unhampered by price limits, convenient also for shortsales, and played by the pros; so it looks likely to be the more efficient tier. In the forward markets, where the signal is stronger, we do find that time value affects prices. In spot markets there is very little evidence in favor or against a settlement effect, perhaps because the time value item has a very small variability. As expected, the time value signals are somewhat stronger in forward prices and noticeably so in forward premiums,but the estimates remain below our theoretical priors. We also find that price discrepancies are autocorrelated, probably indicating market inefficiency. A closer look reveals that positive forward premiums are persistent whereas negative ones vanish overnight. This is consistent with a market-imperfection explanation, where problems with raising cash (shorting money) are more important than problems with shorting stocks, thus creating preferred habitats <b>for</b> <b>purchases</b> (<b>forward)</b> and <b>for</b> sales (spot). dual markets; price discovery; settlement effect; microstructure;...|$|R

Do the site management and the haulers agree about questions concerning both parties? What is possible to gain by using better logistics? Is it possible to gain time with better logistics and by that reducing the costs? Purpose and aim: The purpose is to discover {{if there are any}} disagreements between the site management and the haulers. If disagreements occur they will be examined and probable measures based on the problems will be suggested. Another intention is to bring key ratios concerning time spent <b>for</b> <b>deliveries</b> <b>forward.</b> One aim is to update a similar report made in 1972.

Method: We have with questionnaires tried {{to find out if the}} site management and the haulers have any disagreements. To see how the delivery logistic work we visited five different building sites and spent two days at each. Conclusion: - Deliveries stay in average longer at the building site than the site management and the haulers believe. - The haulers can save a lot of time if they early notify when they are going to arrive to the building site and then they did not have to wait while they are there. - If the site management had an organised plan concerning different things should be they could avoid unnecessary costs in damages. - If the building sites use a booking system for the machines they could avoid double booking...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} self-reported health and register-based prescription medicine purchases on re-employment chances, and whether these health indicators measure similar aspects of health in this analysis. Data came from a 2006 Danish unemployment survey among {{a random sample of}} unemployed individuals enriched with register data (2006 – 2008, N= 1806). The survey participants all received unemployment benefits from the welfare system and had been unemployed for more than 20 weeks {{at the time of the}} interview in 2006. We combined these data with longitudinal register data on individual prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses and prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses, information on re-employment and various socio-demographic variables. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses to investigate the impact of self-reported health and prescription medicine purchases measured in 2006 on re-employment chances in 2007 and 2008. Our analyses show that unemployed workers with poor self-reported health and workers who had prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses were less likely to be re-employed in 2007 and 2008. Furthermore, the impact of both prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses and for mental illnesses increased when adding self-reported health to the model although prescription <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses became statistically insignificant. The impact of prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> somatic illnesses was mediated by self-reported health, whilst prescription medicine <b>purchases</b> <b>for</b> mental illnesses was only partly mediated. Finally, SRH seemed a much stronger prediction than prescription medicines. From these results, we propose, when possible, the inclusion of both an indicator of self-reported health and an indicator of mental health in studies on re-employment...|$|R
