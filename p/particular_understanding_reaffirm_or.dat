In Kimble, the question was whether to <b>reaffirm</b> <b>or</b> overrule a patent misuse precedent holding agreements for post-patent-expiration royalties unenforceable. The precedent, Brulotte v. Thys Co., had been heavily criticized because it was inconsistent with modern antitrust policy, which generally requires a showing of substantial anticompetitive effects before courts condemn a practice. The Court rejected the application of antitrust policy and any requirement that anticompetitive effects be shown.|$|R

This essay discusses three major controversial moral {{issues that are}} related to conceptions of sex, gender, and sexuality: divorce/remarriage, women’s ordination, and homosexuality. By analysing several contributions to debates on these issues, it proposes and explores a hypothesis that concerns the role of a <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of marriage as characterized by a hermeneutical construct: a communal, deeply rooted and subconscious normative principle that drives our interpretations of texts and practices. This essay illustrates the problems of both the dominance of marriage within Christian communities and lived faith, as well as the modern, romantic aspects of this <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of marriage...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{texts on}} diversity produced in 25 interviews with Flemish human resource (HR) managers from a critical discourse analysis and rhetorical perspective. Following critical discourse analysis, we analyse how HR managers define diversity, how their diversity discourses reflect existing managerial practices and underlying power relations, {{and how they}} <b>reaffirm</b> <b>or</b> challenge those managerial practices and power relations. Specifically, we examine how power enters HR managers' local discourses of diversity through the very micro-dynamics of language by analysing the rhetorical schemes they use and the grand Discourses they draw from. This critical, text-focused approach to diversity discourses contributes {{to the development of}} a non-essentialist reconceptualization of diversity that acknowledges power. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} process whereby {{competition}} {{has come to}} be valued in our economies. Taking a step back in history, we show how it all started not with competition but with cooperation in fact, in the last decades of the 19 th century. Comparing Germany and the USA, we then show how national paths diverged after that. While cooperation remained the accepted and dominant rule in Europe, a <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of competition, what we call oligopolistic competition, came to triumph in the United States. After World War II, this <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> was diffused {{to other parts of the}} world and particularly to Western Europe. When it comes to competition, we thus show that the basic and formal rules of the game that structure Europe today owe a lot, historically, to American models.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of architectural space as a contrasting and changing experience {{from the ground and}} from the ai r. It focuses on how architectural interventions may offer spatial experiences which may be instrumental in gaining a <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of a place. The thesis design is an attempt to nurture the notions of my particular impression of the chosen site. The transformation of the natural landscape focuses on the procession as the body moves through space. It investigates a way architectural interventions may be choreographed, from the beginning, to disorient the visitors and to deprive them of the experiences of the site as a way to sharpen the senses and increase physical awareness of the body and the surroundings, while gradually reintroducing elements of these experiences to them in order to construct a <b>particular</b> <b>understanding</b> of the place. by Soo-Hwa Yuan.

40|$|This paper aims to show, {{through the}} legitimization of certain {{domestic}} habits of indigenous and mestizo populations, the different effects that have some traditions in <b>reaffirming</b> <b>or</b> perpetuating prejudices, taboos and gender pre determinism. In many cases, these popular traditions help to give continuity to the patriarchal {{structures in the}} country, but their also generate different attitudes, requirements, demonstrations of male power and expressions of submission of women who eventually nurture aggression and violence, either symbolic or physical, against them.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} Weber’s theodicy problem to define {{organizational}} corruption as the emerging discrepancy between experience and normative expectation. Theodicy describes {{the attempts to}} explain this discrepancy. The paper presents four normative principles enlisted by observers to respond to perceived corruption: moral dilemma, detachment, systematic regulation, and normative controls. Consistent with social construction, these justifications work to either <b>reaffirm</b> <b>or</b> challenge prevailing social norms {{in the face of}} confusing events. An exemplar case involves perceived corruption in the business of mountain climbing as represented through the 1996 Mt. Everest climbing disaster. The events illustrate how theodicy informs descriptive accounts of corruption and expose two limitations of normative models of ethics.
