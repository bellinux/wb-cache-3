5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., potato grading for Idaho {{potatoes}} {{is performed}} in which No. 1 potatoes {{are the highest}} quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends). Potato density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines. High-density potatoes are desirable {{in the production of}} dehydrated mashed potatoes, <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> and french fries.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide {{has been}} found in roasted barley tea, called mugicha in Japanese. The barley is roasted so it is dark brown prior to being steeped in hot water. The {{roasting}} process revealed 200–600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide in mugicha. This is less than the >1000 micrograms/kg found in <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> and other fried whole potato snack foods cited in the same study and it is unclear {{how much of this is}} ingested after the drink is prepared. Rice cracker and sweet potato levels were lower than in potatoes. Potatoes cooked whole were found to have significantly lower acrylamide levels than the others, suggesting a link between food preparation method and acrylamide levels.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Burger King began {{licensing}} its logo {{and items}} to outside companies for non-Burger King products. A licensed products company, Broad Street Licensing Group, and its manufacturing partner, the Inventure Group, introduced the first {{products in the}} fall of that year: flavored <b>potato</b> <b>crisps</b> in two flavors, flame-broiled burger and French fries with ketchup. Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating [...] "just because you can do something does not mean you should." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another type {{of potato}} chip, notably the Pringles and Lay's Stax brands, {{is made by}} {{extruding}} or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as <b>potato</b> <b>crisps,</b> but they are rarely referred to as such by Americans. Conversely, Pringles may be termed potato chips in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional [...] "crisps". Munchos, another brand that uses the term <b>potato</b> <b>crisps,</b> has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.|$|E

2500|$|Acrylamide was {{discovered}} in foods in April 2002 by Eritrean scientist Eden Tareke in Sweden when she found the chemical in starchy foods, such as potato chips (<b>potato</b> <b>crisps),</b> French fries (chips), and bread that had been heated higher than [...] (production of acrylamide in the heating process was shown to be temperature-dependent). It was not found in food that had been boiled or in foods that were not heated.|$|E

2500|$|In an idea {{originated}} by the Smiths <b>Potato</b> <b>Crisps</b> Company Ltd, {{formed in}} 1920, Frank Smith packaged {{a twist of}} salt with his chips in greaseproof paper bags, which were sold around London. The potato chip remained otherwise unseasoned until an innovation by Joe [...] "Spud" [...] Murphy, {{the owner of the}} Irish crisps company Tayto, who in the 1950s developed a technology to add seasoning during manufacture. After some trial and error, Murphy and his employee Seamus Burke produced the world's first seasoned chips: Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar. Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto's technique.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, [...] "crisps" [...] are {{potato chips}} which are eaten cold, whilst [...] "chips" [...] {{are similar to}} french fries (as in [...] "fish and chips") and are served hot. In Australia, some parts of South Africa, New Zealand, India, the general West Indies {{especially}} in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as [...] "chips", as are the larger [...] "home-style" [...] <b>potato</b> <b>crisps.</b> In the north of New Zealand, they are known as [...] "chippies", but are marketed as [...] "chips" [...] throughout the country.

2500|$|Bradford's textile {{industry}} has been in decline {{for many years and}} the city has suffered from de-industrialisation. Some areas of Bradford are among the worst levels of social deprivation in the UK, with widespread pockets of exclusion, and rates of unemployment in some wards exceeding 25%, though other areas of Bradford are among the least deprived in the UK. The economy is worth around £9.5billion, making Bradford's economy a major powerhouse in the region and is forecast to grow to more than £10billion by 2018, contributing around 8.4% of the region's output, and making the district the third largest (after Leeds and Sheffield) in Yorkshire & Humber. The economy has diversified and the city is home to several major companies, notably in finance (Yorkshire Building Society, Provident Financial, Santander UK), textiles ( [...] British Wool Marketing Board, Bulmer and Lumb Group), chemicals (BASF, Nufarm UK), electronics (Pace Micro, Filtronic), engineering (NG Bailey, Powell Switchgear), and manufacturing, (Denso Marston, Bailey Offsite, Hallmark Cards UK and Seabrook <b>Potato</b> <b>Crisps).</b> Supermarket chain Morrisons has its head office in Bradford as does water utility company Yorkshire Water.|$|E

40|$|Food frying is very energy {{intensive}} and in industrial <b>potato</b> <b>crisp</b> production lines frying {{is responsible for}} more than 90 % of the total energy consumption of the process. This paper considers the energy flows in crisp frying using a First Law of Thermodynamics modelling approach which was verified against data from a <b>potato</b> <b>crisp</b> production line. The results indicate that for the frying process considered, most of the energy used {{is associated with the}} evaporation of water present in the potato and on the surface of potato slices. The remainder is from evaporation of frying oil and air of the ventilation system and heat losses from the fryer wall surfaces by convection and radiation. The frying oil is heated by an industrial gas furnace and the efficiency of this process was calculated to be 84 %. The efficiency of the overall frying process which was found to be of the order of 70 % can be improved by employing exhaust heat recovery and optimising other operating and control parameters such as exhaust gas recirculation...|$|R
