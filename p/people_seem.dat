5|$|Bishop of Mannar (a north western town), Rayappu Joseph, says 146,679 <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to be {{unaccounted}} between 2008 October {{and at the}} end of {{the civil}} war.|$|E
5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to think it works.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no single}} or {{canonical}} Book of the Dead. The surviving papyri contain a varying selection {{of religious and}} magical texts and vary considerably in their illustration. Some <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead, perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was most commonly written in hieroglyphic or hieratic script on a papyrus scroll, and often illustrated with vignettes depicting the deceased and their journey into the afterlife.|$|E
60|$|The <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> {{satisfied}} with this explanation, {{and so they}} let the boy go.|$|R
60|$|Everything was deadly still. The three <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> {{very slow}} in approaching. He {{wondered}} what his antagonist was doing.|$|R
60|$|Kenneth, who {{resented the}} {{companionship}} of most <b>people,</b> <b>seemed</b> {{attracted by the}} man, and hesitated to gallop on and leave him.|$|R
5|$|According to Domhoff, many <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> {{to believe}} that the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
25|$|<b>People</b> <b>seem</b> {{to prefer}} modest levels of novelty; {{they want to}} {{experience}} phenomena that are unfamiliar enough to be interesting, but not so unfamiliar as to be frightening or too familiar as to be boring.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{may have been}} different further north, where Semitic <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have been dominant. In this area, Kish possibly {{was the center of}} a large territorial state, competing with other powerful political entities such as Mari and Akshak.|$|E
60|$|She {{held him}} fast by the arm. The hurried parting before other <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be not}} a parting to Blanche's taste.|$|R
6000|$|Each {{a little}} Burgher Piet [...] Of the hardy Boer race, [...] Two great <b>peoples</b> <b>seem</b> to meet [...] In the tiny sunburned face.|$|R
60|$|Immelan intervened,--grim, suspicious, {{a little}} disturbed. For some reason or other, the meeting {{between these two}} young <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to have made him uneasy.|$|R
25|$|The {{progress}} that Japanese robotics engineers recorded was also possible {{due to the}} friendly image that Japanese people have towards the robots. In the Western countries, <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to picture robots as evil and dangerous creatures and they fear that their jobs could be taken by robots.|$|E
25|$|The El Omari {{culture is}} known {{from a small}} {{settlement}} near modern Cairo. <b>People</b> <b>seem</b> to have lived in huts, but only postholes and pits survive. The pottery is undecorated. Stone tools include small flakes, axes and sickles. Metal was not yet known. Their sites were occupied from 4000BC to the Archaic Period.|$|E
25|$|Direct reciprocity. Research {{shows that}} it can be {{beneficial}} to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example. Many <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.|$|E
60|$|But when he {{had heard}} the whole story he withdrew the remark, and commented on the wholly undeserved good luck some <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to enjoy.|$|R
50|$|On September 27, 2016, he {{was buried}} in his {{hometown}} in Kedungjampang, Karangreja village, Kutasari district, Purbalingga Regency. About 200 <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to accompany Sobron's funeral shouting Takbir.|$|R

25|$|There are {{depictions of}} male and female {{masturbation}} in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. Most early <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature. A clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from a temple site on the island of Malta, depicts a woman masturbating. However, in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common.|$|E
25|$|Stig: His {{nickname}} {{may come}} from the term stigma, as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene. Stig is the last member to be initiated into this generation of the Midnight Society. As such, he has only two stories in the series before the cast is changed. Due to the aversion <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have against him for his looks, both his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and tastes.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 World Happiness Report {{stated that}} in {{subjective}} well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports. Happiness {{is used in}} both life evaluation, as in “How happy are you with your life as a whole?”, and in emotional reports, as in “How happy are you now?,” and <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the World Happiness Report identifies the countries with {{the highest levels of}} happiness.|$|E
50|$|He {{also felt}} {{drawn to the}} {{disaster}} known as The Pitt, after which he had strange experiences with other ghosts and other <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be able to}} see him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Greatrex {{only met}} this flat {{rebellion}} by an indirect remark {{to the effect}} that some <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> absolutely destitute of the very faintest glimmering power of judging human character.|$|R
50|$|The author based {{the novel}} {{on the way}} <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> nice but had a dark side. He got the idea when he {{discovered}} that two ladies he liked were saying things behind his back.|$|R
25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that most early peoples which have left records knew {{something}} of numeration and mechanics, and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and land-surveying. The results attained by these <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have been accessible, under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of observation and measurement, and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.|$|E
25|$|The Bistromath arrives {{too late}} {{at the gate}} to stop the robots, so its {{occupants}} transport to the planet to attempt {{to negotiate with the}} Krikkit people. To their surprise, they find that the <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to lack any desire to continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With Zaphod and Marvin's help, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously be smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—while also being stupid enough not to realise that this weapon would also destroy them.|$|E
5000|$|Pollack {{responded to}} the Suellentrop article by {{saying that he was}} unhappy that many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to have read only the {{subtitle}} of his book, which had not been his choice. He also said: ...|$|R
60|$|Everyone {{rose and}} drank this toast in silence. The {{fate of the}} unfortunate King of France, then a {{prisoner}} of his own <b>people,</b> <b>seemed</b> to cast a gloom even over Mr. Jellyband's pleasant countenance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I got uneasy. <b>People</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{watching}} me. It scared me--badly." [...] She put {{her hand to her}} head. [...] "It's almost the last thing I remember before waking up in the hospital...." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1399, {{the exiled}} Henry Bolingbroke, {{heir to the}} Duchy of Lancaster, {{returned}} to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from Ireland to Wales to deal with Bolingbroke but he was arrested by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, as {{he was on his}} way from Conwy Castle to meet Bolingbroke at Flint Castle supposedly to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Richard was imprisoned at Chester before being taken to London. Parliament quickly made Henry Bolingbroke Regent and then King. Richard died in Pontefract Castle, shortly after the failed Epiphany Rising of English nobles in January 1400, but his death was not generally known for some time. In Wales, people like Owain Glyndŵr were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh had generally supported King Richard, who had succeeded his father, Edward, the Black Prince, as Prince of Wales. With Richard removed, the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people became more limited. Many Welsh <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to have been uncertain where this left them and their future.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Gibbs {{discussed}} his preference for local politics: “At the state level, it’s {{much more about}} whether you are a Republican or a Democrat and winning and losing, rather than making decisions that are good for Colorado. The more dysfunctional things get at {{the federal and state}} levels, the more <b>people</b> <b>seem</b> to come together at the local level to accomplish goals that are important to communities.” ...|$|E
500|$|The semi-finals at Villa Park and Old Trafford {{presented}} traffic {{problems and}} lengthy delays for supporters going {{to and from}} the grounds. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone had written to the FA, expressing his concern about the possible travel chaos and urging to be kept briefed on the arrangements. Train tickets were sold out since the semi-final round, despite the addition of services to accommodate 7,000 extra passengers. Both clubs laid on six planes to take its supporters directly to Cardiff at £135 each. Although the M4 was busy {{on the day of the}} final, there was little traffic with no major delays. A spokesman for South Wales Police reported: [...] "The motorways are clear, despite the predictions. <b>People</b> <b>seem</b> to have taken our advice and left early." ...|$|E
50|$|Germanic <b>peoples</b> <b>seem</b> to {{have adopted}} the week as a {{division}} of time from the Romans, but they changed the Roman names into those of corresponding Teutonic deities. Hence, the dies Solis became Sunday (German, Sonntag).|$|R
6000|$|BARTHWICK. Most distressing! The more I see of it, {{the more}} {{important}} this question of {{the condition of the}} <b>people</b> <b>seems</b> to become. I shall certainly make a point of taking up the cudgels in the House. I shall move---- ...|$|R
