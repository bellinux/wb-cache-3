40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the fatigue crack growth {{behavior}} in structural components {{from the old}} 19 th century structures (e. g. bridges) has been investigated. The delivered material for investigation was extracted from a beam made of <b>puddled</b> <b>iron,</b> commonly used in 19 th century. The obtained results from several ancient railway metallic bridges (located in Lower Silesia, Poland) have shown the presence of microstructural degradation processes in <b>puddled</b> <b>iron.</b> In all analyzed materials (low carbon <b>puddled</b> <b>iron)</b> microstructure degradation processes were related to: the presence of numerous precipitations of carbides and nitrides (or the carbides–nitrides) of iron inside the ferrite grains, the presence of continuous precipitations of cementite at ferrite grain boundaries. In order to restore the initial state of the microstructure, all tests were carried out in two stages of heat treatment; as-received state and after normalization (950 °C, 2 h, cooled in air) state. The kinetic fatigue fracture diagrams (KFFD) have been obtained. The problem of crack closure {{has been involved in}} fatigue crack growth process during the experiments and its understanding is fundamental for the analysis of stress ratio effects on KFFD. In the paper, a few experimental and numerical techniques for the evaluation of the crack closure/opening forces based on the experimental data have been compared.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cumulative}} concept {{proposed by}} Palmgren and Miner [1] {{maintains that the}} damage level can be {{expressed in terms of}} the number of cycles applied at a given stress range divided by the number of cycles needed to produce failure for the same stress range.

40|$|AbstractBeing {{the second}} oldest railway network in Europe, {{almost half of}} the {{metallic}} railway bridges in France were built before the 1900 s. At the time, <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> was the building material of preference amongst most engineers, hot riveting was the preferred joining method. Considering the ageing of these constructions, as well as the increasing evolution of traffic in the network, the understanding of the behaviour of this type of structures to cyclic loadings is of utmost importance. However, high cycle fatigue characterization is an expensive and time consuming process. The use of a fast characterization method through the measure of self-heating of the specimens during cycling loadings is proposed and analysed. For homogeneous materials, like modern steel, the use of self-heating measurements to estimate fatigue-life related properties has shown good correlation to results obtained by the standard fatigue tests with the advantage of a lower time of characterization. In our case, non-metallic inclusions present in the <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> will have an important influence in the response of the material, and therefore the interpretation of the temperature's evolution needs a different approach. Due to its complexity, the integrity of the structure must be analysed from a multi-scaled point of view. For this study, we focused in the quantification of the influence that the population of non-metallic inclusions have on the mechanic and thermal behaviour of a <b>puddled</b> <b>iron.</b> For this purpose, a set of specimens previously tested by the self-heating method were prepared and observed using two different tools: a classic optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The relationship between geometric parameters of the inclusions found in the specimens and their temperature response to cyclic loadings was shown. The hypothesis of the presence of micro plasticity (dissipative phenomenon) near inclusions was also validated through SEM observations...|$|R
50|$|Stays {{made from}} <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> bar {{were used as}} a cheaper {{alternative}} to copper for joining {{the inner and outer}} firebox plates of steam locomotives. The incorporated stringers gave flexibility akin to stranded wire rope and stays made of the material were therefore resistant to snapping in service. Wrought iron rivets made from iron bar typically contained stringer filaments running the length of the rivet, but filaments at right angles to the tension, particularly beneath the head, caused weakness.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLargely used as main {{material}} in railway riveted bridges {{during the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> characterizes for having an anisotropic behaviour due to the large amount of non metallic inclusions that it posses. Its mechanical characterization is thus difficult. Since these ancient structures have supported variable cyclic loadings at least for a century, the determination of the puddled iron's fatigue properties becomes crucial to their maintenance. The self-heating method is proposed in this paper to accomplish this task. The obtained experimental self-heating curves show dispersion non observed in homogeneous materials, this phenomenon is explained by the lack of determination of the representative elementary volume of the <b>puddled</b> <b>iron.</b> However, this data gives us important information such as the minimum and maximum boundaries of the mean fatigue limit for several orientations. A two-scale probabilistic model for high cycle fatigue is also used to represent the dispersion on the experimental data by using Weibull's distribution law to describe several characteristics of each site where the microplasticity occurs. The influence of such parameters and the limitations of the model are also studied...|$|R

Regarding their use {{in the case of}} old steel structures, there is however much less literature, more particularly concerning their use for old steel materials such as <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> and mild steel. In the case of steel structures, the adhesive joint behaviour becomes more tremendous than in the case of concrete, as it will be the weak link of the assembly. That's the reason why we decided to investigate the bond behaviour between CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) laminates and different old steel materials (mild steel and <b>puddled</b> <b>iron).</b> Different commercial reinforcement processes (different composite elastic modulus and thicknesses, different adhesives) have been experimentally studied investigating the materials' behaviour (steel, and adhesive) and the assembly behaviour through the realization of single lap shear tests. Some of the shear samples were monitored using strain gages during the test in order to determine an equivalent interfacial behaviour that may be used during the design process of the reinforcement. Additionally, some load/unload cycles have been applied to check their effect on the assembly capacity...|$|R

5000|$|Puddled iron—the {{puddling}} process {{was the first}} large-scale process to produce wrought <b>iron.</b> In the <b>puddling</b> process, pig <b>iron</b> is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent harmful sulphur from the coal or coke from contaminating the iron. The molten pig iron is manually stirred and iron ore, an oxygen source, is added, which decarburizes the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (rabble arm or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the open hearth furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.|$|R

50|$|In 1816, the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, {{which had}} earlier {{successfully}} adapted {{new technology to}} shipbuilding with the Charlotte Dundas, authorised {{the development of an}} all-iron ship, and they quickly settled upon building a canal barge.

The design called for iron sectionals to be riveted together with covering plates. Two blacksmiths were hired to construct the parts. The plating had to be hammered out of <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> as no iron rolling mills existed at the time. The iron was supplied by the Monklands Steel Company.|$|R

As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300 tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 m on each side, to a depth of only 6.25 cm assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8 tons per cubic metre. Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324 m x 125 m x 125 m) would contain [...] tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself.

50|$|For instance, two {{processes}} {{were used}} in constructing iron armor. In the first, hammering, large lumps of iron of scrap or <b>puddled</b> <b>iron</b> were heated to welding temperature and placed under heavy steel hammers. Repeated blows welded these lumps into one solid plate and shaped it to the required form and dimensions. Hammered iron plate was the armor used in the earliest ironclad vessels, including HMS Warrior. The second method, rolling, involved stacking iron lumps atop one another, heating them to welding temperature and passing them between two iron rollers to become one plate of the required size. Rolled iron was difficult to produce initially, as it required machinery of immense size and great power. However, when the Special Committee tested both types of plate in 1863, it found that rolled iron was superior to hammered due to greater uniformity in quality. The committee and iron manufacturers worked together on how to more easily produce rolled plate, which became standard use in warships beginning in 1865.|$|R
