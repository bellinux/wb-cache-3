40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the printing plate onto the printing substrate. The pad printing is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area of the <b>printing</b> <b>elements,</b> on the pad printing plate one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer pad printing plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the <b>printing</b> <b>elements.</b> The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the <b>printing</b> <b>elements.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the <b>printing</b> <b>elements,</b> consequently on the reproduction of the pad <b>printing</b> plate <b>elements.</b> For this purpose four pad printing plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences the <b>printing</b> <b>elements</b> size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form <b>printing</b> <b>elements</b> of desired depth...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{microstrip}} or printed reflectarrays {{are designed}} using the transmit mode technique. In this method, {{the size of}} each <b>printed</b> <b>element</b> is chosen so as to provide the required value of the reflection phase such that a collimated beam results along a given direction. The reflection phase of each <b>printed</b> <b>element</b> is approximated using an infinite array model. The infinite array model is an excellent engineering approximation for a large microstrip array since the size or orientation of elements exhibits a slow spatial variation. In this model, the reflection phase from a given <b>printed</b> <b>element</b> is approximated by that of an infinite array of elements {{of the same size}} and orientation when illuminated by a local plane wave. Thus the reflection phase {{is a function of the}} size (or orientation) of the element, the elevation and azimuth angles of incidence of a local plane wave, and polarization. Typically, one computes the reflection phase of the infinite array as a function of several parameters such as size/orientation, elevation and azimuth angles of incidence, and in some cases for vertical and horizontal polarization. The design requires the selection of the size/orientation of the <b>printed</b> <b>element</b> to realize the required phase by interpolating or curve fitting all the computed data. This is a substantially complicated problem, especially in applications requiring a computationally intensive commercial code to determine the reflection phase. In dual polarization applications requiring rectangular patches, one needs to determine the reflection phase as a function of five parameters (dimensions of the rectangular patch, elevation and azimuth angles of incidence, and polarization). This is an extremely complex problem. The new method employs the reciprocity principle and reaction concept, two well-known concepts in electromagnetics to derive the receive mode analysis and design techniques. In the "receive mode design" technique, the reflection phase is computed for a plane wave incident on the reflectarray from the direction of the beam peak. In antenna applications with a single collimated beam, this method is extremely simple since all printed elements see the same angles of incidence. Thus the number of parameters is reduced by two when compared to the transmit mode design. The reflection phase computation as a function of five parameters in the rectangular patch array discussed previously is reduced to a computational problem with three parameters in the receive mode. Furthermore, if the beam peak is in the broadside direction, the receive mode design is polarization independent and the reflection phase computation is a function of two parameters only. For a square patch array, it is a function of the size, one parameter only, thus making it extremely simple...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} applying thermoelectric generators as power sources for implantable applications. Thermoelectric design principles, manufacturing methods and novel materials are foundational aspects of the work. Rapid advancements {{in the field of}} biomedical engineering has led to the vast number of implantable medical devices developed within the last few decades. As implantable medical devices provide more functionality, sufficient energy storage while maintaining compactness becomes challenging. The lifetime of implanted medical devices will often be much shorter than the expected lifespan of patients, adding risks and costs to the patient in the form of additional surgical procedures. A perpetual power source that extends the longevity of implantable devices still remains elusive. This presents opportunities for solid-state thermal energy harvesting with thermoelectric energy generators (TEGs) that scavenge waste heat, the most abundant source of energy from the body. Thermoelectric energy generators (TEGs) provide solid-state energy by converting temperature differences into usable electricity. Since the fat in the human body provides thermal insulation, the largest temperature differences (typically 1 - 5 K) are found in the highest fat regions of the body. Bioheat transfer modeling shows that the optimal placement of TEGs for energy generation is in the abdomen under high convective conditions. Based on average 100 µW (at 1 V) input power requirements of implantable medical devices, thermoelectric and heat transfer design theories suggest a need for high aspect ratio thermoelectric elements in high density arrays {{to take advantage of the}} low temperature differences in the fat layer. In order to maximize power output, traditional thermoelectric device designs must be abandoned and a planar TEG device design is proposed as an effective and scalable method for implantable medical applications. Dispenser printing was then shown as a scalable and repeatable manufacturing method for depositing thick-film thermoelectric materials in the fabrication of planar TEGs. The use of printed fabrication methods led to the development and synthesis of novel printable composite thermoelectric materials. The thermoelectric properties of the printed thermoelectric materials were analyzed and carefully characterized as a function of temperature. The maximum dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) at 302 K for an n-type Bi 2 Te 3 -epoxy composite was 0. 18 when cured at 250 °C, while the ZT of a p-type Sb 2 Te 3 -epoxy composite cured at 350 °C was 0. 34. A 50 -couple TEG prototype with 5 mm x 640 µm x 90 µm <b>printed</b> <b>element</b> dimensions was fabricated on a polyimide substrate with evaporated metal contacts. The prototype device produced a power output of 10. 5 µW at 61. 3 µA and 171. 6 mV for a temperature difference of 20 K resulting in a device areal power density of 75 µW/cm 2. The results of the work are promising and alternative methods to improve the performance of future devices are proposed. While the initial focus of this work was specific to the field of biomedical devices, the technologies that have been developed are applicable to other fields involving energy harvesting. The prospective impact of this work ultimately paves the path towards the advanced healthcare system of the future based on integrated autonomous wireless systems for the needs of "aging in place" or "aging at home" technologies...|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine the possibility to use luminescent nanosized systems for registration of changes {{that take place in}} packaged food products during storage. We studied the influence of substances that emerge in food products as a result of spoilage processes (lactic and acetic acids, alcohols, amines) on luminescence of nanosized zinc oxide (ZnO) and organic luminophores. We created nanophotonic compositions and researched their properties in order to use them for the manufacture of printed novel packaging. Nanophotonic systems as <b>printed</b> <b>elements</b> are promising to ensure the functionality of novel packaging—active and intelligent (smart) packaging, which inform on the status of a packaged food product by changing the properties of an external or internal <b>printed</b> <b>elements</b> or sensors (optical, mechanical, electronic, or other properties). These changes are to be registered visually or instrumentally, by internal of external devices (sensors), in the latter case enabling combination with ICT, as the response of packaging can be transformed into electrical signals and processed and analyzed or passed into computer systems for processing. Therefore, creating nanophotonic compositions and future simulation and study of the characteristics of printing techniques of producing <b>printed</b> <b>elements</b> and functional surfaces, including multilayer, containing these system is an actual task.
