40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} discuss the {{identity}} of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> People in the United States.

50|$|The <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa</b> {{or yellow}} tree boa (Chilabothrus inornatus) is {{a species of}} slender, terrestrial, {{viviparous}} boa with a dark brown coloration. It grows to about 1.8 - 2.7 m in total length. It feeds on small mammals, birds, and lizards.|$|E
50|$|Since the karst {{region in}} which the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa</b> lives usually has many caves, the boa has the {{opportunity}} to feed on bats.

50|$|A mass {{migration}} from Puerto Rico to Philadelphia coincided with an industrialization <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> economy {{from the late}} 1940s to 1970. Most <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> came from rural areas. During the period many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> worked in factories. <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> neighborhoods and organizations formed during the area. By the 1950s <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> became the largest Latino and Hispanic group in Philadelphia. In the 1950s many pan-Latino areas were becoming predominately <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican.</b> By 1954, 65% of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> in Philadelphia lived in three neighborhoods north of Center City. In the 1950s <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> were settling in those three neighborhoods {{and two of them}} became no longer majority white. Spring Garden, the third, remained predominately White. In the period from 1950 to 1970 the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> community expanded by over 60,000. By the 1960s an increase of Cubans arrived in Philadelphia and the proportionate percentage of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> began to decline.|$|R

Such behavior has been observed being directed against the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa</b> by immature Puerto Rican spindalis.The vocalization of the Puerto Rican spindalis is not as complex as that of other Spindalis species; only the songs of S. dominicensis are less elaborate. As with all Spindalis, the males emit high pitched sounds at 8 KHz or higher, usually from treetops high above the ground. Females, on the other hand, sing [...] "whisper songs" [...] usually from dense areas close to the ground.

50|$|The Northeast Ecological Corridor Nature Reserve (NECNR) {{refers to}} an area {{designated}} as a protected Nature Reserve located on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico, between the municipalities of Luquillo and Fajardo. Specifically, the lands that comprise the NEC are located between Luquillo’s town square {{to the west and}} Seven Seas Beach to the east, being delineated by PR Route # 3 to its south and the Atlantic Ocean to its north. It was decreed as a protected area by former Puerto Rico Governor Aníbal S. Acevedo-Vilá in April 2008, a decision reversed by Governor Luis G. Fortuño-Burset in October 2009, although he later passed a law in June 2012 re-designated as nature reserve two-thirds of its lands, after intense lobbying and public pressure. Later, in 2013, Governor Alejandro García-Padilla signed a law declaring all lands within the NEC a nature reserve. The area comprises 2,969.64 acres (1201.77 hectares), which include such diverse habitats as forests, wetlands, beaches, coral communities, and a sporadically bioluminescent lagoon. The Corridor is also home to 866 species of flora and fauna, of which 54 are considered critical elements, meaning rare, threatened, endangered and endemic species classified by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), some even designated as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). These include, among others, federally endangered species such as the plain pigeon, the snowy plover, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa,</b> the hawksbill sea turtle and the West Indian manatee. The beaches along the NEC, which are 8.74 kilometers (5.43 miles) long are important nesting grounds for the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), which starts its nesting season around April each year.|$|E

40|$|The endemic <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa</b> (Epicrates inornatus) {{has spent}} 42 {{years on the}} Endangered Species List with little {{evidence}} for recovery. One significant impediment to effective conservation planning has been {{a lack of knowledge}} of the distribution of genetic variability in the species. It has previously been suggested that boas might best be protected around caves that harbor large populations of bats. Prior study has found Puerto Rican boas at relatively high densities in and around bat caves, which they use both to feed and seek shelter. However, it is unknown whether these behaviorally distinctive populations represent a distinct evolutionary lineage, or (conversely) whether caves harbor representative genetic diversity for the species across the island. We provide the first genetic study of the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>boa,</b> and we examine and compare genetic diversity and divergence among two cave populations and two surface populations of boas. We find three haplogroups and an apparent lack of phylogeographic structure across the island. In addition, we find that the two cave populations appear no less diverse than the two surface populations, and harbor multiple mtDNA lineages. We discuss the conservation implications of these findings, including a call for the immediate protection of the remaining cave-associated populations of boas...|$|E
