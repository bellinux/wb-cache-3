40|$|The {{objectives}} of gaseous waste management for the recycling of nuclear used fuel {{is to reduce}} by best practical means (ALARA) and below regulatory limits, the quantity of activity discharged to the environment. The industrial PUREX process recovers the fissile material U(VI) and Pu(IV) to re-use them for the fabrication of new fuel elements e. g. <b>recycling</b> <b>plutonium</b> as a Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel or recycling uranium for new enrichment for Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Meanwhile {{the separation of the}} waste (activation and fission product) is performed as a function of their pollution in order to store and avoid any potential danger and release towards the biosphere. Raffinate, that remains after the extraction step and which contains mostly all fission products and minor actinides is vitrified, the glass package being stored temporarily at the recycling plant site. Hulls and end pieces coming from PWR recycled fuel are compacted by means of a press leading to a volume reduced to 1 / 5 th of initial volume. An organic waste treatment step will recycle the solvent, mainly tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) and some of its hydrolysis and radiolytic degradation products such as dibutyl phosphate (HDPB) and monobutyl phosphate (H 2 MBP). Although most scientific and technological development work focused on high level waste streams, a considerable effort is still under way in the area of intermediate and low level waste management. Current industrial practices for the treatment of gaseous effluents focusing essentially on Iodine- 129 and Krypton- 85 will be reviewed along with the development of novel technologies to extract, condition, and store these fission products. As an example, the current industrial practice is to discharge Kr- 85, a radioactive gas, entirely to the atmosphere after dilution, but for the large recycling facilities envisioned in the near future, several techniques such as 1) cryogenic distillation and selective absorption in solvents, 2) adsorption on activated charcoal, 3) selective sorption on chemical modified zeolites, or 4) diffusion through membranes with selective permeability are potential technologies to retain the gas...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{assessment}} (PA) analyses {{have been}} completed for high level nuclear waste forms derived from once through Light Water Reactor (LWR) spent fuel (SF), defense high level waste (DHLW), the closed advanced liquid metal reactor (ALMR) pyroprocess fuel cycle, and the front end processing of LWR spent fuel for possible recycling of the actinides in the closed ALMR fuel cycle. The IMARC (Integrated Multiple Assumptions and Release Calculations) and RIP (Repository Integration Program) PA tools were utilized to predict the performance of these wasteforms for emplacement in the proposed Yucca Mountain Repository;A model was developed to predict the time dependent failure distribution of the engineered barrier system. This model utilized the Weibull distribution as the tool to estimate the failure properties of each barrier of the multi-barrier waste containers. The sequential failure of each barrier {{was included in the}} model. The results were used in the subsequent PA analyses;The overall conclusion drawn from the use of two PA tools is that the total actinide release to the accessible environment is substantially lower for the closed ALMR fuel cycle and LWR actinide recycle wasteforms relative to directly disposed LWR SF. The release of fission products is similar. This is due to the significantly lower actinide inventory within these wasteforms;The maximum releases were found to occur for fracture dominated flow for all wasteforms considered. Under matrix dominated flow, sorption of the actinides is greatly enhanced. The dominant actinide under fracture flow conditions is 239 Pu while under matrix flow conditions 237 Np dominates as the Pu is effectively sorbed onto the tuff. The release of fission products is independent of the flow mode since they do not strongly sorb to tuff and will dominate the total release in a matrix flow situation;The benefits of incorporating LWR actinides into the closed ALMR fuel cycle are apparent at Yucca Mountain regardless of the flow mode. If fracture flow dominates, the reduction in the <b>plutonium</b> inventory through <b>recycling</b> leads to reductions in the total actinide release relative to that from LWR SF. If matrix flow dominates, the reduction in the neptunium and plutonium inventory (particularly 241 Pu) through recycling again leads to reductions in the total actinide release relative to that from LWR SF. The degree of reduction is largest when matrix flow dominates...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of radioactive wastes from the nuclear fuel cycle {{has become an}} important issue {{in the development of}} future, more sustainable nuclear energy systems. Partitioning and transmutation (P&T) of actinides and some long-lived fission products could reduce the mass and radiotoxicity of highlevel wastes and possibly ease repository licensing requirements. Influenced by political and technological developments, an increasing number of countries employing nuclear power have become interested in P&T technology which involves the development of new types of critical and/or sub-critical reactors and very efficient fuel cycle strategies. The present thesis is closely connected to two P&T related projects of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris, a numerical benchmark exercise for an accelerator-driven minor actinides burner and a calculational system study on the role of accelerator-driven systems (ADS) and advanced fast reactors (FR) in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The author co-coordinated the benchmark exercise and performed the comparative analysis of the different "fuel cycle schemes" investigated in the system study. The benchmark exercise contributed to a greater understanding of the physical phenomena characteristic of the transmutation of actinides in a closed fuel cycle, and allowed to test and improve the tools used for modeling ADSs and corresponding advanced fuel cycles. This work thus effectively {{led to the development of}} an efficient and more complete calculational scheme, which has permitted an in-depth and reliable analysis of different transmutation scenarios to be carried out. To quantitatively assess the advantages and drawbacks of transmutation, we considered a limited number of "base" transmutation scenarios which constitute an envelope for various possible transmutation strategies employing fast spectrum systems. We then evaluated, for an equilibrium situation, the main aspects which characterise the different transmutation strategies, such as the nuclear park composition, the mass and toxicity of the waste, the need for natural uranium, the in-pile and out-pile mass inventories and, finally, the fuel cycle requirements. Thus, this study has allowed for the reliable comparison of performances of the three main options in the nuclear waste management, viz. open cycle, <b>recycling</b> of <b>plutonium</b> alone and <b>recycling</b> of all the actinides, as well as an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of ADSs in comparison to advanced critical reactors in the {{management of}} minor actinides or transuranics. The last part of the dissertation is dedicated to a phase-out study for two schemes employing either ADSs or critical reactors. It has been shown thereby that advanced systems, optimised for an equilibrium fuel composition, can indeed be used to reduce the inventory of transuranics. A comparison of ADS and FR performances has been made in this context, and the relative benefits of transmutation have been quantified in each case taking into consideration, more realistically, the residual mass inventory after the shutdown of all nuclear installations...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project {{was to assess the}} feasibility of improving the performance of PWR and BWR cores by using solid hydride fuels instead of the commonly used oxide fuel. The primary measure of performance considered is the bus-bar cost of electricity (COE). Additional performance measures considered are safety, fuel bundle design simplicity – in particular for BWR’s, and plutonium incineration capability. It was found that hydride fuel can safely operate in PWR’s and BWR’s without restricting the linear heat generation rate of these reactors relative to that attainable with oxide fuel. A couple of promising applications of hydride fuel in PWR’s and BWR’s were identified: (1) Eliminating dedicated water moderator volumes in BWR cores thus enabling to significantly increase the cooled fuel rods surface area as well as the coolant flow cross section area in a given volume fuel bundle while significantly reducing the heterogeneity of BWR fuel bundles thus achieving flatter pin-by-pin power distribution. The net result is a possibility to significantly increase the core power density – on the order of 30 % and, possibly, more, while greatly simplifying the fuel bundle design. Implementation of the above modifications is, though, not straightforward; it requires a design of completely different control system that could probably be implemented only in newly designed plants. It also requires increasing the coolant pressure drop across the core. (2) <b>Recycling</b> <b>plutonium</b> in PWR’s more effectively than is possible with oxide fuel by virtue of a couple of unique features of hydride fuel – reduced inventory of U- 238 and increased inventory of hydrogen. As a result, the hydride fuelled core achieves nearly double the average discharge burnup and the fraction of the loaded Pu it incinerates in one pass is double that of the MOX fuel. The fissile fraction of the Pu in the discharged hydride fuel is only ~ 2 / 3 that of the MOX fuel and the discharged hydride fuel is more proliferation resistant. Preliminary feasibility assessment indicates that by replacing some of the ZrH 1. 6 by ThH 2 {{it will be possible to}} further improve the plutonium incineration capability of PWR’s. Other possibly promising applications of hydride fuel were identified but not evaluated in this work. A number of promising oxide fueled PWR core designs were also found as spin-offs of this study: (1) The optimal oxide fueled PWR core design features smaller fuel rod diameter of D= 6. 5 mm and a larger pitch-to-diameter ratio of P/D= 1. 39 than presently practiced by industry – 9. 5 mm and 1. 326. This optimal design can provide a 30 % increase in the power density and a 24 % reduction in the cost of electricity (COE) provided the PWR could be designed to have the coolant pressure drop across the core increased from the reference 29 psia to 60 psia. (2) Using wire wrapped oxide fuel rods in hexagonal fuel assemblies it is possible to design PWR cores to operate at 54 % higher power density than the reference PWR design that uses grid spacers and a square lattice, provided 60 psia coolant pressure drop across the core could be accommodated. Uprating existing PWR’s to use such cores could result in 40 % reduction in the COE. The optimal lattice geometry is D = 8. 08 mm and P/D = 1. 41. The most notable advantages of wire wraps over grid spacers are their significant lower pressure drop, higher critical heat flux and improved vibrations characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Various recycle {{strategies}} {{have been proposed}} to manage the inventory of transuranics in commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF), with a particular goal of increasing the loading capacity of spent fuel and reprocessing wastes in the Yucca Mountain repository. Transuranic recycling in commercial LWRs {{can be seen as}} a viable means of slowing the accumulation of transuranics in the nationwide CSNF stockpile. Furthermore, this type of approach is an important first step in demonstrating the benefits of a nuclear fuel cycle which incorporates recycling, such as envisioned for Generation-IV reactor systems under development. Recycling strategies of this sort are not proposed as an attempt to eliminate the need of a geologic nuclear waste repository, but as a means to enhance the usefulness of the repository currently under construction in the U. S., perhaps circumventing the need for a second facility. A US-DOE Secretarial recommendation on the need for the construction of a second geologic repository is required by 2010. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) has supported a breadth of work to evaluate the ideal transuranic separation and recycle strategy. Previous AFCI studies of LWR-based transmutation have considered the benefits of homogeneously <b>recycling</b> <b>plutonium,</b> plutonium and neptunium, and all transuranic (TRU) species. A study of a wide range of hypothetical separation schemes (Pu, Pu+Np, Pu+Np+Am, etc.) with multi-recycling has also been performed, focusing on the proliferation resistance of the various fuel cycles and fuel handling issues. The direct recycle of the recovered TRU from spent inert-matrix fuel (IMF) into new IMF was found to be quite limited due to the rapid burndown of the fissile plutonium. The IMF is very effective at destroying the fissile fraction of the TRU with destruction rates in excess of 80 % of the fissile material without recycling the IMF. Blending {{strategies have}} been proposed to mitigate the rapid burndown of the fissile plutonium by mixing high fissile feed from new sources (e. g., spent UO{sub 2 } pins) with the low fissile material recovered from the recycled transmutation fuel. The blending of the fuels is anticipated to aid the multi-recycle of the transuranics. A systematic study of blending strategies (for both IMF and MOX) has been initiated and is currently ongoing. This work extends the previous study that considered separation strategies for plutonium, neptunium, and americium recycling in MOX, CORAIL, and IMF{sub 6 } by considering blending schemes and approach to continuous recycle. Plutonium and americium are recycled in order to reduce the intermediate term (100 to 1500 years after spent fuel irradiation) decay heat of the disposed waste which accounts for the bulk of the repository heating. Since the long-term released dose from the repository is dominated by neptunium, it is sensible to consume it by transmutation in a reactor, as well. Curium accounts for {approx} 0. 6 % of the TRU mass in spent UO{sub 2 } fuel ({approx} 0. 008 % of the heavy metal), but does constitute significantly higher fractions in spent transmutation fuels. This initial evaluation will focus on blending strategies for the multirecycling of Pu+Np+Am. The impact of curium recycle will be investigated as part of the systematic study of blending strategies. The initial study focuses on understanding a simple strategy for IMF recycle and blending. More complex strategies (i. e., heterogeneous assemblies) will be evaluated later in the year, including enriched uranium support options. Currently, a preliminary study of a serial blending strategy has been performed in order to evaluate the impact of blending on the performance of the IMF recycle and to evaluate the potential for continuous or infinite recycle. The continuous recycle of Pu+Np+Am in IMF would allow for complete destruction of all heat contributing actinides in the same LWRs that originally produced them. The only transuranics sent to the repository would be those lost in reprocessing and curium if it is not eventually recycled...|$|R

In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein solches Kriterium vorgeschlagen. Es beruht auf Erfahrungen mit dem Einsatz von MOX-BE in franzoesischen und deutschen DWR und wurde auch durch eigene Gesamtkernrechnungen fuer Voll-MOX Kerne bestaetigt. Die Analysen der Kuehlmitteldichte Reaktivitaetskoeffizienten zeigen, dass der Anteil an spaltbarem Plutonium im MOX #approx# 6 % nicht ueberschreiten soll, wenn die Sicherheitseigenschaften des Reaktors beibehalten werden sollen. Die Plutonium Mehrfach-Rezyklierung wurde fuer ein Szenarium mit einem Pool gleicher DWR eingehend untersucht. Bei diesem Modell sind am Anfang nur UOX-Kerne vorhanden. Sobald im Pool genuegend Plutonium erzeugt worden ist, werden UOX-Kerne durch MOX-Kerne ersetzt. Bei den Rechnungen wird 10 Jahre Umlaufzeit angenommen. Das in MOX-Kernen erzeugte Plutonium wird mit dem Plutonium der noch im Pool vorhandenen UOX-Kerne vermischt. Der Spaltstoff Anteil des Plutoniums im MOX Brennstoff wird auf 6 % begrenzt; falls erforderlich wird angereichertes U" 2 " 3 " 5 verwendet, um die Kritikalitaetsanforderungen zu erfuellen. Dieses Szenarium fuehrt nach etwa 60 bis 80 Jahren zu einem quasi-stationaeren Plutonium Inventar auf einem Niveau von etwa der Haelfte des Falles ohne Rezyklierung zu diesem Zeitpunkt. Der Aufbau von Neptunium betraegt 5 [...] 6 % des Plutoniums in einem Zyklus und wird praktisch nicht durch die Rezyklierung beeinflusst. Die Americium Menge dagegen erreicht bei der Rezyklierung die gleiche Groessenordnung wie Neptunium, bleibt ohne Rezyklierung aber deutlich geringer. (orig. /DG) The {{equivalency}} {{of uranium}} oxide (UOX) and MOX fuel assemblies {{in the same}} PWR core have lead to some problems in the past. Based on experiences in French and German PWRs, as specification for the fissile fraction of the MOX fuel has been derived. The problem of plutonium multi-recycling in PWRs has been studied {{with the help of}} whole core calculations for full MOX cores with appropriate scenarios for the mass flows. These whole core calculations need fissile plutonium fractions in accordance with the results of the investigations for the equivalency of UOX and MOX fuel assemblies, mentioned before. The analysis of the coolant density reactivity coefficient indicates that the plutonium fissile fraction should be limited to #approx# 6 %, if safety related parameters have to be maintained. The long term investigations are based on a scenario with pools of PWRs, consisting of only UOX cores at the beginning. As soon as enough plutonium is produced in this pool, UOX cores are replaced by full MOX cores. For the ex-core periods, 7 years of cooling and processing time and 3 years of fabrication time are chosen. The plutonium for the next cycle is obtained by mixing all available plutonium from the UOX and the MOX cores. The fissile fraction of the plutonium is limited to #approx# 6 %; if necessary, enriched U" 2 " 3 " 5 is used to meet criticality conditions. This scenario for plutonium multi-recycling leads to a near to equilibrium plutonium composition with constant inventory after about 60 to 80 years. At this time the amount of pluntonium is about half the value, compared to a scenario without <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling.</b> This means that large savings of plutonium buildup may be obtained by <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> in PWRs.

According to the MIMAS process, developed by BELGONUCLEAIRE, a primary blend made of UO 2 containing about 30 % PuO 2 is micronised in a ball mill, afterwards this primary blend is mechanically diluted in UO 2 to obtain the specified Pu content. After mixing, the (U,Pu) 02 powder is pressed and the pellets are sintered. The sintering cover gas contains moisture and 5 v/o H- 2. Moisture increases the sintering process and the U-Pu interdiffusion. After sintering and grinding, the pellets are submitted to severe controls to verify conformity with customer specifications (fissile content, Pu distribution, surface condition, chemical purity, density, microstructure) ...|$|E

Calculations have been made to compare the actinides and fission products recycling scheme with the normal <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> scheme in a fast reactor. For this purpose, the Karlsruhe version of isotope generation and depletion code, KORIGEN, has been modified accordingly. An entirely novel fission product yields library for fast reactors has been created which has replaced the old KORIGEN fission products library. For the purposes of this study, the standard 26 groups data set, KFKINR, developed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany, has been extended by the addition of the cross-sections of 13 important actinides and 68 most important fission products. It has been confirmed that these 68 fission products constitute about 95 % of the total fission products yield and about 99. 5 % of the total absorption due to fission products in fast reactors. The amount of fissile material required to guarantee the criticality of the reactor during recycling schemes has also been investigated. Cumulative high active waste per ton of initial heavy metal is also calculated. Results show that the {{recycling of}} actinides and fission products in fast reactors through the atomics international reduction oxidation process results in a reduction of the potential hazard of radioactive waste...|$|E
40|$|Japan could {{acquire a}} 50 -year reserve of low-enriched uranium fuel for its {{nuclear power plants}} at about {{half the cost of}} its {{plutonium}} program, providing energy security and major economic and political benefits. Fuel for light-water reactors made with plu-tonium costs four to eight times as much as conventional uranium fuel. Japan can develop a Strategic Uranium Reserve to address its energy security concerns and elim-inate any need to proceed now with <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> with its many attendant costs and nuclear proliferation risks. Such a reserve could provide as much as a 50 -year, energy-secure timeframe within which Japan could develop the commercial breeder reactor later on, if necessary. A discounted cash flow analysis demonstrates that, by developing a 50 -year uranium reserve instead of a commercial plutonium and breeder program, Japan could save up to $ 22. 7 billion. Savings would be greater (up to $ 38. 4 billion) if an enriched-uranium reserve smaller than the extreme 50 -year example or a reserve of natural uranium were acquired. The reserve would also make a major con-tribution to keeping the Asia-Pacific region free of weapons-usable nuclear materials. OVERVIEW: WHY A STRATEGIC URANIUM RESERVE? The original dream of nuclear-generated electricity “too cheap to meter”— fueled forever by plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel and recycled in fast breeder reactors (FBRs) —has long since faded.

40|$|It {{concerns}} {{the application of}} the INPRO methodology to a French scenario, on the transition from present LWRs to EPRs in a first phase and to 4 th generation fast reactors in a second phase during the 21 st century. The scenario also considers the renewal of the present fuel cycle facilities by the third and the fourth generation ones. Present practice of <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> in PWR is replaced {{by the middle of the}} century by a global recycling of actinides, uranium, plutonium and minor actinides in fast reactors. The status and the evolution of the INPRO’s criteria and the corresponding indicators during the studied period are analyzed for each of the six considered areas: economics, safety, environment, waste management, proliferation resistance and infrastructure. Improvements on economic and safety are expected for both the EPR and the 4 th generation systems having these improvements among their basic goals. The use of fast reactors and global recycling of actinides leads to a significant improvement on environment indicators and in particular on the natural resources utilization. The envisaged waste management policy results in significant reductions on mass, thermal loads and radiotoxicity of the final waste which only contains fission products. The use of fuels that do not relay on enriched uranium and separated plutonium increases the proliferation resistance characteristics of the future fuel cycle. The paper summarizes also some recommendations on the data, codes and methods used to support the continuous improvement of the INPRO methodology and help future assessors. I...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{proposed}} ways to dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium (Pu) is to irradiate the high-fissile material in light-water reactors {{in order to reduce}} the Pu enrichment to the level of spent fuels from commercial reactors. Considerable experience has been accumulated about the behavior of mixed-oxide (MOX) uranium and plutonium fuels for <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> in commercial reactors, but the experience is related to Pu enrichments typical of spent fuels quite below the values of weapons-grade plutonium. Important decisions related to the kind of reactors to be used for the disposition of the plutonium are going to be based on calculations, so the validation of computational algorithms related to all aspects of the fuel cycle (power distributions, isotopics as function of the burnup, etc.), for weapons-grade isotopics is very important. Analysis of public domain data reveals that the cycle- 2 irradiation in the Quad cities boiling-water reactor (BWR) is the most recent US destructive examination. This effort involved the irradiation of five MOX assemblies using 80 and 90 % fissile plutonium. These benchmark data were gathered by General Electric under the sponsorship of the Electric Power Research Institute. It is emphasized, however, that global parameters are not the focus of this benchmark, since the five bundles containing MOX fuels did not significantly affect the overall core performance. However, since the primary objective of this work is to compare against measured post-irradiation assembly data, the term benchmark is applied here. One important reason for performing the benchmark on Quad Cities irradiation is that the fissile blends (up to 90 %) are higher than reactor-grade and, quite close to, weapons-grade isotopics...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} adjoint techniques to fuel cycle analysis, {{in order to provide}} a more accurate description of the effects of nuclides on reactor behaviour. Transmutation and decay processes change the composition of the fuel. Allowing for these changes makes it possible to create different fuel compositions that yield similar reactor behaviour. This approach can then be used to improve the sustainability of nuclear energy, for example by reducing the heat produced by radioactive waste. Chapter 2 reviews and extends the continuous fuel cycle model described in Ott and Borg (1980). This approach approximates the long-term behaviour of the reactor using an eigenvalue problem, removing the complexity associated with the discrete operating cycles. The model provides reasonable predictions of the behaviour of a sodium cooled fast reactor model, although extending it to include additional nuclides decreases the quality of the results significantly. The use of a constant power constraint in place of the reactivity constraint makes little difference to the results. Applying the model to a negative growth system gives worse results than those found for the breeder system, with the growth rate prediction being particularly poor. The effects of fuel cycle strategies such as different feed materials and recycling schemes on the negative growth system are also studied. Recycling additional actinides decreases the waste radiotoxicity, while including more light uranium isotopes in the feed material increases the amount of Pu- 239 and decreases the amount of other plutonium isotopes in the fuel. The double adjoint method is developed in chapter 3. This approach relies on using the nuclide worths found from an adjoint reactivity calculation as the source values for a time adjoint problem. This allows the contributions of nuclides present {{at the start of the}} burn-up period to the reactivity at the end of it to be determined. Combining this measure with reactivity worths found at the beginning of the burn-up period yields a method that can be used to produce a new fuel composition that gives very similar reactor behaviour to that seen with the original composition. This leads to a breeding gain definition that includes the effects of the feed material and that can be applied to non-equilibrium situations. The importance of including the effects of the compound material in the calculation is demonstrated. Results are found for both fast and thermal systems, with the indirect effects causing inaccuraciesin the worths of up to 50 % in the worst cases. The coupled perturbation theory proposed by Williams (1979) is used in chapter 4 to allow for the indirect effects that are neglected in chapter 3. Including the coupling to the flux allows for accurate results to be found for both the fast and thermal systems. The effects of studying a different response are also investigated, with the flux coupling having a larger effect on results for the Pu- 239 response than for the reactivity response. The scale of the coupling effect is illustrated by comparison between the values found using the coupled and uncoupled approaches. The use of longer burn-up periods increases the importance of the flux coupling. This implementation of the coupled model relies on an approximation to produce some of the multi-group cross sections, and it is expected that the use of more accurate data would improve the results. Chapter 5 {{describes the}} application of the coupled model to waste heat production. The model is used with fast and thermal systems, and the effects of different post burn-up decay periods are considered. The waste heat worths for different isotopes are found with no recycling, with <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling,</b> and with uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling.</b> Equivalent fuel compositions using plutonium from different sources are determined and the resulting waste heat is calculated, with the results showing that plutonium from lower burn-up sources tends to produce less waste heat, by up to a factor of 5 in the extreme cases. The effects of different recycling schemes on the waste produced by these fuels are determined, and both the waste heat per unit mass and the total waste mass are examined. The methods developed in this thesis demonstrate some of the potential uses of adjoint techniques in fuel cycle analysis. Quantifying how nuclides present at the beginning of the burn-up period affect the reactor behaviour at the end of the period allows a better comparison of fuels of different compositions. One possible application of such comparisons is demonstrated in the study of the waste heat produced by different fuels. There is a wide range of other possibilities, some of which are described in the recommendations given in the final chapter. RST/Radiation, Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} {{once-through}} cycle (OTC) scheme currently {{practiced in the}} U. S. leads to accumulation of uranium, transuranic (TRU) and fission product inventories in the spent nuclear fuel. Various separation and recycling options can be envisioned {{in order to reduce}} these inventories while extracting additional energy and sending the ultimate waste to a repository. Choosing one of these options has direct implications for the infrastructure requirements, natural uranium consumption, actinide inventories in the system, waste repository needs and costs. In order to account for the complexity of the nuclear enterprise, a fuel cycle simulation code has been developed using system dynamics (CAFCA). An economic module was added using spreadsheets. Four main advanced fuel cycle schemes are assessed here {{within the context of the}} US market: 1) the twice-through cycle scheme (TTC) : single-pass <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> in thermal spectrum LWRs using Mixed OXide (MOX) fuel; 2) Multi-recycling of TRU in sodium-cooled fast spectrum burner cores, characterized by a fissile conversion ratio lower than 1 (FBu); 3) Multi-recycling of TRU in sodium-cooled fast breeders with a conversion ratio of 1. 23 (FBr); and 4) A two-tier scenario: a TTC scheme is practiced as a transition scheme to fast reactors. The base case scenario assumes annual nuclear energy demand growth rate of 2. 5 % from 2020 on. The technologies for plutonium separation as well as MOX fuel fabrication are assumed to be available in 2025 while the first commercial fast reactors, as well as the possibility to recycle their spent fuel, are assumed to be available in 2040. (cont.) For fast reactors, the cores are assumed to be TRU fueled, and the technology to separate the minor actinides is supposed to be available at the latest 5 years before deployment of fast reactors. Limits are applied on the building rate of reprocessing plants, which are also subject to a 80 % minimum life-time loading factor requirement. It is found that, despite its higher cost, at the end of the century, the TTC scheme (single Pu-MOX recycle) does not lead to large improvements in terms of natural uranium consumption (16 %), repository needs (considering both fission products and MA from reprocessing facilities, and spent MOX fuel) and TRU inventory reduction (although some shifting of TRU from storage to reactors occurs). This is especially significant because it is the only advanced fuel cycle option that can be deployed in large scale in the next few decades. However, if the primary reason for introduction of the more expensive fast reactors is resource enhancement and/or control of TRU in the nuclear waste, thermal reactor recycling allows the introduction of fast reactors to be delayed by 20 - 25 years. Moreover, once fast reactors are introduced, their deployment is accelerated compared to a 1 -tier FR scenario. However, the two-tier scheme is the most expensive scheme as it combines the requirements of both the MOX technology and the FR technology. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the impact of secondary parameters. It is found that whatever the growth rate assumed, LWRs remain a significant part of the system at the end of the century, decades after fast breeders are introduced. (cont.) The reason is the fissile materials required for fabrication of start-up cores considerably affect the rate at which fast reactors can be deployed. As a result, the choice of the core design (compact core vs. large core) may be as significant as the choice of the conversion ratio. For example, the breeder scenario (CR= 1. 23) may lead to the same cumulative natural uranium consumption reduction (by 2100) as the self-sustaining reactors (CR= 1. 0) while leading to larger TRU inventory in the system and requiring greater fast reactor fuel reprocessing capacity. Allowing fast reactors to start with uranium only cores was not considered, as it will likely limit resource enhancement benefits of fast reactors. Still, in general, the higher the conversion ratio, the greater the fast reactor installed capacity, hence the greater the savings in natural uranium. Conversely, the best reduction in TRU from the OTC amount is obtained by the lower conversion ratio (45 % for a pure burner with conversion ratio 0. 0 by 2100). Doubling the minimum cooling time before reprocessing for all fuel types from 5 years to 10 years slows down the deployment of the fast reactors and therefore reduces their share in the total installed capacity. This is almost equivalent to replacing breeders with fast reactors with a conversion ratio of 0. 75. Finally, the results show that starting the separation of the TRU 10 years prior to introduction of the fast reactors instead of 5 years provides a mid-term advantage (faster initial deployment) that vanishes within 25 years. In the long term, the fast reactor penetration results are insensitive to the assumed industrial capacity to build reprocessing facilities for the base case or at lower nuclear energy growth rates. (cont.) However, the assumed industrial capacity can be a real constraint if the nuclear energy growth rates are 4 % or higher. by Laurent Guérin. Thesis (S.

40|$|As use {{of nuclear}} energy is {{expected}} to expand {{in different parts of}} the world, several codes that describe the nuclear fuel cycle system are currently under development, featuring a range of capabilities and different levels of flexibility and automation. Such codes model the addition or retirement of reactors, the demand for fresh fuel, and the need for spent fuel storage and recycling facilities as the production of nuclear energy varies with time. The codes enable analysis of various scenarios for the evolution of the nuclear energy system, and the timing of deployment of new facilities. Outputs may also include fuel material mass flows, economic analysis and metrics related to spent fuel or waste assessment. The study reported here is the first attempt for benchmarking the MIT code CAFCA against three independently developed fuel cycle simulation codes. It is also among the first publicly available benchmark exercises. Some reviews of the existing codes were previously reported, but focused mostly on their theoretical capabilities. Benchmarking studies, generally involving two or three codes, have been done over the last few years, but most remain unpublished. The codes included in this study are: CAFCA (developed at MIT), COSI (developed at CEA, France), DANESS (developed at ANL) and VISION (developed by DOE laboratories for the AFCI program). The purpose of this benchmark study is to evaluate the degree of convergence of the current versions of these codes and to compare their basic methodologies. This benchmark is not a comprehensive analysis of all the codes’ capabilities but constitutes a first step towards a more complete benchmark study. In order to compare all 4 codes, only the common capabilities were considered and assessed. Those capabilities are essentially those of CAFCA, as it is the simplest code. Consequently, some of the advanced capabilities of the other codes were disabled, and their complete features were not reflected in this benchmark study. In addition, economic evaluation of the fuel cycles was not considered, even though it is a capability common to the four codes. Furthermore, the initial runs showed that a degree of freedom should be removed to ease the comparison. For that reason reprocessing capacity profiles were provided by CAFCA and used as input by the other codes. Following a description of the codes, the report presents the four scenarios selected as the benchmark cases, including initial conditions. The time period of the simulation covers the 21 st century. Those scenarios differ from each other in either the nuclear energy supply growth rate (0 %, 1. 5 % or 3 %) or the type of advanced technology introduced in the midterm. The options for advanced reactors were: the “self-sustaining” fast reactor (with a fissile conversion ratio of one), fast burners of transuranics (TRU), or a combination of <b>plutonium</b> <b>recycling</b> (as mixed oxide) in the thermal light water reactors (LWRs) and fast burners. The scenarios, and hence the results, are for benchmarking purposes only and should not be considered realistic for policy studies or forecasts about the future of nuclear power. The set of constraints specified is minimal and only intended to provide a common framework for the simulations. The results are presented and commented on for each case. The first case, characterized by a very constraining zero energy growth rate, shows an excellent agreement among the codes, with identical ratios of fast reactors/thermal reactors over time. This excellent agreement was the iv result of the particular efforts made in order to get very close results (several iterations were performed to allow for adjustments). This case eventually shows how the models can produce very close results if sufficiently tuned to adhere to the same basic assumptions. This case also allowed us to identify a number of minor apparent discrepancies and explain them. In particular, it made obvious differences in results between COSI, which was tuned to track fuel batches (“discrete-flow code”) and CAFCA, DANESS and VISION, which deal with annual mass flows (”continuous-flow codes). The treatment of discrete batches of fuel by COSI, instead of timeaveraged quantities in the other codes, result in somewhat oscillatory flows and inventories of materials. Another factor leading to discrepancies among the codes is the time assumed to exist between the separation of transuranics and the manufacturing of fast reactor fuels. CAFCA speeds up the fuel manufacturing, to avoid the presence of separated transuranics in large quantities, while the other codes do not (as Pu-containing fuel has a very limited shelf-life at the initial fissile content due to Pu 241 decay with a half life of about 14. 4 years). Unlike the first cases, there was in the three other cases no attempt, beyond the common set of assumptions, to iterate to get the results of the other cases to converge. Therefore, these three cases are more a reflection of how the codes actually operate and show the level of variation in results that should be considered normal. These three cases were of great interest for comparing the different strategies for fast reactor deployment and their dependence for fuel on available TRU from the operation of light water reactors. Overall, the benchmark shows that, although the codes exhibit reassuring consistency, both internally and among themselves, differences still exist. The fact that reprocessing capacity profiles were externally provided may have disturbed some of the codes designed to internally calculate this variable. Although limitations inherent in the codes exist, the differences in the results generally do not reveal major flaws, but rather reflect differing assumptions and constraints embedded in the methods and approximations of the calculations. This benchmark reveals (or reminds us) that there is no single profile for a fuel cycle scenario but several profiles that depend on industrial practices with regards to manufacturing, storage and reprocessing of nuclear fuels. These practices may aim at differing priorities of reducing stocks of stored spent fuel, avoiding the presence of separated TRU to reduce proliferation risks, ensuring sufficient supply of fresh fuel for advanced reactors and spent fuel for reprocessing plants, and minimizing some costs. Such choices can either be intrinsic to the code (through built-in assumptions) or through user choices (for example, the level of conservatism in the algorithm ensuring fuel supply for fast reactors is a user input). Moreover, the parameters left to the user’s discretion are generally not the same from one code to another, or are expressed in different terms. Finally, complete consistency between the codes is difficult to obtain. Two major conclusions can be drawn from this benchmark. First, the overall results show good consistency and similar trends. Hence, utilization of various codes is likely to lead to similar conclusions. Second, one must not expect the various fuel cycle system simulation codes to provide identical outputs. Therefore, users must keep in mind that, although the results are internally consistent and meet each code’s set of requirements, they do not project unique scenarios for meeting such requirements.
