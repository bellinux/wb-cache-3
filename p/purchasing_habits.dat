500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{served as}} a {{commentary}} on American consumerism, the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the product fails at its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believes it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight. This blind faith is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys is further indicative of American <b>purchasing</b> <b>habits.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Energy-efficient {{appliances}} {{are another}} method for households to decrease energy use. [...] Low-income households have trouble realizing this gain energy efficiency. [...] Energy-efficient appliances require a large up-front investment, and savings {{will not be}} realized for many years. [...] Local grantees {{have the option to}} use Weatherization funds to support appliance purchases. [...] However, unlike weatherization programs, the gains in household budgets are often not worth the investment. [...] A 2010 study examined the households' <b>purchasing</b> <b>habits</b> in regard to high-efficiency appliances. [...] Using household-level data, this study determines that homeowners are significantly more likely to own energy efficient large appliances, such as refrigerators or washing machines. However, the results show that the cost of this problem is negligible compared to overall energy consumption. This finding is important considering the increasing efficiency standards for household appliances. [...] A higher standard may put simple appliances out of the price range of low income households, while not offering much energy relief for households that do own them.|$|E

2500|$|During the post-WWII {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1950s, many parents were able to give their teenage children much higher weekly allowances, signaling {{a shift in the}} buying power and <b>purchasing</b> <b>habits</b> of American teens. During the 1940s bobby soxers had idolized Frank Sinatra, but the buyers of his records were mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. Presley triggered a lot of demand for his records by near-teens and early teens aged ten and up. Along with Presley's [...] "ducktail" [...] haircut, the demand for black slacks and loose, open-necked shirts resulted in new lines of clothing for teenage boys whereas a girl might get a pink portable 45 rpm record player for her bedroom. Meanwhile, American teenagers began buying newly available portable transistor radios and listened to rock 'n' roll on them (helping to propel that fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units sold in 1955 to 5,000,000 units by the end of 1958). Teens were asserting more independence and Presley became a national symbol of their parents' consternation.|$|E
2500|$|English market towns were {{regulated}} from {{a relatively}} early period. The English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords {{the right to}} take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days. Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up [...] between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronise. A study on the <b>purchasing</b> <b>habits</b> of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions [...] of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to [...] make their [...] purchases and which markets were superior. Today, traders and showmen jealously guard the reputation of these historic market charters.|$|E

30|$|In the {{organized}} retail industry, particularly the food retail, sales highly {{depend on the}} convenience of the customer. Evident by stories of big grocery stores like Subhiksha and Reliance Fresh, there is a wrong assumption that price is the deciding factor for any organized retail to be successful. In the Indian context, the housewife still bargains with the roadside vendor for her daily vegetables. The glamor of an organized retail has not made her change her <b>purchasing</b> <b>habit</b> of vegetables and fruits. Perhaps {{that is the reason}} many roadside vegetable vendors are in business near organized retail houses.

The data were elicited from TV advertisements telecasted on Turkish TV channels throughout 2012. The study found that the common method used in the advertisements was to set a pessimistic scene in which advertized products appeared as a panacea. Furthermore, it yielded several cultural values, some of which were rigorously promoted while others were criticized in some way. These comprised collectivism, familial relations, patriarchy, patriotism, religious values, social conventions, wisdom on the one hand, and achievement, competitiveness, consumption, distrust, easy life, globalization, hedonism and individualism on the other. Finally, this study revealed that the traditional versus modern dichotomy constituted a prevalent conflict in Turkish society. </p...|$|R
