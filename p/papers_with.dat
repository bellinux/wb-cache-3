The University of Berlin cancelled Levi's doctorate in 1938. In April 1940, the Germans occupied Denmark.

5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded.

Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted <b>papers</b> <b>with</b> the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E
