This <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> conjecture was disproved by Brian Cole in 1968. However, Anderson and Izzo {{showed that the}} <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> conjecture does hold for uniform algebras generated by smooth functions on smooth two-manifolds with boundary. The corresponding assertion for smooth three-manifolds is false, but Anderson, Izzo, and Wermer established a <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> theorem for polynomial approximation on real-analytic three-manifolds with boundary. Here we establish a more gen-eral <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> theorem for real-analytic three-manifolds with boundary analogous to the two-dimensional result. We also show that if A is a counterexample to the <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> conjecture generated by smooth func-tions on a manifold of arbitrary dimension, then the essential set for A has empty interior. 1...|$|R

30|$|In general, a <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> {{is defined}} by a point that holds the highest value located at a {{specific}} time and location on EEG signals. A <b>peak</b> <b>point</b> {{can be observed in}} EEG signals because of the response of brain on human activities. Such responses of the brain on human activities that triggers a peak in EEG signals are eye movements, epilepsy, and event-related potentials. However, EEG signals are also very sensitive to noises that come from heart bit, EEG electrodes and some movements of the body. The presence of various noises in EEG signals generates a large number of false peaks in the signals and makes the classification of desired <b>peak</b> <b>points</b> difficult. Moreover, this problem could be worse because the amplitude of peaks of the signals is different from one subject to another, which can vary from 600 to 1100  µV (Iwasaki et al. 2005), resulting a high variance value of peak features in data collection.|$|R
