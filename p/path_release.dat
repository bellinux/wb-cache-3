5000|$|An optimistic album, more pop {{oriented}} {{rather than}} rock, where, however, a duel between joy and sadness, happiness and misery {{and so many}} other antagonisms present on Schneider's work are presented. [...] "Give me one more life and I promise I'll do my best" [...] sings Sebastian, on an attempt to communicate to the outside what is happening within. The album had a long recording process which culminated with the selection of fourteen songs (it is Schneider's longest album) where the musical quality of [...] "Canción Para Nadie" [...] is led to more lively arrangements, [...] "peppier" [...] melodies like the hit [...] "Dame" [...] which was aired on a multitude of media throughout Latin America.

40|$|Hugoniot data on San Gabriel {{anorthosite}} and San Marcos gabbro to 11 GPA are presented. <b>Release</b> <b>paths</b> in the stress-density {{plane and}} sound velocities are reported as determined from particl velocity data. Electrical interference effects precluded {{the determination of}} accurate <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> for the gabbro. Because {{of the loss of}} shear strength in the shocked state, the plastic behavior exhibited by anorthosite indicates that calculations of energy partitioning due to impact onto planetary surfaces based on elastic-plastic models may underestimate the amount of internal energy deposited in the impacted surface material...|$|R
50|$|Darzamat is a Polish symphonic {{black metal}} band formed in 1995. Although {{there is a}} claim about Darzamat being a name of a Slavonic forest god, it comes from Latvian mythology {{denoting}} garden goddess (Lat. dārzs - garden, māte - mother).

40|$|Particle {{velocity}} profiles upon shock {{compression and}} isentropic releases were measured for polycrystalline calcite. The Solenhofen limestone <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> lie {{close to the}} Hugoniot. Calcite 3 to 2 transition, upon release was observed, but rarefaction shocks were not detected. The equation of state is used to predict the fraction of material devolatilized upon isentropic release {{as a function of}} shock pressure. The effect of ambient partial pressure of CO 2 on the calculations is demonstrated and considered in models of atmospheric evolution by impact induced mineral devolatilization. The radiative characteristics of shocked calcite indicate that localization of thermal energy occurs under shock compression. Shock entropy calculations result in a minimum estimate of 90 percent devolatilization upon complete release from 10 GPa. Isentropic <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> from calculated continuum Hugoniot temperatures cross into the CaO (solid) + CO 2 (vapor) field at improbably low pressures. It is found that <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> from measured shock temperatures cross into the melt plus vapor field at pressures greater than. 5 GPa, which suggests that devolatilization is initiated at the shear banding sites...|$|R
50|$|McGivern's and Culhane's paths now diverged. They {{were sent}} to {{different}} prisons, McGivern to the Green Haven Correctional Facility and Culhane to the Attica Correctional Facility, and elected to pursue different <b>paths</b> to gaining <b>release.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Buddha's {{teaching}} of (...) {{may be viewed}} as a <b>path</b> (...) of <b>release</b> from the anxieties of life. The first Noble Truth equates life-experiences with pain and suffering. Buddha's language was simple and colloquial. Naturally, various statements of Buddha at times appear contradictory to each other. Later Buddhist teachers were faced with the problem of resolving these contradictions. Nagarjuna and other teachers introduced an exegetical technique level-distinction between two levels of truth, the conventional and the ultimate.|$|R

50|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{metaphor for}} chain reactions {{is thus a}} snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results ("snowball effect"). This {{is a result of}} stored gravitational potential energy seeking a <b>path</b> of <b>release</b> over friction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in a prompt critical event, which may finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.|$|R

40|$|Shock wave {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} San Gabriel anorthosite and San Marcos gabbra 10 11 GPa using a 40 mm-borne propellant gun. Particle velocities were measured directly at several points in each target by means of electromagnetic gauges. Hugoniot states were calculated by determining shock-transit time from the gauge records. Sound speeds indicate a loss of shear strength upon sock compression for both rocks, with the strength loss persisting upon release to zero stress om the anorthosite. Stress-density <b>release</b> <b>paths</b> in the anorthosite indicate possible transformation of albite to jadeite + (quartz or coesite), {{with the amount of}} material transformed increasing as a function of shock stress.
