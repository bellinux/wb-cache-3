5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car <b>parking</b> <b>facility,</b> and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the other}} major {{problems}} noted in the report was the availability of parking at stations along the line.

That was {{in addition to the}} construction of a further 240 car parking bays at Whitfords Station, costing $780,000 in 2000, on the southern side of the station. Construction of a multi-story parking structure at Warwick was not considered as an option due to a number of social and environmental concerns.|$|E

25|$|To {{accommodate}} the cancelled Glasgow Airport Rail Link plans, the platforms were renumbered. Platform 11a (the previous West Bank Siding, {{on the bridge}} over the Clyde) was renumbered 12, whilst 12 & 13 were renumbered 14 & 15 respectively. In September 2009 the former platform-level car park and passenger drop-off area {{was taken out of}} use and the platform over the Clyde (recently renumbered 12) was removed. Two new platforms were created between 11 and 14, being brought into use in May 2010. There are no plans to replace indoor parking or passenger drop-off within Central station. The existing multi-storey <b>parking</b> <b>facility</b> on Oswald Street and on-street parking surrounding Central station remain, with passenger drop-off having moved to surrounding streets. During Cyclone Bodil in December 2013, the glass roof of the station was broken by flying debris.|$|E

25|$|During {{the budget}} {{session of the}} Indian Railways 2008–09 the then Railway Minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav, rolled out a design to turn the over 200-year-old Secunderabad railway station into a grander facility, {{at a cost of}} Rs. 40billion (USD$1 billions). Later in the maiden budget of 2009-10, Ms.Mamata Banerjee listed 50 {{stations}} to be upgraded into world-class facilities which included the Secunderabad station. The idea was to transform the station into an ultra-modern train hub with added facilities. According to the Ministry, the upgradation will be done on the lines of Rome's central railway station, Roma Termini (Stazione Termini). The Late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy directed the proposal for developing the old Gandhi Hospital land adjoining Secunderabad Railway Station on the lines of Toronto railway station, which was developed into a major terminus for commuters, a commercial hub and a <b>parking</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rosenholm Station was {{established}} with two goals in mind. The first was creating an efficient {{park and ride}} station for commuters from Follo and Østfold. The second was to target IBM employees. The station was situated {{too far from the}} residential area to be of much value for the residents at Holmlia. Proposals for a station at Rosenholm were first put forward in 1976, but at the time the Norwegian State Railways concluded that there would not be sufficient ridership from the station. By 1987 the number of residents and work places had increased sufficiently that the agency reconsidered. The station opened on 1 July 1988, after a large <b>parking</b> <b>facility</b> with 250 spaces built at the site. The site was chosen because it was immediately within the city limits of Oslo, and thus only have to pay an Oslo fare. It was also situated before Mosseveien on E18 where the greatest congestion occurs. The plans called for up to 800 parking places to be built in the future. Investments totaled 2.6 million Norwegian kroner.|$|E
