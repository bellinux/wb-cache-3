40|$|A <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> {{suitable}} for midrange frequencies uses a dome shaped piezoelectric actuator to a speaker membrane directly is discussed. The dome shaped actuator {{is made from}} a reduced and internally biased oxygen wafer, and generates excursion of {{the apex of the}} dome in the order of 0. 02 - 0. 05 inches when a rated drive voltage of 350 V rms is applied between the convex and the concave surface of the dome shaped actuator. The load capacity exceeds 10 lbs. The edge of the rim of the dome shaped actuator must be free to rock when the dome height varies to ensure low distortion in the loudspeaker. This is achieved by mounting the rim of the dome shaped actuator on a support surface by prestress only. An exceptionally simple design uses a planar speaker membrane with the center part of one side pressed against the rim of a dome shaped actuator by prestress from a stretched latex surround member...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} two design {{strategies that}} {{would allow us to}} efficiently process audio signals on embedded systems such as mobile phones and portable electronics. In the first strategy, we exploit properties of the human auditory system to process audio signals. We designed a sound enhancement algorithm to make <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> sound "richer" and "fuller," using a combination of bass extension and dynamic range compression. We also developed an audio energy reduction algorithm for loudspeaker power management by suppressing signal energy below the masking threshold. In the second strategy, we use low-power analog circuits to process the signal before digitizing it. We designed an analog front-end for sound detection and implemented it on a field programmable analog array (FPAA). The sound classifier front-end {{can be used in a}} wide range of applications because programmable floating-gate transistors are employed to store classifier weights. Moreover, we incorporated a feature selection algorithm to simplify the analog front-end. A machine learning algorithm AdaBoost is used to select the most relevant features for a particular sound detection application. We also designed the circuits to implement the AdaBoost-based analog classifier.

40|$|International audienceThe MEMS digital {{loudspeaker}} {{consists of}} a set of acoustic transducers, called speaklets, arranged in a matrix and which operate in a binary manner by emitting short pulses of sound pressure. Using the principle of additivity of pressures in the air, it is possible to reconstruct an audible sound. MEMS technology is particularly well suited to produce the large number of speaklets needed for sound reconstruction quality while maintaining a reasonable size. This paper presents {{for the first time the}} modeling, realization and characterizations of a <b>piezoelectric</b> digital <b>loudspeaker</b> based on MEMS technology. Static, dynamic and acoustic measurements are performed and match closely with theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel type of <b>piezoelectric</b> MEMS <b>loudspeaker</b> is presented. The device concept {{is based on}} {{concentrically}} cascaded PZT actuators making it the first two-way MEMS speaker reported. As a further novelty, the device is designed to operate without a closed membrane offering significant improvements with respect to acoustic performance, energy efficiency and manufacturability. Extensive FEA studies have revealed a very high SPL of more than 85 dB at 500 Hz for a device 10 × 10 mm 2 in size. At higher frequencies even larger SPL values are achieved enabling a flat frequency response with 95 dB for frequencies above 800 Hz. Based on the concept speaker prototypes have been fabricated using MEMS technology and are currently being characterized...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} technology {{improvement is}} causing {{a proliferation of}} electronic systems in our society. Nowadays human society is completely dependent on such electronic devices; hence, the reliability of these systems is mandatory. The failure of these systems {{can be caused by}} many factors such as high temperature, electrical overstress and material fatigue. The system failure is mostly due to the thermal overstress caused by a continuous request of intense work. Although the majority of the electronic devices have a high efficiency, a continuous use can cause an increase in temperature which can affect the device performance until the failure. Electronic components are designed to operate within a certain temperature range thus need for a cooling system. Such a cooling system has to be designed to dissipate all the thermal power to maintain a suitable temperature and guarantee electronic component safety without affecting working performance. According to Moore’s law (1965), the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every one and a half year and the transistor density is expected to be very high. Moreover, the size of these transistors decreases exponentially as silicon microfabrication processes are improved. These two components lead to an increase in the heat power which has to be carried away by cooling devices in order to let the electronic systems work properly within a suitable temperature range. Conventional cooling techniques such as heat sink, fans and liquid cooling need to be continuously optimized to face this continuous request of higher heat power dissipation and miniaturization. Such needs have led researchers to focus their efforts on the design of new technology cooling devices. Synthetic jets are an innovative device with promising features in the heat dissipation field. According to Lasance and Aarts. (2008), the benefits and improvements of synthetic jets, compared with a fan, are: •	Lower noise level, •	Better efficiency, •	Design-friendly, •	Intrinsic higher reliability, •	Easier miniaturisation, •	Simple noise cancellation. Synthetic jets are jets with zero-net-mass-flux synthesized directly from the fluid present in the system in which the jet device is embedded (Smith and Glezer, 1998). Such a feature obviates the need for an external input piping, making them ideal for low cost and low space applications. A synthetic jet is generated by a membrane oscillation in a cavity which produces a periodic volume change and thus pressure variation. As the membrane oscillates, fluid is periodically entrained into and expelled out from the orifice. During the injection part of the cycle the flow field could be considered as one inducted by a sink, which coincides with the orifice, while during the ejection part of the cycle, a vortex ring can form near the orifice and, under certain operating conditions (Holman et al., 2005), convects away from the orifice to form a time-average jet (Smith and Glezer, 1998). Several studies have been carried out to characterize and describe the heat transfer behaviour of a classical synthetic jet (Gutmark et al., 1982, Mahalingam and Glezer 2005, Valiorgue et al., 2008, Chaudhari et al., 2010 a, Persoons et al., 2011, Arik and Icoz, 2012, Greco et al. 2014). In order to improve the heat transfer performances of synthetic jets in practical applications, some recent studies are focused on the design of different configurations. For instance, Rylatt and O’Donovan (2013) decided to confine the impinging synthetic air jet asserting that, with such a configuration, cold air was drawn from a remote location into the jet flow. Chaudhari et al. (2011) realized a particular synthetic jet device by means of a centre orifice surrounded by multiple satellite orifices. Laxmikant and Chaudhari (2015) designed also synthetic jets with diamond and oval shape orifice. Luo et al. (2006) proposed a new generation of synthetic jet consisting in two cavities sharing the same piezoelectric actuator. Lasance ans Aarts (2008) and Lasance et al. (2008) replaced the two slots with two orifices and the <b>piezoelectric</b> with a <b>loudspeaker</b> creating the so-called “dipole cooler”. This double configuration was found to be advantageous because of noise reduction (Russell et al., 1999) and improvement of heat transfer performances (Lasance et al., 2008) without a characterization of its flow field behaviour. The object of this research is: •	to design a similar experimental apparatus with variable jet-axes-distance; •	to deeply investigate and characterize the jets free and impinging flow field; •	to evaluate and explain the jets heat transfer performance; •	to compare the results with the classical single synthetic jet (under the same operating conditions). Moreover, as also reported in Persoons et al. (2011) : “Although information is available for free synthetic jets insufficient knowledge is available for impinging synthetic jets, which could be the focus of future research. ”, thus a study on the classical single synthetic jet impinging flow field behaviour, varying the operating parameters, has also been carried out. The thesis has been divided as following: Chapter 1 reviews current literature, Chapter 2 describes the measurements techniques employed in present investigation, in Chapter 3 the experimental rigs are shown, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the results, for the free and impinging configurations, Chapter 6 draws final conclusions and Chapter 7 opens the path for future works...|$|R
