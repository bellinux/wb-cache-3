40|$|Sweden {{is about}} to change through the {{separation}} into different <b>price</b> <b>areas</b> on the common Nordic electricity market. Many Scandinavian countries, acting at the Nord Pool, are already divided into several <b>price</b> <b>areas.</b> Different <b>price</b> <b>areas</b> in different countries mean that one country has different prices on one market, Nord Pool. The definition of a relevant market can be explored using various price series and to analyse if they follow long-term trend. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine whether the countries that are divided into different price zones in Nord Pool belong to a single market. To answer the question cointegration tests will be performed on countries such as Norway and Denmark which are divided into several <b>price</b> <b>areas.</b> Time series based on monthly data from six different <b>price</b> <b>areas</b> from January 2002 to March 2010 is used in the thesis. The results show that countries like Norway and Denmark are integrated into one market whether or not they are divided into several <b>price</b> <b>areas</b> for trade on Nord Pool. Price variations occur in the short term, in both Denmark and Norway, although the <b>price</b> <b>areas</b> in the country belong to a single market in the long run.

40|$|This paper investigates a {{pricing model}} for an {{electricity}} {{market with a}} hybrid congestion management method, i. e. {{part of the system}} applies a nodal pricing scheme and the rest applies a zonal pricing scheme. The model clears the zonal and nodal <b>pricing</b> <b>areas</b> simultaneously. The nodal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> is affected by the changes in the zonal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> since it is directly connected to the zonal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> by commercial trading. The model is tested on a 13 -node power system. Within the area that is applying nodal pricing, prices and surpluses given by the hybrid pricing model match well with those given by the full nodal pricing model. Part of the network is better utilized compared to the solutions given by the full zonal pricing model. However, the prices given by the hybrid system may send wrong economic signals which triggers unnecessary generation from existing capacities, exacerbates grid congestion, and induces higher re-dispatching costs...|$|R

The primary target of the market coupling is to assure a deeper integration of regional power markets. The process aims at maximizing the energy flow from the low <b>price</b> <b>area</b> to the high <b>price</b> <b>area</b> by {{taking into account the}} available cross-border capacity. Consequently, price levels among the individual market areas converge. By this procedure, not only the security of supply can be increased but the price volatility on relevant power markets can be moderated and the power sale and purchase can become more effective.The Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian NRAs, TSOs and PXs jointly implemented the extension of CZ-SK-HU Market Coupling to Romanian day-ahead electricity market (4M MC) on 19 November 2014 based on PCR solution.|$|E

An important aspect is the modeling of energy prices, with the aim of forecasting these.

The original HPFC was usable only for a single <b>price</b> <b>area.</b> His group has been developing it for several areas through the incorporation of market coupling mechanisms.

40|$|In the European market, the {{promotion}} of wind power leads to more network congestion. Zonal pricing (market coupling), which does not take the physical characteristics of transmission into account, is {{the most commonly used}} method to relieve congestion in Europe. Zonal pricing fails to provide adequate locational price signals regarding the energy resource scarcity and thus creates a large amount of unscheduled cross-border flows originating from wind-generated power, making the interconnected grid less secure. Prior studies show that full nodal pricing works better in integrating wind power into the grid. In this paper we investigate the effects of applying a hybrid congestion management model, i. e. nodal pricing model for one country embedded in a zonal pricing system {{for the rest of the}} market. We test how nodal pricing works in such a hybrid context with more wind power. We find that, compared to full nodal pricing, hybrid pricing fails to fully utilize all the resources in the network and some wrong price signals might be given. However, hybrid pricing still performs better than zonal pricing. The results from the hybrid pricing model of Poland, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic show that, within the <b>area</b> applying nodal <b>pricing</b> (Poland), better price signals are given; the need for re-dispatching reduces; more congestion rent is collected and the unit cost of power is reduced. The results also show that international power exchange increases between the nodal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> and the zonal <b>pricing</b> <b>areas,</b> especially on windy days. Moreover, the nodal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> has less unscheduled crossborder power flow from the zonal <b>pricing</b> <b>area</b> entering its network and collects more cross-border congestion rent...|$|R

As a unique identifaction strategy national bank holidays are used as exogenous system shocks to trace the degree of market integration before the advent of the so-called market coupling of European power markets. In order to avoid overestimation of the degree of market integration, we specifically control for seasonal effects and common input factors.

The average annual household energy consumption {{has been found to}} be 6907 kWh, whereas per capita consumption is 1727 kWh. Seasonal and monthly variations are analysed indicating increased energy consumption in the summer months accounting for 28 % of total annual consumption. Correlations are indicated for energy consumption with apartment <b>price,</b> <b>area,</b> income and number of residents. Multiple regression analysis indicated statistical significance of income, area and number of residents to the energy consumption. Based on current consumption and electricity generating technologies, 1. 6 tons of CO 2, 7. 3 kg of SO 2 in addition to other pollutants are generated per resident. Comparative analysis indicates that Lebanon has electricity consumption similar to that of Western Europe, paving the way for significant energy saving potential.
