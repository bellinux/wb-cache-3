5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> {{contact with the}} spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad.|$|E
50|$|<b>Padding</b> <b>in</b> {{undergarments}} is {{also used}} by some crossdressers. This may include a form of <b>padding</b> <b>in</b> the shape of male genitals worn in the underwear of a female who is passing as a male, or hip and buttock padding worn by a male who is passing as a female.|$|R

5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|Baryonyx had a {{rudimentary}} secondary palate, similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests {{the presence of}} a horny <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> the roof of the mouth. It had a sagittal crest above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasal bones, which was triangular, narrow, and sharp in front. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, on Allosaurus. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary had many foramina (openings), which were passages for nerves and blood vessels. It has been suggested that some of Baryonyx cranial bones had been misidentified (resulting in the occiput's too-deep reconstruction), and the skull was probably as low, long and narrow as that of the closely related Suchomimus.|$|E

The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) barred him from running for the presidency {{on the grounds that}} he had Costa Rican nationality. In the 2004 municipal elections, Pastora was running for mayor of Managua on the Independent Liberal Party's ticket. Pastora got less than 5% of the votes.|$|E
25|$|There were {{changes made}} to the Andrés Bonifacio class as {{compared}} to their original design during its service with the US Navy, US Coast Guard and the Republic of Vietnam Navy. The ships were passed to the Philippine Navy with fewer weapons on-board and old surface search radars, and these were addressed later on by the Philippine Navy through modernization programs, including {{the addition of a}} helicopter landing <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> 1979.|$|E
25|$|One {{week after}} the PAD began {{occupation}} of the Government House grounds, violence erupted {{as members of the}} UDDT clashed with the <b>PAD</b> <b>in</b> a melee involving firearms, resulting in 43 injuries and at least one death.

25|$|AUSROC II was {{a larger}} {{pressure}} fed kerosene-oxygen bipropellant rocket {{that was developed}} in the 1990s. It was designed to reach an altitude of 10km. The first attempt at launching an AUSROC II suffered a spectacular failure on the launch <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> 1992. The subsequent rocket, named AUSROC II-2 was successfully launched in 1995 from Woomera, although it did not reach its target apogee due to pressurisation problems with the LOX tank.|$|E
25|$|By July 1969 a three-door wagon version {{intended}} for private use arrived, the LS11 Suzuki Fronte Estate, to give passenger car buyers a model with more luggage room without {{the indignity of}} having to buy a commercial vehicle. The Estate had the same top-hinged rear opening, but featured a more comfortable, while still folding, rear seat. There was also a folding luggage shelf in the trunk. Sops to safety, already somewhat better than the regular Fronte because of the engine location and the driver's seat being located farther back, included an anti-glare dashboard and a round horn <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> the steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|Steve Harmison then bowled {{the next}} {{over from the}} Pavilion End, {{removing}} spinner Rafique for a duck on his second ball of the over as he was caught behind and then having Mortaza bowled as Mortaza missed the ball only to have it graze his pad and roll behind him to hit his leg stump. Bangladesh had lost three wickets for two runs {{in the space of}} nine balls, and Harmison nearly added another wicket to his tally as he hit Anwar Hossain Monir on the <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> front. However, umpire Hariharan wasn't convinced it was going to hit the stumps, and Harmison was denied the hat-trick.|$|E

25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if your left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{his career}} as a journalist, he later founded Manager Daily {{newspaper}} as well as satellite broadcaster ASTV. Originally a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, he later became a leader of the anti-Thaksin movement. Under his leadership, the PAD was the major player in the 2005–2006 Thai political crisis that led to the 2006 military coup that toppled the Thaksin government. When Thaksin-affiliated parties won the 2007 general election, Sondhi became the major player in the 2008–2009 Thai political crisis, leading the <b>PAD</b> <b>in</b> violent clashes with security forces and anti-PAD protestors as well as the seizure of Government House, Don Muang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Sondhi is more or less a supporter of the Democrat Party and stopped the PAD's protests after Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries to the Air Force {{began in}} 1956, with 145 {{of this model}} produced. RB-66s were used as the primary night photo-reconnaissance {{aircraft}} of the USAF during this time, many examples serving with tactical reconnaissance squadrons based in the United Kingdom and in West Germany. A total of 72 of the B-66B bomber version were built, 69 fewer than originally planned. A total of 13 B-66B aircraft later were modified into EB-66B electronic countermeasures aircraft for the cold war with Russia, and were stationed at RAF Chelveston with the 42nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron who did the conversion in the early 1960s. They would rotate out of an alert <b>pad</b> <b>in</b> Spain {{during the time that}} the 42nd had them. These and the RB-66Cs that the 42nd had would eventually be sent to Vietnam. Unlike the U.S. Navy's A-3 Skywarrior, which performed some bombing missions, the Destroyer was not used as a bomber in Vietnam.|$|E
