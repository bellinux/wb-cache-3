40|$|Published online: 18 Feb 2014 There is {{considerable}} evidence for {{an association between}} <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> scores on validated psychometric measures of erroneous gambling-related cognitions. However, a potential problem with this literature is that samples of pathological gamblers score higher on indicators of co-morbidity (e. g. substance misuse) that are also associated with poorer decision-making and reasoning abilities. We aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> gambling-related erroneous beliefs after controlling for alcohol misuse. A sample of 140 regular gamblers completed a detailed psychological assessment including measures of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> (NORC DSM-IV Screen Self-Administered), delusion proneness (the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory), alcohol use (the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> beliefs (Gambling-Related Cognitions Scale). Pathological gamblers scored higher than other regular gamblers on all these measures. Although alcohol use disorder was not directly related to delusion proneness, a combination of higher alcohol use disorder and delusion proneness was associated with higher gambling-related cognition scores. Our findings confirm previous evidence supporting an association between <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> greater endorsement of erroneous gambling-related cognitions. Alcohol misuse and delusion proneness may be factors that strengthen this association. Reza Abdollahnejad, Paul Delfabbro and Linley Denso...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT — Aim: <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> comorbid alcohol {{dependence}} often occur in combination. Disulfiram {{is one of}} the proven drugs for {{alcohol dependence}}. In addition to its inhibiting acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, disulfiram inhibits dopamine β-hydroxylase and may thereby increase dopamine and decrease norepinephrine cerebral concentrations. Because there may be common neurochemical substrates and neuronal circuits for <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> addiction, we wished to explore the effect of disulfiram in gambling. Method: We describe the outcome of a patient with alcohol dependence <b>and</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> treated with disulfiram D. Results: During treatment with disulfiram, the patient reported that his desire to gamble disappeared entirely. Follow-up indicated that he has not gambled for> 12 months. Conclusions: Although uncontrolled case observations should be interpreted with caution, disulfiram deserves further investigation in <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Impulse control {{disorders}} (ICDs), {{in particular}} <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> hypersexuality, <b>and</b> compulsive eating, are being increasingly identified in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> {{has been associated}} with frontal/executive dysfunctions, whereas hypersexuality and compulsive eating, and their relation with cognitive dysfunctions, have not been investigated in PD. METHODS: We investigated cognitive correlates underpinning <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> hypersexuality, <b>and</b> compulsive eating in PD. PD outpatients were screened for <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> hypersexuality, <b>and</b> compulsive eating. Based on clinical criteria, we identified 13 patients with hypersexuality, 12 with compulsive eating, 14 with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> <b>and</b> 10 with multiple ICDs. Fourteen PD patients matched for age and education without ICDs served as controls. Clinical features and neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological functioning were assessed in the 5 groups. RESULTS: Demographic, clinical, neuropsychiatric, and neurological aspects did not differ among groups. All 4 groups of ICD patients were impaired on tasks exploring spatial-planning and set-shifting tasks compared with the controls. The main difference among patients with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> hypersexuality, <b>and</b> compulsive eating was that patients with hypersexuality were more impaired on the Stroop test than patients with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling.</b> Individuals with hypersexuality, compulsive eating, and multiple ICDs performed worse on verbal learning and memory tests than did patients with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling.</b> DISCUSSION: ICDs are associated with impaired cognitive functions; the severity of impairment decreased in the order multiple ICDs and hypersexuality > compulsive eating > <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling.</b> Our findings support the idea that hypersexuality is associated with prefrontal and memory dysfunctions, whereas <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> seems to be related only to frontal dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> is {{proposed}} {{as a participant}} of an impulsive-compulsive spectrum related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. This study aims to contrast <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> obsessive-compulsive disorder regarding course, comorbidity, and personality, hence testing {{the validity of the}} impulsive-compulsive spectrum. METHOD: 40 <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> 40 obsessive-compulsive disorder subjects matched to 40 healthy volunteers according to gender, age, and education were assessed with the Temperament Personality Questionnaire and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Psychiatric patients were also assessed for course and comorbidity data. RESULTS: Obsessive-compulsive disorder presented an earlier onset, but the full syndrome took longer to evolve. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> had higher comorbidity with substance-related disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder higher comorbidity with somatoform disorders. Gamblers scored higher than controls on the sub-factors Impulsiveness, Extravagance, Disorderliness, and Fear of Uncertainty. Obsessive-compulsive patients scored higher than controls on Fear of Uncertai-nty. Impulsiveness, Extravagance, and Disorderliness significantly correlated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale total score, Fear of Uncertainty did not. DISCUSSION: The course and comorbidity profiles of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> resemble an addiction and differ from obsessive-compulsive disorder. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> combines impulsive <b>and</b> compulsive traits. Impulsivity and compulsivity should be regarded as orthogonal constructs, and as drives implicated in volition aspects of behavioral syndromes...|$|R

40|$|The {{neurobiology}} of impulse control disorders Neurobiologia dos transtornos do controle do impulso Abst rac t Objective: To {{review the}} neurobiological substrates of impulse control disorders. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> is a {{main focus of}} the review in that most biological studies of the formal impulse control disorders have examined this disorder. Method: The medical database Medline from 1966 to present was searched to identify relevant articles that were subsequently reviewed to generate this manuscript. Results: Preclinical studies suggest that differential brain monoamine neuromodulation is associated with impulsive decision-making and risk-taking behaviors. Clinical studies implicate multiple neurotransmitter systems (serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and opioidergic) in the pathophysiology of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> other impulse control disorders. Initial neuroimaging studies have implicated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in the pathophysiology of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> other impulse control disorders.

40|$|The present thesis {{aimed to}} {{contribute}} to research and practice by investigating psychiatric disorders, dysfunctional beliefs and substance use disorders in pathological gamblers. The four empirical studies utilised a large Australian community sample of regular gamblers to examine the prevalence and role of Axis I and Axis II psychiatric disorders in regular and pathological gamblers’ behaviour and thoughts. In Paper 1, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders within a community sample of regular gamblers was investigated. Psychiatric disorders {{were found to be}} more prevalent among pathological gamblers than other regular gamblers. Mood and anxiety related disorders were twice as common. Furthermore, almost all personality disorders (apart from depressive and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder) were more prevalent among pathological gamblers than non-pathological gamblers. These differences remained significant even after controlling for gender. Paper 2 examined <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> gambling-related cognitions to ascertain to what extent they were related to personality disorders and general dysfunctional beliefs. The results showed that <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> was strongly related to borderline personality disorder measure as well as gambling-specific belief scores. A path analysis showed that borderline personality disorder is only weakly related to gambling-related belief after controlling for delusion-proneness. In other words, there is evidence of a pathway between borderline personality disorder scores, delusion-proneness scores <b>and</b> <b>Gambling</b> Related Cognition Scale scores which, in turn, are positively associated with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> scores. These results support suggestions that dysfunctional beliefs which are associated with borderline personality disorder may make people more susceptible to gambling-related erroneous cognitions. The study reported in Paper 3 compared the prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidity between pathological gamblers who did, and did not, additionally meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder (dual diagnosis). The findings indicated that psychiatric disorders were most prevalent amongst those with a dual diagnosis, followed by those who only met criteria for <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling.</b> Both of these groups had a higher prevalence of psychiatric co- morbidity than those regular gamblers in the sample who did not meet criteria for either <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> or alcohol use disorder. Paper 4 examined associations between <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> gambling-related dysfunctional belief scores once alcohol use disorder has been controlled for. Pathological gamblers scored higher than other regular gamblers on all these measures. Although alcohol use disorder was not directly related to delusion proneness, a combination of higher alcohol use disorder and delusion proneness was associated with higher gambling-related cognition scores. The findings confirm previous evidence supporting an association between <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> greater endorsement of erroneous gambling-related cognitions. Alcohol misuse and delusion proneness may be factors that strengthen this association. By clarifying links between dysfunctional beliefs, Axis I and II psychiatric disorders, substance use <b>and</b> <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> <b>and</b> suggesting new directions for research and practice, the thesis potentially contributes to better research and outcomes for problem gamblers, clinicians, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> communities.

40|$|Background and Aims: Gender {{differences}} {{have been reported}} among pathological gamblers populations. These differences concern variables such as type of gambling (men are more likely engaged in ''strategic gambling'' whereas women prefer ''non-strategic'' gambling), evolution of the gambling problem (faster progression for women) and suicidal behaviours (more attempted suicide by women). The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate the relationship between gender and clinical status in a Swiss sample of treatment seeking pathological gamblers. Method: Prospective descriptive study of 260 new outpatients entering treatment between October 1999 and October 2007 at the Center for Excessive Gambling Studies, Lausanne, Switzerland. Data are issued from standardised medical records. Gender differences were examined (Chi-squares and ANOVAs) on interval between first <b>gambling</b> behaviours <b>and</b> first specialized treatment, interval between <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> onset <b>and</b> first specialized treatment, purpose of consulting, type of gambling (« strategic gambling » vs « nonstrategic <b>gambling</b> ») <b>and</b> suicidality.
