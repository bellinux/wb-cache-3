In 1991, Eisert received the 1990 Picture Editor of the Year award for Newspapers/Sports Picture Editing in the <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Year</b> competition. This award recognized Eisert's work, Field of Dreamers, for the San Jose Mercury News. A year later, Eisert was part of the six-person team at The Mercury News that was awarded third place in the 1991 Picture Editing/Team Portfolio category of the University of Missouri's <b>Pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Year.</b> She took second place in the 1992 Pictures of the Year's Magazine Feature Story Picture Editing category for her contribution to a story in West Magazine.|$|E

500|$|Declaring that {{it would}} make only all-talking films, RKO began {{shooting}} at the small facility FBO shared with Pathé in New York City while the main FBO studio in Hollywood was technologically refitted. In charge of production was William LeBaron, who had held the same position at FBO. The new company's two initial releases were musicals: The melodramatic Syncopation premiered on March 29, 1929. The comedic Street Girl debuted July 30. This was billed as RKO's first [...] "official" [...] production—first to follow the formal incorporation of Radio Pictures, first to be made in Hollywood. A few nonsinging pictures followed, but the studio's first major hit was again a musical. RKO spent heavily on the lavish Rio Rita, including a number of Technicolor sequences. Opening in September to rave reviews, it was named one of the ten best <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> by Film Daily. Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with initiating the [...] "first age of the filmed Broadway musical". By the end of the year, RKO was making use of an additional production facility—five hundred acres that had been acquired near Encino in the San Fernando Valley as a backlot for exteriors and large-scale standing sets.|$|E

2500|$|In early February 1994, Eisert {{left her}} {{position}} at the San Jose Mercury News to become the director of photography at the San Francisco Examiner newspaper.

2500|$|The {{film was}} a success and was the only silent {{independent}} film of Swanson's to do well at the box office. It {{was one of her}} last financially successful films, including the talkies The Trespasser and Sunset Blvd. It went on to make $1,000,000 during its US run. However, at Kennedy's advice, Swanson had sold her distribution rights for the film to Schenck, as Kennedy felt it would be a commercial failure. He also didn't care for the image Swanson portrayed in the film. By this point, Queen Kelly had been a disaster, and Swanson regretted it. [...] The film made the top ten best <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> list as well. It was Raoul Walsh's final role, as he subsequently lost an eye in an accident. The film was nominated for awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Gloria Swanson) and Best Cinematography. Swanson did not attend the ceremony, and always felt it was like [...] "comparing apples to oranges". [...] Contemporary reviews called it racy but excellent, and praised Swanson's performance. At present, the film, save for the final reel (stopping just after Davidson finds Sadie in his room), exists in good condition.|$|E
