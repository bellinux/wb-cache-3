5|$|After the war, Macmillan went to Zürich in May 1919 as a {{delegate}} to the International Congress of Women. The Congress strongly condemned the harsh surrender terms that were being planned for Germany in the Treaty of Versailles to be signed the next month.

5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference</b> in Geneva in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Koht's first {{travel abroad}} was in 1890, when he {{accompanied}} {{his father as}} well as Hans Jacob Horst and John Theodor Lund to an interparliamentary <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> in London. In 1895 he was a founding member and {{board member of the}} Norwegian Peace Association, serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902. From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named Fredstidende ("Peace Times").|$|E
5|$|Two months later, in November 1973 (just {{after the}} Yom Kippur War in October), the ANO hijacked KLM Flight 861, this time {{using the name}} Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. Fatah had been {{discussing}} convening a <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> in Geneva; the hijacking was intended to warn them not {{to go ahead with}} it. In response, in March or July 1974, Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference</b> of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece, but {{political}} developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the war's end in November 1918 a draft {{agreement}} had been accepted by the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference</b> to create a League of Nations, as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means. The foundation of the League at this time was providential as far as Nansen was concerned, giving him a new outlet for his restless energy.|$|E
5|$|After they test {{negative}} for the virus, Artyom again encounters Khan. They locate the young Dark One, {{and in a}} series of hallucinatory flashbacks, Artyom recalls that he was saved by a Dark One as a child; he was psychically linked to the Dark Ones, intended to form a bridge between their species and his. Artyom vows to make amends by protecting the little Dark One, and the two travel to Polis, the Metro's central area, where a <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> regarding D6 between the Rangers, Red Line, the Reich, and neutral Hansa is taking place. Artyom defeats Lesnitsky and Pavel during the trip. Along the way, the little Dark One senses that there is a group of hibernating Dark Ones in D6. After arriving at Polis, the little Dark One uses his telepathic abilities to make the Red Line leader, Chairman Moskvin, publicly confess that the <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> is a diversion to enable General Korbut to seize D6. Artyom {{and the rest of the}} Rangers rush to the bunker to make a final stand against Korbut's army, but are incapacitated by an armored train ramming into their station. Red Line soldiers surround, and prepare to execute Artyom and Miller.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference</b> in 1919, while it also began to take a more assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{successful}} surprise attack, the Polish army in Vilnius managed to appropriate sizable stocks of supplies and take hundreds of prisoners. When Piłsudski entered the city, a victory parade was held in his honour. The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city were immediately sent to the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference,</b> and the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened.|$|E
5|$|Bramlette {{resigned}} his judgeship {{and accepted}} a commission as a {{colonel in the}} Union Army on August 7, 1861. In violation of Kentucky's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War, he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{territorial}} gains {{following the}} Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference,</b> the Greeks still hoped {{to achieve the}} Megali Idea and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna and sought to take Ankara, {{with the aim of}} destroying the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.|$|E
50|$|The main {{activity}} of the WPC was organizing enormous international <b>peace</b> <b>conferences</b> with thousands in attendance; they condemned western military action, armaments and weapons tests but refrained from criticizing Russian aggression. For example, in 1956 the WPC condemned the Suez war but not the Russian invasion of Hungary.|$|R

50|$|The Hague Conventions were {{international}} treaties negotiated at the First and Second <b>Peace</b> <b>Conferences</b> at The Hague, Netherlands, in 1899 and 1907, respectively, and were, {{along with the}} Geneva Conventions, among the first formal statements {{of the laws of}} war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law.|$|R
5|$|General Salle {{removed the}} already limited {{autonomy}} of the Council on February 16, 1918. After the armistices and capitulations {{at the end of}} First World War, it was agreed that France and Italy should continue to govern the territories they occupied, and that France, Italy and the British Empire together should govern Shkodër. As a result, the French army moved from Korçë on June 15, 1920. After the French army left Korçë, the fate of the territory that it administered was decided by the Paris <b>Peace</b> <b>Conference</b> in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál (chapter 57), the god Bragi {{explains}} {{the origin of}} poetry. Bragi says that it originated in the Æsir–Vanir War, when during the <b>peace</b> <b>conference</b> the Æsir and the Vanir formed a truce by all spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided {{that it should not}} be poured out, but rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered, and from his blood is made the Mead of Poetry.|$|E
