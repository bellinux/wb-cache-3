For {{the distribution of the}} concordance number the closeness of the normalap <b>proximation</b> <b>and</b> its improvement by the Gram-Charlier approximation are discussed. The Metropolis walk on the set of contingency tables is constructed. The two approximations are compared with the simula tion by the Metropolis walk, and then the Gram-Charlier approximation is shown to be extremely close to the distribution of the concordance number.

In Proximo we propose an approach to combine a collaborative recommendation system, with location-aware technology to provide personalised, dynamic and domain-driven paths through work and social spaces. For our purposes, context includes user preferences, current location, importance measures for digital artifacts and a community of other users’ measures. We report on an ethnographic study of two art galleries, the architecture of a privacy-centric <b>proximation</b> <b>and</b> recommendation system, an exploratory user study and results from a gallery tour application. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the psychometric properties of}} the Swedish and the original version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture within a Swedish hospital setting and described health care staff’s per- ceptions of patient safety culture. A web-survey was used to obtain data from registered nurses, enrolled nurses and physicians (N = 1023). Psychometric properties were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Root mean square error of ap- <b>proximation</b> <b>and</b> other fit indices indicated psycho- metric properties for both versions to be acceptable. Internal consistency for the dimensions varied be- tween 0. 60 and 0. 87. Staff scored the dimension “Teamwork Within Units” highest and the dimension “Hospital Management Support” the lowest. The safety was graded as very good or excellent by 58. 9 % of the respondents and one third had reported more than one event in the past 12 months. The question- naire is considered to be useful for measuring patient safety culture in Swedish hospital settings. Managers have a great responsibility to work with improving patient safety culture...|$|R
40|$|The central {{contention}} {{is that there}} is a coincidence of research interests between industrial marketing and economic geography in relation to spatial embeddedness in business relationships. There are nuances in relational economic geography that have not been addressed in industrial marketing research, notably that in addition to geographic proximity, co-located actors may experienc emore or less cognitive, organizational, social and institutional proximity. A conceptual framework is built around the processes of <b>proximation</b> <b>and</b> distanciation, which, it is argued, can be either competitively generative or competitively degenerative. These processes are investigated empirically through a qualitative study, grounded in structuration theory, of a peripheral region of England that has suffered lengthy industrial decline. The qualitative study extended over six years and encompassed 87 interviews with senior managers from both public and private sector organizations. Competitively generative proximation processes are found to be the most prominent in the region; such processes involve a mixture of cognitive cost-benefit calculation and affective commitment to the region. Important enduring relational states are identified and elaborated, notably regional loyalty and relational isolation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} a modern data {{processing}} method of reflectometry measurement of communication line, {{based on the}} application of wavelet transform to reflectograms is claimed. This method {{is based on a}} multi-level one-dimensional dis- crete wavelet-decomposition of the reflectogram to the j level (depth) allowing decomposition of the reflectogram into ap- <b>proximation</b> <b>and</b> detail coefficients, containing information on the useful and noise components of the reflectogram. The noise term of the reflectogram is most clearly revealed in the detail coefficients obtained at the lowest decomposition level (j = 1, 2, 3), and which needs to be applied to the threshold processing with different threshold for each coefficient thus the removal of sufficiently small coefficients, which are considered to be noise, is carried out. After this processing of detail coefficients reconstructed reflectogram, with great accuracy, corresponds to the reflectogram without the noise term, that will significantly reduce the localization error of damage and discontinuity of communication line. Evaluation is carried out by comparing mean-square error of recovered, noisy, and original reflectogram without the noise component, {{as well as on the}} basis of visual comparison of these reflectograms...|$|R
