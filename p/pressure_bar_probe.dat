40|$|Abstract. Both {{temperature}} and strain rate {{have a significant}} effect on the mechanical behavior of most materials. At or close to room temperature, well-designed and well-built SHPB devices can be used to produce high quality high strain rate data relatively easily, but at elevated temperatures many practical difficulties make such tests much more complicated. There is, however, an increasing interest and practical need to study and model the high strain rate behavior of materials also at high temperatures, and therefore development of sophisticated high strain rate high temperature testing devices is needed. In this paper, a fully computer controlled Split Hopkinson <b>Pressure</b> <b>Bar</b> (SHPB) testing system with a high température capability up to 1000 tuc is described The high température (HT) system is based on fast pneumatic specimen and <b>pressure</b> <b>bar</b> manipulation devices which en able heating up of the specimen only and limit the contact time of the hot specimen with cold <b>pressure</b> <b>bars</b> to 50 100 mus Some results of the tests made with the new HT-SHPB device are also presented in this paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{materials}} {{are often used}} as impact/blast attenuators due to their capacity to absorb kinetic energy when compressed to large strains. For such applications, three key material properties are the crushing stress, plateau stress and densification strain. The difficulties associated with obtaining these mechanical properties from dynamic/impact tests are outlined. The results of an experimental investigation of the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of two types of cellular {{materials are}} reported. The dynamic tests were carried out using Hopkinson <b>pressure</b> <b>bars.</b> Experimentally determined propagation coefficients are employed to represent both dispersion and attenuation effects as stress waves travel along the bars. Propagation coefficients were determined for 20 mm and 40 mm diameter viscoelastic PMMA <b>pressure</b> <b>bars</b> and for elastic Magnesium <b>pressure</b> <b>bars.</b> The use of the elementary wave theory is shown to give satisfactory results for frequencies of up to approximately 15 kHz, 8 kHz and 30 kHz for the 20 mm and 40 mm diameter PMMA bars and the 23 mm diameter Magnesium bars respectively. The use of low impedance, viscoelastic <b>pressure</b> <b>bars</b> is shown to be preferable for testing low density, low strength materials. The quasi-static and dynamic compressive properties of balsa wood, Rohacell- 51 WF and Rohacell- 110 WF foams are investigated along all three principal directions. The dynamic properties were investigated by performing Split Hopkinson <b>Pressure</b> <b>Bar</b> (SHPB) and Direct Impact (DI) tests. In general, the crushing stress, the plateau stress and the densification strain remain constant with increasing strain rate of the SHPB tests. However, a dynamic enhancement of the crushing stress and plateau stress was revealed for balsa wood and Rohacell- 51 WF. In contrast, the plateau stresses of the Rohacell- 110 WF specimens are lower for SHPB than quasi-static tests. From the DI tests, it is shown that compaction waves have negligible effect on the stresses during dynamic compaction of along and across the grain balsa wood at impact speeds between approximately 20 - 100 m/s. Alternatively, the proximal end stresses of both Rohacell- 51 WF and 110 WF foams increase with increasing impact velocity, following the quadratic trend predicted by 'shock theory'. This indicates that compaction waves are important for the case of Rohacell foam, even at low impact velocities. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

It is quick and convenient enough to be used on a routine basis to improve the accuracy of SHPB tests...|$|R

The thesis describes a series of experiments using a split Hopkinson <b>pressure</b> <b>bar</b> to study the mechanical behaviour of a carbon fibre composite at high rates of loading. The split Hopkinson <b>pressure</b> <b>bar</b> technique uses specimens {{in the form of a}} cylinder, sandwiched between two steel bars of the same diameter,as the specimen. Ona of the steel bars is subjected to an impact produced by a projectile from a gas gun specifically developed for this purpose. This produces a stress pulse incident on the specimen which will produce stresses within the specimen of up to 3 x 108 N/m 2 with rise times of approximately 15 to 30 micro seconds. The study of material behaviour at these strain rates involves the study of stress wave propagation. The thesis initially discusses the theory of stress wave propagation and then gives a brief history of the Hopkinson <b>pressure</b> <b>bar.</b> The configuration used for this particular series of experiments is described and an account is given of its use to compare two different techniques of monitoring specimen behaviour.
