40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{diagnosis}} of Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) infection is {{hampered by the}} suboptimal sensitivity of fecal-based tests. Serological methods {{are believed to be}} more sensitive, although assessing their accuracy is difficult {{because of the lack of}} sensitivity of a fecal-based reference ("gold") standard. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of 5 serologic tests for S. stercoralis (in-house IFAT, NIE-ELISA and NIE-LIPS and the commercially available Bordier-ELISA and IVD-ELISA) were assessed on 399 cryopreserved serum samples. Accuracy was measured using fecal results as the <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standard,</b> but also using a composite reference standard (based on a combination of tests). RESULTS: According to the latter standard, the most sensitive test was IFAT, with 94. 6 % sensitivity (91. 2 - 96. 9), followed by IVD-ELISA (92. 3 %, 87. 7 - 96. 9). The most specific test was NIE-LIPS, with specificity 99. 6 % (98. 9 - 100), followed by IVD-ELISA (97. 4 %, 95. 5 - 99. 3). NIE-LIPS did not cross-react with any of the specimens from subjects with other parasitic infections. NIE-LIPS and the two commercial ELISAs approach 100 % specificity at a cut off level that maintains ≥ 70 % sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: NIE-LIPS is the most accurate serologic test for the {{diagnosis of}} S. stercoralis infection. IFAT and each of the ELISA tests are sufficiently accurate, above a given cut off, for diagnosis, prevalence studies and inclusion in clinical trials...|$|E

Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of different tests for the screening of schistosomiasis in African migrants, in a non endemic setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A retrospective study was conducted on 373 patients screened at the Centre for Tropical Diseases (CTD) in Negrar, Verona, Italy. Biological samples were tested with: stool/urine microscopy, Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) dipstick test, ELISA, Western blot, immune-chromatographic test (ICT). Test accuracy and predictive values of the immunological tests were assessed primarily on the basis of the results of microscopy (<b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standard)</b> : ICT and WB resulted the test with highest sensitivity (94 % and 92 %, respectively), with a high NPV (98 %).

40|$|An {{isothermal}} {{section of}} the phase diagram for the system Nd-Pd-O at 1350 K has been established by equilibration of samples representing 13 different compositions and phase identification after quenching by optical and scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive analysis of x-rays. The binary oxides PdO and NdO were not stable at 1350 K. Two ternary oxides Nd 4 PdO 7 and Nd 2 Pd 2 O 5 were identified. Solid and liquid alloys, {{as well as the}} intermetallics NdPd 3 and NdPd 5, were found to be in equilibrium with Nd 2 O 3. Based on the phase relations, three solidstate cells were designed to measure the Gibbs energies of formation of PdO and the two ternary oxides. An advanced version of the solid-state cell incorporating a buffer electrode was used for high-temperature thermodynamic measurements. The function of the buffer electrode, placed between reference and working electrodes, was to absorb the electrochemical flux of the mobile species through the solid electrolyte caused by trace electronic conductivity. The buffer electrode prevented polarization of the measuring electrode and ensured accurate data. Yttria-stabilized zirconia was used as the solid electrolyte and pure oxygen gas at a pressure of 0. 1 MP a as the reference electrode. Electromotive force measurements, conducted from 950 to 1425 K, indicated the presence of a third ternary oxide Nd 2 PdO 4, stable below 1135 (± 10) K.

40|$|Background. The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} non-invasive methods for diagnosing renal artery stenosis {{in patients with}} renal insufficiency is incompletely known. Methods. Forty-seven consecutive patients with moderately impaired renal function and a clinical suspicion of renal artery stenosis were investigated with computed tomography angiography (CTA), gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), contrast-enhanced Doppler ultrasound and captopril renography. The <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> was stenosis reducing the vessel diameter by at least 50 % on CTA, and an alternative reference standard (‘morphological and functional stenosis’) was defined as at least 50 % diameter reduction on CTA or MRA, combined with a positive finding from ultrasound or captopril renography. Results. The frequency of positive findings, calculated {{on the basis of}} individual patients, was 70 % for CTA, 60 % for MRA, 53 % for ultrasound and 30 % for captopril renography. Counting kidneys rather than patients, corresponding frequencies were 53 %, 41 %, 29 % and 15 %, respectively. In relation to the CTA standard, the sensitivity (and specificity) at the patient level was 0. 81 (0. 79) for MRA, 0. 70 (0. 89) for ultrasound and 0. 42 (1. 00) for captopril renography, and at the kidney level 0. 76 (0. 82), 0. 53 (0. 81) and 0. 30 (0. 86), respectively. Relative to the alternative reference standard, corresponding values at the patient level were 1. 00 (0. 62) for CTA, 0. 90 (0. 69) for MRA, 0. 91 (1. 00) for ultrasound and 0. 67 (1. 00) for captopril renography, and at the kidney level 0. 96 (0. 76), 0. 85 (0. 79), 0. 71 (0. 97) and 0. 50 (0. 97), respectively. Conclusions. CTA and MRA are superior to ultrasound and captopril renography at diagnosing morphological stenosis, but ultrasound may be useful as a screening method and captopril renography for verifying renin-dependent hypertension.

30|$|There are two {{approaches}} mostly used {{for determining the}} detection efficiency of Si-SPAD detectors: one {{is based on the}} detector subtitution technique, which uses a strongly attenuated laser and a reference detector (López et al. 2015; Dhoska et al. 2015 a, b; Kück et al. 2014) and the other one based on the two-photon correlation technique (Polyakov et al. 2006). The latter has the advantage that it does not require a reference detector; however, the effect of multiple photon events at photon-counting level has to be considered. The lowest uncertainty so far reported using this approach is 0.18 %. Nevertheless, even when the achieved uncertainty is similar to those reported using the detector substitution technique (u =  0.16 – 0.3 %) (López et al. 2015; Müller et al. 2012), the latter is mostly preferred by most of the national metrology institutes, since it uses a calibrated reference detector traceable to the <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> (cryogenic radiometer) for the optical radiant power measurement; and thus, the traceability to a national primary standard is in this way fully assured. For this reason, the setup used to determine the detection efficiency of Si-SPAD detectors at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the German National Metrology Institute, is based on this approach, which uses the double attenuator technique (López et al. 2015). In this case, a standard detector (Si-Photodiode) is used to calibrate two attenuators required to attenuate the laser radiant power impinging on the Si-SPAD detector. These measurements are performed in situ subsequently; thus, the total attenuation is calculated by multiplying the two attenuation values. Knowing the total filter attenuation, the total optical power impinging on the Si-SPAD detector can be calculated and compared with the count rate generated by the Si-SPAD detector. From these measurements the detection efficiency of the Si-SPAD detector is determined. Using this measurement procedure, the detection efficiency was determined with a relative standard uncertainty of approx. 0.3 % (López et al. 2015). The major uncertainty contribution to this measurement arose from the uncertainty associated to the measurement of the filter transmission, which is obtained from the deviation between the individual and combined transmission measurement carried out with an analog standard Si-photodiode (López et al. 2015; Dhoska et al. 2015 a, b; Kück et al. 2014).|$|E

The present measurements, performed with a vibrating-wire sensor, were carried out at atmospheric pressure over the temperature range (283 to 313) K. Over this temperature range, the viscosity varies from approximately (37 to 267) mPaâs. The measurements have been carried out with an instrument that has already been the subject of improvement since the first measurements were performed, and it relies upon calibration exclusively against the primary standard of viscometry. The estimated overall uncertainty of the results does not exceed (1 %, over the whole range of the measurements and, for the results obtained at temperatures in the vicinity of 293 K, is (0. 8 %. The higher quality of the present measurements, and their direct traceability to the <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> value for viscosity, justifies the replacement of our earlier set of preliminary data on DIDP viscosity...|$|R
40|$|Liquid chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (LC–MS) with electrospray (ES) ionization in {{the positive}} ion mode {{was applied to}} drug analysis in forensic toxicology. Several types of screening and confirmation strategies were developed, based essentially on searching of comprehensive MS libraries and databases that were created in-house for the purpose. Two spectral libraries, both containing spectra for approximately 400 drugs, were created. Spectra for the LC–MS/in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) library were acquired by continuously switching between low (25  V) and high (90  V) orifice voltages during the run, and the summed mass spectra {{were added to the}} library. A library for liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was created by obtaining product ion spectra at a collision energy of 35  eV, and additionally at 20  eV or 50  eV, if the latter were more informative. The product ion spectra were reproducible in the long-term, based on a four-year experiment. Comparison of two libraries, independently created with similar instruments in different laboratories, showed that the libraries were fully compatible. Comparison of spectra obtained with different manufacturers' instruments suggested that after standardization of collision energy and gas pressure, LC–MS/MS spectral libraries are suitable for interlaboratory use. The libraries were utilized in two fully automated methods for selected drug groups, comprising screening and confirmation. Analysis of 16 β-blocking drugs in urine involved two-step MS analysis, including a screening step based on monitoring of protonated molecules and a confirmation step based on LC–MS/MS product ion spectra. A method for simultaneous screening and quantitation of 18 antihistamine drugs in blood involved multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) for screening and quantitation and product ion spectra for confirmation of the drugs. The antihistamines were identified and quantified at concentrations ranging from subtherapeutic to toxic in blood. A data-dependent experiment (DDE) was utilized for automation of both procedures, from starting the sample batch to printing of the library search results. Two different approaches for comprehensive screening of drugs were developed. A method for simultaneous screening of 238 drugs in blood was developed using LC–MS/MS with multiple-reaction monitoring. Identification was based on RT and the presence of protonated molecule and one representative fragment ion. The method was shown to be sufficiently selective and sensitive to allow the majority of the drugs to be detected at therapeutic concentrations. Another approach was based on accurate mass determination with liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–MS/TOF), using a target database of monoisotopic masses for 433 drugs. The method was tentatively suitable for rapid screening of drugs in urine even without referral to <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standards.</b> reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of autocollimator-based surface profilometers at synchrotron metrology laboratories worldwide necessitates a detailed {{understanding of the}} parameters influencing their angular response. A comprehensive overview of {{the current status of}} autocollimator characterization and calibration at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and its implications for their optimal application are provided, as well as information on future challenges and expected progress. Autocollimator-based deflectometric profilometers are in operation at the PTB, the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA, the BESSY II, Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin fuer Materialien und Energie GmbH, Germany, and the Diamond Light Source Ltd (DLS), UK. A continuous topic of research at the PTB is to investigate the factors influencing the angular response of autocollimators and to provide the most accurate calibration of the instruments to aid users in their application and manufacturers in their improvements [1 - 3]. At the PTB, the calibration of autocollimators is realized by a direct comparison of the devices with the <b>primary</b> angle <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> [1]. With highly stable autocollimators, calibrations with standard measurement uncertainties of u = 0. 003 arcsec (15 nrad) have been achieved [2, 3]. The influence of a number of parameters on the angle measurement with autocollimators have been investigated in detail, such as the reflectivity of the surface under test (SUT), the diameter and shape of the aperture stop, its position both along the autocollimator's optical axis and perpendicular to it [2], as well as the optical path length of the autocollimator beam [3]. Extensive information on these errors and their minimization will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Metrologically {{traceable}} {{measurements are}} needed, in environmental monitoring, to provide meaningful {{information on the}} pollution level and the possibility to have suitable <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> is crucial to this purpose to calibrate instruments. The Italian National Institute of Metrological Research (I. N. Ri.

In this framework and regarding gas analysis, {{in the last few}} years I. N. Ri.

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the effect of <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> related bias on estimates of plain radiograph reading performance using studies conducted in clinical practice. Data were extracted on study eligibility, clinical and <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> characteristics and reading performance. The choice of <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> and the prevalence of bias are presented descriptively. Associations between bias and reading performance are estimated using a regression model that produces relative diagnostic odds ratios (RDOR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Three of the 20 eligible studies addressed all five <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> related biases; 15 studies addressed three or more. When the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> report is influenced by knowledge of an observer's opinion this is associated with a significant overestimation in reading performance (RDOR, 3. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 6 to 8. 3; p¿=¿ 0. 01). There is limited evidence that reading performance is inflated when the observer is aware of the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> report before commenting on the radiograph (RDOR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 6 to 5. 1) and deflated when a less valid <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> is used (RDOR, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 1 to 2. 5). There is no evidence that reading performance is affected by application of the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> depending on an observer's opinion and using different <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> in the same study. In conclusion we found variation in the choice and application of <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> in studies of plain radiograph reading performance, but only when <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> report in the knowledge of an observer's opinion does this contribute to a significant overestimation in reading performance...|$|R
