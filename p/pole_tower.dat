40|$|Abstract. In recent years，transmission lines icing {{leads to}} failure and accidents，such as large area ice flashover, {{fittings}} damaged, line dancing, <b>pole</b> (<b>tower)</b> failure, lines breakage even large-scale power outage, causing {{serious threat to}} grid. Nowadays, icing monitoring system mainly relies on detecting the meteorological parameters and the changes of dynamic characteristics for early warning, but the methodologies need additional equipment for data collection. In order to ensure the security and reliability of the grid, a safe, effective and economical methodology of monitoring transmission lines icing has great significance. The project proposed a Transmission Line Icing monitoring principle and algorithm, the method based only on the voltage and current from both ends of transmission lines can be generated dynamically monitoring criterion line icing. According to the criterion maximum, line icing center area, extent and severity can be recognized. The criterion of the method {{is used as a}} mathematical scanner, swept {{from one end of the}} line to the other end, comprehensive judgments are made on the basis of comprehensive criteria for integrated maximum value, thus the method has a high diagnostic accuracy and reliability. The methodology proposed in this paper is different from the current monitoring methodology; additional hardware devices are not required, and the methodology is simple and practical, has strong operability and enormous economic benefits, adapting to the requirements of the development of the smart grid...|$|E
40|$|The {{total number}} of mobile {{subscriptions}} has been announced to reach 6 billion in the market, of which 4 billion are individual users. The {{rest of the people}} on earth are potential subscribers that mainly live in rural areas lacking mobile connectivity today. Many of these users {{do not have access to}} electricity and have 6 U. S. dollar per month (USD/month) of average revenue per person.   Referring to the year 2007, the telecommunication industry had a contribution of 0. 6 percent of direct global carbon dioxide (CO 2) or 0. 4 percent of global carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e). From 2007 to 2009, the number of off-grid radio base stations located in rural areas went up from 350, 000 to 500, 000. Nearly all of these sites use diesel generators and large amounts of fossil fuels during the operational stage. In addition the grid sites with diesel back-up were about 0. 5 million in 2009. The financial and environmental consequences of the life cycle impact of the diesel fuel depleted can be significant. Adaptation of renewable energy has therefore become important for both environmental and economic reasons.   In this master thesis a Life Cycle Assessment of Ericsson’s Managed Rural Coverage (MRC) solution was made. Four main life cycle stages were included: manufacturing, transportation, operation and end-of-life treatment. MRC is an off-grid site solution consisting of electronic communication equipment (radio base station, base station controller, hub, cable) photovoltaic cells, battery, antenna, and constructions part (antenna <b>pole,</b> <b>tower</b> and foundation). This study also includes the satellite connection as well as Ericsson and operator activities in the assessment. The MRC distinguishes itself from the conventional base stations, by its significant decrease of energy consumption in its operational stage as well as the business model around the offering. The assessment in this thesis was carried out in accordance with data retrieved from an Ericsson’s pilot system in Dungunab, Sudan. The ISO 1404 X series of LCA standards was followed and Gabi software w used to evaluate the results.   The carbon footprint was found to be 0. 3 kg CO 2 e/subscriber for the pilot setup. These calculations were based on an assumption that each pilot site serviced 1000 users. The maximum number of subscribers can be about 3200, which would decrease the life cycle CO 2 emissions per user by 2 / 3. According to the sensitivity analysis the maximum CO 2 emissions for a conservative MRC scenario is less than 1 kg CO 2 e/subscriber. Although this figure represents a very conservative scenario, the result is low in comparison with an average GSM network which has an approximate carbon footprint of 15 kg CO 2 e/subscriber. It is important to note that the MRC is not intended to replace all conventional macro RBS sites due to limitations in performance and capabilities, but is rather a complement to conventional macro radio base station sites for applicable scenarios.   Thesis registration number: EGI- 2013 - 024 MSC  EKV 941 </p...|$|E
