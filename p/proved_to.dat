5|$|Bundling the LITE {{version of}} WinFax <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used {{the program for}} the first time and {{submitted}} their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.|$|E

5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be ineffective as very few documents <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be revealing.|$|E

A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a Chimps' Tea Party, which <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but by then the owners of Belle Vue had lost interest in the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.|$|E

5|$|The Allied command {{structure}} in the South West Pacific Area faced the challenges of coalition warfare in several ways, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The benefits of the wartime alliances <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

500|$|Rongorongo ( [...] ; Rapa Nui: [...] ) is {{a system}} of glyphs {{discovered}} in the 19th century on Easter Island that appear to contain writing or proto-writing.

5|$|A Jo Tessem {{equaliser}} for Southampton {{earned the}} visitors a point against Arsenal on 2 February 2002; in hindsight this <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> {{be the last}} time they dropped points in the league season.

5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice.
