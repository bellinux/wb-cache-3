40|$|Purpose: China's {{real estate}} market is rampantly expanding. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the factors {{underpinning}} China's real estate <b>price</b> <b>escalation</b> from 1998 to 2009. Design/methodology/approach: Cointegration approach, vector error correction model and Granger causality test are adopted to analyze whether stable and long-run equilibrium interactions exist between housing prices and key macroeconomic variables, such as CPI, land sale and GDP. Findings: Cointegration analysis shows long-term equilibrium between real estate price (HP) and CPI or GDP, but not land sale. A bilateral Granger causality is observed between CPI and HP. However, GDP does not Granger cause HP, indicating personal gain (disposable income) does not catch up with national gain (GDP) in China, or "Guojinmintui" (national gain outpaces personal gain). Neither is there a feedback effect from HP to GDP, indicating housing price appreciation does not result in immediate capital gain or speculations in housing purchase. Besides, lack of cointegration relationships between HP and land sale is probably caused by restrictive polices on land supply. Originality/value: This paper represents the first attempt to adopt cointegration approach and Granger causality tests to examine the real estate <b>price</b> <b>escalation</b> in China using national monthly data. Econometric analysis and subsequent policy discussion suggest that real estate price is driven by both economic and institutional factors. In particular, "Guojinmintui" is a fiscal issue while capital gain is a monetary issue.

Taking into consideration that a housing purchase is a long-horizon decision and the property price reflects the discounted {{present value of}} future mortgage payments, we develop a housing affordability index as the ratio of lifetime income to housing price. Lifetime income is computed by obtaining the predicted income from a regression over the working life from age 20 to 64 for each birth cohort for which limited data were available.

In this study we use a simulation model to study how markets for oil, biofuel, and food may interact and develop in the long run as world oil production peaks and starts to decline due to resource depletion. We hypothesize that a shortage of oil will make biofuels highly profitable, lead to a take-off for the biofuel industry, and lead to food shortages and starvation. We do not reject this hypothesis. A number of proposed policies turn out to delay rather than cure the problem. A better policy is to develop alternative energy sources that do not require agricultural land.

40|$|We {{examine a}} supply base {{diversification}} problem faced by a buyer who periodically holds auctions to award short term supply contracts among {{a cohort of}} suppliers (i. e., the supply base). To mitigate significant cost shocks to procurement, the buyer can diversify her supply base by selecting suppliers from different regions. We find that the optimal degree of supply base diversification depends on the buyer’s bargaining power, i. e., the buyer’s ability to choose the auction mechanism. At one extreme, when the buyer has full bargaining power and thus can dictatorially implement the optimal mechanism, she prefers to fully diversify. At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bargaining power, she may consider protecting herself against potential <b>price</b> <b>escalation</b> from cost-advantaged suppliers by using a less diversified supply base.

The level of completeness in these contractual archetypes is hypothesized to be determined by contracting costs and benefits, where costs are related to project uncertainty and benefits are related to the likelihood of vendor opportunism. We test this hypothesis with a unique data set of 270 software development contracts entered into by a leading international bank. The analysis confirms the existence of multiple hybrid contracts that mitigate both <b>price</b> <b>escalation</b> and specification volatility.

Coupled with a slowing US economy, regional central banks faced an inevitable monetary policy choice of either addressing higher inflation or supporting moderate growth.

Their causes, however, were a confluence of factors [...] whether cyclical or structural, domestic or global, supply or demand [...] all reinforcing each other and contributing to widespread <b>price</b> <b>escalations</b> in all classes of commodities. In response, a raft of fiscal and administrative measures of questionable effectiveness was widely implemented. Understandably, different economies faced different balance of risks between price stability and growth, but to attribute the causes of inflation to supply shocks alone was misleading and probably explained why many central banks were reluctant and/or slow to raise interest rates.
