30|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} to visualize 3 D objects, such as using <b>polarized</b> <b>lens,</b> active vision, and anaglyph. However, {{some of those}} techniques have certain drawbacks, mainly the special hardware requirements, such as the special display used with the synchronized lens {{in the case of}} active vision and the polarized display in the case of <b>polarized</b> <b>lens.</b> However, the anaglyph technique only requires a pair of spectacles constructed with red and blue filters where the red filter is placed over the left position producing a visual effect of 3 D perception. Anaglyph synthesis is a simple process, in which the red channel of the second image (frame) replaces the red channel in the first image (frame) [2]. In the literature, several methods to compute anaglyphs have been described. One of them is the original Photoshop algorithm [3], where the red channel of the left eye becomes the red channel of the anaglyph and vice versa for the blue and green channels of the right eye. Dubois [4] suggested the least square projection in each color component (R, G, B) from R 6 space to the 3 D subspace. Two principal drawbacks of these algorithms are the presence of ghosting and the loss of color [5].|$|E
40|$|The Rhetoric of Rape: A Critical Mapping of the Discursive Landscape in France {{comprises}} three theoretically distinct, but thematically contiguous essays, each {{of which}} touches upon the highly contentious topic of 'la tournante'. From the expression 'faire tourner', meaning something like 'to hand, or to pass (something) around; to share', the word has taken on an additional, specialized, and more sinister sense: that of gang-rape. In place of the politically <b>polarized</b> <b>lens</b> through which 'la tournante' has been seen, The Rhetoric of Rape offers an alternative set of theoretical, respectively phenomenological (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), linguistic (John Langshaw Austin), and psychoanalytical (Sigmund Freud) perspectives from which the practice and its discursive conditions of possibility — its underlying archaeology — can be mapped.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been interest, in {{computer}} vision research, in the segmentation of images based upon the actual material makeup of the objects or object parts that constitute image regions. The idea is to identify image characteristics {{which can be used}} to predict the material properties of objects that are being imaged. A majority of object surfaces can be simply classified according to their basic electrical properties; metal objects (e. g. Aluminum, Copper) conduct electricity rather well while dielectric objects (e. g. Rubber, Plastic, Ceramic) conduct electricity poorly. Distinguishing image regions according to whether they correspond to metal or dielectric material can provide important information for scene understanding especially in industrial machine vision. One such major application is circuit board inspection where the presence of dielectric or metal material in the wrong place can cause trouble. A previous approach to the problem of identifying metal or dielectric material in images is based upon careful spectral (i. e. color) analysis of reflected light from material objects. This paper presents a technique for identifying the material properties of objects in an image using a <b>polarizing</b> <b>lens</b> (i. e. Polaroid filter). Two images of the same scene are taken with a <b>polarizing</b> <b>lens</b> placed {{in front of a camera}} in two different respective orientations. Effectively these two images represent two linearly independent polarization components of the reflected light. It is shown that when the linearly independent components of polarization are taken parallel and perpendicular with respect to the plane in which specular rays travel that dielectric objects can be distinguished from metallic objects when specular highlights are present. In particular the two polarization components are very similar at specular highlights on metals while the two polarization components for specular highlights on dielectrics are very different, the perpendicular component having much larger magnitude than the parallel component. This is shown to hold regardless of whether the surface is polished or rough. Results for coated surfaces will be presented at a future date...|$|R
50|$|A {{graduated}} {{neutral density filter}} can be {{also used}} to improve the reproduction of the exposure range of the scene, by darkening bright parts of the image. A graduated filter will reduce the extreme highlights of an image, such as a clear, open sky as well as sunlight. The filter is usually an even gradation of neutral gray to clear, covering the top third to half of the filter in gray. Therefore, it mostly affects the top third to half of the frame's exposure, leaving the highlights in the bottom half to two-thirds unaffected. Often these filters are the square gelatin, polycarbonate, or glass type. A mounting kit such as a square frame receptacle mounted to interchangeable screw-in rings will hold the filter at an appropriate orientation. These can be mounted {{to the end of}} an SLR lens camera in the same fashion as a <b>polarizing</b> <b>lens,</b> UV filter, and various other screw-in type filters for SLR and DSLR cameras.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{visualisation}} {{is one of}} {{the requirements}} of cartographic visualisation for geospatial data with chromo-stereoscopy being one of several 3 D systems available. The distinct advantages of chromo-stereoscopy over other techniques, such as <b>Polarized</b> <b>lenses</b> and anaglyph, have led to improvements in its usability through the design of a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows the user to display their own data in both conventional and chromo-stereoscopic systems whilst taking into account cartographic considerations: familiarity, interaction and colour contrast. This software integrates data stream for radar, GNSS, sonar systems and electronic charts and the CS impact. Hence, good understanding of these systems is essential. The first GFG 2 summer school provided a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge about GNSS principles and to meet some experts in that field. And I expect the second summer school will focus on the application side of GNSS. This technical knowledge will be ideal for enhancing my application...|$|R

50|$|Some {{models have}} <b>{{polarized}}</b> <b>lenses,</b> made of Polaroid polarized plastic sheeting, to reduce glare caused by light reflected from non-metallic surfaces {{such as water}} (see Brewster's angle for how this works) {{as well as by}} polarized diffuse sky radiation (skylight). This can be especially useful to see {{beneath the surface of the}} water when fishing.A mirrored coating can be applied to the lens. This mirrored coating deflects some of the light when it hits the lens so that it is not transmitted through the lens, making it useful in bright conditions; however, it does not necessarily reflect UV radiation as well. Mirrored coatings can be made any color by the manufacturer for styling and fashion purposes. The color of the mirrored surface is irrelevant to the color of the lens. For example, a gray lens can have a blue mirror coating, and a brown lens can have a silver coating. Sunglasses of this type are sometimes called mirrorshades. A mirror coating does not get hot in sunlight and it prevents scattering of rays in the lens bulk.|$|R
50|$|The high-resolution, {{digital cinema}} grade video {{projector}} alternately projects right-eye frames and left-eye frames, switching between them 144 times per second. The projector {{is either a}} Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing device or Sony's reflective LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon). A push-pull electro-optical liquid crystal modulator called a ZScreen is placed immediately {{in front of the}} projector <b>lens</b> to alternately <b>polarize</b> each frame. It circularly polarizes the frames clockwise for the right eye and counter-clockwise for the left eye. The audience wears circularly polarized glasses that have oppositely <b>polarized</b> <b>lenses</b> that ensures each eye sees only its designated frame. In RealD Cinema, each frame is projected three times to reduce flicker, a system called triple flash. The source video is usually produced at 24 frames per second per eye (total 48 frames/s), which may result in subtle ghosting and stuttering on horizontal camera movements. A silver screen is used to maintain the light polarization upon reflection and to reduce reflection loss to counter some of the significant light loss due to polarization filter absorption. The result is a 3D picture that seems to extend behind and in front of the screen itself.|$|R
