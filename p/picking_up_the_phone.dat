At first, fans who dialed the phone number found themselves connected to an actual phone located on set. Several fans reported many cast and crew members <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and having live conversations with them (Zach Braff, who plays J.D., accounted for this in his own blog). The phone soon became overloaded with calls, and callers were re-directed to a voice mail message from Turk or Carla announcing that Turk was out, but would {{be back at the}} start of the next season. The voice mail was later changed to one in which Braff promoted his film Garden State. As of December 2006, the message was one of Neil Flynn (who plays the Janitor) advertising for the season premiere of Scrubs. As of February 2007, the message changed to one of Sacred Heart's security guard, Leonard, promoting Scrubs on Comedy Central. As of January 2008, the message is of Doug Murphy (Johnny Kastl), one of the show's supporting characters, promoting the Scrubs blog and podcast. As of July 2008, the message was of the Janitor saying [...] "...this is J.D., I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back immediately. If I don't, feel free to come after me and personally harm me." [...] He then advertises the episode [...] "My Princess". As of April 2009, the message is Dr. Cox advertising the new season on ABC. As of May 2009, when the number is dialed the automatic message [...] "I'm sorry, the number you have called is not in service. Please check the number and dial again," [...] suggesting that the number had been deactivated. As of February 2010, the number reached a message saying that the mailbox was full, suggesting the number had been reconnected. As of 2013 the number belongs to a cell phone that belongs to a private citizen in the Sacramento, California area.|$|E
