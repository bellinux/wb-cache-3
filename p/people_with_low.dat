5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also {{been found to be}} at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E

5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This article {{looks at}} the effect that fear of {{movement}} can have {{on the lives of}} <b>people</b> <b>with</b> chronic <b>low</b> back pain. It describes the experiences of people who were attending a six week work hardening programme as part of their vocational rehabilitation in Sydney, Australia. Method: A thematic content analysis of data collected during an ethnographic study of eleven unemployed participants <b>with</b> chronic <b>low</b> back pain who attended the work hardening programme took place. The analysis focused on the effects of fear of movement on the participants' lives. Findings: The fear of movement impacted on all aspects of the participants' daily occupations and restricted their occupational roles. These changes involved loss of occupational roles, relationship changes, loss of participation in leisure and encountering barriers to returning to paid employment. Conclusions: The findings suggest that fear of movement has a significant effect on all areas of the lives of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> chronic <b>low</b> back pain. Recognizing fear of movement as a barrier will enable health professionals involved in vocational rehabilitation to develop a greater understanding of the context in which <b>people</b> <b>with</b> chronic <b>low</b> back pain live...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEpilepsy is more {{prevalent}} in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> a <b>low</b> IQ than the general population. Up to 1 in 4 <b>people</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy may have a learning disability, yet this group are often under-represented in specialist neurology services. This study examined access and outcomes in epilepsy surgery for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> a <b>low</b> IQ in an audit of 953 patients who have undergone pre-surgical evaluation in our service from 1988 to 2007. We noted {{a significant increase in}} the proportion of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> an IQ of 70 or less who have been evaluated for surgery since the routine introduction of high resolution MRI. However candidates with an IQ of 70 or less remain significantly less likely to proceed to surgery; with only 1 in 4 offered surgery compared to 1 in 2 of the candidates with an IQ greater than 70. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> a <b>low</b> IQ who proceeded to surgery achieved comparable postoperative seizure control to their counterparts with an IQ greater than 70. Our findings suggest that special consideration should be given to candidates who are excluded from surgery primarily on the basis of neuropsychological data, since the necessary specialist protocols and appropriate neuropsychological test norms are not widely available for this population...|$|R

40|$|<b>People</b> <b>with</b> {{high levels}} of narcissism possess {{extremely}} positive self-evaluations that may mask underlying feelings of inferiority and a need for love and acceptance. <b>People</b> <b>with</b> {{high levels of}} narcissism defend their inflated self-evaluations through chronic self-enhancement processes, which can have negative consequences for their relationship functioning. The current research {{examined the effects of}} acceptance affirmation on self-enhancement of <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high and <b>low</b> levels of narcissism. Study 1 found that affirming acceptance reduced self-enhancement on trait ratings for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high (vs. <b>low)</b> narcissism when they had a low need to belong, but the acceptance manipulation increased defensive self-enhancement in <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high (vs. <b>low)</b> narcissism when they had a high need to belong. Study 2 revealed that <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high narcissism self-enhance (i. e., self-serving bias) at the expense of their romantic partners, but this effect is driven by lower relationship commitment and poor recent relationship quality. In addition, <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high (vs. <b>low)</b> narcissism 2 ̆ 7 s love for their romantic partner may be more influenced by situation factors.
