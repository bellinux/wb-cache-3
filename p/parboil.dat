40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{study was}} carried out in northern Ghana to verify the importance of rice <b>parboiling</b> to poverty alleviation. Consumer acceptability and sensory evaluation carried out showed that there was a high correlation between consumer acceptability and sensory attributes developed by a trained panel for both raw and cooked rice. An improved prototype rice <b>parboiling</b> vessel was designed and constructed and this vessel more than doubled the quantity of paddy usually parboiled per batch in northern Ghana. It also reduced fuel and water usage by 50 % and 30 % respectively. Ghanaian consumers preferred imported rice to locally produced parboiled rice. They also preferred parboiled rice that had a clean, translucent and uniform appearance. Percent starch damage, an important quality indicator increased with <b>parboiling</b> intensity. On intense laboratory <b>parboiling,</b> milling yield increased by 7 % over the raw milled sample. Broken grains increased on mild <b>parboiling</b> and only began to decrease when paddy was soaked at 90 °C and steamed for at least 8 minutes. The most intensely parboiled sample had a broken level of 5. 06 %. Water absorption index increased with <b>parboiling</b> intensity. Thiamine content increased linearly with <b>parboiling.</b> Riboflavin however peaked with paddy soaked at 70 °C and steamed for 12 minutes and decreased with further intensification of <b>parboiling.</b> X-ray diffraction pattern of the raw milled sample was the A-type. While the severest laboratory parboiled sample had an A-type pattern, the commercially parboiled sample had a typical V-pattern. The characteristic aroma of Ghanaian parboiled rice is influenced mainly by 2 -decena, 2 -heptenal and acetic acid.

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Parboiling</b> {{is a set}} of {{operations}} needed for the production of a gelatinized product. Scientifically it is a thermal treatment process done on rice and other cereals. Water and heat are two essential elements to transform the natural cereal into “parboiled ” cereal. In rice, it is done to produce gelatinized or parboiled rice. <b>Parboiling,</b> if examined carefully has other scientific benefits beyond easy milling and reducing broken grains. Unfortunately, the technology has received little attention in terms of research as far as food processing or preservation is concern. As part of an ongoing research to assess the extent to which <b>parboiling</b> affect the migration of vitamin B 1, a preliminary survey was conducted between October, 2012 and December, 2012 in the three northern regions of Ghana to elucidate the scientific principles behind the practice and to what extend processors understand these principles. This work also aimed at high lighting the practice so as to encourage people to adapt indigenous technologies which may have more beneficial health effects. Eighty (80) processors in the three northern regions drawn by purposive sampling methods were interviewed using structured and semi structured questionnaires. The results showed that 100 % of the people engaged in <b>parboiling</b> business are women with over 70 % of them having no formal education and therefore are unaware of any effects of <b>parboiling</b> on nutritional elements. It became clear that <b>parboiling</b> increased the flavour and taste of the rice thus making it attractive to eat. However, the respondents only mentioned less broken grains, easy dehusking, ease of cooking, increase quantity, better prices, and <b>parboiling</b> being a norm as some of the reasons why they carry out rice <b>parboiling.</b> From the outcome of this survey it’s recommended more studies be done on the subject to ascertain the nutritional impact of the practice.

Current research efforts seek {{to explore the}} potential of <b>parboiling</b> to improve nutrient delivery. This study investigates factors that affect iron transfer into the kernel endosperm via <b>parboiling</b> by evaluating the impact of varied milling durations, iron concentrations in the soaking water, and <b>parboiling</b> conditions upon iron penetration into the rice kernel. Long-grain rice grown in Arkansas was parboiled as rough, brown, and milled rice under various soaking and steaming temperature conditions. Visual quality of the milled parboiled rice was evaluated using a colorimeter utilizing the L* a* b* color scale. Compositional analyses quantified the impact of <b>parboiling</b> conditions upon the iron content of various rice kernel components. This work demonstrates that hull and bran layers of the rice kernel act {{as a barrier to}} iron uptake via <b>parboiling</b> fortification. Hybrid CL XL 745 and pureline Diamond rice cultivars exhibited differences in iron uptake and response to <b>parboiling</b> conditions. <b>Parboiling</b> brown and milled rice resulted in increased fortification efficiency compared to rice parboiled in the rough rice form. Parboiled conditions (soaking temperature and inclusion of a steaming step) were critical determinants of iron penetration into the rice kernel and of parboiled rice color. Milling studies indicated that iron fortificants primarily deposit in the external kernel layers. Optimization of this fortification method may be particularly advantageous in regions of the world where rice is a staple crop and where it represents a major source of daily caloric intake.

40|$|Rice color {{changes from}} white to amber during <b>parboiling</b> (soaking and steaming). Color {{parameters}} indicated that, during soaking, yellow bran pigments leached {{out in the}} water. The levels of the Maillard precursors (i. e., reducing sugars (RS) and free alpha-amino nitrogen (FAN)) depended on soaking temperature and time: leaching of RS was compensated by enzymic formation for long soaking times (> 60 min), while proteolytic activity was too low to compensate for FAN leaching. Rice soaking under nitrogen, oxygen, or ambient conditions and determination of polyphenol oxidase activity allowed us {{to conclude that the}} effect of enzymic color changes on the soaked rice color was rather small. Color measurements of brown and milled mildly, intermediately, and severely parboiled rice samples showed that both brown and milled rice samples were darker and more red and yellow after <b>parboiling</b> and that the effect depended on the severity of <b>parboiling</b> conditions. Furthermore, steaming affected the rice color more and in a way opposite to that observed in soaking. The changes in RS and the loss of FAN during <b>parboiling</b> suggested that Maillard type reactions occur during brown rice steaming. Analyses of furosine levels confirmed Maillard browning of outer bran layers and endosperm during steaming. The level of this Maillard indicator increased with the severity of <b>parboiling</b> conditions in both brown and milled parboiled rice.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{steaming}} conditions (mild, intermediate and severe) during <b>parboiling</b> of five different long-grain rice cultivars (brown rice cultivars Puntal, Cocodrie, XL 8 and Jacinto, {{and a red}} rice) on rice colour, and Maillard precursors and indicators was investigated. Rice colour increased with severity of <b>parboiling</b> conditions. Redness increased more than yellowness when <b>parboiling</b> brown rice. <b>Parboiling</b> turned red rice black. It changed the levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Losses of the non-reducing sugar, sucrose were caused by both leaching into the soaking water and enzymic conversion, rather than by thermal degradation during steaming. Concentrations of the reducing sugars, glucose and fructose, in intermediately parboiled rice were {{higher than those of}} mildly parboiled rice. After severe <b>parboiling,</b> glucose levels were lower than those of intermediately parboiled rice, while fructose levels were higher. These changes were ascribed to the sum of losses in the Maillard reaction (MR), formations as a result of starch degradation and isomerisation of glucose into fructose. It was clear that the epsilon-amino group of protein-bound lysine was more affected by <b>parboiling</b> conditions and loss in MRs, than that of free lysine. Low values of the MR indicators furosine and free 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde (HMF) in processed brown and red rices were related to mild <b>parboiling,</b> whereas high furosine and low free HMF levels were indicative of rices being subjected to intermediate processing conditions. High furosine and high free HMF contents corresponded to severe hydrothermal treatments. The strong correlation (r = 0. 89) between the free HMF levels and the increase in redness of parboiled brown rices suggested that Maillard browning was reflected more in the red than in the yellow colour.

Freshly harvested and aged RoyJ, a pureline, and CL XL 745, a hybrid, from 2014 and 2015 crop years were soaked at 8 C, 4 C below onset gelatinization temperature (GT), at onset GT, or 4 C above GT for 3 h, and steamed at 100 C, 110 C, or 120 C for 10, 15, or 20 min prior to gentle drying and then characterization. RoyJ had a greater amylose content and a lower protein content than CL XL 745 for both crop years. Regardless of <b>parboiling</b> conditions, CL XL 745 had lower percentages of deformed kernels, greater head rice yields, lower water absorption, and greater cooked rice hardness than RoyJ, which was attributed to its greater protein content. After <b>parboiling,</b> both cultivars displayed increased head rice yield, breaking force, water absorption, and cooked rice hardness, and reduced deformed kernels and soluble solids in 2014 than in 2015.
