40|$|Abstract / Public service {{media are}} no longer limited to radio and {{television}} as new media genres emerge. Among others, the online medium has supplemented radio, television and the press since the mid- 1990 s {{and has become a}} medium in its own right. Moreover, online media have become essential elements of media consumption patterns. Public service media compete not only with private radio and television broadcasters but also with the press. The question arises, whether such competition in the online field results in more diversity and higher output quality, serving the public interest better. In Europe, {{there are at least two}} different schools of thought. One line of argument accepts the public service expansion into online media and regards online media as a necessary and important field for public service activities. Another line of argument suggests limiting the <b>public</b> service <b>remit</b> strictly to radio and broadcasting and considers online media as an emerging market subject to competition among private companies only. Based on the results of a compara-tive empirical analysis of online media provided by public service broadcasters and print publishers in Switzerland, Germany and Austria (from 2006) this article shows that the achieved results in media output are disappointing. Only few online media live up to the expectations. The article finally argues that the extension of the <b>public</b> service <b>remit</b> to online media might enhance quality and diversity...|$|R

5000|$|Sunday Life was a British magazine/discussion {{television}} programme broadcast on Sundays on BBC One beginning 20 April 2008. It was presented by Louise Minchin and Colin Jackson.

50|$|In the UK, {{religious}} television operates {{differently from}} the US. Most religious stations transmit via direct-to-home satellite, some, are streamed live via the Internet or, like TBN, broadcast 24 hours on terrestrial Freeview. The BBC and ITV broadcast religious programmes, such as Songs of Praise and Highway, {{as part of their}} <b>public</b> service <b>remit.</b> The 2009 Ofcom report found that religious broadcasting on public service channels was watched on average for 2.3 hours per year per viewer on the main PSB channels in 2011, 2.7 hours in 2008, reducing steadily from 3.2 in 2006 and 3.6 in 2001. In 2006, 5% of viewers found religious broadcasting to be of personal importance.|$|R

This resulted in departmental restructuring and a number of job losses in the BBC. The Trust requested that the BBC management prepare a fresh proposal, including how the BBC should deliver its Charter obligation — promoting formal education and learning, whilst meeting the online needs of school age children.|$|R

40|$|Regarding the {{situation}} of docudrama on French television over the last twenty years, {{we can say that}} the choice of the genre, the frequency with which it is used and the subject-matters to which it is applied largely depend on the broadcasting channel, on the chosen time slot and on whether the producer intends to entertain, inform or provoke. As far as privately-owned channels are concerned, very often, the purpose of docudrama is to attract a large audience and to compete with public service channels over the fulfilling of the <b>public</b> service <b>remits.</b> This paper explores the following topics: the televisual environment, docudrama and the treatment of History, but also of controversial political issues and trial by media...|$|R

25|$|Sky News {{objected to}} the {{breaking}} of its monopoly, complaining about {{the costs associated with}} running a channel that only a minority could view from the licence fee. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the European Commission ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the licence fee should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the <b>public</b> service <b>remit</b> of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.|$|R
40|$|Cybersecurity {{tends to}} be viewed as a highly dynamic, {{continually}} evolving technology race between attacker and defender. However, economic theory suggests that in many cases doing "nothing" is the optimal strategy when substantial fixed adjustment costs are present. Indeed, the authors' anecdotal experience as chief information security officers indicates that uncertain costs that might be incurred by rapid adoption of security updates substantially delay the application of recommended security controls, so the industry does appear to understand this economic aspect quite well. From a policy perspective, the inherently discontinuous adjustment path taken by firms can cause difficulties in determining the most effective <b>public</b> policy <b>remit</b> and the effectiveness of any enacted policies ex post.
