The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that <b>perhaps</b> <b>Our</b> Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked {{into the night sky}} and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E
25|$|The first {{uniform of}} the corps was a grey tunic with green facings, and a peaked cap with cock's feathers; in 1863 this was changed for a green uniform with red facings, similar to that worn by the 60th Rifles, with the {{exception}} of a broad red stripe on the trousers. The trouser stripe was done away with in 1875, when also the cap and feathers gave place to the busby and glengarry, the latter in 1884 being exchanged for the regulation army helmet, and soon <b>perhaps</b> <b>our</b> boys will all be seen in scarlet like their brothers of the Staffordshire battalions. The annual balls did not become popular, the last taking place in 1864; bazaars were held 14–17 October 1863, and 24–27 October 1876; athletic displays had been given (the first in May 1865).|$|E

It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO not get equal treatment. Equal treatment— no more, no less— is what we want!

2500|$|... "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] {{provided}} feminists {{the tools}} {{on how to}} interpret literature in different ways. Lanser says the short story was a [...] "particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision [...] [...] [...] because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall". The narrator in the story {{is trying to find}} a single meaning in the wallpaper. [...] At first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is [...] "flamboyant" [...] while also [...] "dull", [...] "pronounced" [...] yet also [...] "lame" [...] and [...] "uncertain" [...] (p.13). [...] She takes into account the patterns and tries to geometrically organize them, but she is further confused. [...] The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor which Jane cannot recognize (p.25). At night the narrator is able to see a woman behind bars within the complicated design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that Jane was able to find [...] "a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection". Lanser creates a relationship between the narrator and the reader. Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find one single meaning. [...] "How we were taught to read" [...] as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text. The patriarchal ideology has kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper." [...] Thanks to feminist criticism, [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] has become a fundamental reading in the standard curriculum. Feminists have made a great contribution to the study of literature but, according to Lanser, are falling short because [...] "we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then <b>perhaps</b> <b>our</b> own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.|$|E
