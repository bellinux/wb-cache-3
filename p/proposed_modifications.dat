5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his <b>proposed</b> <b>modifications,</b> Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency of single-objective {{optimization}} can {{be improved}} by introducing some auxiliary objectives. Ideally, auxiliary objectives should be helpful. However, in practice, objectives may be efficient on some optimization stages but obstructive on others. In this paper we <b>propose</b> a <b>modification</b> of the EA+RL method which dynamically selects optimized objectives using reinforcement learning. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> prevents from losing the best found solution. We analysed the <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> and compared it with the EA+RL method and Random Local Search on XdivK, Generalized OneMax and LeadingOnes problems. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> outperforms the EA+RL method on all problem instances. It also outperforms the single objective approach on the most problem instances. We also provide detailed analysis of how different components of the considered algorithms influence efficiency of optimization. In addition, we present theoretical analysis of the <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> on the XdivK problem.

The province paid the $25 million construction cost for the alpine skiing facility on Mount Allan, about an hour west of Calgary.

40|$|Subject of Research. We {{propose to}} modify the EA+RL method, which {{increases}} efficiency of evolutionary algorithms by means of auxiliary objectives. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> is compared to the existing objective selection methods on the example of travelling salesman problem. Method. In the EA+RL method a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to select an objective – the target objective {{or one of the}} auxiliary objectives – at each iteration of the single-objective evolutionary algorithm. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> of the EA+RL method adopts this approach for the usage with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. As opposed to theEA+RL method, in this modification one of the auxiliary objectives is selected by reinforcement learning and optimized together with the target objective at each step of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Main Results. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> of the EA+RL method was compared to the existing objective selection methods on the example of travelling salesman problem. In the EA+RL method and its <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> reinforcement learning algorithms for stationary and non-stationary environment were used. The <b>proposed</b> <b>modification</b> of the EA+RL method applied with reinforcement learning for non-stationary environment outperformed the considered objective selection algorithms on the most problem instances. Practical Significance. The proposed approach increases efficiency of evolutionary algorithms, which may be used for solving discrete NP-hard optimization problems.
