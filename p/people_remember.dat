5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment that few <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly was impressive.|$|E

25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when people look at scary faces, or remember traumatic events. Research has also shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday afternoons at 3pm, between May and October, Rosary processions are held. These are {{traditionally}} attended {{by thousands of}} visitors. The rosary {{is led by the}} parish priest, a tradition started by Fr. Taylor and carried on by his successor, Fr. George Mullen (later Canon George Mullen). The priest would stand on the parapet of the Glass Chapel, from which a clear view could be obtained, both of the Grotto itself and of the movement of the procession along the shrine's gravel paths. Each Sunday procession culminated in Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the upper Glass Chapel. Many local <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> the discomfort of kneeling in the gravel as children, at the moment of adoration in the Benediction service.|$|E

It was a dire period, the cold war, as some <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> it. It was under the threat of nuclear annihilation.

500|$|Describing {{the general}} {{tone of the}} show, Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald {{explains}} that [...] "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." [...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." ...|$|E
500|$|Clooney and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel used various {{techniques}} when {{portraying the}} different decades of Barris's life. [...] "We thought {{in order to}} go back in time, most <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> things through film," [...] Clooney reasoned. [...] "I don't remember the 1950s [...] I wasn't around for them [...] I know the 50s through Technicolor. Not Technicolor as it was shot, but Technicolor as it has faded now." [...] The filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on the color palette. Racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in the 1960s, similar to the Spaghetti Westerns of that era. Hand-held cameras were used for scenes set in the 1970s, an homage to the films of Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols and Alan J. Pakula, primarily Klute (1971), Carnal Knowledge (1971), and The Parallax View (1974). Bob Fosse's All That Jazz also influenced Clooney's direction.|$|E

500|$|Complex {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, writing {{that it was}} overshadowed by [...] "Leave It to Beaver", {{but that it was}} also a good episode by itself as well. [...] " [...] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. <b>People</b> <b>remember</b> who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the vast stores of {{information}} made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a Wall Street Journal business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long [...] "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was [...] "like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.|$|E

500|$|The {{humor of}} the show comes from the [...] "disparity" [...] between the [...] "cute" [...] {{appearance}} of the characters and their [...] "crude" [...] behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't <b>people</b> <b>remember</b> what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." [...] Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show [...] "constantly plays on its grade-school aesthetic for shock value, with great success", arguing that at its height, it is [...] "more a profane 'Peanuts' than a downsized 'Beavis and Butt-Head.'" [...] He points, for example, to Kenny, who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass, which is eliminated in each episode. Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that [...] "The show captures that mix of innocence and viciousness that can co-exist in kids that age", that [...] "the boys are fascinated by bodily functions", and that they [...] "mimic adult behavior and language". For example, Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to [...] "make sweet love down by the fire", a phrase he learns from Chef. In a light-hearted study of the humor of flatulence, Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Simpsons, and Beavis and Butt-Head. Beginning with [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", South Park builds on this tradition.|$|E
