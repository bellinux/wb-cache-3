2500|$|In France, {{both the}} Criminal Code and the Labor Code are {{relevant}} to the issue of sexual harassment. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described sexual harassment as [...] "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors of a sexual nature". Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the [...] (French Supreme Court) quashed the definition of the criminal code as being too vague. The 2012 decision resulted from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality. As a consequence of this decision, all <b>pending</b> <b>procedures</b> before criminal courts were cancelled. Several feminist NGOs, such as AFVT, criticized this decision. President François Hollande, the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira) and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem) asked that a new law be voted rapidly. As a result, LOI n°2012-954 du 6 août 2012 was voted in, providing a new definition. In addition to criminal provisions, the French Labor code also prohibits sexual harassment. The legislator voted a law in 2008 that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive definition without modifying the French Labour Code.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{described}} a novel technique for semen collection in large psittacines (patent <b>pending),</b> a <b>procedure</b> {{which was not}} routinely possible before. For the first time, a large set of semen samples is now available for analysis {{as well as for}} artificial insemination. Semen samples of more than 100 psittacine taxa were collected and analysed; data demonstrate large differences in the spermatological parameters between families, indicating an ecological relationship with breeding behaviour (polygamous versus monogamous birds). Using semen samples for artificial insemination resulted in the production of offspring in various families, such as Macaws and Cockatoos, for the first time ever. The present technique represents a breakthrough in species conservation programs and will enable future research into the ecology and environmental factors influencing endangered species...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{provision}} of information before medical or surgical procedures should improve knowledge and allay anxiety about the <b>pending</b> <b>procedure.</b> This trial aimed to assess {{the value of an}} information video in this process. METHODS: Patients scheduled to undergo colonoscopy were approached about 1 week before the procedure. All patients were given an information leaflet about colonoscopy, and completed a Spielberger state anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire to assess baseline anxiety. The patients were then randomly assigned to watch or not watch the information video. Immediately before colonoscopy, all patients completed a second anxiety questionnaire and a knowledge questionnaire. FINDINGS: 198 patients were screened. 31 declined to participate and 17 were unable to complete the forms. Of the remaining 150 patients, 72 were assigned the video, and 78 no video. The groups were similar with regard to age, sex, educational attainment, and initial anxiety score. Female patients had higher baseline anxiety than male patients (mean STAI 46. 3 [95 % CI 44. 9 - 47. 7] vs 36. 9 [35. 5 - 38. 3]; difference 9. 4 [7. 8 - 12. 2], p= 0. 0008). Patients who had not had a previous colonoscopy had higher baseline anxiety scores than those who had prior experience of the procedure (46. 9 [45. 4 - 48. 5] vs 36. 3 [34. 7 - 37. 9]; difference 10. 6 [7. 5 - 13. 8], p= 0. 0008). Patients who watched the video were significantly less anxious before colonoscopy than those who did not. The former also scored more highly in the knowledge questionnaire than the latter with regard to the purpose of the procedure, procedural details, and potential complications of colonoscopy. INTERPRETATION: An information video increases knowledge and decreases anxiety in patients preparing for colonoscopy. Andrew Luck, Sue Pearson, Guy Maddem, Peter Hewet...|$|R

50|$|His {{relationship}} with the United States proved difficult. In his early years, Duvalier rebuked the United States for its friendly relations with Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo (assassinated in 1961) while ignoring Haiti. The Kennedy administration (1961-1963) was particularly disturbed by Duvalier’s repressive and authoritarian rule and allegations that he misappropriated aid money—at the time {{a substantial part of}} the Haitian budget—and a U.S. Marine Corps mission to train the Tonton Macoute. The U.S. thus halted most of its economic assistance in mid-1962, <b>pending</b> stricter accounting <b>procedures,</b> with which Duvalier refused to comply. Duvalier publicly renounced all aid from Washington on nationalist grounds, portraying himself as a “principled and lonely opponent of domination by a great power”.|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the main}} factors causing ecosystem stability and the existence of several ecosystem functions. In consequence, species richness can be a reliable state variable, useful to assess an ecosystem status or to identify highly valuable areas in a landscape. Here we present two applications in which species richness assessment allowed respectively the boundaries redesign of a part of the Natura 2000 network and an ex-post BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) assessment as enforced by an infringement procedure for action against Article 4 of the Birds Directive. In the first case study, the boundaries of 16 Natura 2000 sites were redefined, identifying genuine scientific errors and expunging low species richness areas and incorporating high biodiversity areas whose value was not possible to assess when the sites were instituted. The overall balance involved a minimal surface area change (+ 1. 5 % SPAs, + 1. 6 % SCIs) but a net gain in high quality habitats in the redesigned sites network. The second case presents a small scale a posteriori impact assessment, where an exact quantification of habitat and species loss allowed not only reporting the European Commission as requested, but also to individuate a new Natural Reserve with identical ecological traits as measure of compensation, positively resolving the <b>pending</b> infringement <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

40|$|What {{happens when}} there is a tolling motion under Rule 3 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate <b>Procedure</b> <b>pending</b> before a trial court and a {{subsequent}} notice of appeal is filed? As the case law currently stands, depending on which of three tolling motions is pending, the trial court may be divested of jurisdiction to rule on the motion - a divestiture that could lead the appellate court to dismiss the appeal as untimely. This Article argues that the North Carolina courts have drawn arbitrary distinctions between the different tolling motions to determine whether a trial court is divested of jurisdiction. Instead, the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure should be amended to conform with the approach laid out in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, in which a trial court retains jurisdiction over a tolling motion even after a notice of appeal is filed and the notice of appeal does not become effective until there is an order disposing of the tolling motion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background. Sentinel {{lymph node}} {{sampling}} may be studied profitably in series {{of patients with}} 1 tumor type, such as breast carcinoma, in 1 anatomic locale. The present work analyzes the efficacy of sentinel node sampling in a pathologi-cally diverse group of lesions from an anatomically diverse region such as {{the head and neck}}; however, there are risks con-flating the findings in different tumors with radically different behaviors, in the process producing muddled data. This report reviews the head and neck experience with sentinel sampling and concludes that certain tumor types that have a known pro-pensity for aggressive behavior are the best candidates for trials employing sentinel node sampling; candidates include many cu-taneous melanomas of the head and neck, oropharyngeal squa-mous carcinomas, and selected thyroid carcinomas. Despite the growing popularity of sentinel node sampling in a variety of regions of the body, however, at this juncture this technique remains an investigational <b>procedure,</b> <b>pending</b> demonstration of a tangible improvement in patient outcome through its use. It is recommended that studies of the efficacy of this technique strive, whenever possible, to segregate results of different tumor types in different head and neck locales from one another so as to produce more focused findings for discrete types of malig-nancies, and not group together tumor types that may in reality exhibit different biological behaviors.

For example, the water flea Daphnia magna was exposed to Bt maize pollen and the measurement of [...] "no effects" [...] was judged as [...] "no risk" [...] although the Bt toxin contained in the pollen will not dissolve {{in the water and}} Daphnia cannot eat pollen. Similarly [...] "no effect" [...] results with the earthworm Eisenia fetida were accepted although there was no proof that the worms actually had taken up the toxin in the feeding trials. Apart from questionable test designs, it is known that, for example, the widely used earthworm Eisenia fetida does not live in agricultural ecosystems [33]. The criticism on using environmentally irrelevant organisms and ill-designed tests added to the existing uncertainty on how to measure [...] "indirect effects", e.g. the effects of the herbicides used together with herbicide tolerant crops, as demanded by the legal framework, {{how to deal with the}} foreseeable EU-wide use of antibiotic marker genes in foodstuff made out of GM crops containing these transgenes and how to evaluate the research work pointing to considerable gene flow in GM canola [34].

40|$|BackgroundEsophagectomy {{has been}} the {{traditional}} therapy for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma. New endoscopic approaches allow treatment of these lesions with esophageal preservation. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the outcome of endoscopic therapy with esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer. MethodsA retrospective review was performed of all patients treated for high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma from 2001 to April 2010. ResultsEndoscopic therapy was performed in 40 patients (high-grade dysplasia =  22, intramucosal cancer =  18) and esophagectomy in 61 patients (high-grade dysplasia =  13, intramucosal cancer =  48). Endotherapy consisted of 102 endoscopic resections and 79 mucosal ablations (median 3 interventions per patient). In the endotherapy group, intramucosal cancer was completely resected in all patients. At last assessment, 10 patients have been converted to intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia and 21 to no residual intestinal metaplasia. Five patients have follow-up biopsy <b>procedures</b> <b>pending</b> after recent ablation, and esophagectomy was performed in 3 patients for failed endotherapy. A laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been performed in 8 patients after eradication of intestinal metaplasia. Esophagectomy resected the mucosal disease with negative margins in all patients. Compared with esophagectomy, endotherapy was associated with significantly lower morbidity (39 % vs 0; P < . 0001) and similar survival (94 % at 3 years in both groups; median follow-up 34  months after esophagectomy vs 17 months after endotherapy; P = . 0026). ConclusionsEndoscopic therapy for high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal cancer has lower morbidity than an esophagectomy and similar survival during short-term follow-up, but required multiple procedures in most patients. Both therapies are appropriate options, but preservation of the esophagus allows the option of a fundoplication for reflux control, perhaps further improving long-term quality of life...|$|R
40|$|The Hispaniola Island, in the Caribbean {{tropical}} zone, {{is prone}} to extreme flood events. Floods are caused by tropical springs and hurricanes and may lead to human losses, economical damages, and spreading of waterborne diseases. Flood studies based upon hydrological and hydraulic modelling are hampered by almost complete lack of hydro-meteorological data. Thenceforth, and given the cost and complexity {{in the organization of}} field measurement campaigns, the need for exploitation of remote sensing data, and open source data bases. We present here a feasibility study to explore the potential of (i) high-resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs) from remote imagery and (ii) remotely sensed precipitation data, to feed hydrological flow routing and hydraulic flood modelling, applied to the case study of river La Quinte closed to Gonaives (585  km 2), Haiti. We studied one recent flood episode, namely hurricane Ike in 2008, when flood maps from remote sensing were available for validation. The atmospheric input given by hourly rainfall was taken from downscaled Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) daily estimates, and subsequently fed to a semi-distributed DEM-based hydrological model, providing an hourly flood hydrograph. Then, flood modelling using Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS 1 D, one-dimensional model for unsteady open channel flow) was carried out under different scenarios of available digital elevation models. The DEMs were generated using optical remote sensing satellite WorldView- 1 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), combined with information from an open source database (OpenStreetMap). Observed flood extent and land use have been extracted using Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre- 4 (SPOT- 4) imagery. The hydraulic model was tuned for floodplain friction against the observed flooded area. We compared different scenarios of flood simulation and the predictive power given by model tuning. Our study provides acceptable results in depicting flooded areas, especially considering the tremendous lack of ground data, and shows the potential of hydrological modelling approach fed by remote sensing information in Haiti, and in similarly data-scarce areas. Our approach may be useful to provide depiction of flooded areas for the purpose of (i) flood design for urban planning under a frequency-driven approach and (ii) forecasting of flooded areas for warning <b>procedures,</b> <b>pending</b> availability of weather forecast with proper lead time...|$|R
