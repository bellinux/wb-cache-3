40|$|This paper {{describes}} a FEM based approach aimed {{to investigate the}} effects of lead and profile modifications in combination with machining and assembly deviations on meshing characteristics of helical gears.

The approach has been validated with experimental data and its application is illustrated through sample case studies.

40|$|Pregnancy is {{characterized}} by a complexity of metabolic processes that may impact fetal development and ultimately, infant health outcomes. However, our understanding of whole body maternal and fetal metabolism during this critical life stage remains incomplete. The objective {{of this study is to}} utilize metabolomics to <b>profile</b> <b>longitudinal</b> patterns of fasting maternal metabolites among a cohort of non-diabetic, healthy pregnant women in order to advance our understanding of changes in protein and lipid concentrations across gestation, the biochemical pathways by which they are metabolized and to describe variation in maternal metabolites between ethnic groups. Among 160 pregnant women, amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, keto-bodies and non-esterified fatty acids were detected by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, while polar lipids were detected through flow-injected mass spectrometry. The maternal plasma concentration of several essential and non-essential amino acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins significantly decreased across pregnancy. Concentrations of several TCA intermediates increase as pregnancy progresses, as well as the keto-body β-hydroxybutyrate. Ratios of specific acylcarnitines used as indicators of metabolic pathways suggest a decreased beta-oxidation rate and increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 enzyme activity with advancing gestation. Decreasing amino acid concentrations likely reflects placental uptake and tissue biosynthesis. The absence of any increase in plasma non-esterified fatty acids is unexpected in the catabolic phase of later pregnancy and may reflect enhanced placental fatty acid uptake and utilization for fetal tissue growth. While it appears that energy production through the TCA cycle increases as pregnancy progresses, decreasing patterns of free carnitine and acetylcarnitine as well as increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 rate and β-hydroxybutyrate levels suggest a concomitant upregulation of ketogenesis to ensure sufficient energy supply in the fasting state. Several differences in metabolomic profiles between Hispanic and non-Hispanic women demonstrate phenotypic variations in prenatal metabolism which should be considered in future studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{previously}} reported observation of anomalous eastward gravity wave forcing at mesopause heights around {{the onset of}} the January 2013 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) over Trondheim, Norway (63 ° N, 10 ° E), is placed in a global perspective using Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) temperature observations from the Aura satellite. It is shown that this anomalous forcing results in a clear cooling over Trondheim about 10 km below mesopause heights. Conversely, near the mesopause itself, where the gravity wave forcing was measured, observations with meteor radar, OH airglow and MLS show no distinct cooling. Polar cap zonal mean temperatures show a similar vertical <b>profile.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> variability in the high northern-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) is characterized by a quasi-stationary wave- 1 structure, which reverses phase at altitudes below ~ 0. 1 hPa. This wave- 1 develops prior to the SSW onset, and starts to propagate westward at the SSW onset. The latitudinal pole-to-pole temperature structure associated with the major SSW shows a warming (cooling) in the winter stratosphere (mesosphere) which extends to about 40 ° N. In the stratosphere, a cooling extending over the equator and far into the summer hemisphere is observed, whereas in the mesosphere an equatorial warming is noted. In the Southern Hemisphere mesosphere, a warm anomaly overlaying a cold anomaly is present, which is shown to propagate downward in time. This observed structure is in accordance with the temperature perturbations predicted by the proposed interhemispheric coupling mechanism for cases of increased winter stratospheric planetary wave activity, of which major SSWs are an extreme case. These results provide observational evidence for the interhemispheric coupling mechanism, and for the wave-mean flow interaction believed to be responsible for the establishment of the anomalies in the summer hemisphere...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{was based on}} the hypothesis that the stochastic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile</b> of a flexible pavement by the stimulation of lorries' self-frequencies leads to irregular wheel load that causes an increase of amplitude in the area of self-frequency. Nine test sections of federal highways and provincial roads were identified as roads with pregnant corrugated deformation in their <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile.</b> The highway assessment made in three measurement cycles contained the recording of <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse <b>profiles,</b> bearing capacity measurements and visual assessments. In addition core samples were taken and exploratory excavations had been made to characterise the different pavements. The comparative graphic evaluation of the unevenness of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> by a moving average of a length of 10 m with the bearing capacity <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> {{as a result of the}} deflections in the centre of load leads to the following theses: Two of nine test sections showed tight relation between the unevenness <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile</b> and the bearing capacity <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile.</b> Comparing both profiles in one case there was a congenial in the other case a contrary development. Five of the remaining seven test sections showed that relationship too but in shorter terms; there were also congenial and contrary developments. The following attempts to prove the apparently particularly existing relations in some characteristics between the uneven and the bearing capacity <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> in a mathematical way could not bring a satisfactory result. Due to the importance of the examined relationship for highway assessment and its analysis exploration should continue in a modified way. Therefore the exploration based on a wide range of test sections should contain nondestructive tests to examine the different layer thicknesses beside the highway assessment of unevenness and bearing capacity <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Purpose. Obtaining {{suitable}} {{indicators for}} profile track classification (combining {{a diversity of}} its individual elements) to enhance the bandwidth of plots. Methodology. Analysis was done with polygon profiles. Rectified profile of each plot was grouped by the steepness of the elements within the increment of 1 - 2 ‰. For each plot was determined magnitude of the estimated rise and medium-sized rise on the working part of the <b>profile.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> profiles were classified into four types by {{the magnitude of the}} proportion of light elements profile and estimated rises. Classification criteria are given for these four types of profiles with additional breakdown of each type into subgroups depending on the magnitude of the estimated rise. Findings. Researches proved that the maximum speed increasing on falls reduces the magnitude of the average fall and increases the proportion of the working profile. To test the proposed classification of profiles juxtaposition of freight trains time motion, calculated for real plots and by the corresponding typical profiles was carried out. Originality. Simplifying the calculations significantly, prevailing methods for assess profile track do not provide the full and accurate representation of the actual character impact of profile track at important tractional-operational and operational indicators. Conventional schemes do not accurately reflect the actual structure of track profiles, and therefore the use of them for concrete calculations can lead to wrong conclusions. Therefore, this classification of longitudinal profiles of the railway network becomes more important, which allow refer railway lines to a particular class upon longitudinal profile on the base of simple classifications marks and therefore use the tractional-operational calculations made for typical profiles in respect of certain lines. Practical value. Grouping of all explored plots by magnitude of average rise in the working part of the profile and analysis of the profile structure that is relevant to average rise, revealed that the proposed value of k is a simple, stable and specific indicator for the classification of the profile plot. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explain the}} force balance in flowing marine ice sheets {{and the ice}} shelves they often feed. Treating ice as a viscous shear-thinning power law fluid, we develop an {{asymptotic}} (late-time) theory in two cases - {{the presence or absence}} of contact with sidewalls. The solution without sidewalls is a simple generalisation of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363), allowing us to obtain the equilibrium grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and to get an analytic approximation. For laterally confined shelves, we obtain an asymptotic theory valid for long shelves and define when this is. Our theory is based on the velocity profile across the channel being a generalised version of Poiseuille flow, which works when lateral shear dominates the force balance. We conducted experiments using a laboratory model for ice. This was an aqueous suspension of 0. 5 % mass concentration xanthan, yielding n ≈ 3. 8 (similar to ice). Our theories agreed extremely well with our experiments for all relevant parameters (front position, thickness profile, lateral velocity <b>profile,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> velocity gradient and grounding line thickness). This strongly suggests that we have understood the dominant force balance in both types of ice shelf. In the real world, ice tongues are unlikely to rapidly disintegrate but can be shortened until they no longer exist, at which point the sheet becomes unstable and ultimately the grounding line should retreat above sea level. Prior to that point, the flow of ice into it should not be speeded up and the grounding line should also not retreat, assuming that only oceanic conditions change. However, laterally confined ice shelves experience significant buttressing. If removed, this leads to a rapid speedup of the sheet and a much smaller equilibrium grounding line thickness. Something similar may have occurred to the Larsen B ice shelf. Comment: 37 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables.

Treating ice as a viscous shear-thinning power law fluid, we develop an asymptotic (late-time) theory in two cases: {{the presence or absence of}} contact with sidewalls. Most real-world situations fall somewhere between the two extreme cases considered. The solution when sidewalls are absent is a fairly simple generalization of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363). In this case, we obtain the equilibrium grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and have an analytic approximation. For shelves in contact with sidewalls, we obtain an asymptotic theory valid for long shelves. We determine when this is. Our theory is based on the velocity profile across the channel being a generalized version of Poiseuille flow, which works when lateral shear dominates the force balance. We conducted experiments using a laboratory model for ice. This was a suspension of xanthan in water, at a concentration of 0. 5 % by mass. The model has n ≈ 3. 8, similar to that of ice. Our theories agreed extremely well with our experiments for all relevant parameters (front position, thickness profile, lateral velocity <b>profile,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> velocity gradient and grounding line thickness). We also saw detailed features similar to natural systems. Thus, we believe we have understood the dominant force balance in both types of ice shelf. Combining our understanding of the forces in the system with a basic model for basal melting and iceberg formation, we uncovered some instabilities of the natural system. Laterally confined ice shelves can rapidly disintegrate but ice tongues cannot. However, ice tongues can be shortened until they no longer exist, at which point the sheet becomes unstable and ultimately the grounding line should retreat above sea level. While the ice tongue still exists, the flow of ice into it should not be speeded up and the grounding line should also not retreat, assuming that only conditions in the ocean change. However, laterally confined ice shelves experience significant buttressing. If removed, this leads to a rapid speed-up of the sheet and a new equilibrium grounding line thickness.

40|$|Understanding {{downstream}} {{transitions in}} river character and behavior {{is a basic}} concept in fluvial geomorphology. Downstream patterns of depositional processes can be differentiated between channel and floodplain components. In this study a generic set of methods is used to analyze floodplain initiation and continuity in relation to downstream changes in total stream power (slope and discharge) and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile</b> form for river courses in the upper Hunter catchment, Australia. Absolute values of these controlling factors are shown to be poor indicators of threshold conditions at which floodplains begin to form along river courses. Catchment-scale patterns of stream power and the form of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> provide better predictors of this transitional zone. The total stream power plot derived along <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> represented by a second-order exponential curve has a bimodal pattern.

40|$|Progradational fluvio-deltaic systems tend towards but cannot reach equilibrium, a {{state in}} which the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile</b> does not change shape and all {{sediment}} is bypassed beyond the shoreline. They cannot reach equilibrium because progradation of the shoreline requires aggradation along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile.</b> Therefore progradation provides a negative feedback, unless relative sea level falls at a sufficient rate to cause non-aggradational extension of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile.</b> How closely fluvio-deltaic systems approach equilibrium is dependent on their progradation rate, which is controlled by water depth and downstream allogenic controls, and governs sediment partitioning between the fluvial, deltaic, and marine domains. Here, six analogue models of coastal fluvio-deltaic systems and small prograding shelf margins are examined {{to better understand the}} effect of water depth, subsidence, and relative sea-level variations upon longitudinal patterns of sediment partitioning and grain-size distribution that eventually determine large-scale stratigraphic architecture. Fluvio-deltaic systems prograding in relatively deep-water environments are characterized by relatively low progradation rates compared to shallow-water systems. This allows these deeper water systems to approach equilibrium more closely, enabling them to construct less concave and steeper <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profiles</b> that provide low accommodation to fluvial systems. Glacio-eustatic sea-level variations and subsidence modulate the effects of water depth on the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile.</b> Systems are closest to equilibrium during falling relative sea level and early lowstand, resulting in efficient sediment transport towards the shoreline at those times. Additionally, the strength of the response to relative sea-level fall differs dependent on water depth. In systems prograding into deep water, relative sea-level fall causes higher sediment bypass rates and generates significantly stronger erosion than in shallow-water systems, which increases the probability of incised-valley formation. Water depth in the receiving basin thus forms a first-order control on the sediment partitioning along the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>profile</b> of fluvio-deltaic systems and the shelf clinoform style. It also forms a control on the availability of sand-grade sediment at the shoreline that can potentially be remobilized and redistributed into deeper marine environments.
