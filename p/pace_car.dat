5|$|By lap 60, Johnson {{built up}} a 1.5 second lead over Kurt Busch, while Hamlin moved into the third position. Green flag pit stops took place from lap 65 to 73; Kurt Busch {{reclaimed}} the lead {{at the end of}} the cycle. On lap 90, Johnson passed Kurt Busch to take over the lead position. One lap later, Hamlin took over fifth position. On the 102nd lap, Martin and Gordon moved into third and fourth respectively. Four laps later, Montoya moved into fourth. Having started on pole position, Truex clinched sixth position on lap 107. On lap 115, the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> moved on track because debris was spotted on the track. During the caution, most of the leaders made pit stops.|$|E

5|$|On lap 113, Burton {{moved up}} to sixth, while Jeff Gordon passed Earnhardt for {{eleventh}}. Allmendinger fell to twenty-fifth after pit stops due to having run out of fuel on his way onto pit road. Three laps later, both Jeff Gordon and Earnhardt had passed Reutimann for tenth and eleventh respectively. By lap 120, Bowyer had a lead of about four seconds over Edwards. Four laps later, Harvick passed Montoya for fourteenth. On lap 132, Keselowski fell to ninth after being passed by Kurt Busch and Hamlin. On lap 147, Bowyer's lead of over seven seconds was reduced to nothing when the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> moved on track. During the caution, which was caused by debris, most of the leaders made pit stops.|$|E
5|$|McMurray {{accelerated}} {{faster than}} Truex {{off the line}} (leading him at the first turn), {{but by the end}} of the first lap Earnhardt had the lead. Three laps later, McMurray reclaimed the lead; one lap later, Logano passed him. On lap six, Truex briefly reclaimed the lead before Harvick passed him. Three laps later a multiple-car collision between turns one and two, involving Waltrip, Menard, Martin, Ragan, Kenseth, and Montoya, triggered the first caution of the race and the <b>pace</b> <b>car.</b> The race restarted on lap sixteen, with Earnhardt leading Harvick and Truex. On the seventeenth lap, McMurray passed Harvick on the backstraightaway to move into the lead. One lap later, Truex took the lead for a lap before he was passed by Kurt Busch. On the 21st lap, McMurray moved back into second place; two laps later McMurray passed Truex to reclaim the lead, with Edwards moving into second.|$|E
5|$|On lap 241, the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> {{came out}} for the eighth and final caution, after Joey Logano {{collided}} with the outside wall. McMurray led on the restart, but Stewart reclaimed the lead on lap 247. Seven laps later, Johnson was forced to pit due to a loose wheel. By lap 257, Stewart had a lead of over one second. Five laps later, Hamlin claimed sixth from Harvick. During the 263rd lap, Bowyer passed McMurray for second. Four laps later, Newman passed Kyle Busch for tenth position. After 269 laps, Stewart lead was over Bowyer was 1.6 seconds. Six laps later, Hamlin moved into fifth position after passing Earnhardt. During lap 290, Hamlin passed McMurray for third. With two laps remaining, Stewart and Burton both ran out of fuel, handing the lead back to Bowyer. Bowyer maintained the lead to win his first race of the 2010 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of McMurray in third, Earnhardt in fourth, and Harvick in fifth.|$|E

5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the <b>pace</b> <b>car.</b> During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the <b>pace</b> <b>car.</b> Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E
5|$|On the 77th lap, Power and {{teammate}} Castroneves (on the Primary tires) encountered slower cars, and {{the latter}} {{took advantage of the}} situation which allowed him to overtake Power for the lead. Castroneves began to pull away from Power. Ten laps later, de Silvestro's car ran out of fuel and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track onto the infield grass to retire from the race which prompted the fourth (and final) caution. Racing resumed when the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> drove into the pit lane at the start of lap 92. Power went onto the outside lane at the entrance of the first turn, and Castroneves drove left as a blocking manoeuvre. Castroneves accelerated out of the corner's exit which caused Power to run wide. Dixon took advantage of the situation and passed Power around the outside to take over second place. The move was immediately reviewed by the IndyCar chief steward and competition president Brian Barnhart, which led to Castroneves being shown a black-flag one minute later as he was deemed as having blocked Power. Castroneves was informed that he was issued with a drive-through penalty. He opted to remain on the track for the final two laps and crossed the start-finish line first on the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} varying the {{selection}} across different models, which existed from 1911 through 2001, has been abandoned since 2002, with all <b>pace</b> <b>cars</b> exclusively {{provided by the}} Chevrolet marque since that year.|$|R

5000|$|... 1997 models {{added the}} new Daytime running lights as {{standard}} {{to the standard}} dual airbags and ABS. Rear visibility was poor. Also, again Chevrolet made a limited production run of Monte Carlo Brickyard 400 <b>pace</b> <b>cars,</b> though none were available for consumers.|$|R
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further seepage. CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 a C4 {{convertible}} {{was again}} the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> for the Indianapolis 500, {{and a special}} <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> edition was offered. 527 were built.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the newly}} {{introduced}} convertible {{version of the}} C5 was chosen to pace the Indianapolis 500 race, and a <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> Replica (RPO Z4Z) was offered to the public. Aside from lacking the equipment necessary for actual <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> duties (light bar, special racing harnesses, etc.), there was little difference between the <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> Replica C5 and the vehicle that actually saw duty during the race. The <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> Replica package consisted of a special paint color ("Radar Blue"), unique interior colors (black and yellow), painted yellow wheels, and special <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> decals. The <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> Replica package also included other optional equipment: the newly introduced Active Handling System (RPO JL4); an electronically tuned AM/FM radio with CD player and a Bose speaker system; an electronic dual-zone heating & air conditioning system; and leather adjustable sport bucket seats. While regarded {{by many as the}} most garish Corvette appearance package offered to date, the 1998 <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> Replicas nevertheless enjoy a strong and loyal following of owners and collectors.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} {{carried in the}} United States on ABC Sports on a same-day tape delay basis. For the first time, the {{broadcast}} was expanded to three-hours. Chris Schenkel rode along and reported live from {{inside one of the}} <b>pace</b> <b>cars</b> {{at the start of the}} race.|$|R

25|$|A 1934 LaSalle Model 350 {{was chosen}} as the <b>Pace</b> <b>Car</b> for the Indianapolis 500 and a 1937 LaSalle Series 50 {{convertible}} also served as an Indy 500 <b>Pace</b> <b>Car.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the IndyCar Series season, however, Johnny Rutherford is {{the normal}} {{driver of the}} IRL <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> for all events. The <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> is {{deployed}} for debris, collision, or weather reasons. Since 1993, upon the waving of the yellow flag, pit road is closed until the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> picks up the leader and passes the pit entrance the first time, unless track blockage forces the field to drive through pit lane. Another duty of the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> is to lead the field around the course on parade laps {{prior to the start}} of the race. These increase in speed, allowing for a flying start of the race.|$|E
25|$|The Honda FCX Clarity was the <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> in 2008 Indy Japan 300 {{which took}} place at the Twin Ring Motegi in Tochigi, Japan, April 2008. It also served as the {{official}} <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> for the 2011 Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg in March 2011.|$|E
50|$|In later years, the Speedway began {{experimenting with}} using pop culture celebrities driving the <b>pace</b> <b>cars,</b> {{a change that}} has met with mixed {{responses}} from fans.

25|$|Automakers {{compete for}} the {{prestige}} of having one of their models selected as the year's <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> for the publicity. In 1971, the move backfired as no automakers stepped up to provide a <b>pace</b> <b>car.</b> Instead, local Indianapolis-area Dodge dealers fulfilled the duty. Eldon Palmer, a local dealer, {{lost control of the}} Dodge Challenger <b>pace</b> <b>car</b> and crashed into a photography stand, injuring several people. The blame for the crash was never fully determined, as officials realized that an orange cone (or perhaps an orange flag), which was to identify Palmer's braking point, was accidentally removed.|$|E
