40|$|The paper aims at proposing an {{information}} technology framework for demand management within a dyad on the supply chain pharmaceutical industry. The paper adopts the exploratory study as research method, involving a <b>producer</b> <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and its main distributor. Data was collected by semi - structured interviews. In pharmaceu tical supply chain, sharing information boosted by information technology translates into greater flexibility and reliability, lower costs, obtained through more reliable forecasting, and lower inventory requirements. There are few initiatives involving In formation Technology (IT) applied to demand management in pharmaceutical supply chains available in the literature. It {{was found that the}} IT framework proposed in this research is adherent to the demand management of the focused pharmaceutical dyad. Other assumption was that, if partners processes integration exist, better supply chain performance is achieved. It was found that, by means of proposed tools and solutions, such as RFID and involved partners applications integration, this goal could be achieved. Because of the chosen research approach, results may be restricted to these specific dyadic processes. Further application of the proposed IT framework have to be tested. The paper identifies demand management strategic and operational processes that can reach a better performance by using the proposed IT framework. Based on the literature, were identified which IT requirements should be met to demand management processes optimization. Additionally, were applied questionnaires and interviews to the focuse d dyad personnel, to corroborate the data identified in the literature. Answers found in the case study link literature elements with those stated by respondents. Finally, based on this, was conceived an IT framework composed of three elements: 1. One spec ific for infrastructure, to enable data and systems interoperability among SC participants, considering a virtualized infrastructure environment (Cloud); 2. An information system solution to integrate partners applications, based on the reference component model structure (CORBA / CCM – Common Object Request Broker Architectures / Corba Component Model); 3. One element responsible for logistics operations, formed by fourth and fifth pieces: a tool to streamline the logistics flow, and to obtain prompt inven tory data, provided by a RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) solution; and another to provide information about production and logistics lead times, applied to demand forecasts elaboration and to streamline the order fulfillmentprocess, based on OEE (Ov erall Equipment Effectiveness) solution.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the role of {{insurance}} coverage in explaining the generic competition paradox in a two-stage game involving a single <b>producer</b> <b>of</b> brand-name drugs and n quantity-competing <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Independently <b>of</b> brand loyalty, which some studies rely upon to explain the paradox, we show that heterogene- ity in insurance coverage may result in higher prices <b>of</b> brand-name <b>drugs</b> following <b>generic</b> entry. With market segmentation based on insurance coverage present in both the pre- and post-entry stages, the paradox can arise when {{the two types of}} drugs are highly substitutable and the market is quite pro?table but does not have to arise when the two types of drugs are highly di¤erentiated. However, with market segmentation occuring only after generic entry, the paradox can arise when the two types of drugs are weakly substituables, provided, however, that the industry is not very pro?table. In both cases, that is, when market segmentation is present in the pre-entry stage and when it is not, the paradox becomes more likely to arise as the market expands and/or insurance companies decrease deductables applied on the purchase <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> brand-name pricing; <b>generic</b> entry; generic competition paradox; health insurance; health economics. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} pharmaceutical <b>producers</b> (<b>of</b> branded and <b>generic</b> <b>drugs)</b> pricing de- cisions in {{a context}} which combines the classical Hotelling framework (commonly adopted in the literature) with the possibility that consumers demands are price elastic. We analyze with particular interest two commonly adopted reimbursement mechanisms: xed percentage reim- bursement (FPR) and reference pricing (RP). We nd that assuming an elastic demand has a signi cant impact under a RP mechanism, as it allows rms to raise their prices when the copayment rate increases. Contrary to previous literature, we show that RP may be worse than FPR {{in terms of social}} welfare for su¢ ciently high copayment rates. From a policy viewpoint, our results indicate that the introduction of RP is not necessarily always bene cial (compared to FPR) and thus constitute a model towards which all reimbursement mechanisms should converge. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPolicymakers tend {{to focus}} on {{improving}} patented drug policies because they are under pressure from patients, physicians, and manufacturers to increase access to novel therapies. The success of pharmaceutical innovation over the last few decades has led to the availability of many off-patent drugs to treat disease areas with the greatest public health need. Therefore, the success of public health programs in improving the health status of the total population is highly dependent on the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> policies. The objective of this article was to explore factors influencing the true efficiency <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> prescription <b>drug</b> policies in supporting public health initiatives in the developed world. Health care decision makers often assess the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> policies by the level of price erosion and market share of generics. Drug quality, bioequivalence, in some cases drug formulations, supply reliability, medical adherence and persistence, health outcomes, and nondrug costs, however, are also attributes <b>of</b> success for <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> policies. Further methodological research is needed to measure and improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> policies. This also requires extension of the evidence base of the impact <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs,</b> partly based on real-world evidence. Multicriteria decision analysis may assist policymakers and researchers to evaluate the true value <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{market share}} <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> has grown {{substantially}} since {{the passage of}} the Waxman-Hatch Act, increasing from 19 % in 1984 to 50 % in 2001. At entry, the <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> typi-cally are priced lower than brand-name drugs; thus, incorpo-rating the impact <b>of</b> the <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> entry introduces an ad-ditional source of uncertainty in economic models as both the timing of entry and the level <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> pricing are sub-ject to variation. In this article, the authors explored the im-pact <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> entry on cost-effectiveness analyses of new or brand-name drugs. Using a mathematical model, they argue that failure to incorporate the impact <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> entry will underestimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and, thus, overstate the economic benefit of the new product. The authors provide 2 examples to illustrate such impact on short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness analyses. To better assess the uncertainty associated with the impact <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> entry, in addition to a deterministic analysis, they also employed a Bayesian probabilistic ap-proach to analyze these examples and presented the results using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. They conclude that incorporating <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> entry into pharmacoeconomic models will yield more accurate projec-tions of the ICER and lead to better decision making.

40|$|<b>Generic</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{cost-effective}} {{versions of}} brand-name drugs {{approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following proof of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. <b>Generic</b> <b>drugs</b> are widely prescribed by physicians, although there is disagreement over the clinical comparability <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> to brand-name drugs within the physician community. The objective of this survey was to assess physicians' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and the <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval process. A survey was administered to a national sample of primary care internists and specialists between August 2014 and January 2015. In total, 1, 152 physicians comprising of internists with no reported specialty certification and those with specialty certification in hematology, infectious diseases, and endocrinology were surveyed. The survey assessed physicians' perceptions <b>of</b> the FDA's <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval process, {{as well as their}} experiences prescribing six <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> approved between 2008 and 2012 using product-specific approval pathways and selected comparator drugs.

Use <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> has been shown to have a significant cost minimisation effect. In spite of this, the benefits <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> substitution are yet to be quantified or even fully explored in Kenya. This study sought to explore the patterns <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use and factors that influence <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use among the prescribers and dispensers in two high volume hospitals in Nakuru County, Kenya. The study focused on selected tracer drugs for cardiovascular Non-Communicable diseases. The study was in the form of case surveys using semistructured questionnaires and interviews. These were conducted over two weeks in two high volume hospitals: Rift Valley Provincial Hospital, and Evans Sunrise Medical Centre, Nakuru. A sample of 50 providers was selected with responses from Forty three providers (43) including thirty three (33) prescribers and ten (10) dispensers across the two institutions. By the end of the 2 weeks of the study, 43 out of the 50 providers contacted participated in the study. Analysis was done to elicit any associations existent in the <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use patterns amongst the providers. The study revealed that the factors that influenced the providers’ prescribing and dispensing habits in hospitals were the cost of the drugs, quality of the drugs, fear of counterfeits, prescriber preference of the drug, availability of the drugs and influence from pharmaceutical firms. The study also found that majority of the respondents (90 % Dispensers and 87. 6 % Prescribers) support <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use, <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> prescription (80 % Dispensers and 60. 6 % Prescribers), and <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> substitution (70 % Dispensers and 33. 3 % Prescribers) as means of lowering the cost of health care. 90. 6 % of Prescribers were unaware of legal provisions governing <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use while 88. 9 % of Dispensers were aware of the provisions. Further, the study found that there were patterns of association between providers’ prescribing and dispensing habits and provider and institutional factors. The key provider factors were level of training and awareness of legal provisions governing <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use. The key institutional factors were presence of institutional policies governing the use <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> as well as availability <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> There is great potential in cost containment through quality <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use, thus the need for awareness, promotion and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use policies among the providers by health institutions and the Government as the providers {{play a key role in}} determining the use <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> use...|$|R

This study aimed to describe changes in dispensing <b>of</b> branded and <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and to explore possible factors that promote the use <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> [Methods]We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese medical and pharmacy claims database. All proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs) with indications for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) described on Japanese labels were included. Patterns of dispensing branded and <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{for the treatment of}} GERD between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate factors associated with receiving <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> [Results]The study cohort included 14, 590 patients (male: 50. 2 %, mean age: 43. 1 years). Branded drugs for GERD were still frequently dispensed despite an increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Only 4. 3 % of patients who initially received branded <b>drugs</b> switched to <b>generic</b> <b>drugs.</b> The percentage <b>of</b> patients who received only <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> increased over time (6. 5 % to 22. 1 %). The frequency <b>of</b> <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> dispensing was the highest in the setting where both prescription and dispensing were implemented in clinics (43. 3 %), while the lowest in the setting where both prescription and dispensing were implemented in hospitals (11. 5 %). Factors associated with receiving <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> included year <b>of</b> dispensing (adjusted OR 2. 22, 95 % CI 1. 94 to 2. 55 for 2009 – 11 v 2006 – 8), prescription and dispensing setting (OR 1. 81, 95 % CI 1. 44 to 2. 26 for prescription in hospitals and dispensing in community pharmacies; OR 2. 21, 95 % CI 1. 80 to 2. 72 for prescription in clinics and dispensing in community pharmacies; and OR 4. 55, 95 % CI 3. 68 to 5. 62 for prescription and dispensing in clinics v prescription and dispensing in hospitals) and H 2 RAs (OR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 49 to 1. 81 compared to PPIs).
