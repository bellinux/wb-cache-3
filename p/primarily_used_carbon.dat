30|$|The current electrochemical-based {{energy storage}} {{technology}} <b>uses</b> <b>primarily</b> activated <b>carbon</b> (AC) electrodes for their intended applications, which are indeed cost effective and scalable, but seriously lacks performance for higher specific capacity. Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) composed of CNT, graphene, and carbon nanofibers come with outstanding properties {{and are the}} most sought alternatives to replace AC materials but their synthesis cost makes them cost-prohibitive. Most importantly, using graphene or graphene oxide requires complex, tedious, {{and in some cases}} toxic processes[1, 2]. In addition, some synthesis processes represent serious health concern[3 – 6]. Silicon has recently emerged as a strong candidate to replace existing graphite anodes due to its inherently large theoretical gravimetric specific capacity of ~ 4, 200 mAh/g and low working potential at around 0.5  V. This is based on the formation of the Li 4.4 Si alloy, which is ten times higher than that of conventional carbon anodes (~ 372 mAh/g corresponding to the formation of LiC 6)[7 – 12].|$|R
40|$|Calcined coke is a {{high quality}} carbon {{material}} produced by calcining green petroleum coke. Calcining {{is the process of}} heating green petroleum coke in a kiln to remove excess moisture, extract all remaining hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline structure of the coke into a denser, electrically conductive product. The final product, calcined coke, is <b>primarily</b> <b>used</b> to make <b>carbon</b> anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of raw coke, or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke. Though calcined coke has shown low hazard potential in human populations due to low volatile content, there remains some public health concern regarding the emissions from these facilities. This study is designed to evaluate the emissions of petroleum coke calcining facility and assess the public health concern from the processes engaged in the handling and storage of green coke {{as well as from the}} calcining process. The ambient air levels were measured from a calcining facility and compared with the standards promulgated by USEPA. The results showed that pollutant contribution from the facility, measured by monitoring carbon fraction of the emissions, was de-minimis. The current research also studied whether the exposure levels and health risks specified in various epidemiological studies correlate with the standards promulgated by USEPA to protect public health from petrochemical emissions...|$|R
