40|$|Salmonella enterica encodes a type III {{secretion}} system {{within a}} pathogenicity island located at centisome 63 {{that is essential}} for virulence. All type III secretion systems require the function {{of a family of}} low-molecularweight proteins that aid the secretion process by acting as <b>partitioning</b> <b>factors</b> and/or secretion pilots. One such protein is SicA, which is encoded immediately upstream of the type III secreted proteins SipB and SipC. We found that the absence of SicA results in the degradation of both SipB and SipC. Interestingly, in the absence of SipC, SipB was not only stable but also secreted at wild-type levels in a sicA mutant background, indicating that SicA is not required for SipB secretion. We also found that SicA is capable of binding both SipB and SipC. These results are consistent with a SicA role as a <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor</b> for SipB and SipC, thereby preventing their premature association and degradation. We also found that introduction of a sicA null mutation results in the lack of expression of SopE, another type III-secreted protein. Such an effect was shown to be transcriptional.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{described}} for {{the variation in}} the rate constants for formation of different ozone isotopomers from oxygen atoms and molecules at low pressures. The theory is implemented using a simplified description which treats the transition state as loose. The two principal features of the theory are a phase space partitioning of the transition states of the two exit channels after formation of the energetic molecule and a small (ca. 15 %) decrease in the effective density of states, rho [a "non-Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) effect"], for the symmetric ozone isotopomers [B. C. Hathorn and R. A. Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 4087 (1999) ]. This decrease is {{in addition to the}} usual statistical factor of 2 for symmetric molecules. Experimentally, the scrambled systems show a "mass-independent" effect for the enrichments delta (for trace) and E (for heavily) enriched systems, but the ratios of the individual isotopomeric rate constants for unscrambled systems show a strongly mass-dependent behavior. The contrasting behavior of scrambled and unscrambled systems is described theoretically using a "phase space" <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor.</b> In scrambled systems an energetic asymmetric ozone isotopomer is accessed from both entrance channels and, as shown in paper I, the <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor</b> becomes unity throughout. In unscrambled systems, access to an asymmetric ozone is only from one entrance channel, and differences in zero-point energies and other properties, such as the centrifugal potential, determine the relative contributions (the <b>partitioning</b> <b>factors)</b> of the two exit channels to the lifetime of the resulting energetic ozone molecule. They are responsible for the large differences in individual recombination rate constants at low pressures. While the decrease in rho for symmetric systems is attributed to a small non-RRKM effect eta, these calculated results are independent of the exact origin of the decrease. The calculated "mass-independent" enrichments, delta and E, in scrambled systems are relatively insensitive to the transition state (TS), because of the absence of the <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor</b> in their case (for a fixed non-RRKM eta). They are compared with the data at room temperature. Calculated results for the ratios of individual isotopomeric rate constants for the strongly mass-independent behavior for unscrambled systems are quite sensitive {{to the nature of the}} TS because of the partitioning effect. The current data are available only at room temperature but the loose TS is valid only at low temperatures. Accordingly, the results calculated for the latter at 140 K represent a prediction, for any given eta. At present, a comparison of the 140 K results can be made only with room temperature data. They show the same trends as, and are in fortuitous agreement, with the data. Work is in progress on a description appropriate for room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Achieving optimal {{throughput}} by extracting parallel-ism {{in behavioral}} synthesis often exaggerates memory bottleneck issues. Data partitioning {{is an important}} technique for increasing memory bandwidth by scheduling multiple simultaneous memory accesses to different memory banks. In this paper we present a vertical memory partitioning and scheduling algorithm that can generate a valid partition scheme for arbitrary affine memory inputs. It does this by arranging non-conflicting memory accesses across the border of loop iterations. A mixed memory partitioning and scheduling algorithm is also proposed to com-bine {{the advantages of the}} vertical and other state-of-art algo-rithms. A set of theorems is provided as criteria for selecting a valid partitioning scheme. This is followed by an optimal and scalable memory scheduling algorithm.

Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probabilities are derived for both cellular and D 2 D links using tools from stochastic geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the outage analysis by employing a flexible mode selection scheme. Also, the effect of beamforming alignment errors on the outage probability is investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios.

40|$|BackgroundRecent {{experimental}} and theoretical studies {{have revealed that}} protein folding kinetics can be quite complex and diverse depending on {{various factors such as}} size of the protein sequence and external conditions. For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the sequence. Results:The folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding time, τF, and σ=(Tθ – TF) /Tθ, where Tθ and TF are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of refolding arise depending on the range of values of σ. For relatively small σ, the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of σ, the kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which a fraction of molecules Φ (kinetic <b>partition</b> <b>factor)</b> reach the native conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The <b>partition</b> <b>factor</b> Φ is also determined by σ: the smaller the value of σ, the larger is Φ. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid residues. ConclusionsWe have shown that the various scenarios for folding of proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of σ. Proteins with small values of σ reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand, proteins with large σ get trapped in competing basins of attraction (CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of molecules access the native state rapidly when σ is large. For these sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The rugged {{nature of}} the RNA folding {{landscape}} is determined {{by a number of}} conflicting interactions like repulsive electrostatic potential between the charges on the phosphate groups, constraints due to loop entropy, base stacking, and hydrogen bonding that operate on various length scales. As a result the kinetics of self-assembly of RNA is complex, but can be easily modulated by varying the concentrations, sizes, and shapes of the counterions. Here, we provide a theoretical description of RNA folding that is rooted in the energy landscape perspective and polyelectrolyte theory. A consequence of the rugged folding landscape is that, self-assembly of RNA into compact three-dimensional structures occurs by parallel routes, and is best described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism (KPM). According to KPM one fraction of mol-ecules (Φ) folds rapidly while the remaining gets trapped in one of several competing basins of attraction. The <b>partition</b> <b>factor</b> Φ can be altered by point mutations as well as by changing the initial conditions such as ion concentration, size and valence of ions. We show that even hairpin formation, either by temperature or force quench, captures much of the features of folding of large RNA molecules.

Replacement of soybean meal protein by the Crambe cake protein decreased digestibility of the fiber fraction of the diet, the voluntary intake of DM and methane, without altering rumen fermentation. Crambe cake can be utilized as lamb's food, because, despite reduced intake, assure a large energy intake and similarity to soybean meal protein...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nine {{kinds of}} {{chamfered}} main cutting edge carbide tools {{were used in}} turning of high-strength glass-fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRP) materials to study the temperature of tip's surface and the cutting forces. Force data from these tests were used to estimate the empirical constants of the mechanical model and verify its prediction capabilities. The friction forces and frictional heat generated on elementary cutting tools are calculated by using the measured cutting forces and the oblique cutting analysis. The heat <b>partition</b> <b>factors</b> between the tip and chip are solved by using the inverse heat transfer analysis, which utilizes temperature on the carbide tip’s surface measured by infrared as the input. The tip’s surface temperature of the carbide is solved by finite element analysis (FEA) and compared with those obtained from experimental measurements. A good agreement demonstrates {{the accuracy of the}} proposed model...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the chemical composition of five foliages, and the effect of adding PEG during incubation on in vitro gas production (GP), metabolizable energy (ME), <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor</b> (PF 24 h), in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD), short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbial biomass production (MBP) as tools to detect the adverse effect of tannins in the foliage of non-leguminous trees. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the chemical composition and the in vitro gas production (GP) of some non-leguminous forage trees in presence or absence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Guazuma ulmifolia, Crescentia alata, Ficus glabrata, Ficus cotinifolia, Spondias purpurea, Mangifera indica, Licania arborea, Simira mexicana were collected during the rainy season, in the Bejucos locality, State of Mexico. Metabolizable energy (ME), <b>partitioning</b> <b>factor</b> (PF 24 h), in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD), short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbial biomass production (MBP) were estimated as tools to detect the adverse effects of tannins in tree foliage. The chemical composition data were analyzed in a random design, and the in vitro digestion parameters on a randomized design with 8 9 2 factorial arrangement. Chemical composition showed a wide variation (P. 05) between species. The use of PEG increased (P. 05) GP from the foliage of S. purpurea, L. arborea, F. glabrata and G. ulmifolia, showing activity of total phenolics and condensed tannins. Similarly, ME (5. 9 MJ kg- 1 DM), OMD (354. 5 g kg- 1 DM) and SCFA (2. 3 mol/ 150 mL) increased (P. 05); it was higher for S. purpurea, because of the PEG addition effect. The PF 24 h and MBP were different between species (P. 05), and decreased due to PEG addition (P. 05); the species with lower production was S. purpurea. It could be concluded that S. purpurea and F. cotinifolia represent important sources of fodder for livestock in the south region of Mexico...|$|R
