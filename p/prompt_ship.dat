5000|$|Offer to buy {{goods for}} “prompt shipment” invites {{acceptance}} by either prompt shipment or a <b>prompt</b> promise to <b>ship.</b> Therefore, this offer is not strictly unilateral. However, this “acceptance by performance” {{does not even}} have to be by conforming goods.|$|R
50|$|The {{day after}} the Rota strike, the ship flew off her planes to Saipan and then {{returned}} to Apra Harbor, Guam, on 2 August, for a three-day breather before heading for Okinawa on 5 August. She arrived at Buckner Bay four days later. Her one night spent in the anchorage there was a memorable one since, during the evening, word arrived that surrender negotiations with the Japanese were in progress and <b>prompted</b> many <b>ships</b> and shore-based units to set off pyrotechnics.|$|R
5000|$|Arriving off Cape Torokina, Bougainville, on {{the morning}} of 1 November 1943, American Legion {{proceeded}} into the earmarked transport area in Empress Augusta Bay and anchored at 06:46. Japanese planes arriving in the vicinity <b>prompted</b> the <b>ships</b> to get underway, the transport's men observing Aichi D3A2 Type 99 [...] "Val" [...] carrier attack planes attacking nearby destroyers and losing two or three of their number in the process. [...] "Zeke" [...] (Mitsubishi A6M [...] "Zero") fighters then strafed the beach area; sinking an LCPL from American Legion.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the ship}} was renamed A'Rosa Blu {{transferred}} to A'Rosa Cruises, a new P&O brand aimed at the German market. Financial problems and the acquisition of P&O by Carnival Corporation & plc <b>prompted</b> the <b>ship's</b> reassignment to the AIDA Cruises fleet in September 2003. Following a refit, which saw the ship's passenger capacity increase to 2,014 across 11 decks, her crew expanded to 621, and increases in her tonnage to [...] and , the cruise ship was renamed AIDAblu and returned to service in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The Stones claimed many <b>ships,</b> <b>prompting</b> {{calls for}} a {{lighthouse}} to be built, but nothing came of plans until {{the wreck of the}} iron screw steamer SS Nile during a storm on 30 November 1854. All of her passengers and crew, numbering about 40 people in total, were lost.|$|R
50|$|The island still {{retains a}} {{traditional}} culture, {{a manifestation of}} which is the annual construction of a small straw imitation boat that is floated out to sea. The tradition began in 1656 when the island was almost invaded by British <b>ships,</b> <b>prompting</b> islanders to make a similar replica of a boat, thus preventing the island's annexation by Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, a {{dense fog}} <b>prompted</b> the <b>ships</b> to reduce speed, and the President {{and the members}} of his staff rested, preparing for the transfer to the Potomac. The following morning, 14 August, off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, President Roosevelt went on deck to witness the operations of the first aircraft escort vessel (later CVE), , the prototype of a ship type that the Chief Executive had avidly pushed toward development. Long Island launched three Brewster F2A-2 Buffalos by the catapult method and six Curtiss SOCs by conventional carrier takeoff. That afternoon on board Augusta, Admiral King hosted a farewell luncheon for the President.|$|R
25|$|From the 1720s, Greenland whalers {{also used}} the dock and {{substantial}} blubber boiling houses were built to produce oil on the south side. Howland Great Wet Dock was sold by the fourth Duke of Bedford in 1763. Extensive usage by the Greenland whaling <b>ships</b> <b>prompted</b> the dock to be renamed Greenland Dock. However, this trade declined sharply {{by the start of}} the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|As it {{returns to}} Earth, Dr. Finkel changes {{the path to}} divert the ship into a meteor shower, which <b>prompts</b> the <b>ships</b> {{built-in}} dodging system to quickly maneuver {{its way out of}} the situation, with a slight error that busts the data antenna to the right by a passing meteor. Budderball is sent outside the Vision 1 to repair the antenna, space walking to recalibrate it. At Mission Control, the adults remain puzzled about the change when Sam accuses Dr. Finkel as the perpetrator. However, much to Dr. Finkel's denial, Mission Control's security footage justifies that the desk had Dr. Finkel's presence at the time of change, causing him to be quickly removed from the premises.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the next}} few months, Blair crossed and re-crossed the Atlantic, {{screening}} convoys to the United Kingdom, making a total of 10 round trip voyages between {{the east coast of}} the United States and the ports of Derry, Northern Ireland; Liverpool, England; and Cherbourg, France; also frequenting Portland, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, England. On several occasions, suspicious contacts <b>prompted</b> the <b>ship</b> to drop depth charges and make [...] "hedgehog" [...] attacks, but none of her targets proved to be a submarine. During her first cycle in 1945, she was detached from her convoy (UC-51B) to stand by the Army artillery transport Lakehurst (formerly APM-9) as she labored across the Atlantic, [...] "having difficulty with improperly secured locomotives...." ...|$|R
5000|$|Legend {{maintains}} that the town of Nags Head, North Carolina {{takes its name from}} wreckers or [...] "Bankers" [...] deploying false lights. The Nags Head urban legend states that in the 18th century, wreckers would hang lanterns from the necks of mules (colloquially called [...] "nags" [...] at the time) and walk the animals very slowly up and down the beach. The alleged intent was to fool mariners into believing that the slow-moving lights were ships drifting at rest or at anchor, <b>prompting</b> the <b>ships</b> to change course and subsequently run aground. In 1860, a writer for Harper’s New Monthly Magazine corroborates the story of the [...] "Bankers" [...] who gave Nags Head its name.|$|R
500|$|On 21November, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, {{the light}} cruisers [...] and , and several destroyers {{conducted}} a sweep between Iceland and the Faroe Islands; during the operation, the German ships encountered the British {{armed merchant cruiser}} Scharnhorst sank the ship, {{but in the process}} sustained a hit from one of Rawalpindis 152mm guns.

50|$|The Wireless Ship Act {{was passed}} by the United States Congress in 1910, {{requiring}} all ships of the United States traveling over two-hundred miles off the coast and carrying over 60 passengers to be equipped with wireless radio equipment with a range of one-hundred miles. The legislation was <b>prompted</b> by a <b>shipping</b> accident in 1909, where a wireless operator was seen as having contributed to saving the lives of 1,200 people.|$|R
50|$|On October 21, 1967, four Styx {{missiles}} sank {{the destroyer}} INS Eilat, which was patrolling {{along the northern}} shores of the Sinai. Forty-seven Israeli sailors and officers were killed or went missing in action and 100 were injured. The loss of the <b>ship</b> <b>prompted</b> the Israeli navy to ask Israel Aerospace Industries to accelerate {{the development of an}} anti-ship missile, which had begun in 1958 with the Luz (or Lutz) program.|$|R

50|$|On an {{asteroid}} prison, {{a group of}} dangerous aliens known as Krites are set to be transported to another station. The Krites engineer an escape and hijack a <b>ship,</b> <b>prompting</b> the warden to hire two shape-changing bounty hunters to pursue them to Earth. Studying life on Earth via various satellite television transmissions, the first bounty hunter assumes the form of rock star Johnny Steele, while the second remains undecided, thus retaining his blank, featureless head.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{delays in}} Brisbane, Yongala arrived in Mackay {{on the morning}} of 23 March. After the {{transfer}} of passengers and cargo, the ship sailed north for Townsville at 1:40 pm, carrying 49 passengers, 73 crew, and 617 tons of cargo in the lower hold. Five hours later, the lighthouse keeper of the Dent Island Light saw Yongala sail into the Whitsunday Passage; the last known sighting of the ship. Shortly before the vessel left sight of land at Mackay, a telegram was received by the Flat Top signal station warning of a tropical cyclone between Townsville and Mackay. Flag and wireless signals from the station <b>prompted</b> several <b>ships</b> to take refuge at Mackay, but Yongala did not see the flags, and was yet to be fitted with wireless equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The vessel {{underwent}} refits in Genoa {{over the}} course of 2001 and 2002, redeveloping the vessel and customizing her for a European client base. Costa Tropicale served with the company until 2005, when replacement by larger, more modern cruise <b>ships</b> <b>prompted</b> a transfer to P&O Cruises Australia, where the vessel again underwent a major refit in Palermo, Italy and was renamed Pacific Star. In 2008 the Pacific Star was sold to Pullmantur Cruises and renamed Ocean Dream [...] following a refit in Singapore.|$|R
5000|$|Departing Dutch New Guinean waters on 9 November, {{the attack}} {{transport}} arrived off Leyte on the 13th. While no enemy planes made an appearance close to Wayne that morning, a solitary [...] "Jill", carrying a torpedo, attacked the convoy {{to which she}} was attached. At 17:00, the enemy aircraft appeared forward of the convoy, briefly took a parallel course to it, and then when aft of Wayne s position, banked to starboard and began a low-altitude run on LSV [...] The torpedo missed, but Catskills gunners did not and the raider splashed into the sea. Later that day, more enemy aircraft appeared in the vicinity, <b>prompting</b> the <b>ships</b> to go to general quarters, but {{did not come close}} enough to draw fire. By the time the word came to secure from general quarters, the convoy was in approach disposition in Leyte Gulf.|$|R
5000|$|A formal {{investigation}} into the sinking was ordered by USCG Rear Admiral Steven Ratti on 2 November 2012. An inquiry into the sinking was held in Portsmouth, Virginia from 12 to 21 February 2013; at which {{it was concluded that}} Captain Walbridge's decision to sail the ship into the path of Hurricane Sandy was the cause, and the inquiry found this to have been a [...] "reckless decision". The loss of the <b>ship</b> <b>prompted</b> the USCG to conduct a review of the events and decisions leading to the loss of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 July 1862, the double-ender sailed for the West Indies for {{operations}} against Confederate blockade runners and raiders {{on the high}} seas. The success of Confederate cruisers, especially [...] and , in operations against Union <b>shipping</b> <b>prompted</b> the Department of the Navy on 8 September 1862 to put Commodore Charles Wilkes in command of a [...] "flying" [...] West India Squadron created specifically to seek out and destroy the Confederate raiders. Sonoma was assigned to this squadron. While Sonoma never engaged Florida or Alabama, she did operate successfully against blockade runners.|$|R
500|$|A shell {{from one}} of the British cruisers hit Mainz at around 13:00, which jammed her rudder at ten degrees to starboard. Her crew shut off the port engine in an attempt to correct the ship's course, but she {{continued}} to turn to starboard. By 13:20, the majority of the ship's guns had been disabled and the ship's superstructure had been shot to pieces. Her center and aft funnel collapsed after suffering several hits. A torpedo from the destroyer [...] then hit the ship on her port side, amidships; this <b>prompted</b> the <b>ship's</b> commander to order the crew to abandon the stricken cruiser. He then left the conning tower with the navigation officer, both of whom were immediately killed by a shell hit. The ship's communication system was out of service, and so the order to abandon ship did not reach the entire crew. The ship's executive officer then reached the bridge, and reiterated the order to abandon the crippled ship at 13:35.|$|R
25|$|Since it was {{a widely}} held belief in the United States that a {{shipbuilding}} boom would follow the end of hostilities, the USSB declined to cancel many of its wartime shipbuilding contracts {{at the end of}} the war. In Skinner & Eddy's case, this meant that the company was to complete a further 43 ships for the USSB in the postwar period. In 1920 however, the USSB cancelled a contract for an additional 25 <b>ships,</b> <b>prompting</b> the company to launch a $17 million claim against the government for lost anticipated profits, later reduced to a $9 million claim.|$|R
25|$|Post-war {{searches}} {{attempted to}} find {{one or both of}} the combatants, but were unsuccessful because of a lack of detailed information about the battle's location. Searchers distrusted the German survivors and their accounts; the large difference between the number of survivors from each <b>ship</b> <b>prompted</b> theories that Kormorans crew had acted illegally during the battle and were attempting to cover up their actions. As a result, hypotheses about the wrecks' locations varied from deep water many kilometres off Dirk Hartog Island, to sites nearer to Carnarvon, Western Australia, and as far south as the western side of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands.|$|R

500|$|In 1919, Emperor of India was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet, as part of the 4th Battle Squadron, along with her three sisters and two s. During this period, she served in the Black Sea during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. Admiral Edward Hobart Seymour, the commander of British forces in the Black Sea, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 14 April. The ship bombarded Bolshevik troops on 5 May 1919 outside Theodosia, and later to disrupt the operations of a railway being used to supply the Bolshevik assault on the port. On 26 March 1920, Emperor of India provided gunfire support to White Russian forces outside Novorossiysk, along with the French armoured cruiser [...] Shortly thereafter, Emperor of India came under fire from an armoured train, <b>prompting</b> the <b>ship</b> to leave the harbour, bound for Theodosia. The ship was also involved in observing the Greco-Turkish War of 191922; this included stops in the ports of Mitylene and Smyrna.|$|R
