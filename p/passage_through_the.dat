5|$|About 90% of the sungrazers {{observed}} with SOHO {{are members of}} the Kreutz group, which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> inner Solar System. The remainder contains some sporadic sungrazers, but four other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Kracht 2a, Marsden, and Meyer groups. The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to Comet 96P/Machholz, which is also the parent of two meteor streams, the Quadrantids and the Arietids.|$|E

After helping to defend the city from the Circle in a hardfought battle, Amelia finds that Beaumont has once again escaped, {{this time with the}} hijacked barrels of the Fountain's water.|$|E

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which {{winds through}} the Black Forest. The Elz creates a series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E

5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine force went on {{to invade}} Arzanene. Philippicus besieged Chlomaron, the chief city of the area. At this point, Jovius and Maruthas, two local leaders, {{defected}} to the Byzantines. They promised to help locate the ideal positions for building impregnable forts that would control the <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Taurus Mountains and Hakkâri, allowing the Byzantines to control the routes that connected Arzanene with Persarmenia and Lower Mesopotamia. Philippicus assigned Heraclius the Elder, noted at this point as his second-in-command (hypostrategos), to follow the guides to the strong points indicated.|$|E

5|$|The Rus' {{launched}} the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern {{shores of the}} Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> land of the Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the Dnieper River into the Black Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, then up the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.|$|E

Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera.

5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
