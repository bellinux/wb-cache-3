2500|$|The {{distributor}} of a podcast maintains a central {{list of the}} files on a server as a web feed that can be accessed through the Internet. The listener or viewer uses special client application software on a computer or media player, known as a <b>podcatcher,</b> which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or [...] "pushed" [...] to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for offline use. There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand {{as an alternative to}} downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.|$|E

Many of the magazine contributors participate in these podcast discussions. The official FSM podcast archive is hosted here.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2005, Apple {{released}} iTunes 4.9 which added formal {{support for}} podcasts, thus negating {{the need to}} use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. While this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of <b>podcatchers</b> by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued Cease and Desist orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term [...] "iPod" [...] or [...] "Pod" [...] in their products' names.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2003, {{the company}} AudioFeast (later renamed PodBridge, then VoloMedia) filed a patent {{application}} for “Method for Providing Episodic Media” with the USPTO {{based on its}} work in developing the AudioFeast service launched in September 2004. Although AudioFeast did not refer to itself as a podcasting service and was not built on RSS, it provided a way of downloading episodic audio content through desktop software and portable devices, with a system similar to the MyAudio2Go.com service four years before it. (AudioFeast shut down its service in July 2005 due to the unwillingness of its free customers to pay for its $49.95 paid annual subscription service, {{and a lack of}} a strong competitive differentiation in the market with the emergence of free RSS <b>podcatchers.)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Mediafly {{was founded}} by Carson Conant in 2006 as a <b>podcatcher.</b> In {{addition}} to its mobile apps, in 2009, {{it was one of}} the first channels to be added to Roku’s channel store. That same year, the company began to transition from a consumer model to a business-to-business model, officially shutting down its podcasting applications in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Miro {{integrates}} an RSS {{news aggregator}} and <b>podcatcher,</b> a BitTorrent client (based on libtorrent), and a media player (VLC media player under Windows, QuickTime under macOS, and xine media player or GStreamer under Linux and FreeBSD). Since 2.0, Miro supports the adding of website bookmarks under the [...] "Sites" [...] category; by default, ClearBits.net is preloaded in Miro as a bookmark.|$|E
5000|$|Media {{aggregators}} {{are sometimes}} referred to as <b>podcatchers</b> due to the popularity of the term podcast used to refer to a web feed containing audio or video. Media aggregators are client software or web-based applications which maintain subscriptions to feeds that contain audio or video media enclosures. They can be used to automatically download media, playback the media within the application interface, or synchronize media content with a portable media player. Multimedia aggregators are the current focus. EU launched the project Reveal This to embedded different media platforms in RSS system.

Previous shows can be streamed, downloaded directly or subscribed to as podcasts via RSS through any <b>podcatcher</b> like Juice, Stitcher or iTunes. The service also provides promotional badges and flash player code for placement on blogs, Twitter, Facebook and other Social networking sites.|$|E

Upon installation it will scan the user's hard drives for music files and add them to its library. Ratings and playback information can be imported from other media players such as Winamp and Windows Media Player. Podcasts are supported through the <b>Podcatcher</b> which allows the user to subscribe to podcasts that MediaMonkey will automatically download. It can also monitor the user's hard drive to ensure that any changes are automatically updated in the library.|$|E
