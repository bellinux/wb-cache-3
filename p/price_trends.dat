500|$|Accum paid {{particular}} attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: [...] "Malt beverages, and especially port, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated {{in the course of}} supply." [...] He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the Menispermaceae family, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was getting out of hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> for the same commodities.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examined whether <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> misperceptions {{can be explained}} by the differential perception of increasing versus decreasing prices. We expected price increases (losses to consumers) to be perceived as being more intense than price decreases (gains to consumers) of the same magnitude. This tendency, in turn, should be positively associated with how people perceive the overall <b>price</b> <b>trend.</b> To test this reasoning, participants in the first two studies were asked to compare German Mark (DM) and Euro prices. First, participants received a menu containing 21 dishes with DM prices, and their <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> expectations were assessed. Then, participants indicated for each dish to what extent the price had changed. Finally, participants' overall <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> judgments were assessed. In both studies, results indicate that <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> judgments were biased toward rising prices. In addition, price increases were perceived as rising more than price decreases of the same magnitude were perceived as falling. This tendency was positively associated with overall <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> judgments, even after controlling for expectations. Study 3 was to replicate these findings in a different domain to demonstrate the general nature and impact of the hypothesized effect...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I provide {{alternative}} formulations to the <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> {{factor of}} Han, Zhou and Zhu (2016), using returns instead of <b>prices.</b> The <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> factor is also constructed and {{compared with the}} return trend factors. Two market equity based factors were also constructed, but they showed little interest in themselves. Several tests were conducted that actually attested to the robustness and appeal of the <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> factor. The return trends showed each some weaknesses along the tests. The individual moving average lengths used in the factor construction were also explored and they revealed the adaptability of the <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> factor, which is the primary explanation of this study to the factor’s good performance. For future research, the construction of other factors with the same method seem most fruitful...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on analysis of the <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> on crude oil WTI and crude oil Brent in last 30 years. This thesis aims to clarify important price changes of crude oil {{and to find out}} the main circumstances, which caused them, eventually how the factors affected the changes both in positive or negative way. Then determine the price prediction of both crude oil markets. Necessary information are tested by analysis tools used on time series, which are used to evaluate the price development of crude oil and the factors that affect the <b>price</b> <b>trend.</b> Thesis is divided into two main chapters. The first one is devoted to theoretical investigation. The second is practical, which is divided into three subchapters. Theoretical part summarizes main factors affecting the price development of crude oil such are war conflicts, natural influences and others. The first subchapter of practical part mutually compares the <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> of crude oil Brent and WTI. In following subchapter are individually researched significant events that caused the changes of crude oil price in already mentioned period. Last subchapter pays attention on prediction of <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> on both markets. The resulting survey shows up significant mutual dependence between both markets...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of two related tracts: (i) Quantitative Modeling and (ii) Analysis of Asset Flow Differential Equations. In the former a data set of over 100, 000 daily closed-end fund prices is analyzed using mixed-effects regressions {{with the objective of}} understanding price dynamics. This analysis provides strong statistical evidence that relative daily price change is positively influenced by valuation, recent <b>price</b> <b>trend,</b> short term volatility, volume trend, and the M 2 money supply. There is a strong nonlinearity in the influence of the <b>price</b> <b>trend,</b> so that a significantly large recent uptrend has a negative influence on the subsequent day's relative price change. The nonlinearity is the key {{to an understanding of the}} competing role of <b>price</b> <b>trend,</b> since a single large data set exhibits both under- and overreaction in different regimes of the independent variables. The role of long term volatility is not a clear-cut risk/return inverse relation; rather there is an ambiguous and complicated relationship between volatility and return. Standardization of the independent regression variables allows for a more direct comparison of each factor's influence on the return. In the latter a two-group asset flow model of a financial instrument with one group focused on <b>price</b> <b>trend,</b> the other on value, is considered. The existence of both stable and unstable regions for the system of differential equations is proven. It is shown that a strong motivation based on (recent) <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> is associated with instability. Numerical computations using a set of typical parameters describe regions of stability and instability. A precise limiting connection between the discrete and differential equations is also established...|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Vladimira Ilieva and Prof. Mark DeSantis* {{focused on}} large scale data studies that {{effectively}} subtracted out the changes {{due to the}} net asset value of closed end funds 15. Thus one could establish significant coefficients for <b>price</b> <b>trend.</b> The work with DeSantis was particularly noteworthy in two respects: (a) by standardizing the data, it became possible to compare the impact of <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> versus changes in money supply, for example; (b) {{the impact of the}} <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> was shown to be nonlinear, so that a small uptrend has a positive impact on prices (demonstrating underreaction), while a large uptrend has a negative influence. The measure of large or small is based upon the frequency of occurrence (measure in standard deviations). Using exchange traded funds (ETFs), they also showed (together with Prof. Akin Sayrak) that the concept of resistance—whereby a stock has retreats as it nears a yearly high—has strong statistical support 16.|$|R
