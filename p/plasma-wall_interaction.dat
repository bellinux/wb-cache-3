50|$|Subsequently, {{excellent}} control got {{established on}} tokamak plasma performance by controlling the <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> processes at the plasma boundary so the plasma duration was limited {{primarily by the}} `transformer pulse length'. However, for relevance to future power reactors {{it is essential to}} operate these devices in a steady state mode. The very idea of steady state operation presents a series of physics and technology challenges. For example, the excellent plasma performance which was accomplished earlier, was with the surrounding material wall acting as a good 'pump' of particles, a fact which may not be true in steady state.|$|E
5000|$|Highly charged ions (HCI) are ions in {{very high}} charge states {{due to the}} loss of many or most of their bound {{electrons}} by energetic collisions or high-energy photon absorption. Examples are 13-fold ionized iron, Fe13+ or Fe (XIV) in spectroscopic notation, found in the Sun's corona, or naked uranium, U92+, bare all bound electrons, which requires very high energy for its production. HCI are found in stellar coronae, in active galactic nuclei, in supernova remnants, and in accretion disks. Most of the visible matter found in the universe consists of highly charged ions [...] High temperature plasmas used for nuclear fusion energy research also contain HCI generated by the <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> (see Tokamak). In the laboratory, HCI are investigated by means of heavy ion particle accelerators and electron beam ion traps.|$|E

The divertor plasma is measured by Langmuir probe, visible spectroscopy and magnetic probe. The characteristic behaviors in the RFP divertor are the plasma burst into the divertor region at the RFP field setup stage and the strong magnetic fluctuation in the divertor region. The latter may cause the anomalous effusion or loss/scattering of particles through the X-point region and the additional helicity loss which leads to the enhanced loop voltage.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{actively}} modifying the <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> was tested on the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor.

The lithium introduced in this fashion ablated and migrated preferentially to the limiter contact points. This allowed the <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> to be influenced in situ and in real time by external means. Significant improvement in energy confinement and fusion neutron production rate {{as well as a}} reduction in the plasma Zeff have been documented in a neutral-beam-heated plasma. The introduction of a metallic aerosol into the plasma edge increased the internal inductance of the plasma column and also resulted in prompt heating of core electrons in Ohmic plasmas.

In addition, as fusion plasmas approach the “burning plasma” regime, where internal heating due to fusion products dominates other forms of heating, the physics of the interaction between the α-particles produced by D-T fusion reactions and the thermal “background” plasma becomes significant.

40|$|Abstract. A simple {{model for}} the {{operation}} of the Hall current plasma accelerator, a crossed field discharge device that accelerates a flow of quasi-neutral plasma, is used to calculate the performance of an actual device at various configurations and operating conditions. The solutions demonstrate that the performance, characterized by the ionized fraction of the flow, the mass-averaged exit flow velocity and the total efficiency, improves as the flow rate or the accelerator length are increased at a given discharge voltage, trends that were also observed experimentally. Nevertheless, the calculated values for the longer lengths, especially the total efficiencies, are significantly higher than the measured ones, indicating the importance of an accurate solution of the electron energy equation and the need to include in the model <b>plasma–wall</b> <b>interactions.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of Hall thruster is investigated numerically {{in the presence}} of <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction.</b> The <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> is a function of wall potential, which in turn is determined by the secondary electron emission and sputtering yield. In the present work, the effect of secondary electron emission and sputter yield has been considered simultaneously. Owing to disparate temporal scales, ions and neutrals have been described by set of time-dependent equations while electrons are considered in steady state. Based on the experimental observations, a third order polynomial in electron temperature is used to calculate ionization rate. The changes in plasma density, potential and azimuthal electron velocity due to sputter yield are significant in the acceleration region. The change in ion and electron velocity and temperature is small. The neutral velocity, which decreases initially, starts increasing toward the exit consistent with the computed neutral density profile. The results are qualitatively compared with the experiments.

It was observed that depending on plasma parameters the transport of plasma particles inside the gap can be either in potential-or geometry-dominated regimes. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of a potential peak inside the poloidal gap and its consequences on plasma deposition profiles are discussed. A study of gap shaping was performed in order to validate its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of an outer layer of chaotic magnetic field lines in a tokamak is useful to control <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interactions.</b> Chaotic field lines (in the Lagrangian sense) in this region eventually hit the tokamak wall and are considered lost. Due to the underlying dynamical structure of this chaotic region, namely a chaotic saddle formed by intersections of invariant stable and unstable manifolds, the exit patterns are far from being uniform, rather presenting an involved fractal structure. If three or more exit basins are considered, the respective basins exhibit an even stronger Wada property, for which a boundary point is arbitrarily close to points belonging to all exit basins.

Thanks to a nonuniform spatial grid the sheath structure can be resolved accurately. Several advection schemes are implemented and the code is parallelized.

Composition, {{morphology}} {{and structure}} of the deposited (mixed) surface layers after preliminary carboboronization procedure (B/C:H layers deposition) and subsequent <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> in the different areas of Globus-M spherical tokamak have been analyzed. Globus-M {{to the best of our}} knowledge is unique in that its first wall is almost completely covered by RGTi protection tiles: currently about 90 % of its inner vessel area facing to plasma is covered by RGTi graphite tiles doped with 2 at. % of Ti and 0. 3 - 0. 7 at. % of Si. The mixed layer properties were examined by different diagnostic techniques (electron probe microanalysis, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering, nuclear resonance reactions, thermal desorption spectroscopy, infrared Raman scattering, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy) after sample exposure to plasma during 3000 - 10000 tokamak pulses. It was found that mixed protective layers and/or deposits existed even in high flux regions (separatrix strike points). The initial composition of the protective layers formed during boronization is dramatically modified during long-term <b>plasma-wall</b> <b>interaction</b> and resulted in significant intermixing of its components with materials of vesse...|$|E
