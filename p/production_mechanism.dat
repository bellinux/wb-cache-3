25|$|Many common {{depictions of}} the Electromagnetic Spectrum show gamma rays as higher in energy (hence are higher in {{frequency}} and smaller in wavelength) than X-rays. This historically allowed {{a clear distinction between}} X-rays and gamma rays. Today, the research literature often describes photons depending on their source. While astronomers usually hold to the historical convention (often the source or <b>production</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the radiation is unknown), the physics literature often use the term historically associated with the method of production. For example, one group of scientists might describe a 1 MeV photon as a gamma ray, while another group use the term X-ray.|$|E
25|$|Some {{accretion}} discs produce jets of twin, highly collimated, {{and fast}} outflows that emerge {{in opposite directions}} from close to the disc. The direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole. The jet <b>production</b> <b>mechanism</b> and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low. The jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband, where very-long-baseline interferometry {{can be used to}} study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales. However, they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton scattering process, and so AGN jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation.|$|E

2500|$|When {{heat stress}} {{is at its}} maximum, common {{ostriches}} are able to recover evaporative loss by using a metabolic water mechanism to counter the loss by urine, feces, and respiratory evaporation. [...] An experiment to determine {{the primary source of}} water intake in the ostrich indicated that while the ostrich does employ a metabolic water <b>production</b> <b>mechanism</b> as a source of hydration, the most important source of water is food. When ostriches were restricted to the no food or water condition, the metabolic water production was only 0.5Ld−1, while total water lost to urine, feces and evaporation was 2.3Ld−1. When the birds were given both water and food, total water gain was 8.5Ld−1. In the food only condition total water gain was 10.1Ld−1. These results show that the metabolic water mechanism is not able to sustain water loss independently, and that food intake, specifically of plants with a high water content such as Euphorbia heterochroma, is necessary to overcome water loss challenges in the common ostrich's arid habitat.|$|E

We presented active, passive, and embedded sentences, and in {{a subset of the}} material we also manipulated sentence length. Using accuracy and speech error analyses at the sentence, word and affix level, we provide evidence that individual differences in task performance are influenced by the linguistic properties of the material.

The BABAR {{experiment}} at SLAC {{is designed}} to measure CP violation in the B meson system, however the very high statistics combined with the different e + and e − beam energies, the detector design and the open trigger allow {{a wide variety of}} spectroscopic measurements.

The technique involves the electric field assisted spraying of ink containing CIS nano-particles onto the substrate directly and then sintering in an inert environment.

50|$|Photosynthesis {{converts}} {{light energy}} into chemical {{energy in the}} form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This occurs in the chloroplasts of plants cells. Light photons interact with various intermebrane proteins of the cholorplast to accomplish this. However, these proteins can become saturated with photons, making them unable to function until the saturation is alleviated. This is known as the Kautsky effect and is a cause of inefficiency on the ATP <b>production</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Cytoplasmic streaming in Chara corallina, however, enables chloroplasts to move around the stem of the plant. Thus, the chloroplasts move into lighted regions and shaded regions. This intermittent exposure to photons due to cytoplasmic streaming actually increases the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. Photosynthetic activity is generally assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence analysis.|$|E
