5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont <b>pattern,</b> <b>with</b> two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures {{had done something}} similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same <b>pattern,</b> <b>with</b> intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} that if the gap is very narrow only {{diffraction}} <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> bright centers can occur. If the gap is made progressively wider, then diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> dark centers will alternate <b>with</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> bright centers.

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied <b>pattern,</b> <b>with</b> Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

5|$|About {{four hours}} after formation, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it attained a minimum central pressure of 1002mbar. Shortly thereafter, its appearance on radar deteriorated, and convection warmed around the center. With a mid-level anticyclone over Texas, Bret tracked steadily to the west-northwest, {{and began to}} re-organize just before moving ashore; at 12:00UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall just southeast of Tuxpan with winds of 65km/h (40mph). After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well-organized cloud <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> deep convection. The center turned to the north-northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar <b>pattern,</b> <b>with</b> a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} corporation of Madurai has {{an area of}} 147.97km2. Madurai is hot and dry for eight months of the year. Cold winds are experienced during February and March as in the neighbouring Dindigul. The hottest months are from March to July. The city experiences a moderate climate from August to October, tempered by heavy rain and thundershowers, and a slightly cooler climate from November to February. Fog and dew are rare, occurring only during the winter season. Being equidistant from mountains and the sea, it experiences similar monsoon <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon, with the former providing more rain during October to December. The average annual rainfall for the Madurai district is about 85.76cm.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent <b>pattern,</b> <b>with</b> a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E

5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5|$|While {{patterns}} {{can provide}} more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged object is stationary, any pattern, particularly one with high contrast, stands {{out when the}} object is moving. Jungle camouflage uniforms were issued during the Second World War, but both the British and American forces found that a simple green uniform provided better camouflage when soldiers were moving. After the war, most nations returned to a unicoloured uniform for their troops. Some nations, notably Austria and Israel, continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today. Similarly, while larger military aircraft traditionally had a disruptive <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> a darker top over a lighter lower surface (a form of countershading), modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
