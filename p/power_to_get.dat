No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> trains {{up the steep}} climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things and the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns {{to the question of}} accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|For example, to get 1kW of real power, if {{the power}} factor is unity, 1kVA of {{apparent}} power {{needs to be}} transferred (1kW ÷ 1 = 1kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs {{to be transferred to}} get the same real <b>power.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> 1kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1kW ÷ 0.2 = 5kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.|$|E

25|$|A {{contract}} of employment can always create better terms than statutory minimum rights. But to increase their bargaining <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fair terms, employees organize labor unions for collective bargaining. The Clayton Act of 1914 guarantees all people the right to organize, and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 creates rights for most employees to organize without detriment through unfair labor practices. Under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, labor union governance follows democratic principles. If a majority of employees in a workplace support a union, employing entities {{have a duty to}} bargain in good faith. Unions can take collective action to defend their interests, including withdrawing their labor on strike. There are not yet general rights to directly participate in enterprise governance, but many employees and unions have experimented with securing representation on corporate boards.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as having}} rights for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 {{requires}} {{that people are}} treated equally, {{unless there is a}} good justification, based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on fixed-term contracts are treated generally equally compared to full-time or permanent staff. To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, after two years they can only be dismissed for a fair reason, and are entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary. If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that employees' terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. The purpose of these rights is to ensure people have dignified living standards, whether or not they have the relative bargaining <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> good terms and conditions in their contract.|$|E

The priority now was access to the Navigation Colliery at Treharris, and traffic from the Taff Bargoed line itself, {{as well as the}} collieries at Llancaiach. The GWR disputed the use of the running <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> access <b>to</b> Navigation Colliery: the running <b>powers</b> were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> access <b>to</b> the Taff Bargoed line, not to serve intermediate locations.|$|R

2500|$|Currently, {{the only}} US Navy ships {{that can produce}} enough {{electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> desired performance are the Zumwalt-class destroyers; they can generate 78 megawatts of power, more than is necessary to power a railgun. [...] Engineers are working to derive technologies developed for the DDG-1000 series ships into a battery system so other warships can operate a railgun. Most current destroyers can spare only nine megawatts of additional electricity, while it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range [...] (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles {{at a rate of}} 10 shots per minute). Even if current ships, such as the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, can be upgraded with enough electrical power to operate a railgun, the space taken up on the ships by the integration of an additional weapon system may force the removal of existing weapon systems to make room available. The first shipboard tests was to be from a railgun installed on an Spearhead-class Expeditionary Fast Transport (EFT), but this was later changed to land based testing.|$|E
2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also has a message, which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out [...] The <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, she knew she was [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using whatever you can to get the upper hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E
