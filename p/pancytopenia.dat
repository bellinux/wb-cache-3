25|$|Hypersplenism and <b>pancytopenia,</b> {{the rapid}} and {{premature}} destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with {{an increased risk}} of infection and bleeding).|$|E
25|$|Predisposition {{of acute}} myeloid leukemia; {{skeletal}} abnormalities; radial hypoplasia and vertebral defect and other physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure (<b>pancytopenia),</b> endocrine dysfunction, early onset osteopenia/osteoporosis and lipid abnormalities, spontaneous chromosomal breakage exacerbated {{by exposure to}} DNA cross-linking agents.|$|E
25|$|Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, an {{autosomal}} recessive primary immunodeficiency, is another example. <b>Pancytopenia,</b> rashes, {{swollen lymph nodes}} and enlargement of the liver and spleen are commonly seen in such individuals. Presence of multiple uncleared viral infections {{due to lack of}} perforin are thought to be responsible.|$|E
25|$|Leukemias* are {{progressive}} {{proliferation of}} cancerous {{white blood cells}} within the bone marrow, resulting in destruction of the bone marrow and <b>pancytopenia</b> in many cases. Types of leukemia in dogs include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic basophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (or hypereosinophilic syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and <b>pancytopenia</b> (some fatal) {{have been}} {{reported}} with infliximab. The FDA issued a warning to doctors appearing in the respective product labeling of infliximab instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully. The FDA issued a warning to doctors {{that there is an}} increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers {{associated with the use of}} infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor blockers in children and adolescents.|$|E
25|$|Antiproliferative {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, <b>pancytopenia,</b> or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, duodenal ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA), {{also known}} as Blackfan-Diamond anemia, {{inherited}} pure red cell aplasia and as inherited erythroblastopenia, is a congenital erythroid aplasia that usually presents in infancy. DBA causes low red blood cell counts (anemia), without substantially affecting the other blood components (the platelets and the white blood cells), which are usually normal. This {{is in contrast to}} Shwachman–Bodian–Diamond syndrome, in which the bone marrow defect results primarily in neutropenia, and Fanconi anemia, where all cell lines are affected resulting in <b>pancytopenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopenia, <b>pancytopenia,</b> vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E
25|$|Dogs get {{ehrlichiosis}} {{from the}} brown dog tick, which passes an ehrlichia organism {{into the bloodstream}} when it bites. It is also possible for dogs to become infected through a blood transfusion from an infected dog. There are three stages of ehrlichiosis, each varying in severity. The acute stage, occurring several weeks after infection and lasting {{for up to a}} month, can lead to fever and lowered peripheral blood cell counts due to bone marrow suppression. The second stage, called the subclinical phase, has no outward signs and can last {{for the remainder of the}} dog's life, during which the dog remains infected with the organism. Some dogs are able to successfully eliminate the disease during this time. In some dogs the third and most serious stage of infection, the chronic phase, will commence. Very low blood cell counts (<b>pancytopenia),</b> bleeding, bacterial infection, lameness, neurological and ophthalmic disorders, and kidney disease, can result. Chronic ehrlichiosis can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, <b>pancytopenia,</b> and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Pancytopenia</b> in HCL {{is caused}} {{primarily}} by marrow failure and splenomegaly. [...] Bone marrow failure {{is caused by}} the accumulation of hairy cells and reticulin fibrosis in the bone marrow, {{as well as by the}} detrimental effects of dysregulated cytokine production. [...] Splenomegaly reduces blood counts through sequestration, marginalization, and destruction of healthy blood cells inside the spleen.|$|E
2500|$|Ehrlichiosis ( [...] ; {{also known}} as canine rickettsiosis, canine hemorrhagic fever, canine typhus, tracker dog disease, [...] and {{tropical}} canine <b>pancytopenia</b> is a tick-borne disease of dogs usually caused by the organism Ehrlichia canis. Ehrlichia canis is the pathogen of animals. Humans can become infected by E. canis and other species after tick exposure. German Shepherd Dogs {{are thought to be}} susceptible to a particularly severe form of the disease, other breeds generally have milder clinical signs. Cats can also be infected.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{mutations}} in the XRCC4 gene cause microcephalic primordial dwarfism, a phenotype characterized by marked microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay and short stature. [...] Although immunoglobulin junctional diversity is impaired, these individuals {{do not show}} a recognizable immunological phenotype. [...] In contrast to individuals with a [...] LIG4 mutation, <b>pancytopenia</b> resulting in bone marrow failure is not observed in individuals with XRCC4 deficiency. [...] At the cellular level, disruption of XRCC4 induces hypersensitivity to agents that induce double-strand breaks, defective double-strand break repair and increased apoptosis after induction of DNA damage.|$|E
2500|$|Bone marrow {{examination}} {{refers to}} the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. [...] Bone marrow examination {{is used in the}} diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and <b>pancytopenia.</b> [...] The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.|$|E
2500|$|To {{test the}} effects of the protein {{mutations}} on living organisms, researchers genetically altered lab mice to be homozygous for another mutation in protein related to DNA replication, flap endonuclease 1, or FEN1. The results varied based on the specific gene alterations. Homozygous knockout mutant mice experienced a [...] "failure of cell proliferation" [...] and [...] "early embryonic lethality" [...] (27). Mice with mutation F343A and F344A (also known as FFAA) died directly after birth due to complications including <b>pancytopenia</b> and pulmonary hypoplasia. This is because the FFAA mutation keeps FEN1 from interacting with PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), consequently not allowing it to complete its purpose during Okazaki fragment maturation. Under careful observation, cells homozygous for FFAA FEN1 mutations seem to display only partial defects in maturation, meaning mice heterozygous for the mutation would be able to survive into adulthood, despite sustaining multiple small nicks in their genomes. Inevitably however, these nicks prevent future DNA replication because the break causes the replication fork to collapse and causes double strand breaks in the actual DNA sequence. In time, these nicks also cause full chromosome breaks, which could lead to severe mutations and cancers. Other mutations have been implemented with altered versions of Polymerase α, leading to similar results.|$|E
