5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously <b>polymerize</b> without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but <b>polymerize</b> to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E

The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that <b>polymerize</b> and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to <b>polymerize</b> and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of tubulin in tissues has been developed. The procedure consists of homogenization and centrifugation {{of the tissue}} in a microtubule- stabilizing solution and depolymerization of the precipitated microtubules; <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of tubulin are quantitated by a colchicine-binding assay. The validity of the technique was assessed by electron microscopy and recovery studies with labeled and unlabeled preparations of <b>polymerized</b> and depolymerized forms of rat brain tubulin.

30|$|Either organic {{solvents}} {{or water}} {{can be used as}} medium for TR polymer polymerization. Although water is environmental friendly, we have found that the polymerization yields and recoveries in water are not as high as in organic solvents. In this study, PVBAm and PN are <b>polymerized</b> in benzene, giving higher yields than in water (Table  3). Moreover, when <b>polymerized</b> in benzene, PVBAm and PN shrunk to a clot when heated above their LCST and could easily be removed, whereas when <b>polymerized</b> in water, they needed to be centrifuged before recovery. In another TR ATPS (Table  3), PNBAa <b>polymerized</b> in benzene also showed high yields after forming clots that can be easily collected, whereas PNE <b>polymerized</b> in water only gave 85.8 % yield and needed to be centrifuged to be collected.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that polymerized-type I {{collagen}} (<b>polymerized</b> collagen) exhibits potent immunoregulatory properties. This work evaluated the effect of intramuscular administration of <b>polymerized</b> collagen in early and established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice and analyzed changes in Th subsets following therapy. Incidence of CIA was of 100 % in mice challenged with type II collagen. Clinimorphometric analysis showed a downregulation of inflammation after administration of all treatments (P < 0. 05). Histological analysis showed that the CIA-mice group had extensive bone erosion, pannus and severe focal inflammatory infiltrates. In contrast, there was a remarkable reduction in the severity of arthritis in mice under <b>polymerized</b> collagen, methotrexate or methotrexate/polymerized collagen treatment. <b>Polymerized</b> Collagen but not methotrexate induced tissue joint regeneration. <b>Polymerized</b> Collagen and methotrexate/polymerized collagen but not methotrexate alone induces downregulation of CD 4 +/IL 17 A+ T cells and upregulation of Tregs and CD 4 +/IFN-γ+ T cells.

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} {{offers a}} number of advantages over other polymerization methods and in general. The most significant advantage of plasma polymerization {{is its ability to}} produce polymer films of organic compounds that do not <b>polymerize</b> under normal chemical polymerization conditions. Nearly all monomers, even saturated hydrocarbons and organic compounds without a polymerizable structure such as a double bond, can be polymerized with this technique.|$|E
25|$|Maturing {{can also}} be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after {{fermentation}} but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but it also helps to mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to <b>polymerize</b> {{the components of the}} wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{aromatic}} character, pyrrole {{is difficult}} to hydrogenate, does not easily react as a diene in Diels–Alder reactions, and does not undergo usual olefin reactions. Its reactivity {{is similar to that}} of benzene and aniline, in that it is easy to alkylate and acylate. Under acidic conditions, pyrroles <b>polymerize</b> easily, and thus many electrophilic reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles. In contrast, substituted pyrroles (including protected pyrroles) have been used in a broad range of transformations.|$|E

The effect of sodium sulphide treatment on subsequent amplification was also investigated. Those metal–diaminobenzidine complexes that facilitated themost powerful amplification were subsequently tested in an immunohistochemical setting. The most dramatic amplification of <b>polymerized</b> diaminobenzidine was observed following its post-polymerization treatment with salts of platinum alone, or gold or vanadium with subsequent sulphide treatment, and allowed previously invisible quantities of <b>polymerized</b> diaminobenzidine to be clearly seen.

25|$|In the {{winemaking}} process, acids aid {{in enhancing}} {{the effectiveness of}} sulfur dioxide to protect the wines from spoilage and can also protect the wine from bacteria due to the inability of most bacteria to survive in low pH solutions. Two notable exceptions to this are Acetobacter and the lactic acid bacteria. In red wines, acidity helps preserve and stabilize {{the color of the}} wine. The ionization of anthocyanins is affected by pH, so wines with lower pH (such as Sangiovese-based wines) have redder, more stable colors. Wines with higher pH (such as Syrah-based wines) have higher levels of less stable blue pigments, eventually taking on a muddy grey hue. These wines can also develop a brownish tinge. In white wines, higher pH (lower acidity) causes the phenolics in the wine to darken and eventually <b>polymerize</b> as brown deposits.|$|E
25|$|Carbon suboxide, C3O2, can be {{produced}} in small amounts in any biochemical process that normally produces carbon monoxide, CO, for example, during heme oxidation by heme oxygenase-1.

It {{has been shown that}} carbon suboxide in an organism can quickly <b>polymerize</b> into macrocyclic polycarbon structures with the common formula (C3O2)n (mostly (C3O2)6 and (C3O2)8), and that those macrocyclic compounds are potent inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase, and have digoxin-like physiological properties and natriuretic and antihypertensive actions. Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer protective mechanisms, for example in the retina.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} a network of {{quenched}} random grain boundaries, terminating in <b>polymerized</b> patches containing excess disclinations, destabilizes the flat phase of sparsely <b>polymerized</b> membranes, in contrast to membranes completely <b>polymerized</b> in the liquid state.

On the theoretical side, it has been shown that the flat phase of sixfold coordinated tethered networks is stable to random copolymerization at finite temperatures, but exhibits an instability to possible spin-glass behavior as T ! 0 [2, 3].

25|$|Carbon steel {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. Carbon steel accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. Carbon steel does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, carbon steel must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the stovetop or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils <b>polymerize</b> on carbon steel to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. Carbon steel will easily rust if not seasoned and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. Carbon steel is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.|$|E
25|$|Pyrimidine ribonucleosides {{and their}} {{respective}} nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, cyanamide and cyanoacetylene. One of the steps in this sequence allows the isolation of enantiopure ribose aminooxazoline if the enantiomeric excess of glyceraldehyde is 60% or greater. This {{can be viewed as}} a prebiotic purification step, where the said compound spontaneously crystallized out from a mixture of the other pentose aminooxazolines. Ribose aminooxazoline can then react with cyanoacetylene in a mild and highly efficient manner to give the alpha cytidine ribonucleotide. Photoanomerization with UV light allows for inversion about the 1' anomeric centre to give the correct beta stereochemistry. In 2009 they showed that the same simple building blocks allow access, via phosphate controlled nucleobase elaboration, to 2',3'-cyclic pyrimidine nucleotides directly, which are known to be able to <b>polymerize</b> into RNA. This paper also highlights the possibility for the photo-sanitization of the pyrimidine-2',3'-cyclic phosphates.|$|E
25|$|These buffers {{have plenty}} of ions in them, which is {{necessary}} for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium borate, which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Borate is problematic; Borate can <b>polymerize,</b> and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium borate).|$|E
