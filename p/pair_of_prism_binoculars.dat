40|$|An {{optical system}} is {{described}} for rotating the plane {{defined by a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> parallel light beams. In one embodiment a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> rhomboid <b>prisms</b> have their respective input faces disposed to receive the respective input beams. Each prism is rotated about an axis of revolution coaxial {{with each of the}} respective input beams by means of a suitable motor and gear arrangement to cause the plane of the parallel output beams to be rotated relative to the plane of the input beams. In a second embodiment, two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> rhomboid <b>prisms</b> are provided. In a first angular orientation of the output beams, the prisms merely decrease the lateral displacement of the output beams in order to keep in the same plane as the input beams.

50|$|A paper {{published}} in 2006 by Profs. Alfons Stahlhofen and Günter Nimtz described an experiment which sent {{a beam of}} microwaves towards a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> The angle provided for total internal reflection and setting up an evanescent wave. Because the second prism {{was close to the}} first prism, some light leaked across that gap. The transmitted and reflected waves arrived at detectors at the same time, despite the transmitted light having also traversed the distance of the gap. This is the basis for the assertion of faster-than-c transmission of information.|$|R

Although the phases and irradiances of the beams reflected and transmitted by the beam splitter depend on the polarization, the phase difference between the two interferometer beams vanishes for all polarizations and the transmittance can be made polarization insensitive by suitable design. The interferometer transmits radiant power within a wavelength band approximately two octaves wide, and rejects all other radiant power. The design, laboratory tests, and astronomical applications of an interferometer for the millimeter and submillimeter regions are discussed. An observation of the day-sky spectrum is presented...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} techniques for generating high-energy femtosecond laser pulses directly out of an oscillator without external amplification is based on intracavity pulse broadening due to a net positive round-trip group-delay dispersion.

50|$|The {{inner gimbal}} also carries three accelerometers, two pendulums, and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> The accelerometers {{measured}} vehicle acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes.

The pendulums were used to set the X axis exactly vertical, and the prisms were used to align the Y and Z axes, just before launch. The prisms reflected infrared beams sent into the ST-124 by a theodolite stationed 700 feet away from the launch pad. Commands from the theodolite were transmitted via cables to the vehicle, to torquers in the ST-124 to orient the stable platform toward the correct azimuth.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{to determine the}} preferred orientation <b>of</b> free-falling hexagonal <b>prisms</b> were performed at Reynolds numbers appropriate to falling ice crystals in the atmosphere. Hexagonal plates orient with their c axis vertical for aspect ratios < 0. 9, whilst hexagonal columns fall with their c axis horizontal. A secondary alignment is also observed: regular hexagonal columns fall preferentially with two prism facets aligned vertically and not horizontally – the latter scenario was previously assumed {{to be responsible for}} the rare Parry arc. However, if the column is made scalene in its cross-section, it can orient such that a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> facets is horizontal. This finding indicates that the development of scalene crystals may be key to the production of certain ice-crystal optical phenomena. Copyright c © 201...|$|R
50|$|Dispersion {{control is}} also {{important}} in lasers that produce short pulses. The overall dispersion of the optical resonator {{is a major factor}} in determining the duration of the pulses emitted by the laser. A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> can be arranged to produce net negative dispersion, which can be used to balance the usually positive dispersion of the laser medium. Diffraction gratings {{can also be used to}} produce dispersive effects; these are often used in high-power laser amplifier systems. Recently, an alternative to prisms and gratings has been developed: chirped mirrors. These dielectric mirrors are coated so that different wavelengths have different penetration lengths, and therefore different group delays. The coating layers can be tailored to achieve a net negative dispersion.|$|R

Electromagnetic radiation reflected by a rotating scan mirror is focused by a concave primary telescope mirror and collimated by a second concave mirror. The collimated beam is split by a dichroic filter which transmits radiant energy in the infrared spectrum and reflects visible and near infrared energy. The long wavelength beam is filtered and focused on an infrared detector positioned in a cryogenic environment. The short wavelength beam is dispersed by a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisms,</b> then projected on an array of detectors also mounted in a cryogenic environment and oriented at an angle relative to the optical path of the dispersed short wavelength beam...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} technique commonly {{utilized to}} introduce {{large amounts of}} negative group delay dispersion (GDD) into the beam path of ultrashort laser pulses with low insertion losses is the use <b>of</b> a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> in a double pass configuration.

In this paper we provide an overview of the dispersive properties of more than 100 common types of optical glasses, used either as a bulk stretcher or in a prism compressor configuration. In addition, we present a novel method that enables independent control of GDD and TOD in a prism-only setup.
