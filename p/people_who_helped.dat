5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Several <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>helped</b> establish the Plantations of Ireland also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Yiddish {{theater in}} London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of {{professional}} Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London {{to a new}} level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage. Adler's memoir acknowledges many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>helped</b> him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedler—a playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager—the Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|While {{being interviewed}} by author Wilbur Siebert in 1897, Tubman named {{some of the}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>helped</b> her and places that she stayed along the Underground Railroad. She stayed with Sam Green, a free black {{minister}} living in East New Market, Maryland; she also hid near her parents' home at Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland. She would travel from there northeast to Sandtown and Willow Grove, Delaware, and to the Camden area where free black agents, William and Nat Brinkley and Abraham Gibbs, guided her north past Dover, Smyrna, and Blackbird, where other agents would take her across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to New Castle and Wilmington. In Wilmington, Quaker Thomas Garrett would secure transportation to William Still's office or the homes of other Underground Railroad operators in the greater Philadelphia area. Still, a famous black agent, is credited with aiding hundreds of freedom seekers escape to safer places farther north in New York, New England, and present-day Southern Ontario.|$|E

It was the taxonomical classification of Carl Linnaeus in the eighteenth century though, that generated a firm base for the knowledge to stand on and expand. The introduction of the concept of Darwinism in contemporary scientific discourse also had had an effect on the thinking on plant forms and their evolution.|$|E

When the Chinese helped the Americans escape, the grateful Americans, in turn, gave them whatever they had on hand. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>helped</b> them paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured (POW), but their fate was not fully known until 1946. Some of the men who crashed were aided by Irish Bishop of Nancheng, Patrick Cleary. The Japanese troops retaliated by burning down the city.|$|E
