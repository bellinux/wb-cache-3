30|$|The {{empirical}} {{evidence of the}} effects of <b>payroll</b> taxes on <b>employment</b> is mixed. Some studies use cross-country panels, which allow them to exploit both temporal and cross-country variation in tax rates. Recent studies (Daveri et al. 2000; Blanchard and Wolfers, 2000; Heckman and Pages, 2004) find a significant negative impact of <b>payroll</b> taxes on <b>employment,</b> but Daveri et al. (2000) find no effects for a subsample of Anglo-Saxon and Nordic countries. In particular, Heckman and Pages (2004) find that a 10 percent increase in <b>payroll</b> taxes decreases <b>employment</b> by 10 percent in OECD countries and by 4.5 percent in Latin American countries. However, a major concern is that these studies may be subject to endogeneity problems to the extent that employment may determine tax rates. In addition, they may also suffer from omitted variable bias in the sense that both tax rates and employment may be correlated with other institutional factors. For this reason, some studies prefer to examine the evidence from a particular country by exploiting the variation in tax rates that apply differentially across groups of individuals, firms, or sectors.|$|R

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{and policy makers}} argue that judicial elections weaken judicial independence. In this paper we develop two tests to check for whether eliminating elections increases the independence of state-supreme court judges in the United States. The first test is that if judges become more independent after elections are eliminated, then they should receive additional state resources. We find {{that this is the}} case: state courts received substantial increases in state budget allocations during 1961 - 1999 after elections were removed, and these budget allocations were associated with increases in judicial salaries, and <b>payrolls,</b> <b>employment</b> levels and current operating expenditures. The second test is that if judges become more independent, then they become more willing to make politically unpopular decisions that protect the interests of minorities. We focus on education, because state judges were involved in ensuring that students with disabilities received special programs in public schools following the passage of the 1975 Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA). We find that following the removal of elections, judges protected minority interests of special needs students, and that these protections were concentrated largely in states that had constitutional provisions ensuring that there should be within state uniformity in the quality of public education...|$|R

30|$|For the {{particular}} case of Colombia, {{there are at}} least four studies that examine the role of <b>payroll</b> taxes on <b>employment.</b> Bernal and Cárdenas (2003) estimate the wage elasticity of labor demand to quantify the effects of <b>payroll</b> taxation on <b>employment.</b> They consider a static and a dynamic version of their labor demand equation and use alternative data sources. In their estimates, labor is divided into qualified and non-qualified workers; however, it is not classified into formal and informal workers. When household data are used, the estimates for the static version of the model suggest that a 10 percent decrease in payroll taxes could result in a 4.5 and 5.1 percent increase in skilled and unskilled labor demand, respectively. This estimate is lower when the dynamic version is used instead: total labor demand would increase by 3.7 percent after a 10 percent decrease in payroll taxes.|$|R

50|$|Unemployment {{had changed}} {{very little in}} the period between the end of the 1980 {{recession}} and the July 1981 start of the second, never dropping below 7.2%. Unemployment rose to double digits {{for the first time since}} 1941 in September 1982, and stood at a postwar high of 10.8% by the end of the year. The total increase in unemployment was 3.6%, which was less than the 1973-75 recession increase of 3.8%, yet still higher than the 2.9% average. Because the recession began with already elevated levels of unemployment, the increase easily pushed it higher than any other post-war recession. Overall, the recession caused the loss of 2.9 million jobs, representing a 3.0% drop in <b>payroll</b> <b>employment,</b> the largest percentage decline since the 1957-1958 recession.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{business}} subsidies on the employment of firms in Finland, and explores possible regional differences in the effects. Employment of some 26, 000 firms is followed annually between 1995 - 1998. We find that labour subsidies increase the firms' own <b>employment</b> <b>payroll</b> on average by 11 per cent. The marginal effect of subsidies however, is about 34 per cent. As firms pay, on average, 60 per cent of the <b>employment</b> <b>payroll</b> of a worker in a subsidised job, our results suggest that labour subsidies displace the firms' own employment expenditures. Moreover, the regional analysis indicates that the displacement effect has been milder in the Helsinki region than elsewhere, contributing to the divergence of regional economies. As {{an exception to the}} rule however, in some peripheral areas displacement has also been low. Finally, we do not find displacement or stimulation effects in the application of (i) Investment and Operation subsidies or (ii) R&D subsidies.

The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed.

40|$|During the {{recovery}} from the 2001 recession, the business press and economic analysts used <b>payroll</b> <b>employment</b> data released monthly by the U. S.

The initial BLS releases can differ substantially from <b>payroll</b> <b>employment</b> data that are revised to incorporate information from less timely but more complete sources.; This article highlights the historical revisions to the aggregate nonfarm <b>payroll</b> <b>employment</b> series. Examining both monthly survey-based revisions and the more extensive annual benchmark revisions, the authors focus specifically on how the sequence of data revisions modifies <b>payroll</b> <b>employment</b> estimates from their initial release. The graphs in the article display the magnitude and direction of each revision from the initial estimate for a particular month to its currently published value, demonstrating that the largest portion of enduring change for the estimates occurs in the benchmark revisions.; The authors then investigate empirically whether these revisions contain information that can be exploited to anticipate future revisions. The analysis shows that previous benchmark data revisions are useful for explaining the variation in subsequent <b>payroll</b> <b>employment</b> benchmark data.
