6000|$|... "There {{comes the}} boat," [...] {{observed}} Mr Rudyerd {{to one of}} his assistant engineers, as he shut up a <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope</b> with which he had been surveying the distant shore. [...] "I find it necessary to leave you to-day, Mr Franks, rather earlier than usual; but that matters little, as things are going smoothly here. See that you keep the men at work as long as possible. If the swell that is beginning to rise should increase, it may compel you to knock off before dark, but I hope it won't." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{close the}} window, light his candle, throw on his clothes, and hasten down-stairs, {{was the work}} of a very few seconds. Luckily, the key of the boat-house was lying on the table in the hall, where he had left it, after showing the boat to the Ashford boys; he seized it, caught up the <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope,</b> put on a rough coat, and {{proceeded}} to undo the endless fastenings of the hall-door, a very patience-trying occupation; and, when completed, the gusts that were eddying round the house, ready to force their way in everywhere, took advantage of the first opening to blow out his candle.|$|E
60|$|He had fitted up {{his room}} {{to his own}} fancy, having slung a hammock from the ceiling instead of a bed, and {{decorated}} the walls with rusty pistols and cutlasses of foreign workmanship. A great part of his time was passed in this room, seated by the window, which commanded a wide view of the Sound, a short old-fashioned pipe in his mouth, a glass of rum toddy at his elbow, and a <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope</b> in his hand, with which he reconnoitred every boat that moved upon the water. Large square-rigged vessels seemed to excite but little attention; but the moment he descried any thing with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, or that a barge, or yawl, or jolly boat hove in sight, up went the telescope, and he examined it with the most scrupulous attention.|$|E
5000|$|The pico is a <b>pocket</b> <b>telescoping</b> {{ballpoint pen}} {{designed}} by Franco Clivio. It comes in chrome, red, blue, and black finishes. Like some other Lamy pens, the pico features a small protrusion {{to stop the}} pen from rolling. Lamy also produces a leather carrying case uniquely for this pen. The pen has also won a red dot award for product design ...|$|R
60|$|The sea moderating as the {{sun came}} up, though the sky was cloudy and wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores they had, and to {{overhaul}} what we had. I had a compass in my <b>pocket,</b> a small <b>telescope,</b> a double-barrelled pistol, a knife, and a fire-box and matches. Most of my men had knives, and some had a little tobacco: some, a pipe as well. We had a mug among us, and an iron spoon. As to provisions, there were in my boat two bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw pork, a bag of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by mistake, for something else), two small casks of water, and about half-a- gallon of rum in a keg. The Surf-boat, having rather more rum than we, and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another quart into our keg. In return, we gave them three double handfuls of coffee, tied up {{in a piece of}} a handkerchief; they reported that they had aboard besides, a bag of biscuit, a piece of beef, a small cask of water, a small box of lemons, and a Dutch cheese. It {{took a long time to}} make these exchanges, and they were not made without risk to both parties; the sea running quite high enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazardous. In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman (who had a ship's compass with him), a paper written in pencil, and torn from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to steer, in the hope of making land, or being picked up by some vessel--I say in the hope, though I had little hope of either deliverance. I then sang out to him, so as all might hear, that if we two boats could live or die together, we would; but, that if we should be parted by the weather, and join company no more, they should have our prayers and blessings, and we asked for theirs. We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw the men's heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars again.|$|R
60|$|While Henry was stripping, his eye {{had quickly}} and {{intelligently}} {{taken in the}} facts that were presented {{to him on the}} bay. He had seen, on descending the hill, that the man-of-war had entered the bay and anchored there, a fact which surprised him greatly, and that the Foam still lay where he had seen her cast anchor on the morning of her arrival. This surprised him even more--for, if the latter was really a pirate schooner, (as had been hinted more than once that day by various members of the settlement,) why did she remain so fearlessly and peacefully within range of the guns of so dangerous and powerful an enemy? He also observed that one of the large boats of the Talisman was in the water alongside and full of armed men, as if about to put off on some warlike expedition, while his <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope</b> enabled him to perceive that Gascoyne, (who must needs be the pirate captain, if the suspicions of his friends were correct,) was smoking quietly on the quarterdeck, apparently holding amicable converse with the British commander. The youth knew not what to think, for it was preposterous to suppose that a pirate captain could by any possibility be the intimate friend of his own mother.|$|E
50|$|The {{innovative}} {{design and}} technical solutions of Zapp's camera were patented around the world. VEF received 66 patents in 18 countries for Zapp's inventions. Later in the 60's, Zapp was named as the inventor in several patents granted to Minox GmbH for improvements and modifications of a subminiature camera. On {{the beginning of}} 90's, Zapp patented his last invention, the Minox T8 <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Twenty {{miles west}} of Hell On Wheels, at a logging camp, Cullen learns that the mysterious [...] "Harper" [...] has already cut and run â€” direction, north. Hot on the trail, Cullen spots a figure dressed in Civil War garb, atop a horse. While viewing Harper through a <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope,</b> he sees and hears the man firing at him. Cullen returns fire. Harper strikes first, {{wounding}} Cullen's horse, which ends the pursuit.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863, {{again at}} the {{suggestion}} of Molyneux, Hearn was enrolled at St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. In this environment, Hearn adopted the nickname [...] "Paddy" [...] to try to fit in better, and was the top student in English composition for three years. At age 16, while at Ushaw, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard mishap. The eye became infected and, despite consultations with specialists in Dublin and London, and a year spent out of school convalescing, went blind. Hearn also suffered from severe myopia, so his injury left him permanently with poor vision, requiring him to carry a magnifying glass for close work and a <b>pocket</b> <b>telescope</b> to see anything beyond a short distance (Hearn avoided eyeglasses, believing they would gradually weaken his vision further). The iris was permanently discolored, and left Hearn self-conscious about his appearance {{for the rest of his}} life, causing him to cover his left eye while conversing and always posing for the camera in profile so that the left eye was not visible.|$|E
