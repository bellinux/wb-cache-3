40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} No. 13 lymphadenectomy in radical gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. METHODS: Medical records of the patients undergone <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node dissection during D 2 gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma, were reviewed from March 2003 to May 2007. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients underwent <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node dissection for D 2 gastric carcinoma, of them, 4 (2. 53 %) {{were found to have}} metastasis in <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node. Metastasis to <b>No.</b> 12 <b>lymph</b> node was detected in 6 patients and 4 of them had positive <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node. The operative morbidity except for wound infection was 15. 19 % (24 / 158), and hospital death rate was 1. 27 % (2 / 158). No obstructive jaundice caused by <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node metastasis after <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node dissection in radical gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma was detected during the follow-up study to end of January 2007. CONCLUSION: Dissection of <b>No.</b> 13 <b>lymph</b> node in D 2 gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma is safe with a low morbidity and mortality rate.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of laparoscopic spleen-preserving <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node dissection in a left-sided approach for advanced proximal gastric cancer. Methods The clinical data of 32 patients with advanced proximal gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic spleen-preserving <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node dissection from June 2010 to December 2011 were analyzed. Results Laparoscopic spleen-preserving <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node dissection using a left-sided approach was successfully performed for all patients without open conversion. The mean operation time was 206. 4 ± 54. 3 minutes, mean intraoperative blood loss was 68. 2 ± 34. 1 ml, mean number of <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> nodes dissected was 2. 8 ± 2. 1, mean number of positive <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> nodes was 0. 6 ± 1. 2, and the incidence of <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node metastasis was 11. 6 %. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 11. 3 ± 1. 5 days. The postoperative morbidity rate was 9. 4 %, {{and there was no}} postoperative death. Splenic lobar vessels of all 32 patients were anatomically classified and divided into three types: 4 patients had a single lobar vessel, 22 had two lobar vessels and 6 had three lobar vessels. Conclusions Laparoscopic spleen-preserving <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node dissection for advanced proximal gastric cancer using a left-sided approach is technically feasible. It simplifies the complicated surgical procedure of <b>No.</b> 10 <b>lymph</b> node dissection and leads to the popularization and promotion of this technique. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} histologically proven normal or invaded lymph nodes in the apex of level V. METHODS: Seventy neck dissections were performed in 41 patients with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Fifty-one neck dissections were performed in 30 previously untreated patients (group 1); 19 neck dissections were carried out in 11 patients previously irradiated (group 2). RESULTS: Pathologic analysis was unable to identify any lymph node in 70 % of the apex specimens. In group 1, <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes were detected in 63 %, whereas one or more noninvaded lymph nodes were present in 37 %; in group 2, <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes were identified in 89 %, whereas one or more normal lymph nodes were found in 11 % (p =. 03). Metastatic lymph nodes were never identified. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of lymph nodes in the apex was 30 %. <b>No</b> invaded <b>lymph</b> nodes were identified.

30|$|In {{the current}} case, {{we were able}} to apply thoracoscopy-assisted surgery to this patient because the depth of tumor {{invasion}} was diagnosed as submucosa before the surgery.

30|$|In case of {{preoperative}} {{diagnosis of}} leiomyosarcoma, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by laparotomy are {{the gold standard}} [2].

30|$|The {{current study}} also {{reviewed}} 35 EACC cases reported in Japanese literatures from 1990 to 2014.

30|$|Here, {{we present}} a rare case of poorly {{cohesive}} adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater without tubular structure, the histology of {{which is similar to}} poorly cohesive adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

30|$|Surgical {{resection}} is the first-choice {{treatment for}} malignant endometriosis. Lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination {{have been reported}} to be poor prognostic factors [10, 11]. Patients with either factor may benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. In the case of endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the ovary, the recommended postoperative chemotherapy regimen is carboplatin plus paclitaxel [12, 13]. If the tumor is localized and well differentiated and there is <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis, postoperative chemotherapy may be omitted in ovarian cancer. However, the evidence base for postoperative chemotherapy to treat intestinal malignant endometriosis has not been fully established because of the small number of cases. In the present case, endometrioid adenocarcinoma was localized to the intestinal wall, resection margins were negative, and complete resection was performed. There was <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis and histological examination showed that the tumor was well differentiated. We consulted with the patient and decided not to perform postoperative chemotherapy.|$|R

Forty-six patients who had undergone curative resection for right colon cancer in a recent one decade were studied. Tumors with invasion into the colonic wall no deeper than the proper muscle layer (n = 13) were not associated with lymph node metastasis. Patients whose primary lesions were smaller than 20 mm in maximum diameter had <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis. Patients with 0 or 1 macroscopic type also had <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis. These patients may be candidates for laparoscopy-assisted colectomy. Lymph node metastases of n 0, n 1, n 2, and n 3 were observed in 28, 4, 13, and I patients, respectively. All of 8 patients who experienced tumor recurrence had n 2 or n 3 lymph node metastasis.

30|$|A 46 -year-old male {{presented}} with hematochezia 1 [*]month in duration. Abdominal examination including palpation was normal. The levels of several blood tumor markers were normal. Colonoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion approximately 30 [*]mm in diameter in the sigmoid colon 30 [*]cm from the anal verge. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography {{revealed that the}} tumor was 28 [*]mm in diameter, and that <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node or distant metastasis was apparent. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen revealed spindle-shaped cells exhibiting significant nuclear atypia and a trabecular proliferation pattern upon hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemically, the sample was positive for SMA and desmin, and negative for c-kit, DOG- 1, CD 34, and S- 100. Furthermore, the Ki- 67 index was >[*] 50 %. We thus diagnosed a leiomyosarcoma of the sigmoid colon without any metastasis. We performed laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and regional lymphadenectomy using five trocars. After complete curative resection, a colorectal end-to-end anastomosis was created employing the double-stapling technique. All surgical margins were negative, and <b>no</b> <b>lymph</b> node metastasis was observed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 9 [*]days after operation.

40|$|Background and Aim:We {{investigated}} the prognostic importance of dickkopf- 1 (DKK 1) and beta-catenin expression in triple negative breast cancers. Methods: The expression of DKK 1 and beta-catenin was evaluated in breast cell lines using RT-PCR and western blot. Immunohistochemistry {{was used to}} characterize the expression pattern of DKK 1 and beta-catenin in 85 triple negative breast cancers and prognostic significance was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Results: The expression of DKK 1 was confirmed in hormone-resistant breast cell lines MDA-MB- 231, MDA-MB- 231 -HM and MDA-MB- 435. Expression of DKK 1 in triple negative breast cancers correlated with cytoplasmic/nuclear beta-catenin (p = 0. 000). Elevated expression of DKK 1 and cytoplasmic/nuclear beta-catenin in triple negative cancers indicate poor outcome of patients.
