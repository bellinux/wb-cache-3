It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process. 228 ...|$|E

Moreover, we examine whether the quality standards–export activities relationship is firm size dependent. The findings indicate that while quality standards improve the logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee and the logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee destined for non-EU countries for all categories of firm size, they do not influence logarithm <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> per employee destined for EU countries among large and small firms.

40|$|Purpose- The issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> {{success and}} the ability to sustain oneself in {{international}} horticultural markets have become more critical in the recent global and economic downturn because of its significance to the economy and to actors in the horticultural export chain. The extent of success is even much critical for enterprises. Therefore this study establishes the factors which influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success which measures the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Design- Primary data were collected from 52 managers and representatives <b>of</b> horticultural <b>exporting</b> firms through a semi-structured questionnaire. The tobit model was used to estimate the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success by horticultural enterprises in Ghana. Findings- The result indicates that, manager’s educational level, managers past experience, manager trained in export management, manager’s entrepreneurial orientation, presence <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department, product diversification and government support directly influences the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Export barriers and constraints in accessing working capital negatively influences intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Practical implications- Personnel or personal development in terms <b>of</b> training in <b>export</b> management and build up of experience is important in the quest to improve the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Organizational reforms such as institution <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department and diversifying horticultural export products improves the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. To improve the intensity of success, external factors such as working capital inaccessibility and trade barriers should be addressed by various stake holders. In all government and institutional interventions has been proved to be of the essence. Originality/value- Although various determinants <b>of</b> <b>export</b> performance or success have been established by researchers the factors that influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success is not known.

Within export memory use, four export memory use dimensions have been discovered: instrumental, conceptual, legitimizing and manipulating. Results from the qualitative study based on the data from a mail survey with 354 responses reveal that the development <b>of</b> <b>export</b> memory quality is positively related with quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information acquisition, the quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information interpretation, export coordination, and integration of the information into the organizational system. Several company and environmental factors have also been examined {{in terms of their}} relationship with export memory use. The two factors found to be significantly related to the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> memory use are acquisition <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information quality and export memory quality.
