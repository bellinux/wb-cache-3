Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an accurate method for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> design. This research utilizes the three-dimensional expansion curve coordinates of the follower’s motion track and establishes the planar expansion pitch curve equation with the consideration of deviation angle, which can be easily used to analyze and design an oscillating follower <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam.</b> The deduced equation of radius of curvature is based on motion law of the mechanism and prime cylinder radius of the cam.

To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, a multi-axis machining simulation software was further used to simulate the practical milling operation of spatial cams. It was observed from computer simulation that the tool path of small-sized cutter were within the motion range of a standard cutter, no occurrence of overcutting. Examination of a finished cam component clearly verifies the accuracy of the tool path generated for small-sized milling tool. It is believed that the use of small-sized cutter for the machining of the spatial <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams</b> can generate a better surface morphology with higher accuracy. The improvement in efficiency and cost for the manufacturing of the spatial <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> can be expected through the proposed method.

Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams.</b> According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam,</b> the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cams</b> is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|R

This paper presents a simple yet comprehensive method {{for the design}} and machining of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> with a meshing indexing disc. In the proposed methodology, homogenous coordinate transformation and conjugate surface the-ory are employed to develop a kinematic model for the cam profile design. The pressure angle and the principal curvature of the designed cam are analysed using the analytical expression derived for the profile. The requiredNC data equations are obtained by solving the CNC link vari-ables by equating the machine tool ability function with the tool location matrix. The proposed methodology is verified bymachining the designed <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cam</b> using a 4 -axis CNCmachine.

Previous studies have shown that a brief priming stimulus induces <b>positive</b> <b>motion</b> priming, in which a subsequent directionally ambiguous stimulus is perceived to move {{in the same direction as}} the primer, while a longer priming stimulus induces negative priming, in which the following ambiguous stimulus is perceived to move in the opposite direction of the primer. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of motion priming by examining how retinal illuminance and velocity of the primer influences the perception of priming. Subjects judged the perceived direction of 180 -deg phase-shifted (thus directionally ambiguous) sine-wave gratings displayed immediately after the offset of a primer stimulus. We found that perception of motion priming was greatly modulated by the retinal illuminance and velocity of the primer. Under low retinal illuminance, positive priming nearly disappeared even when the effective luminance contrast was equated between different conditions. Positive priming was prominent when the velocity of the primer was low, while only negative priming was observed when the velocity was high. These results suggest that the <b>positive</b> <b>motion</b> priming is induced by a higher-order mechanism that tracks prominent features of the visual stimulus, while a directionally selective motion mechanism induces negative motion priming...|$|R

The experimentation points out the destabilizing effect of the {{internal friction}} in the over-critical rotor running. Nevertheless, this detrimental influence may be efficiently counterbalanced by other external dissipative sources located in the supports or by a proper anisotropic configuration of the support stiffness. The present analysis considers a rotor-shaft system which is symmetric {{with respect to the}} mid span and is constrained by viscous-flexible supports with different stiffness on two orthogonal planes. The cylindrical and conical whirling modes are easily uncoupled and separately analyzed. The internal dissipation is modelled by nonlinear Coulombian forces and moments, which counteract the translational and rotational motion of the rotor relative to a frame rotating with the shaft ends. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved by averaging approaches of the Krylov-Bogoliubov type.
