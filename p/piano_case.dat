6000|$|Between the {{possibility}} of being hanged in all innocence, and the certainty of a public and merited disgrace, no gentleman of spirit could long hesitate. After three gulps of that hot, snuffy, and muddy beverage, that passes on the streets of London for a decoction of the coffee berry, Gideon's mind was made up. He would do without the police. He must face {{the other side of the}} dilemma, and be Robert Skill in earnest. What would Robert Skill have done? How does a gentleman dispose of a dead body, honestly come by? He remembered the inimitable story of the hunchback; reviewed its course, and dismissed it for a worthless guide. It was impossible to prop a corpse on the corner of Tottenham Court Road without arousing fatal curiosity in the bosoms of the passers-by; as for lowering it down a London chimney, the physical obstacles were insurmountable. To get it on board a train and drop it out, or on the top of an omnibus and drop it off, were equally out of the question. To get it on a yacht and drop it overboard, was more conceivable; but for a man of moderate means it seemed extravagant. The hire of the yacht was in itself a consideration; the subsequent support of the whole crew (which seemed a necessary consequence) was simply not to be thought of. His uncle and the houseboat here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind. A musical composer (say, of the name of Jimson) might very well suffer, like Hogarth's musician before him, from the disturbances of London. He might very well be pressed for time to finish an opera--say the comic opera Orange Pekoe--Orange Pekoe, music by Jimson--"this young maëstro, one of the most promising of our recent English school"--vigorous entrance of the drums, etc.--the whole character of Jimson and his music arose in bulk before the mind of Gideon. What more likely than Jimson's arrival with a grand piano (say, at Padwick), and his residence in a houseboat alone with the unfinished score of Orange Pekoe? His subsequent disappearance, leaving nothing behind but an empty <b>piano</b> <b>case,</b> it might be more difficult to account for. And yet even that was susceptible of explanation. For, suppose Jimson had gone mad over a fugal passage, and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy, and plunged into the welcome river? What end, on the whole, more probable for a modern musician? ...|$|E

The main block, built in 1895, was lauded into the 1930s as one of the city's finest and most modern factory facilities. The southern addition was made in 1906, and was originally six stories in height; the top floor was damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938 and removed. The northern addition, originally used as a dry kiln, was made in 1919. Wellington's company was the last <b>piano</b> <b>case</b> maker to be established in the city.

50|$|The wood of {{this species}} has been much sought after since it was first {{introduced}} to the European and subsequently the world market, hundreds of years ago. Dalbergia nigra became popular in high grade furniture, such as that produced during the Regency period of late 18th and early 19th centuries—and more recently by Scandinavian makers, who produced furniture in the Danish Modern style. This species has also been used in various musical instruments, decorative wood-ware, knife handles and turnery.

50|$|The former Wellington <b>Piano</b> <b>Case</b> Company Building {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Green Street, a short way north of the {{junction}} of Massachusetts Routes 12 and 13, north of downtown Leominster. The building consists of three large sections, all of brick construction. The original central block is a four-story structure, finished in pressed red brick with granite sills, and a corbelled cornice. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and a six-story square tower with crenellated top projects near its center. To the left (south) it is connected to what is now a five-story structure with similar styling, and to the right is an attached two-story section.|$|E
5000|$|The {{moderator}} {{stop was}} popular on Viennese pianos, {{and a similar}} mechanism is still sometimes fitted on upright pianos today {{in the form of}} the practice rail (see Functions of the upright piano's middle and left pedals, below). Joseph Banowetz states that for the bassoon pedal, paper or silk was placed over the bass strings to create [...] "a buzzing noise that listeners of the day felt resembled the sound of the bassoon". The buff stop and cembalo stops seem to be similar to each other in method of manipulation and sound produced. The buff ("leather") stop used [...] "a narrow strip of soft leather ... pressed against the strings to give a dry, soft tone of little sustaining power". The cembalo stop pressed leather weights on the strings and modified the sound to make it resemble that of the harpsichord. Johannes Pohlmann used a swell pedal on his pianos to raise and lower the lid of the piano to control the overall volume. Instead of raising and lowering the lid, the swell was sometimes operated by opening and closing slots in the sides of the <b>piano</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The company's forebears {{came from}} a family in Rudolstadt, Thuringia that built harpsichords. The family was {{subsequently}} based in Neustadt an der Orla, where it took up instrument building. Eduard Steingraeber was born in 1823; he first apprenticed with his uncle, Gottlieb Steingraeber, in Neustadt an der Orla. During his years of travel, he worked {{in a number of}} places, including the workshop of the Viennese piano builder Nannette Streicher, daughter of the well-known Augsburg piano maker, Andreas Stein. While there, he was permitted to accompany Franz Liszt on his concert tours, where he looked after the pianos and grand pianos that Liszt [...] "demolished" [...] at his performances. In 1852, Eduard Steingraeber founded the Pianofortefabrik Steingraeber Piano Factory in Bayreuth. Steingraeber purchased the Liebhardt Palace on Friedrichstraße in 1871 and made it the head office of the company. And it has borne the name of Steingraeber Haus ever since. The company rapidly became the largest piano factory in Bavaria. Steingraeber has also supplied pianos to the Wagner family and to the Bayreuther Festspiele since the festival began in 1876. In 1881, Richard Wagner commissioned the instrument known as the Parsifal bell, which is used in the temple scenes of Wagner's opera, Parsifal. During high volume production periods, Steingraeber's more than thirty employees, including twelve piano builders, specialise in the manufacture of high-quality pianos that are still predominantly handcrafted. The cases are constructed of solid wood and no particle board is ever used. Steingraeber & Söhne even treats the surfaces of the <b>piano</b> <b>case</b> with shellac and wax instead of polyester and synthetic resin varnishes. The company has sought technical solutions to simplify piano playing for wheelchair users and, above all, to provide them with a serviceable alternative to working the pedals with their feet. Steingraeber currently produces some forty uprights and seventy grand pianos per year. Since the company was founded, however, Steingraeber & Söhne has built over 40,000 grand and upright pianos.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the piano teaching methodologies used to train final-year undergraduate performance students at four tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. As {{there is a}} hierarchical relationship among the philosophies, principles, and methodologies of teaching, this study discusses two chief areas of philosophy, five principles, and six aspects of teaching methodologies that were identified in the literature as being important {{in the teaching of}} piano performance. The philosophies include both philosophical ideas and philosophies that are derived from practical experience. The philosophical ideas investigated include rationalism, empiricism, and pragmatism, and the philosophies derived from practical experience cover the issues of inculcating in students an abiding enjoyment and love of music; acknowledgement of the place of aesthetic education in the teaching of piano; recognition of the teacher’s and performer’s roles in transmitting to others musical knowledge, personal insights, and a significant expression of culture; ideally, the need for pianists to be well-balanced intellectually and emotionally and not narrowly focused; the importance of instilling in students a sense of humanity that goes beyond their role as a mere pianist and, ideally, gives them a world perspective. The five principles identified relating to the teaching of piano performance majors include: the need to nurture in students an ability to express emotions and ideas; the importance of pianists producing a considered and appropriate tonal quality; the importance of developing the imagination and nurturing creativity; recognizing the need for encouragement and stimulation in teaching; and committing to quality teaching. These ideas provide the foundation for the discussion of the methodologies of teaching piano performance, which is divided into the six aspects of technique, style, memorization, practicing, acute listening skills (or extending aural ability), and devising solutions to stage fright. The information in this research was collected from the four tertiary institutions in Hong Kong that offer a Bachelor degree in music. The participants included the heads of department, the teachers of final-year undergraduate piano performance students, and undergraduate students of <b>piano.</b> <b>Case</b> studies of the ten teachers’ are presented that include their philosophies, their principles, and the teaching methodologies that they used to teach technique, style, memorization, practice, and the development of aural ability, and {{to solve the problem of}} stage fright. The data from the heads of department, teachers, and students were analyzed, and the findings from this analysis are presented. Models of philosophies, principles, and methodologies of piano teaching are proposed, and recommendations are offered for teachers, students, and institutions to improve the quality of piano performance teaching...|$|E
