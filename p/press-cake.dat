Since the flocculants used {{in the water and}} wastewater plants {{have been shown to be}} potentially hazardous for the human health, it has become necessary to find flocculants less dangerous and more eco-friendly. This thesis consists of a systematic study to investigate the applications of natural submicron capsules (oil-bodies) and proteins extracted from oleaginous seeds for water treatment. Submicron capsules were extracted from different oleaginous sources and their flocculation activity has been investigated and characterized. We showed that they possess flocculation activity for clay suspensions comparable or even higher than the standard flocculants as alum and ferric salts. Moreover, the capsules have been tested for their ability to remove a range of pharmaceuticals from water. The investigation of oleaginous seed materials was further extended to the extraction of soluble proteins from <b>press-cakes,</b> the by-product of seeds after oil extraction. Thus, the flocculation activity of extracts from several <b>press-cakes</b> has been tested and compared to conventional flocculants, for example, alum and ferric salts. Finally, since lab-scale flocculation tests are usually off-line, in order to improve this methodology an on-line quantification method was developed. To do that, a typical jar test apparatus was equipped with six turbidity probes connected to a computer to get online measurements. ...|$|R

It is usually possible to buy H. rhamnoides jam or fruit concentrate, fruit juices and some cosmetics, such as hand cream, shampoo or massage oils. In southern France for example, H. rhamnoides is commonly sold as fruit juice or as an ingredient in non-alcoholic and alcoholic mixed beverages.

40|$|Water {{has been}} {{declared}} a human right by the United Nations, thus urging countries who have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to ensure supply with drinking water for their populations 1. However, supply of drinking water in developing countries underlies different constraints than those met in industrialized countries. An example is the dependency on treatment chemicals that may pose problems in these countries regarding importation and distribution 2. In pioneering work in the Darfur region (Sudan) S. A. A. Jahn has instructed rural people how to use local natural coagulants, {{that had been used}} traditionally by parts of the population, for the preparation of water for household use with special emphasis on the seeds of the Moringa oleifera tree 3. The implementation of water supply for the population on the other hand demands centralized water treatment for villages and cities and thus traditional techniques will reach their limitations. The present work tries to identify and characterise the coagulating principle present in the seeds and <b>press-cake</b> of M. oleifera, in order to produce quantities of a standardized coagulant {{that could be used in}} small treatment works. Therefore, different extraction methods, reported in the literature, are compared regarding extraction efficiency and composition. All extracts contained a large proteinaceous moiety, which differed from proteins described before as Mo 2. 1 (flocculating proteins 4) in the way that two proteins were detected under reducing conditions, both not co-migrating with a synthetic protein having the amino acid sequence of Mo 2. 1. Moreover a different group of proteins with higher molecular weight was only present during the first two days of storage of the liquid extract. An optimized extraction procedure is presented, resulting in a total protein yield of 40 g/L. Separation of proteinaceous components present in the seed and <b>press-cake</b> extracts lead to the determination of relative molecular masses of two protein components present (4 and 8 kDa) which form a 12 kDa heterodimer under non-reducing conditions, such as those found in the raw extracts. Further evidence is presented that the number of different proteins present in the extracts using the reported techniques may be an artifact due to sample degradation, oxidation and reaction with non-proteinaceous substances present in the extracts. The presence of glucosinolates and of their derivatives that belong to the reactive group of isothiocyanates was show in the extracts of M. oleifera seeds and <b>press-cake,</b> thus increasing the risk of protein stability problems during storage of the potential product. Furthermore, a method for protein isolation which reduces interference of isothiocyanates has been developed for extraction from M. oleifera. In order to compare the coagulating activities of different components present in fractions after separation of the seed extracts a miniaturized assay has been developed. Highest coagulating activities were found for the 8 kDa protein chain. Partial sequencing of different preparations of the 8 kDa chain indicated the presence of several forms of the protein having slight sequence differences. The protein chain is very similar to the published Mo 2. 1 protein, but appears to contain 70 amino acid residues instead of the 60 residues reported for Mo 2. 1. These results clearly indicate that the original protein Mo 2. 1 is only a fragment of the proteins present in extracts from M. oleifera seeds. Experiments for pilot scale production were conducted involving extraction of the coagulant from M. oleifera press cake. Different possible technologies for the preparation of coagulant from M. oleifera <b>press-cake</b> are compared. Difficulties were encountered in solid-liquid separation after initial extraction, due to high solid loads and very slow settling, and during concentration of extracts by ultrafiltration. Alternatively tests for percolation of <b>press-cake</b> were carried out, which resulted in high extraction efficiencies. Finally an extraction process using sequential percolation with two different solvents, in order to separate glucosinolates and proteins is proposed, followed by a precipitating concentration step of the product.

One {{of the sources}} of these compounds is strawberry <b>press-cake.</b> This material can be used for the production of dietary fiber or ellagitannin preparations. The health safety of press cake and the preparations that are rich in ellagitannins obtained from it depend on pesticide residue levels, mainly fungicides, which are used for strawberry protection. Aim: The aim of the work was a dietary risk assessment measured by the %ADI (acceptable daily intake) and MOE (margin of exposure) associated with the presence of pesticide residues for the consumption of strawberry processing by-products containing an amount of ellagitannins equivalent to amount present in 100 ¬†g of fresh strawberries. In our study, we investigated the contents of pesticides that are approved for use against strawberry diseases and pests. Results: The total contents of pesticides in strawberry <b>press-cake</b> seeds (SPCS), exhausted strawberry flesh (ESF) and strawberry ellagitannin preparation (SEP) were 2143, 13, 464 and 20, 225 ¬†Œºg/kg, respectively.

The dietary risk to consumer health, which depends on the presence of pesticide residues, in %ADI of daily consumption of ellagitannins (as dried extract (SEP), seeds (SPCS) or flesh (ESF)) ranged from 0. 2 % to 4. 1 % in a dose that was equivalent to 100 ¬†g of strawberries. Conclusion: Although the pesticide residue contents in strawberry by-products are higher than in fresh fruits, the suggested doses of the by-products are lower.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is a systematic study {{of the use of}} oleaginous-seed <b>press-cake</b> extracts of Moringa oleifera lam, hemp, sunflower, rapeseed, strawberry, lime and raspberry as bioflocculants for the removal of suspended solids in the process of coagulation and flocculation. A quantitative method for the analysis of the coagulation and flocculation process was developed to test the activity of the proteinaceous extracts, based on a spectrophotometric assay using kaolin to create the turbid water samples. This method could be used to measure both the initial flocculation activity rate as well as the total level of turbidity removal. Extracts of the press-cakes were tested for flocculation activity over a range of physical and chemical conditions, including initial turbidity, coagulant dosage, pH, ionic strength, and reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and proteases (Proteinase K). Of the extracts studied, all showed significant levels of coagulation and flocculation activity with the exception of strawberry, raspberry and lime extracts. The level of turbidity reduction was calculated and in the order of decreasing activity, the most effective bioflocculants were found to be Moringa, sunflower, hemp and rapeseed. These results indicate that many common oleaginous-seed <b>press-cake</b> extracts show potential as bioflocculants in water treatment processes. The first section of this work used a simulated Jar test assay, which required the samples to be taken off-line and measured in a spectrophotometer. This process made accurate measurement of sedimentation often difficult and was extremely time consuming. This has led to the much needed continuous-reading on-line turbidity meters to be attached to the standard jar test apparatus. Therefore, the main aim of this section of the project was to develop and validate a new on-line quantitative process for the analysis of flocculation activity by attaching six Mettler Toledo Turbidity Transmitter TRB 8300 probes to a data acquisition system (Lab View). Each of the probes was then placed inside the vessels in the Phipps and Bird PB- 700 Jar Test apparatus. Instrument calibration and process validation were examined by setting up a study on a multipoint calibration, limit of detection, and sensitivity. The effect of interfering light, flocculant colouring effects on the readings from the probes, measurement of flocculation rates and change in turbidity was examined. The results have demonstrated that all probes work within a 95 % confidence interval for the measurement of the flocculation assay. This result will aid the efficiency and accuracy of the experimentation by allowing six independent on-line measurements of flocculation and sedimentation activity to be determined in parallel rather than the original single Jar test assay...|$|E
40|$|Carrots are a cold-weather crop {{well suited}} for {{cultivation}} {{in the south of}} Sweden. Carrots are generally rather inexpensive, with a market price below ‚Ç¨ 1 /kg (Sweden, 2003), whereas fresh carrot juice has a price of around ‚Ç¨ 5 /kg. The fresh carrot juice produced today has a short shelf-life of approximately three days, which makes centralised industrial production and distribution difficult, and there is also a high degree of spoilage in the retail outlet. It is therefore of interest to produce a carrot juice with a sustainable high quality and thus a longer shelf-life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of different unit operations on the quality and shelf-life of carrot juice. High-quality carrot juice was defined as a cloud-stable juice with fresh taste, appealing intense colour, high carotene content and a healthy dietary fibre balance. The effects on the pomace were also considered in order to gain knowledge on by-product applications of the waste material and thus decrease the environmental load. Three different two-stage expression lines were investigated. It was concluded that the composition of the juice and pomace, as well as the physical properties of the pomace, were affected by both juice yield and the type of equipment used. The primary juice expressed was found to have higher quality than secondary juice in terms of higher values for colour, optical density, carotene and dietary fibre content. During juice expression the density of the <b>press-cake</b> seemed to influence primarily the amount of carotene expressed, but also that of dietary fibre. The water-holding capacity of the pomace decreased after hard pressing, although the total amount of dietary fibre per gram dry matter increased. Cloud formation was investigated and a combined effect of temperature and acidification was found. Cloud formation occurred at lower temperatures for lower pH. Carrot juice has a pH of 6. 3, and at a pH of 4. 4 cloud formation was found to occur immediately at room temperature. The shelf-life of fresh carrot juice is primarily determined by microbial growth in the juice. The method of isothermal calorimetry in determining the microbial status of the juice was compared with total colony forming units found by plate counts. The results showed that isothermal calorimetry could be used to determine the shelf-life of carrot juice. When stored at 17 ¬∞C the shelf-life was less than 20 % of that under refrigerated storage at 8 ¬∞C, and the shelf-life was found to be limited by the mesophilic flora in both cases. The shelf-life of carrot juice was prolonged by mixing with other juices and acidification. The effect on shelf-life varied according to the acid used, and was related to the undissociated acid concentration. Using combinations of acids had greater effects at the same pH and thus a positive effect on shelf-life could be achieved without cloud formation. However, storage of the carrot juice under a modified anaerobic atmosphere had no effect on shelf-life...|$|E

Despite {{the high degree of}} absorption (95 - 98 %) of the water-insoluble dyes, relatively large quantities remain in solution and must be disposed of with the waste water. This work examined the degradation of the disperse dyes by chemical and electro-chemical reduction. To this end, three representative disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 79 : 1, Disperse Orange 62, Disperse Red 60) were selected in agreement with the company DyStar. For analysis of the degradation products, LC-MS and GCxGC-(TOF) MS were used along with UV-VIS methods. In some cases solid-phase extraction proved unsuitable for concentrating the dye solutions because the dispersing agents contained in the solutions prevented the degradation products from being adsorbed on the stationary phase. Liquid/liquid extraction procedures were therefore developed, which made the concentration of relatively nonpolar products possible. By such extraction, followed by GCxGC-(TOF) MS, the degradation product 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -aminoaniline was identified, which is formed during the chemical and electro-chemical reduction of the azodye Disperse Orange 62. Further degradation products could be identified by precision mass measurements. As expected, the reductive treatment of azodyes yielded aromatic amines as main degradation products. Aromatic amines also resulted from reduction of nitro or amide groups. It was shown in addition that the use of larger quantities of reducing agents and/or longer electrolysis times did not lead to increased degradation of the aromatic amines to harmless compounds. Since many of these amines are suspected of being genotoxic, it is urged that past practice be reconsidered, for it includes reductive degradation for decolourisation, either as a component of the dyeing method (reductive after-clearing) or as an anaerobic step during the waste water purification. The goal must be largely eliminating and destroying aromatic amines, as is possible by oxidative procedures. To investigate the chemical reduction of the disperse dyes, sodium dithionite, sodium borohydride and zinc/hydrochloric acid were used. The degradation products were analysed {{as a function of the}} quantity of reducing agent, so that the course of the reaction could be examined more closely. The chemical reduction clearly ran faster than the electro-chemical reduction. The disperse dyes in the form of the commercial products in water could be converted electro-chemically only with the assistance of a mediator system. If the dye <b>press-cake</b> (containing no dispersing agents) was dispersed with cationic tensides, then degradation could also be observed. Neither of these procedures, however, is suitable for a technical application. The conversion of the dye into a truly dissolved condition gave the best turnover rates in the electro-chemical treatment. Nevertheless, even at a relatively low dye concentration (0. 1 g/L), it was necessary to add about 50 percent by volume of an organic solvent. The resulting secondary burden of pollutants also eliminates this method as a treatment procedure. From the relatively low conversion rate of the electro-chemical reduction in purely aqueous systems, it can be concluded that the particle character of the incompletely dissolved disperse dye and the negatively charged dispersing agents, which coat and/or shield the dye, are unfavourable for the transmission of electrons at the cathode surface. The electro-chemical treatment of real waste water led likewise to insufficient decolourisation, although the measured particle sizes were clearly smaller (factor 30) than those in the freshly dispersed solution before the dyeing process. This suggests that the dispersing agent, which is not consumed during the dyeing process and is thus present in the real waste water in a large excess over the dye, probably has a substantial effect on the conversion rate. On the whole, the electro-chemical reduction as primary step of the degradation of water-insoluble dyes and pigments does not have the desired efficiency. Surprisingly, the concentrations of both the disperse dyes and the vat dyes, to the extent that these were present in the waste water from the dyeing plant, could be lowered by ozonisation. The ozone consumption here was greater than what is necessary to degrade water-soluble dyes; this can be explained by the presence of ozone-degradable dispersing agents. While the fineness of the disperse after the dyeing, when the relationship of dye to dispersing agent is approximately 1 : 100 (before the dyeing this relationship is 50 : 50), makes electro-chemical reduction rather difficult, this relationship seems on the contrary even to be favourable for an oxidative treatment. It is thus conceivable that this established procedure for water-soluble dyes can also be used economically in disperse and vat dyeing...|$|E
