5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> seen playing time otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E

5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E

It was plagued, for many years, by typhoid fever outbreaks. The railroad was built by many contractors. The railroad came through Modoc from the west, and met the contractors, who were building the next section east, in what was then a strip of timber about one-half mile east of where the depot was located.|$|E
25|$|Toshio Masuda {{was born}} in Kobe, Japan. His father was a seaman. He {{enrolled}} in a technical training school, however, his mindset did not mesh with the school's military indoctrination and he was expelled in July 1945. He next attended the Osaka University of Foreign Studies (now Osaka University) where he specialized in Russian literature. There he became enamoured with French cinema which led him away from Russian grammar and towards {{a career in the}} film industry. He thought he would have been bored as a salaryman and that filmmaking would better suit him but suggested he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> followed through had his friends not sought similar careers. After graduating in 1949, he moved to Tokyo to study screenwriting at the Shintoho Studio's Scenario Academy.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Czerkas, Gregory S. Paul, {{and others}} {{have argued that the}} fact Microraptor could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid {{suggests}} that the Dromaeosauridae, including later and larger species such as Deinonychus, were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of gliding, although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view. Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to achieve enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings. These studies concluded that Microraptor probably evolved flight and its associated features (fused sternum, alula, etc.) independently of the ancestors of birds.|$|E

25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> happened had Star Trek not come along.

25|$|This {{favorable}} economic constellation came to {{a rather}} abrupt end around 1670 {{as a consequence of}} two mutually reinforcing economic trends. The first was the rather abrupt closure of major European markets, especially France, for political reasons, as indicated in the previous section. This {{put an end to the}} heretofore secular increase in trade volumes for the Dutch economy. The effect of this stall <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been as serious, but at approximately the same time the secular trend of the price level had reversed from inflation to deflation. The whole of the 16th century, and the first half of the 17th century, had seen a rising price level. This now suddenly {{came to a}}n end, to be replaced by deflationary tendencies that would last into the 1740s. Because of the tendency of nominal wages to be sticky downward, the already high level of real wages in the maritime provinces continued to rise, even though the business cycle went downward. This of course reinforced the trade depression in the short run, but in the longer run it caused a structural realignment of the Dutch economy.|$|E

500|$|The game's mission {{design and}} {{progression}} system received mixed reviews. According to Parkin, the chaos system {{did not make}} sense; Rico sometimes destroys properties which help local citizens. He called most missions repetitive and a [...] "grind", losing their appeal as players progress (although he praised some side missions). Parkin and VanOrd criticized the stronghold-takeover missions. Parkin added that most players <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the patience to complete the settlements, since the island's appeal wanes after hours of play. Marchiafava praised the game's side activities, saying that the diversions increased its replayability. Davis criticized the missions' repetition, but liked their quantity.|$|E

500|$|Kurosawa {{decided to}} write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less {{expensive}} to produce. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail, based on the Kabuki play Kanjinchō and starring the comedian Enoken, with whom Kurosawa had often worked during his assistant director days, was completed in September 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun. The new American censors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly [...] "feudal" [...] and banned the work. (It would not be released until 1952, the year another Kurosawa film, Ikiru, was also released.) Ironically, while in production, the film had already been savaged by Japanese wartime censors as too Western and [...] "democratic" [...] (they particularly disliked the comic porter played by Enoken), so the movie most <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> seen {{the light of day}} even if the war had continued beyond its completion.|$|E

500|$|Legal {{scholars}} have also identified {{benefits associated with}} circuit splits. For example, Justice Louis Brandeis praised the fact that splits of opinion among courts allow jurisdictions to experiment with new developments in law without risking harm to other jurisdictions. Judge Diane P. Wood has suggested that circuit splits and [...] "disagreements with colleagues force judges to sharpen their writing, push them to defend their positions, {{and from time to}} time persuade them that someone else's perspective is preferable". Amanda Frost has argued that negative attitudes toward circuit splits may hinder progress and creative problem solving because [...] "ourts of appeals are generally hesitant to depart from precedent set in other jurisdictions, despite being under no obligation to adhere to decisions by sister circuits." [...] Consequently, Frost suggests that uniformity among circuits may be [...] "overvalued." [...] Likewise, Wayne A. Logan suggests that Circuit splits may also be beneficial by virtue of the fact that citizens in different parts of the country have different preferences for how to structure their laws. Additionally, Judge J. Clifford Wallace has argued that there is nothing inherently wrong with different laws existing in different circuits, and [...] "if conflicts were by their very nature unacceptable, the traditional rule denying precedential status to out-of-circuit decisions <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed its long history." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked {{him as a person}} and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each other}} at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick {{searched for}} a project that he could film quickly on a small budget. He settled on A Clockwork Orange (1971) {{at the end of}} 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of Alex (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick had originally received a copy of Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on Dr. Strangelove, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. In 1969, the decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth was a more timely one; the New Hollywood movement was witnessing a great number of films that were centered around the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people, which no doubt influenced Kubrick in Baxter's opinion. [...] A Clockwork Orange was shot over the winter of 1970-1 on a budget of £2 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an [...] "acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy", and favored his [...] "rigorously symmetrical framing", which [...] "increased the beauty of his compositions". The film heavily features [...] "pop erotica" [...] of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a [...] "slightly futuristic" [...] look. McDowell's role in Lindsay Anderson's if.... (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, and Kubrick professed that he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made the film if McDowell had been unavailable.|$|E
