She later wrote about him for her undergraduate senior thesis and made him the subject of her PhD dissertation at Yale University. After graduation, Applegate signed a <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> for a biography of Beecher. To write a biography with popular appeal, Applegate studied fiction writing, including techniques for suspense and pornographic writing.

5|$|Though {{the book}} {{originally}} sold very slowly, {{it became a}} Publishers Weekly bestseller. The Fall of Reach {{would go on to}} sell more than 100,000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009. The novel's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three-novel <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> for novels based on Xbox games, including another Halo novel. The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003's , written by William C. Dietz. The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie to tone down the character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more a real person inside a suit.|$|E
5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard Law Review {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E

5|$|The Tales series {{originated}} when Phantasia began production, {{based on}} an unpublished novel titled , written by the game's scenario writer and lead programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda. During the story development process, several elements of the original novel were dropped or changed. The game was developed by Wolf Team, an independent game development studio founded in 1986. Due to bad experiences at Telenet Japan, the previous employer of multiple Wolf Team members, the staff sought an independent publisher for the game. After an unsuccessful pitch to Enix, they entered a <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> with Bandai Namco (then Namco). Phantasia had a troubled development cycle for the original Super Famicom version, with many creative disagreements between Wolf Team and Namco. The disagreements led {{to most of the}} Wolf Team staff leaving after the game in order to start a new company, tri-Ace, which would go on to make the Star Ocean series. Remaining members would continue to develop games in the Tales series.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after {{settling}} in Britain Panufnik {{was given an}} exclusive <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> with the prestigious firm of Boosey & Hawkes. They could get no answer from the Polish State publishers as to their long-term intentions for Panufnik's existing works, all of which had appeared under their imprint. Panufnik was therefore advised to introduce small revisions into all his existing works {{in order to avoid}} copyright problems when Boosey & Hawkes took these works into their catalogue. Just after he completed this task, he heard that the Polish State Publishers had finally confirmed that they had no further interest in their catalogue of Panufnik's music. Panufnik bemoaned the time wasted, and indeed the surviving original scores (copies of which had already been sent to some libraries in the West, including Harvard University) show that Panufnik's revisions excised some of the more radical passages in these works. Nevertheless, all the music he wrote before 1955 continues to be performed in the revised editions. For two years from 1957 to 1959 Panufnik's financial situation eased slightly when he was appointed Principal Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra was keen to keep him, but preparing for fifty concerts a year prevented Panufnik from devoting enough time to composing.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, {{if they ever}} want to tear it up, they can hold me but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS <b>publishing</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E

The {{attorney}} Alicia Roman told The Huffington Post, [...] " [...] annul the release due to the fraud they committed. When it’s annulled, all of the rights to Elijah’s songs are returned to my client, particularly the song 'Vida' that Ricky Martin sang." [...] Martin has not made any comment on the lawsuit. Additionally, Luis Adrian Cortes Ramos, a finalist from the first season of Idol Puerto Rico filled a $10 million lawsuit towards Martin. He sued the singer for releasing [...] "Vida" [...] despite claims that he submitted {{his version of the}} track as part of SuperSong contest, a version that was never recognized. Ramos' lawyer released a statement saying [...] "Ramos was surprised, disillusioned and suffered mental anguish because the song was almost identical to the one he composed. Until that moment, Martin was an idol for Ramos." [...] However, Martin's representative never commented on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|In {{its debut}} week in Japan, Odin Sphere sold 59,248 units, {{reaching}} #3 in the charts. It {{went up to}} {{second place in the}} charts the following week. Sales capped out at 96,280 units in the region by the end of 2007. Upon release in North America, the game reached the top of sales charts and remained there into the following week. It was among the top 20 best-selling titles in North America during its debut month, and was the only title in that ranking not to be a sequel or belong to an established brand. Upon its release as a PS2 Classic on the PlayStation Network in October 2011, the game was the best-selling out of five concurrent releases including God Hand, and reached #15 in the PSN charts for that month. According to a later statement by Atlus' parent company, Odin Sphere had sold 350,000 units worldwide during the 2007 to 2008 period, placing it among the PS2's [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] line. The financial success of the game for Vanillaware was contributed by Kamitani to high royalty payments set by Atlus as part of the <b>publishing</b> <b>contract.</b> As of 2015, the game has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Rohrer later {{transferred}} {{the themes of}} Deception onto a framework around corporate espionage and the blood diamond trade. Though not particularly concerned about blood diamonds, and wary of the game being perceived as a finger-wagging exercise, {{he felt that the}} setting would give an [...] "extra oomph to the game's seedy mechanics". Instead of being an overt protest against the blood diamond trade, the game would explore the psychology of the industry through its game mechanics, causing players to reflect after a game on their decisions made within it. Majesco greenlit this, and in July 2009, a <b>publishing</b> <b>contract</b> was signed. Rohrer began work on Diamond Trust of London as a pen and paper prototype to iron out the design before committing to code. By December, the game was in a fully playable state, lacking only the soundtrack and tutorial. Majesco, however, decided to back away from a physical cartridge release, and pushed instead for a DSiWare download version. Rohrer disagreed, believing that the smaller DSiWare market would limit the game's audience; Majesco, on the other hand, was not willing to invest in the manufacturing of cartridges without strong pre-order numbers. The company made the game available to GameStop to gauge pre-order interest, stating that 3,000pre-orders would be necessary for a cartridge release. [...] Diamond Trust generated only 23pre-orders, and in 2010, the Majesco agreement was terminated.|$|E

In 1962, he recorded his first album, ...And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas.
