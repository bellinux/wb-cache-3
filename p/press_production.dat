Discreet talks between Britain and France regarding an association with the Tiger had been continuing since the late 1980s and, although Britain had initially dismissed industrial participation in the project, it was known by the mid 1990s that Britain was prepared to purchase modern attack helicopters from abroad.

In both the Netherlands and Britain, {{a considerable amount of}} lobbying pressure was applied in the hopes of the Tiger's selection. [...] However, neither country would order the Tiger.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the profit}} margins for small presses can be narrow, many {{are driven by}} other motives, {{including}} the desire to help disseminate literature with only a small likely market. Many presses are also associated with crowdfunding efforts that help connect authors with readers. Small presses tend to fill the niches that larger publishers neglect. They can focus on regional titles, narrow specializations and niche genres. They can also make up for commercial clout by creating a reputation for academic knowledge, vigorously pursuing prestigious literature prizes and spending more effort nurturing the careers of new authors. [...] At its most minimal, small <b>press</b> <b>production</b> consists of chapbooks. This role can now be taken on by desktop publishing and Web sites. This still leaves a continuum of small press publishing: from specialist periodicals, short runs or print-to-order of low-demand books, to fine art books and limited editions of collectors' items printed to high standards.|$|E
