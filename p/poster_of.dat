40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of {{research}} of the collection <b>of</b> concert <b>posters</b> from the NMHM collections. It was found that the posters refer to the period of time from 1900 to 2010 and represent a brief chronicle of the musical life of Moldova east of the Prut River. Chronologically and by the method of production, form and content they can be classified into four categories: 1) concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the times of Imperial Russia, 2) concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the times of Romanian government, 3) concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet period, and 4) concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the Republic Moldova. The <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the first two categories contain much text, partly black and white images, are of small size (A 4 sheet), printed on paper of poor quality, mainly newsprint. <b>Posters</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet period are <b>of</b> two types: <b>posters</b> with lots <b>of</b> text without images and color <b>posters,</b> <b>of</b> various sizes. Concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Moldova have diverse formats and images, but provide little information. It was also found that the concert <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the times of Tsarist Russia and the Romanian government are very few, and <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> singers and musical groups, as well as folk singers and orchestras of 1960 s are completely missing...|$|R

5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

5|$|The film is {{referenced}} in Tarkovsky's {{two films}} that followed this one. It is first referenced in Solaris, made in 1972, by having an icon by Andrei Rublev {{being placed in}} the main character's room.

50|$|Alice Russell Glenny is a {{historically}} significant {{figure in the}} realm of late nineteenth to early twentieth century American women artists as evidenced by her presence in American Art <b>Posters</b> <b>of</b> the 1890s. The exhibition catalogue includes prints and posters that are housed {{in the collection of the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art. Glenny's artwork in American Art <b>Posters</b> <b>of</b> the 1890s visually elucidates the uniqueness <b>of</b> the American <b>posters</b> when compared to French <b>posters</b> <b>of</b> the same time period. The insertion <b>of</b> Glenny's <b>poster</b> in this collection demonstrates that women artists helped shape American graphic design.|$|R

5|$|The film {{references}} Tarkovsky's earlier 1966 film Andrei Rublev {{by having}} an icon by Andrei Rublev {{being placed in}} Kelvin's room. It thus forms the second part, together with Tarkovsky's next film The Mirror which was made in 1975 and which references Andrei Rublev by having a <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> the film being hanged on a wall, {{in a series of}} three films by Tarkovsky referencing Andrei Rublev.|$|E
5|$|The teaser <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> Kaminey was {{received}} positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped {{a man and}} one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, and said the trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was tacky, as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the <b>poster</b> <b>of</b> Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, {{revealing}} a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.|$|E
