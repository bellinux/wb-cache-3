For this purpose the evidence <b>parcel</b> and one managed <b>parcel</b> of series no. 3 of Lesakouti for qualitative and quantitative investigation was selected to compare the efficiency of different silviculture methods. For data collecting, Systematic random sampling with a 150 * 200 inventory network was used. The study of qualitative and quantitative characteristics 2 of trees was accomplished in 1000 m circular sample plot and the quantitative study of regeneration was 2 2 fulfilled in 100 m circular micro plot concentricity with main 1000 m sample plot. The results of the research revealed that there was no significant difference between quantitative characteristics (dbh, basal area of stand, height, number per unit of area, basal area of tree) of trees in managed and evidence <b>parcel.</b> Meanwhile the number of very old tree (dbh> 70 cm) in managed <b>parcel</b> is greater than it's in evidence <b>parcel.</b> On the other hand the number of regeneration in different stages per unit of area in managed <b>parcel</b> was greater than in evidence <b>parcel.</b> Study of trees quality showed that the number of tree with high quality in managed <b>parcel</b> is lower than it’s in evidence <b>parcel.</b> Besides the number of healthy trees with dbh < 42. 5 cm in evidence <b>parcel</b> is greater than its in managed <b>parcel.</b> Key words:Control <b>parcel</b> Interference <b>parcel</b> Lesakouti Qualitative characteristics Quantitative characteristics Ira...|$|R

50|$|When a <b>parcel</b> of air rises, it expands, {{because the}} {{pressure}} is lower at higher altitudes. As the air <b>parcel</b> expands, it pushes the surrounding air outward, transferring {{energy in the form}} of work from that <b>parcel</b> to the atmosphere. As energy transfer to a <b>parcel</b> of air by way of heat is very slow, it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of heat with the environment. Such a process is called an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat). Since the rising <b>parcel</b> of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere {{to make up for the}} loss, the <b>parcel</b> of air is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air <b>parcel.</b> The reverse, of course, will be true for a <b>parcel</b> of air that is sinking and is being compressed.|$|R
