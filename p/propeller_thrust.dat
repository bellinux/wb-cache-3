25|$|At 17:10 {{local time}} {{the first officer}} {{requested}} clearance and, after a short delay, the crew taxied to depart from runway 06. With the pilot flying, a normal takeoff {{was followed by a}} normal reduction in power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet the co-pilot selected the anti-icing systems on while the pilot changed to a new radio frequency.

25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into <b>propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E

The new propellers were originally fitted with [...] "Grim Wheels", named after their inventor, Dr.-Ing. Otto Grim.

50|$|Tail-sitters were {{otherwise}} conventional aeroplanes which sat pointing vertically {{up while}} on the ground and, after takeoff, tilted the whole aircraft horizontal to fly forwards.

5000|$|The airboat {{is pushed}} {{forward by the}} propeller, which {{produces}} a rearward column of air behind it. The resulting prop wash averages 150 mph. Steering is accomplished by diverting that column of air left or right as it passes across the rudders, which the pilot controls via a [...] "stick" [...] located on the operator's left side.

50|$|The {{tail unit}} is {{attached}} {{by a pair}} of alumininium centreline booms. The upper one is mounted directly on the vertical engine/rotor mast and is cranked near midpoint to clear the propeller tips. The lower one is attached well below the keel on an extension plate. They support a deep, wide chord, finless rudder, formed from honeycomb composites material and carrying a pair of fixed horizontal stabilizers with small endplate fins. The rudder has self-centring springs. The resulting cruciform structure is centred on the <b>propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> line for dynamical stability.|$|E
50|$|Most powered model-aircraft, {{including}} electric, internal-combustion, and rubber-band powered models, generate thrust by spinning an airscrew. The propeller is {{the most}} commonly used device. <b>Propellers</b> generate <b>thrust</b> due to the angle of attack of the blades, which forces air backwards. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, thus the plane moves forwards.|$|R

50|$|The SAAB 1071 was {{projected}} {{for very}} short distances between small domestic airfields and international hub airports. The design featured a high wing with rectangular plan form, a circular pressurized fuselage for 40 passengers and four turboprop engines in the 800 h.p. class. Development costs were estimated at 100 million SKR {{and the final}} unit sales costs at maximal 5 million SKR. Wings and fuselage were designed to be easily stretchable at low development costs if needed later on. The wing was equipped with simple, single-pivoted slot flaps to obtain high lift for short take offs within 800 m run way. <b>Propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> reversal {{was intended to be}} used for reduction of the landing distance.|$|E
50|$|Known by Helio as {{the model}} H-500 this STOL {{aircraft}} mounted twin Lycoming engines {{on top of the}} high-set wing, close to the fuselage. With the engines mounted in this manner, lateral and over-the-nose visibility were much improved while the propellers were kept clear of cabin doors and away from possible debris damage during rough field operations. This was a tail-wheel design, so the vertical component of <b>propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> assisted STOL take-off performance from rough fields.In 1967 or 68, work was started on a redesign of the Twin Courier in a tricycle-gear configuration for the commercial market, since many firms which desired STOL capability had regulations which required multi-engine aircraft. The company ran out of money and the project was terminated.|$|E

50|$|Ford {{tried his}} hand at {{engineering}} in the company as well. Working along with engineer Karl Shultz, Ford submitted U.S. Patent no. 1749578 for a Ford Trimotor sized aircraft with separate sets of <b>propellers</b> providing <b>thrust</b> and lift.

50|$|On 17 June 2005, the company's sole flying {{technology}} demonstrator reached a rotorcraft milestone, but crashed {{on the next}} flight. The aircraft had been flying at 160 mph when the drive pulley to the propeller drive-shaft bolts failed in flight, reversing <b>propeller</b> <b>thrust.</b> The aircraft was damaged beyond repair but both crew members were unharmed. The accident set the company's development back at least ten months as a small wingless autogyro was not flown until 2006, and the Carter PAV (a subsequent 4-place manned compound rotorcraft, the N110AV) was not flown until 2011. Design of the PAV was begun during 2005. Carter says it has flown 186 kn at 18,000 feet and reached a Mu of 1.13, and Carter has applied to the FAA to change the PAVs certificate from research and development to demonstration.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, {{during the}} Dutch {{decolonization}} and planned independence of Western New Guinea, a territory {{which was also}} claimed by Indonesia, Karel Doorman set sail along with two destroyers and a modified oil tanker to [...] "show the flag". In order to avoid possible problems with Indonesia's ally Egypt at the Suez Canal, she instead sailed around the Horn of Africa. She arrived in Fremantle, Australia, where the local seamen's union struck in sympathy with Indonesia; the crew used the <b>propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> of aircraft chained down on deck to nudge the carrier into dock without tugs. In addition to her air wing, she was ferrying twelve Hawker Hunter fighters to bolster the local Dutch defence forces, which she delivered when she arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea. Karel Doorman was also to have visited Yokohama, Japan during this Asian cruise to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the establishment of Japanese-Dutch diplomatic relations but, due to Indonesian and local protests, Japan withdrew its invitation.|$|E
50|$|With new noise {{restrictions}} {{coming into}} effect throughout the 1970s, an aircraft tailored for this role {{would also have to}} be very quiet. <b>Propeller</b> <b>thrust</b> is a factor of blade length and chord and the speed at which it rotates. To meet these new regulations, the new design used much larger (oversized) propellers geared to rotate at a slower speed than is normally designed. Much of the problem sound from a typical propeller is generated at the tips of the blades which are rotating just beneath the speed of sound. By using overlarge propeller blades, no need exists to have the blade tip reach near the speed of sound, and the speed can therefore be reduced without sacrificing thrust. In reducing the speed, this noise is reduced substantially. The Dash 7 often landed at only 900 rpm speed, and took off at only 1,210 rpm. The propellers on the Dash-7 are constant-speed propellers which change the blade angle to push more or less air as needed. This can be used to change power while maintaining a constant (and lower) speed.|$|E

In this respect a region of half a diameter of the outboard propeller is scanned using a traverse for both the laser light sheet and the four CCD cameras, in addition several measurements are performed at differ-ent phases of the propeller rotation. The fluid mechanical properties of the flow around two different propeller blade settings are investigated and compared {{for their ability to}} deliver negative thrust, i. e. thrust reverse. The first setting has identical blade angles for all propeller blades; the second setting has alternating different blade angles. It is concluded that the latter setting, with alternating propeller blade angles, provides the best flow properties...|$|R
