25|$|The {{partnership}} {{was converted}} into a private company, Galloways Ltd., in 1889, with a share capital of £250,000 in £100 shares. The initial subscribers, who each took one share, were John Galloway, John Galloway junior, Charles John Galloway, Edward Napier Galloway, Arthur Walter Galloway, John Henry Beckwith, W E Norbury and C Rought– all but the last giving their address as the Knott Mill Ironworks. Beckwith, MIMechE, had been a frequent co-applicant with Charles John Galloway in applications for patents and <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> thereof: he had joined the company in his early 20s in 1864 as a draughtsman and, after a brief interlude working for another business in Buenos Aires, returned in 1867; by 1877 he was chief design engineer and he became managing director with the conversion to limited company status; he resigned as managing director in 1897 but kept his seat {{on the board of}} directors until his death one year later.|$|E
50|$|An {{action for}} {{infringement}} can only be brought after grant of the patent, but damages can be recovered under Section 69 for infringing acts conducted after publication of the application, but before grant, provided those acts infringe the claims both as published and as granted, and provided the defendant can be shown to {{have been aware of}} the existence of the patent (or patent application). The protection conferred by publication of the application is known as <b>provisional</b> <b>protection.</b> Publication of European applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications confers <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> in the same manner, provided the application is published in English.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>provisional</b> {{measure of}} <b>protection</b> {{is the term}} that the International Court of Justice (ICJ, World Court) uses to {{describe}} a procedure [...] "roughly equivalent" [...] to an interim order (which can be either {{a temporary restraining order}} or a temporary directive order) in national legal systems. The carrying out of the procedure is termed indicating the <b>provisional</b> measure of <b>protection.</b> Requests for the indication of <b>provisional</b> measures of <b>protection</b> take priority over all other cases before the ICJ due to their urgency.|$|R

The legal basis for protection against unlawful dismissal in Bulgaria {{is to be found in}} Art. 344-346 and 225 (concerning compensation) of the Labour Code. The dismissal is unlawful in the following circumstances: when it is not conducted on any of the statutory grounds for termination; failure to comply with the <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> against dismissal; if the dismissal was not announced by the employer but by unauthorized party.|$|E
5000|$|Francis Preston, {{who was an}} {{engineer}} of Francis Preston & Co, Ancoats Bridge Works, Manchester, was also listed as a director and is also variously referred to as [...] "manager" [...] and as [...] "managing director". Preston had obtained <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> on a patent for [...] "improvements in machinery and apparatus used {{in the manufacture of}} steel and iron" [...] on 17 January 1866. He was also patentee of the above-mentioned file manufacturing and cutting methods, some of them in conjunction with a William McGregor, and in 1862 had opened works at Lime Bank Street for the Patent File Manufacturing Company Limited.|$|E

40|$|Forest {{resources}} {{are an integral}} part of economic, social and ecological development of the state. Making decisions as for the change and improving the system of forestry and the mechanism of management of it should be based on the results of comprehensive evaluation of im-plementation their functions by forest fund. The research is based on application of integrating estimation method to economic objects. The main functions of forest resources include productive, socio-economic, protective and preserving function. The method of evaluation of lamas their func-tions is developed, which is based on the method of integral evaluation and regulation of perform-ing indicators implementation of specific functions. System of indicators is selected, which reflect the performance of the forest resources of each determined function. It was ascertained that degree of execution of their functions by forests of the four most radioactively contaminated districts of Zhytomyr oblast as one of the worst-affected by Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster differs significantly. This applies especially to <b>provisional</b> and <b>protection</b> functions. Key words: forest resources, radioactively contaminated forests, functions of forests, inte-gral evaluation of the functions by forests...|$|R
25|$|In late July 2008, {{human rights}} lawyer Francis Boyle {{recommended}} that the Iranian government should sue the United States and Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{in order to get}} an Order of <b>Provisional</b> Measures of <b>Protection</b> (the equivalent of a temporary restraining order in national or local law), against military action against Iran by these two states. Boyle previously aided Bosnia in filing a similar lawsuit at the ICJ against Serbia on 19 March 1993, and obtained this on 8 April 1993. Boyle points out that he also helped file a lawsuit of this type against the United States in early 1992, and claims that this helped to provide a diplomatic solution to threats of a United States military attack on Libya in relation to the Lockerbie dispute.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 September 1870 he was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps {{as a first}} lieutenant, a rank replaced by that of lieutenant during British Army standardisation in 1871. The 1st Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps was a Volunteer Force coastal artillery unit formed at Leeds in 1860 and armed with 32 pounder guns. Elliott-Cooper was promoted to captain on 5 June 1875 and major on 16 April 1879. He resigned his commission as a major on 27 February 1886 and was permitted to retain his rank and continue to wear the uniform. On 30 May 1874 Elliott-Cooper applied for a patent for [...] "improvements in apparatus for locking railway signals and switches, and for locking railway signals and gates at level crossings", this patent was granted <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> on 26 June 1874.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{problems of}} enforceability of regulatory decisions {{issued by the}} Polish regulatory authority – the President of the Office of Electronic Communications (UKE) {{in the context of}} the protection of the rights of electronic undertakings. The author refers to the standards for implementing decisions and <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> developed in the law of the Council of Europe and Community legislation, including Framework Directive 2002 / 21 /EC. He also analyses Polish legal regulations which introduce European solutions, including regulations implementing Community framework for electronic communications, into the national legal order. Special attention is devoted to the competence of Polish administrative courts and the Court of Competition and Consumer Protection in suspending the enforcement of contested regulatory decisions. The author also points to significant gaps in existing national regulations and postulates the introduction of necessary legislative changes to better protect the rights of telecommunications undertakings. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{predictable}} nature of network transfers in media production industry, advance bandwidth reservation results in higher bandwidth utilization and improved network performance. However, in unreliable networks, this may fail. As a first <b>provisional</b> stage, deploying <b>protection</b> mechanisms {{ensures that the}} schedule remains valid when the system is in operation. Constant monitoring and modification is also {{required in order to}} be capable of dynamically adapting the network to changing conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient dual approach consisting of two processes. First, a schedule is produced by a resilient advance reservation algorithm. Then, the generated schedule is continually updated over time using a runtime adaptation approach. As this step uses the interconnecting network links' leftover capacity, following this approach leads to increased performance in case of steady network conditions, or neutral performance when transmitting admitted requests in uncertain network conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{length of}} patent rights {{is an issue}} of {{considerable}} importance in the design of patent systems, and its optimality has been intensively discussed in the literature. This dimension – taking the form of the number of years during which a given patent has been maintained – has been considered in the empirical literature as a direct indication of the private value of patents. But the lack of comprehensive data on both the renewal of patents and their characteristics has prevented so far any systematic analysis of the determinants of this duration. Relying on a comprehensive dataset including detailed information on all patent applications filed to the European Patent Office from 1980 to 2000 and on the renewal of those of them that were granted, this paper presents a survival time analysis of the determinants of patent length in Europe. The results are threefold: first, they clearly establish that patent rights have significantly increased in length over the past decades despite a small decline in the average grant rate, and due to the dilatation of the examination process and higher maintenance rates. Second, they show that some filing strategies induce considerable delays in the examination process, possibly to the benefits of the patentee, but most certainly to the expense of legal uncertainty on the markets and undue exploitation of the <b>provisional</b> <b>protection</b> granted to pending applications by the European Patent Convention. And third, they confirm that more valuable patents (more cited or covering a larger geographical scope) take more time to be processed and live longer, whereas more complex applications are associated with longer decision lags but also with lower grant and renewal rates. These results have many policy implications for technology markets, patent systems and all their stakeholders. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
