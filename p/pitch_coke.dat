Copper-graphite MMC containing 1, 3, 5 and 10 vol. % of graphite plus <b>pitch</b> <b>coke</b> were prepared by conventional powder metallurgical route where graphite/pitch coke ratio are 50 : 50 (by weight) and 30 : 70 (by weight). The composite powder mixture were cold compacted and sintered in tubular furnace at 900 ° C for 1 h with argon gas. The composites were then characterized by XRD and SEM. It was observed that high hardness values of Cu-graphite metal matrix composite with graphite/pitch coke ratio of 30 : 70 (by weight) as compared to 50 : 50. It has also been noticed that MMC with graphite/pitch coke ratio of 30 : 70 shows higher wear resistance due to higher hardness as compared to 50 : 50. Wear rate and wear volume was calculated {{and found that it}} decreases with increase in vol. % of graphite. Electrical conductivity analysis shows decrease in electrical conductivity with increase in vol. % of graphite plus <b>pitch</b> <b>coke.</b> To study the effect of milling, Cu with 1 & 5 vol. % of graphite powders were milled for 2, 4, 8, 20 and 40 h. The milled powder mixture were cold compacted and sintered in tabular furnace at 900 ° C for 1 h with argon gas. It {{can be seen from the}} micrographs that initially there is an increase in particle size (flake formation) due to ductile nature of Cu. But in later stage reduction in particle size takes place due to strain hardening during milling. In initial milling period (up to 10 h) hardness trend is decreasing but after that hardness value goes up. Milling of initial Cu and graphite powder mixtures result in higher wear resistance than un-milled powder. Wear rate and wear volume decreases with increase in milling time.

The recycled reactor graphite has been proven superior in density, strength, and thermal conductivity.

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed carbon products, using mildly hydrogenated solvents {{to extract}} the organic portion of coal to create synthetic <b>pitches,</b> <b>cokes,</b> carbon foam and carbon fibers. The focus of this effort was on development of lower cost solvents, milder hydrogenation conditions and improved yield in order to enable practical production of these products. This technology is needed because of the long-term decline in production of domestic feedstocks such as petroleum pitch and coal tar pitch. Currently, carbon products represents a market of roughly 5 million tons domestically, and 19 million tons worldwide. Carbon products are mainly derived from feedstocks such as petroleum pitch and coal tar pitch. The domestic supply of petroleum pitch is declining because of the rising price of liquid fuels, which has caused US refineries to maximize liquid fuel production. As a consequence, the long term trend has a decline in production of petroleum pitch over the past 20 years. The production of coal tar pitch, {{as in the case}} of petroleum pitch, has likewise declined significantly over the past two decades. Coal tar pitch is a byproduct of metallurgical grade coke (metcoke) production. In this industry, modern metcoke facilities are recycling coal tar as fuel in order to enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental emissions. Metcoke production itself is dependent upon the production requirements for domestic steel. Hence, several metcoke ovens have been decommissioned over the past two decades and have not been replaced. As a consequence sources of coal tar are being taken off line and are not being replaced. The long-term trend is a reduction in coal tar pitch production. Thus import of feedstocks, mainly from Eastern Europe and China, is on the rise despite the relatively large transportation cost. To reverse this trend, a new process for producing carbon products is needed. The process must be economically competitive with current processes, and yet be environmentally friendly as well. The solvent extraction process developed uses mild hydrogenation of low cost oils to create powerful solvents that can dissolve the organic portion of coal. The insoluble portion, consisting mainly of mineral matter and fixed carbon, is removed via centrifugation or filtration, leaving a liquid solution of coal chemicals and solvent. This solution can be further refined via distillation to meet specifications for products such as synthetic <b>pitches,</b> <b>cokes,</b> carbon foam and fibers. The most economical process recycles 85 % of the solvent, which itself is obtained as a low-cost byproduct from industrial processes such as coal tar or petroleum refining. Alternatively, processes have been developed that can recycle 100 % of the solvent, avoiding any need for products derived from petroleum or coal tar...|$|R

40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed {{processes for}} converting coal feedstocks to carbon products, including coal-derived <b>pitch,</b> <b>coke</b> foams and fibers based on solvent extraction processes. A key {{technology is the}} use of hydrogenation accomplished at elevated temperatures and pressures to obtain a synthetic coal pitch. Hydrogenation, or partial direct liquefaction of coal, is used to modify the properties of raw coal such that a molten synthetic pitch can be obtained. The amount of hydrogen required to produce a synthetic pitch is about an order of magnitude less than the amount required to produce synthetic crude oil. Hence the conditions for synthetic pitch production consume very little hydrogen and can be accomplished at substantially lower pressure. In the molten state, hot filtration or centrifugation can be used to separate dissolved coal chemicals from mineral matter and insolubles (inertinite), resulting in the production of a purified hydrocarbon pitch. Alternatively, if hydrogenation is not used, aromatic hydrocarbon liquids appropriate for use as precursors to carbon products can obtained by dissolving coal in a solvent.

Wettability is normally assessed from the pitch behavior during the initial stages of a penetration test.

NBG– 18 {{graphite}} {{is developed}} by SGL Carbon for the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Company (PBMR), {{and is used}} as the preferred material for the internal graphite core structures of a high–temperature gas–cooled nuclear reactor (HTR). The NBG– 18 graphite is manufactured using <b>pitch</b> <b>coke,</b> and is vibrationally molded. To assess the structural behaviour of graphite many destructive techniques have been performed in the past. Though the destructive techniques are easy {{and in some cases}} relative inexpensive to perform, these methods lead to waste material and require cumbersome time consuming sample preparations. To overcome this problem numerous non–destructive testing techniques are available such as sonic resonance, resonant inspection, ultrasonic testing, low and multifrequency Eddy current analysis, acoustic emission and impulse excitation techniques. The Hammer Impulse Excitation technique was used as a method in predicting the fatigue life of NBG– 18 graphite by focussing on the application of modal frequency analysis of determined natural frequencies. Moreover, the typical fatigue characteristics of NBG– 18 graphite were determined across a comprehensive set of load ranges.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} demand to reduce and control the amount of dissolved gases in steel. Hydrogen and nitrogen are two of the most important gases which when dissolved in liquid steel affect its properties significantly. Several steelmaking additions have been investigated in this research for their effect on the hydrogen and nitrogen content of steels. It has been established that calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime) acts as a source of hydrogen. Carburizers, such as metallurgical coke, were found to result in no hydrogen pickup when added to liquid steel. Addition of petroleum coke, on the other hand, increased the hydrogen content of liquid steel. Ferroalloy such as medium carbon ferromanganese when added to the liquid iron was found to increase its nitrogen content, the increase being proportional to the amount of ferroalloy added. Similarly, addition of <b>pitch</b> <b>coke,</b> which had a significant nitrogen impurity, increased the nitrogen content of liquid iron. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the absorption of nitrogen and hydrogen from the air bubbles entrained during tapping of liquid steel. During the bottom stirring of liquid metal in a ladle, the inert gas escaping from the top displaces the slag layer and often forms an open eye. The absorption of atmospheric nitrogen through the spout eye was estimated for different slag thickness and gas flow rate. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a comprehensive set of equations which could predict the nitrogen and hydrogen pickup from their various sources. Estimates of hydrogen and nitrogen pickup during the steel transfer operations such as tapping and ladle stirring and the predicted pickup from steelmaking additions were integrated into empirical equations. The comprehensive model is designed to predict the gas pickup under varying operating conditions such as the metal oxygen and sulfur content, the total tapping or stirring time, the stirring gas flow rate and the slag thickness. The model predictions are based on mathematical and empirical evidence which are derived from thermodynamic and kinetic fundamental principles...|$|E
40|$|Pitches {{are used}} {{on a large scale}} in the {{manufacture}} of carbon anodes for the production of primary aluminium. The role of the pitch is to act as a binder between the petroleum coke grains. The structure of the carbonized pitch binder (<b>pitch</b> <b>coke)</b> has an important impact on the overall performance of the anode. Even though the binder pitch is the minor constituent in an anode, it is impossible to make a good quality anode without a good quality binder pitch. Pitch is an extremely complex mixture of numerous, essentially aromatic and heterocyclic compounds derived from pyrolysis of organic material or tar distillation. Upon heat treatment pitches form cokes in relatively high yields. Physical and chemical properties of the anode such as mechanical strength, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and resistance towards oxidation by air and CO 2 are dependent on the structure of the aggregate material as well as the carbonized binder pitch. The properties of the <b>pitch</b> <b>coke</b> is in turn mainly dependent on the chemical characteristics of the parent pitch. Coal-tar pitch is the preferred choice of binder material in anode manufacture today. However, the availability of high quality coal-tar is in decline and at least partial replacement by alternative binder sources will become increasingly important in the future. Due to environmental regulations, petroleum pitches are interesting as they generally have lower PAH emissions than coal-tar pitches during baking. Blends of coal-tar pitches and petroleum pitches are in use today on an industrial scale. The aluminium industry must be prepared to meet the challenges involved in adapting binder pitches from new sources which may be of inferior quality to the pitches available on the market today. An increased understanding of the processes involved in the transformation of a pitch into a coke and the link between raw material composition and properties and the final artifact is thus highly relevant. Traditionally, the suitability of a binder pitch for use in anodes, has been defined from parameters like softening point, insolubility in toluene (TI) and quinoline (QI), coke yield, H/C atomic ratio, ash content and density. Although these parameters, which are mostly empirical in nature, give an indication of the pitch quality, more information on the chemical characteristics and carbonization behavior of pitches is certainly valuable. The present work aims to describe and explain the link between “classical” pitch properties, hydrogen transfer properties, information derived from NMR spectroscopy and the structure of the carbonized binder pitch. Coal-tar and petroleum pitches pass through a fluid stage during carbonization. In the early stages of carbonization, free radicals are formed due to thermal rupture of C-C and C-H bonds in reactive components. Polymerization occurs mainly via a free radical mechanism leading to molecular size enlargement (aromatic growth) and the formation of oligomeric systems (mesogens). If the intermolecular reactivity of the pitch constituents is too high, extensive cross-linking and a rapid transformation of pitch molecules through polymerization will occur at a relatively low temperature. In this case, either mesophase will not be formed or the growth and coalescence of mesophase will take place under low fluidity/high viscosity conditions leading to a premature solidification of the pyrolysis system. An isotropic coke or a <b>pitch</b> <b>coke</b> of small optical domains will then be formed. On the other hand, if the pitch has a low thermal reactivity, aromatic growth is constrained and the mesogens will have sufficient mobility to stack parallel to each other and establish a liquid crystal system (mesophase). The growth and coalescence of mesophase take place at a higher temperature where the viscosity of the pyrolysis system is at a low level. Eventually, the system will solidify and an anisotropic coke of large well-developed optical domains is formed. In particular, the presence of alkyl side chains and oxygenated functional groups are considered to lead to an increased thermal reactivity. If free radicals formed by thermal rupture of bonds in reactive pitch species can be stabilized by hydrogen transfer from within the system, extensive cross-linking at a too early stage is prevented. The initiation, growth and coalescence of mesophase are facilitated and consequently a coke of large well-developed optical domains is formed. Hydroaromatic rings and naphthenic rings in hydroaromatic species are considered to be principal hydrogen donor groups. Oxygen acceptor sites are believed to deplete the supply of donatable hydrogen and leave radicals free to recombine. The thermal reactivity of a pitch is thus dependent on both the amount of reactive species and the ability of the pitch to stabilize free radicals by hydrogen transfer. In the present work, the subject of study was five coal-tar pitches and four petroleum pitches. In addition, a QI-free coal-tar pitch supplied by GrafTech International was studied. The pitches were characterized by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, hydrogen transfer properties, elemental analysis and the release of volatiles during carbonization. In addition, the pitches were characterized by more “traditional” pitch parameters like insolubility in quinoline (QI), insolubility in toluene (TI), softening point and coking value. The structure of the carbonized pitches was examined by optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The hydrogen transfer properties of the pitches were evaluated from their ability to donate hydrogen to an acceptor compound, anthracene, or abstract hydrogen from a donor compound, 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin). A mixture of pitch and anthracene or tetralin was heat treated in sealed glass tubes filled with argon gas at 400 ºC. Two different heat treatment procedures were tested. In the first, the sample was kept at 400 ºC for 8 hours while in the second, the sample was heated at a rate of 5 ºC/min to 400 ºC with no soaking time. The major hydrogenated products from the reaction between anthracene and pitch were 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene (DHA) and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroanthracene (THA). After the reaction, the semi-coke residue was dissolved in carbon disulphide and analyzed by gas chromatography. The hydrogen donor ability (HDa) was calculated from the amounts of DHA and THA formed and expressed as milligrams of hydrogen transferred to anthracene per gram of pitch. For the hydrogen donor ability test, the less severe heat treatment (5 ºC/min to 400 ºC, no soaking time) was found to be the most appropriate. The reaction between tetralin and pitch gave one major dehydrogenated product, naphthalene. The hydrogen acceptor ability (HAa) was calculated from the ratio of naphthalene to tetralin as determined by gas chromatography and expressed as milligrams of hydrogen transferred per gram of pitch. For the acceptor ability test, the heat treatment at 400 ºC with 8 hours soaking time was found to be the most appropriate. The release of volatiles during carbonization was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The amount of volatiles released between 300 and 500 ºC (VM 300 - 500) relative to the total amount of volatiles released at 1000 ºC was selected as a parameter reflecting the thermal behavior of pitches during the critical stages of carbonization. Carbonization of pitches was performed under inert gas pressure (15 bar) and the green cokes obtained at 550 ºC were studied by optical microscopy. Computerized image analysis was performed to quantify the optical texture. The output parameters from the image analysis were the mosaic index, which {{is a measure of the}} optical domain size, and the fiber index, which is a measure of the parallel alignment of optical domains. The green cokes were further heat treated to 1150 ºC and the microstructure of the resulting calcined pitch cokes was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The carbon disulphide soluble part of the pitches was investigated by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Results from elemental analysis of the pitches were used in conjunction with the results obtained from the NMR spectroscopy. The main objective of the NMR analysis was to identify and quantify structures in the pitch which are considered either to increase or decrease the thermal reactivity. The coal-tar pitches were as expected found to be more aromatic than the pitches of petroleum origin. A relationship was found between the aromaticity of the pitches and the H/C atomic ratio as determined from elemental analysis. Elemental analysis is a rapid and convenient method to estimate the aromaticity of pitches. Due to a more hydroaromatic structure, the petroleum pitches were in general found to have a higher estimated concentration of donatable hydrogen which will suppress intermolecular reactivity. However, the petroleum pitches also had a high concentration of alkyl side chains which are generally believed to give increased thermal reactivity. Carbon connected to oxygen could not be distinguished in the NMR spectra. Pitch constituents containing heteroatoms are generally concentrated in the heavier pitch fractions which may not be soluble in carbon disulphide. This could be an explanation for the failure in the detection of aromatic carbon connected to heteroatoms. However,the oxygen content was determined by elemental analysis. The pitches could be distinguished due to their ability to donate hydrogen to anthracene or abstract hydrogen from tetralin. The hydrogen donor ability was not found to correlate with the concentration of donatable hydrogen (NMR) which might have been expected. A likely explanation for this apparent inconsistency is that potential donatable hydrogen in reactive pitches will be preferentially consumed by free radicals and oxygenated acceptor sites instead of being transferred to anthracene. A correlation between the hydrogen donor (HDa) and acceptor ability (HAa) was not found. This indicates that the two parameters represent two separate properties where both are linked to the thermal reactivity of the pitch. The ratio between the hydrogen donor and acceptor ability, HDa/HAa, was used as a parameter reflecting the thermal reactivity of pitches. Pitches which exhibit a high HDa/HAa ratio (low thermal reactivity) are expected to form an anisotropic coke of large optical domains. On the other hand, pitches with a relatively low HDa/HAa ratio are expected to have a high thermal reactivity and form a more isotropic (small optical domains) coke. Despite the higher concentration of donatable hydrogen, the petroleum pitches were not generally considered to have a lower thermal reactivity than the coal-tar pitches expressed by the HDa/HAa ratio. The processes taking place during thermal treatment of pitches are reflected in the release of volatiles. A correlation was observed between the HDa/HAa ratio and the relative amount of volatiles released between 300 and 500 ºC (VM 300 - 500). Thermally reactive pitches exhibiting a low HDa/HAa ratio will have a high activity at low temperatures and release low boiling point molecules and fragmentation species. If on the other hand the pitch has a low thermal reactivity, fragmentation species will be stabilized by hydrogen transfer and retained in the pyrolysis system. The resulting thermally stable molecules of relatively low molecular weight may then act as solvating vehicles maintaining a low viscosity in the system and may also be important as hydrogen shuttling agents. When the system has reached a critical stage for mesophase growth and coalescence, these smaller thermally stable molecules (non-mesogens) are eventually released at higher temperatures. The petroleum pitches developed cokes of relatively large optical domains (coarse mosaic). A correlation was observed between the HDa/HAa ratio and the mosaic index (size of optical texture) for the petroleum pitches. As expected, a high thermal reactivity (low HDa/HAa ratio) resulted in a <b>pitch</b> <b>coke</b> of small optical domains (high mosaic index). The HDa/HAa ratio was, however, not successful in predicting the size of optical texture in the cokes obtained from the coal-tar pitches. This was mainly due to the influence of QI material on the <b>pitch</b> <b>coke</b> structure. It is recognized that particulate matter (primary QI material) hinders the growth and coalescence of mesophase. This was found for the coal-tar pitches. Scanning electron (SEM) and polarized light microscopy images taken at a high magnification revealed how the QI particles were arranged and clustered around smaller anisotropic domains. The detrimental effect of QI material on the development of anisotropic texture in the resulting coke was demonstrated by comparing the structure of the coke obtained from a QI-free coal-tar pitch and a coal-tar pitch containing QI. The QI-free pitch developed a coke of large optical domains whereas the coke obtained from the pitch containing QI material had mainly a fine mosaic texture (small optical domains). However, some large anisotropic domains were present in between the QI clusters. It is also not to be excluded that the QI fraction not only acts physically by obstructing the growth and coalescence of mesophase but may also be chemically active. Findings indicate that the oxygen is concentrated in the QI fraction. Solid QI particles with oxygenated functional groups or heteroatomic structures containing oxygen, which due to their large size are insoluble in quinoline, may act as acceptor sites for hydrogen thus increasing the thermal reactivity. The average coherent stacks of the calcined (1150 ºC) pitch cokes was found to consist of between 7 and 8 graphene layers (Lc divided by d 002). The average crystallite size (Lc) was fairly similar for all the calcined pitch cokes but significant differences were found. The coal-tar pitches generally developed cokes of slightly higher average crystallite sizes than the pitches of petroleum origin. The microstructure of the coal-tar pitch cokes is probably influenced by the amount and nature of the QI fraction. For the petroleum pitches there was a tendency that a high average crystallite size was connected to a more well-developed structure (larger domains) at the green coke stage. The evaluation of hydrogen donor and acceptor abilities provides a rapid and relatively simple method to differentiate pitches which can be linked to the development of structure during carbonization. These properties thus reflect the thermal reactivity of pitches and can be connected to the release of volatiles during pyrolysis. However, for coal-tar pitches the QI content was found to be the most influential factor on the development of optical texture and must be considered in addition to the hydrogen transfer properties. Considerations on thermal reactivity from NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis were found to generally support the results from the hydrogen donor and acceptor ability tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} {{study of}} the importance of the pyrolysis temperature (up to 1500 °C) of a petroleum residue (ethylene tar) in the activation with KOH of the resultant pyrolysis products (covering from the own ethylene tar to pitches and well developed cokes) has been carried out. The trend in the porosity found for activated carbons is as follows: the pore volume increases with the pyrolysis temperature reaching a maximum value (1. 39 cm 3 /g) at about 460 °C, just at the transition temperature between a fluid pitch and a solid coke. It is the pitch with highest mesophase content that develops the maximum porosity when activated with KOH. The amount of H 2, CO and CO 2 produced during the reaction of the mesophase <b>pitch</b> and <b>coke</b> with KOH has been quantified, and a trend as described for the pore volume was found with the pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, there is a relationship between the reactivity of the precursor with KOH and the porosity developed by the activated carbon. Since the reactions that produce H 2 initiate at temperatures as low as 300 °C, it seems that KOH is modifying the conditions under which the pyrolysis occurs, and this fact is critical in the development of porosity.

40|$|Workers {{in plants}} {{producing}} carbon anodes for aluminium electrolysis {{are exposed to}} PAHs containing coal tar pitch volatiles, <b>pitch</b> and <b>coke.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the suitability of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene to characterize respiratory exposure to PAH, which is most relevant for assessing individual health risks. Six workers in a carbon anode plant volunteered to take part in a personal air sampling and a biological monitoring programme lasting five consecutive 8 -h shifts to determine occupational exposure to airborne PAHs and urinary excretion of l-hydroxypyrene. Exposure to total PAH for all worksites varied from 3. 99 to 120. 6 μg PAH m− 3 and for benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) from 0. 17 to 4. 88 μg BaP m− 3. The concentration of 1 -hydroxypyrene in post- and pre-shift urine samples was in the range (0. 5 - 61. 8 μmol 1 -OHP per mol creatinine) and depended on the worksite. The Spearman rank correlation test showed a low but significant (P< 0. 05) correlation of urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene in the post- and pre-shift samples with respiratory pyrene exposure. The quantitative aspects of biological monitoring for the evaluation of respiratory PAH exposure were tested with a pharmacokinetic model. On the basis of individual pyrene exposure, excretion of urinary 1 - hydroxypyrene during the working week was calculated for each worker. The results presented in this investigation indicate that biological monitoring of the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene is a useful indicator of a general PAll exposure, but cannot replace personal air sampling for assessing the lung cancer risk of individuals.
