5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> can invoke one of Palmer's real 'heroes', Antonio Gramsci, and say here, now, what {{precisely}} {{has been}} inscribed over against what today (in the vicious circles {{of media and}} cultural production) is merely forecast as cultural hegemony.|$|E
25|$|I {{know the}} case is desperate; but, sir, we must either quit the country or attack Mr. Hamilton. No time is to be lost. Were I sure of a reinforcement, I should not attempt it. Who knows what fortune will do for us? Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E

25|$|The analyst {{went on to}} {{note the}} absence of {{coverage}} of the subject in the Soviet press, which it was felt could only represent a policy position and highlighted the “question of why and {{of whether or not}} these sightings could be used from a psychological warfare point of view either offensively or defensively. Air Force is aware of this and had investigated a number of the civilian groups that have sprung up to follow the subject. One - the Civilian Saucer Committee in California has substantial funds, strongly influences the editorial policy of a number of newspapers and has leaders whose connections may be questionable. Air Force is watching this organization because of its power to touch off mass hysteria and panic. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we,</b> from an intelligence point of view, should watch for any indication of Russian efforts to capitalize upon this present American credulity.|$|E
500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} January 1970, Malcolm Jones {{was shocked by}} the {{substandard}} musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind". Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> were trying to punish him". Waters was more positive: [...] "Syd is a genius".|$|E
500|$|... "Before {{all this}} came about {{we had our}} own method of dealing with law-breakers and in {{settling}} disputes between members. That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't {{know how to handle}} murderers {{and they were going to}} show us." ...|$|E

500|$|Davidson further {{compares to}} early {{attestations}} of the Irish goddesses Badb (Davidson {{points to the}} description of Badb from The Destruction of Da Choca's Hostel where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle, has a large mouth, is dark in color, and has gray hair falling over her shoulders, or, alternatively, [...] "as a red figure {{on the edge of}} the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die") and The Morrígan. Davidson concludes that, in these examples, [...] "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Octopus" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in November 1969 and The Madcap Laughs followed on 3 January 1970. The album {{was released}} by Harvest in the UK, while in the US it was issued by Capitol Records. It sold 6,000 copies {{in the first few}} months and reached number 40 in the UK and was fairly well-reviewed by music critics. Upon release, Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> were trying to punish him..." [...] While Barrett admitted that [...] "I don't think it would stand as my last statement", Waters was more optimistic, declaring Barrett a [...] "genius". Initial sales and reaction were deemed sufficient by EMI to sanction a second solo album.|$|E
500|$|It was {{therefore}} no surprise when closure notices were posted in March 1961. The {{last day of}} regular services was Saturday 10 June 1961 when a pair of C class 0-6-0's replaced the usual H class tanks. The event was recorded by a BBC cameraman who filmed the 09:07 departure from Paddock Wood. The Tonbridge crew had chalked on the cabside of the engine [...] "Shed no tears for the single track, for <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> may come back. And if we do, you can be sure, we'll see you all again once more." [...] Later in the day the trains were lengthened {{with the addition of}} former LSWR push-pull set No. 656 and a Maunsell corridor coach. The same locomotive worked the last 17:00 train from Hawkhurst, while every seat was taken by locals and railway enthusiasts. The daughter of bandleader Jack Payne was on-hand to toast the final departure.|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Garcia {{requested}} that the prisoners perform their Thriller routine at the annual Sinulog festival, a popular street-music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of baby Jesus. The nine-day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession. The mayor of Cebu, Tomas Osmena, refused to permit the request, stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail. [...] "I will not allow it even if Michael Jackson joins them", he commented. Garcia had hoped that, by allowing the inmates {{to be a part}} of the Sinulog celebrations, Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme. [...] "By showing these highly disciplined inmates, <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the mardi gras, but rather, Cebu is about leadership and good governance." [...] The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the Lumad Basakonon, a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years.|$|E
500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E
500|$|For {{several months}} the Allies had been {{planning}} an attack upon Brest, the French port in the Bay of Biscay. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling Marshal Vauban to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably the attack on 18 June led by Thomas Tollemache ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured, and Tollemache himself died of his wounds shortly afterwards. Despite lacking evidence, Marlborough's detractors claimed that {{it was he who}} had alerted the enemy. Macaulay states that in a letter on 3 May 1694 Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to James, thus ensuring that the landing failed and that Tollemache, a talented rival, was killed or discredited as a direct result. Historians such as John Paget and C. T. Atkinson conclude that he probably did write the letter, but did so only when he knew that it would be received too late for its information to be of any practical use (the plan of the attack on Brest was widely known, and the French had already begun to strengthen their defences in April). To Richard Holmes the evidence linking Marlborough with the Camaret Bay letter (which no longer exists), is slender, concluding, [...] "It is very hard to imagine a man as careful as Marlborough, only recently freed from suspicion of treason, writing a letter which would kill him if it fell into the wrong hands". However, David Chandler surmises that, [...] "the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling. In sum, <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> should award Marlborough the benefit of the doubt".|$|E

2500|$|After a {{no point}} weekend mid-season, {{it seemed that}} Haig {{attributed}} the team's lack of success to an absence of young blood on the team, saying [...] "We had no Under 19s and we also {{found it difficult to}} raise our game after the disappointment of (an 8–2 defeat at) Sheffield. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> need an injection of some new players. It's been a bad weekend and I have got some serious thinking to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{code name}} for the project was [...] "GameCom", but Masayuki Uemura's wife {{proposed}} the name [...] "Famicom", arguing that [...] "In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> could {{say it is a}} family computer." [...] Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna which used those colors.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1926 season, Yost {{retired as}} Michigan's head coach, and Wieman was {{appointed}} as the school's new head coach. In Wieman's first year as head coach, Michigan went 6–2 with All-American Bennie Oosterbaan leading the effort. [...] In December 1927, Wieman expressed concern about the team's prospects for 1928 without Oosterbaan: [...] "We have been riding on the crest of the wave for some time, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> are due for a poor season, possibly not; who can tell?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill James {{focuses on}} this {{dichotomy}} between Ryan's {{positive and negative}} statistics. While ranking him as the 24th best pitcher of all time, he notes, [...] "Ryan has been retired almost ten years , in another ten <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> will begin {{to get a little}} bit of perspective on him. Ryan's log of spectacular accomplishments is as thick as Bill Clinton's little black book; his list of flaws and failures is lengthy but dry, and will never make for good reading." ...|$|E
