25|$|Patients with decompensated {{cirrhosis}} generally require {{admission to}} a hospital, with close {{monitoring of the}} fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and <b>pentoxifylline.</b> Administration of saline is avoided, as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{alcoholic}} hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include <b>pentoxifylline</b> (PTX), {{which is a}} nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with <b>pentoxifylline</b> (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered {{on a case by}} case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.|$|E
25|$|First {{reported}} in 2001, pomalidomide was noted to directly inhibit myeloma cell proliferation and thus inhibiting MM {{both on the}} tumor and vascular compartments. This dual activity of pomalidomide makes it more efficacious than thalidomide both in vitro and in vivo. This effect {{is not related to}} TNF-α inhibition since potent TNF-α inhibitors such as rolipram and <b>pentoxifylline</b> did not inhibit myeloma cell growth nor angiogenesis. Upregulation of interferon gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 have been reported for pomalidomide and may contribute to its anti-angiogenic and anti-myeloma activities.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need {{to remain on}} steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, <b>pentoxifylline,</b> thalidomide and infliximab {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) and not very effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of <b>pentoxifylline</b> (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E
500|$|Other {{agents that}} have been {{investigated}} for use in treatment of HRS include <b>pentoxifylline,</b> acetylcysteine, and misoprostol.

2500|$|Intoxication {{accounts}} for {{a small percentage of}} musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, <b>pentoxifylline,</b> propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, procaine, and alcohol. [...] General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combined}} pentoxifylline-tocopherol {{treatment has}} been reported effective in improving uterine parameters in women with POF undergoing IVF with donor oocytes (IVF-OD). [...] Three women with uterine hormonoresistance despite high estradiol (E2) plasma levels received treatment with 800mg <b>pentoxifylline</b> and 1000 IU of vitamin E for at least nine months. Three frozen-thawed embryo transfers (ETs) resulted in two viable pregnancies. Mean endometrial thickness increased from 4.9mm (with thin uterine crosses) to 7.4mm with nice uterine crosses. [...] This treatment protocol has also reversed some cases of iatrogenic POF caused by full body radiation treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Ketorolac can {{interact}} with other medications. Probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with ketorolac. <b>Pentoxifylline</b> can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. When aspirin is taken {{at the same time as}} ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. [...] The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer {{can interact}} with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with cyclosporine.|$|E
5000|$|Like other {{methylated}} xanthine derivatives, <b>pentoxifylline</b> is {{a competitive}} nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF and leukotriene [...] synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, <b>pentoxifylline</b> improves {{red blood cell}} deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. <b>Pentoxifylline</b> is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors.|$|E
50|$|Pentoxifylline: A {{randomized}} controlled trial found that among {{patients with a}} discriminant function score > 32 {{and at least one}} of the following symptoms (a palpable, tender enlarged liver, fever, high white blood cell count, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatic systolic bruit), 4.6 patients must be treated with <b>pentoxifylline</b> for 4 weeks to prevent one patient from dying. Subsequent trials have suggested that <b>pentoxifylline</b> may be superior to prednisolone in the management of acute alcoholic hepatitis with discriminant function score >32. Advantage of <b>pentoxifylline</b> over prednisolone was better tolerability, lesser side effects, with decreased occurrence of renal dysfunction in patients receiving <b>pentoxifylline.</b>|$|E

Current American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines do not include immune-modulators, such as <b>pentoxifylline,</b> in standard treatment protocols.|$|E
5000|$|Potential for {{combined}} therapy: A large {{prospective study}} of over 1000 patients investigated whether prednisolone and <b>pentoxifylline</b> produced benefits when used {{alone or in}} combination. [...] <b>Pentoxifylline</b> did not improve survival alone or in combination.

50|$|Isoxsuprine and <b>pentoxifylline</b> are two {{commonly}} used vasodilators in equine medicine. Isoxsuprine {{has been shown}} to have vasodilatory and red blood cell deformability properties. <b>Pentoxifylline</b> {{has been shown to}} decrease blood viscosity, reduce platelet aggregation, and increase red blood cell deformability. These properties are thought to improve blood flow to the digit, and makes them popular drugs for treatment of navicular disease and laminitis. However, some studies have shown oral isoxsuprine and <b>pentoxifylline</b> to have little to no effect on digital blood flow. The lack of efficacy of isoxsuprine may be partially due to its poor oral bioavailability (2.2%) and high first pass effect. While pentoxyfylline has a better bioavailability after oral dosing, its absorption may decrease with repeated administration. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to reduce lameness in horses with experimentally induced laminitis and has inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), so it may be beneficial for laminitis treatment despite its uncertain effects on digital blood flow.|$|E
