5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple's third visit to the city—and Isabella was {{pregnant}} during the visit, {{just as she had}} been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the Book of Household Management , which was to be titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery. On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Isabella began to feel feverish the following day and died of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> on 6 February at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} whether the preexisting decline in mortality rates from infectious diseases accelerated after the introduction of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic drugs. Linear regression curves showed that in Sweden mortality rates declined faster in septicemia, syphilis, and non-memingococcal meningitis after the introduction of these drugs. By contrast, for the ten other infectious diseases studied, (scarlet fever, erysipelas, acute rheumatic <b>fever,</b> <b>puerperal</b> sepsis, meningococcal infection, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and acute gastroenteritis) no such accelerated decline in mortality could be detected. The findings suggest that antibiotic and chemotherapeutic drugs have not had the dramatic effect of the mortality of infectious diseases popularly attributed to them...|$|R
500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; <b>puerperal</b> (childbed) <b>fever</b> was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|R

5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's {{first wife}} Anna Maria Elers {{gave birth to}} their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, {{at the age of}} 29. Ten days later she died from <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever.</b> Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his {{expectant}} wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and {{there was no mention of}} the conventional waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E

5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever,</b> {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

25|$|The {{findings}} from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of physical signs, which emphasized {{the belief that}} <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> was not one, but many different, yet unidentified, diseases.|$|E
25|$|Infection {{remains a}} major cause of {{maternal}} mortality and morbidity in the developing world. The work of Ignaz Semmelweis was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> and saved many lives.|$|E
25|$|During 1848, Semmelweis widened {{the scope}} of his washing protocol, to include all {{instruments}} coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates time series to document his success in virtually eliminating <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> from the hospital ward.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{impressive}} results, Semmelweis's ideas were not {{accepted by the}} other obstetricians in Budapest. The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, Ede Flórián Birly, never adopted Semmelweis's methods. He continued to believe that <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> was due to uncleanliness of the bowel. Therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.|$|E

Only Lesley and Irma outlived their father. Frost's wife, who had heart problems throughout her life, developed breast cancer in 1937, and died of heart failure in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Darger {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, to Henry Darger Sr. and Rosa Fullman. Cook County records show he was born at home, located at 350 W. 24th Street. When he was four years old, his mother died of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> after giving birth to a daughter, who was given up for adoption; Henry Darger never knew his sister. One of Darger's biographers, the art {{historian}} and psychologist John M. MacGregor, discovered that Rosa had two children before Henry, but did not discover their whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Lusk wrote many medical papers, {{including}} his 1876 paper, Nature, Causes and Prevention of <b>Puerperal</b> <b>Fever,</b> {{which was one}} of the first papers to come out in support of germ theory. In 1882, he published The Science and Art of Midwifery. The book achieved great sales in America and England, and was translated into many languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, Arabic. It went through four editions, the last of which was practically a rewrite. Lusk was either planning to or in the process of writing a fifth edition when he died.|$|E
25|$|The {{death rate}} for women giving birth {{plummeted}} {{in the twentieth}} century. The historical level of maternal deaths is probably around 1 in 100 births. Mortality rates reached very high levels in maternity institutions in the 1800s, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of patients (see Historical mortality rates of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever).</b> At {{the beginning of the}} 1900s, maternal death rates were around 1 in 100 for live births. Currently, there are an estimated 275,000 maternal deaths each year. Public health, technological and policy approaches are steps that can be taken to drastically reduce the global maternal death burden.|$|E
25|$|While {{employed}} as {{assistant to the}} professor of the maternity clinic at the Vienna General Hospital in Austria in 1847, Semmelweis introduced hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions for interns who had performed autopsies. This immediately reduced the incidence of fatal <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> from about 10% (range 5–30%) to about 1–2%. At the time, diseases were attributed to many different and unrelated causes. Each case was considered unique, just as a human person is unique. Semmelweis's hypothesis, {{that there was only}} one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time, and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, Hungarian {{physician}} Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically {{reduced the}} occurrency of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> by simply requiring physicians {{to wash their}} hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the germ theory of disease. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis. Lister's work {{was based on the}} important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised {{one of the most important}} methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies. Pasteur invented the process of pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1880s {{mortality}} rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels {{and became an}} area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to <b>Puerperal</b> <b>fever,</b> at the time commonly known as childbed fever. In the 1800s Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an antiseptic solution before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%. So {{it was concluded that}} it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one labouring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash. It was not until the 20th century when advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would {{play a significant role in}} the decrease of maternal {{mortality rates}} among many populations.|$|E
500|$|Sometime {{during the}} summer of 1842 J.B.S. Jackson [...] "asked the opinion of the Society as to the {{contagion}} of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> and the probability of physicians communicating it from one patient to another" [...] following the death of a physician who had treated an infected woman, and the subsequent infection of the patients he had treated in the interim.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Holmes {{published}} [...] "The Contagiousness of puerperal fever" [...] in {{the short-lived}} publication New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery. The essay argued—contrary {{to popular belief}} at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever,</b> a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient to patient contact via their physicians. Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> had occurred, had {{a moral obligation to}} purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice for a period of at least six months. A few years later, Ignaz Semmelweis would reach similar conclusions in Vienna, where his introduction of prophylaxis (handwashing in chlorine solution before assisting at delivery) would considerably lower the puerperal mortality rate.|$|E
500|$|The {{teaching}} of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen from 1863 to 1889. He {{was responsible for}} setting up the system of three years of [...] "pre-clinical" [...] academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the Tay Whale. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the {{teaching of}} anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> and he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.|$|E
500|$|Although {{his essay}} on <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> has been deemed [...] "the most {{important}} contribution made in America {{to the advancement}} of medicine" [...] up to that time, Holmes is most famous as a humorist and poet. Editor and critic George Ripley, an admirer of Holmes, referred to him as [...] "one of the wittiest and most original of modern poets". Emerson noted that, though Holmes did not renew his focus on poetry until later in his life, he quickly perfected his role [...] "like old pear trees which have done nothing for ten years, and at last begin to grow great." ...|$|E
500|$|Though it largely escaped {{notice when}} first published, Holmes {{eventually}} {{came under attack}} by two distinguished professors of obstetrics—Hugh L. Hodge and Charles D. Meigs—who adamantly denied his theory of contagion. In 1855, Holmes chose to republish the essay {{in the form of}} a pamphlet under the new title <b>Puerperal</b> <b>Fever</b> as a Private Pestilence. In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease." [...] He added, [...] "I beg to be heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them." [...] The then controversial work is now considered a landmark in germ theory of disease.|$|E
500|$|Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Holmes {{was educated}} at Phillips Academy and Harvard College. After graduating from Harvard in 1829, he briefly studied law {{before turning to}} the medical profession. He began writing poetry at an early age; {{one of his most}} famous works, [...] "Old Ironsides", was {{published}} in 1830 and was influential in the eventual preservation of the USS Constitution. Following training at the prestigious medical schools of Paris, Holmes was granted his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1836. He taught at Dartmouth Medical School before returning to teach at Harvard and, for a time, served as dean there. During his long professorship, he became an advocate for various medical reforms and notably posited the controversial idea that doctors were capable of carrying <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> from patient to patient. Holmes retired from Harvard in 1882 and continued writing poetry, novels and essays until his death in 1894.|$|E
500|$|Suffering from exhaustion, and {{mourning}} the sudden {{death of his}} youngest son, Holmes began postponing his writing and social engagements. In late 1884, he embarked on a visit to Europe with his daughter Amelia. In Great Britain he met with writers such as Henry James, George du Maurier and Alfred Tennyson, and was awarded a doctor of letters degree (D.Litt.) from Cambridge University, a doctor of laws (LL.D.) from Edinburgh University, and a third honorary degree from Oxford. Holmes and Amelia then visited Paris, a place that had significantly influenced him in his earlier years. He met with chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, whose previous studies in germ theory had helped reduce the mortality rate of women suffering from <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever.</b> Holmes considered the Frenchman to be [...] "one of the truest benefactors of his race". Upon his return to the United States, Holmes published a travelogue entitled Our One Hundred Days in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Surrounded by Boston's {{literary}} elite—which included friends such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell—Holmes made {{an indelible}} imprint on the literary {{world of the}} 19th century. Many of his works were published in The Atlantic Monthly, a magazine that he named. For his literary achievements and other accomplishments, he was awarded numerous honorary degrees from universities around the world. Holmes's writing often commemorated his native Boston area, {{and much of it}} was meant to be humorous or conversational. Some of his medical writings, notably his 1843 essay regarding the contagiousness of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever,</b> were considered innovative for their time. He was often called upon to issue occasional poetry, or poems written specifically for an event, including many occasions at Harvard. Holmes also popularized several terms, including [...] "Boston Brahmin" [...] and [...] "anesthesia". He is the father of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. of the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1857, {{less than}} a year after the wedding, Isabella began writing for one of her husband's publications, The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. She {{translated}} French fiction and wrote the cookery column, though all the recipes were plagiarised from other works or sent in by the magazine's readers. In 1859 the Beetons launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements to The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine; the 24 instalments [...] were published in one volume as Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management in October 1861, which sold 60,000 copies in the first year. Isabella was working on an abridged version of her book, which was to be titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery, when she died of <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> in February 1865 at the age of 28. She gave birth to four children, two of whom died in infancy, and had several miscarriages. Two of her biographers, Nancy Spain and Kathryn Hughes, posit the theory that Samuel had unknowingly contracted syphilis in a premarital liaison with a prostitute, and had unwittingly passed the disease on to his wife.|$|E
2500|$|He {{excluded}} [...] "overcrowding" [...] as a cause, {{since the}} Second Clinic was always more crowded {{and yet the}} mortality was lower. He eliminated climate as a cause because the climate was the same. The breakthrough occurred in 1847, {{following the death of}} his good friend Jakob Kolletschka, who had been accidentally poked with a student's scalpel while performing a post mortem examination. Kolletschka's own autopsy showed a pathology {{similar to that of the}} women who were dying from <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever.</b> Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between cadaveric contamination and <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Semmelweis {{demonstrated}} {{that the incidence of}} <b>puerperal</b> <b>fever</b> (also known as childbed fever) could be drastically reduced by appropriate hand washing by medical care-givers.

2500|$|Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis ( [...] ; 1 July 1818– 13 August 1865) was a Hungarian {{physician}} of ethnic-German ancestry, {{now known}} as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures.
