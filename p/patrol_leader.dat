5|$|The {{youth leader}} of the troop is the senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> (SPL), elected by the Scouts in the troop. He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of the troop, runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> who then appoints an assistant <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader,</b> assistant senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E

5|$|A second {{experimental}} {{course was}} held at Philmont in New Mexico beginning on June 17, 1967. Bob Perin was Scoutmaster, Louis Adin of the Circle Ten Council in Dallas was senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader,</b> and John Larson was assistant senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader.</b> Participants were primarily from the councils who would conduct {{the next step in}} laboratory-testing the new program. One month later, on July 18, the Circle Ten Council presented its first new Wood Badge program at Philmont, while Bob Perin and John Larson watched from the sidelines.|$|E

5|$|The {{first four}} {{sections}} (Beavers to Explorers) {{are led by}} a Section Leader and aided by Assistant Leaders, Sectional Assistants, Occasional Helpers and Young Leaders, who are Explorer Scouts trained in leadership techniques. Scout Networks are mainly member led, but are assisted by a Network Leader who ensures that the Network is working within {{the rules of the}} association. In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group of members, such as the <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> and Assistant <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader,</b> usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, {{and the members of the}} Explorer section are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.|$|E

Every patrol in camp sends two scouts {{to pick up their}} meal ingredients for each meal from the Commissary. At every meal <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders</b> and senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders</b> are put to the test... preparation and training goes into a successful days. Scouts are put to the test in meal setup, preparation, cooking and clean-up.|$|R

5|$|Among {{these was}} an {{experimental}} Wood Badge course in Monterey in 1968. Bánáthy was Course Director, Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster, and Fran Petersen was senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader.</b> John Larson, National Director of Education, was also present. All attendees {{were asked to}} bring their entire troop to a single week of summer camp, allowing the Wood Badge staff to use the summer camp as an application for Wood Badge.|$|E
5|$|In October 1967 the <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> Training Unit {{was formed}} to offer formal Leadership Training courses for Scout Patrol Leaders in the then Natal Division. The nine members {{comprising}} the original Unit were Dudley Forde , Fr Ian Laurenson, Lynn Reynolds, Paddy McDowell, Paul and Helen Bezencon, Ian Hoare, Tony Hornby and Bill Sewell.|$|E
5|$|On the {{successful}} completion of a PLTU course a Scout is entitled to wear a PLTU woggle (which is made by the Scout while on the course) and to wear a special PLTU badge on their uniform. Many Troops also require a Scout to complete a PLTU course before allowing them to become a <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader.</b>|$|E

50|$|Like most German Scout associations, the VCP {{emphasizes}} on youth leadership. Most <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders</b> start at 16 and most leaders up to district level are younger than 25.|$|R
50|$|The <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders</b> {{were given}} more {{responsibility}} {{than at the}} previous Jamboree and had to manage their own timetable and their patrol without an adult leader with them.|$|R
5|$|Scout Troops {{are divided}} into Patrols of between four and ten Scouts, with six being a common size. The <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> and Second have many {{responsibilities}} in training younger Scouts and helping plan and run the programme. Patrol Leaders {{are in charge of}} planning and running (often with no adult intervention) Patrol camps and outings, they are also required to assist their Patrol members through the Scout advancement program.|$|E
5|$|The troop {{program and}} {{activities}} {{are determined by}} the senior <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> and the patrol leaders council under the oversight of the Scoutmaster. Troops generally hold meetings weekly, although they can be irregular during the summer. Troop meeting activities may vary from training in Scout skills to planning camping trips or playing games.|$|E
5|$|As {{this was}} the first Boy Scouting event, the boys did not have uniform shirts, but they did wear khaki scarves and were {{presented}} with brass fleur-de-lis badges, the first use of the Scout emblem. They also wore a coloured knot on their shoulder indicating their patrol: green for Bulls, blue for Wolves, yellow for Curlews, and red for Ravens. The <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> carried a staff with a flag depicting the patrol animal. After passing tests on knots, tracking, and the national flag, they were given another brass badge, a scroll with the words Be Prepared, to wear below the fleur-de-lis.|$|E
5000|$|Many Scouting {{organizations}} use {{the term}} [...] "Court of Honor" [...] {{to refer to a}} meeting of <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leaders</b> in the Scout troop to plan activities with their Scout Leaders.|$|R
50|$|When war {{came again}} in 1939, Scouts carried on under the {{direction}} of their <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders,</b> and undertook service tasks. Including acting as messengers, fire watchers, stretcher bearers, salvage collectors, etc.|$|R
50|$|Within the Troop, the <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leaders</b> hold {{a regular}} council {{and are able}} to plan and run {{activities}} and deal with matters of discipline under the guidance of the Scout Master.|$|R
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|Often {{the most}} senior and {{responsible}} <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), who no longer runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme. Since a Troop Leader {{is not required to}} plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts who are in their final year of school choose to become Troop Leaders to have more time to concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} what was to become the <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leader</b> {{training}} Unit courses was run at Lexden— Natal Gilwell Scout Training Camp in July 1959, under the leadership of Dudley Forde, with 19 Scouts from the 2nd Durban Y.M.C.A. Scout Group in attendance. Courses were offered to boys from the same Group {{over the next five years}} until the 6th Course in October 1964 which was opened to participants from South Durban District.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Patrol</b> <b>Leaders</b> Camp, {{ran from}} 26 until 28 July 2007, {{was the first}} of the four camps and {{involved}} Scouts from the United Kingdom engaging in activities such as sea kayaking.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, the Associação Guias de Portugal {{held the}} first encampment for Ramos Adventurer and Caravel <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders</b> and deputies in Belmonte. This camp was also {{attended}} by Mozambique Guides and Guides from São Tomé and Príncipe.|$|R
50|$|The Girl Guide uniform {{consisted}} of a royal blue longyi, white blouse with royal blue buttons, a Guide company neckerchief in company colors, royal blue shoulder tabs, and for <b>patrol</b> <b>leaders,</b> royal blue stripes, completed with black slippers.|$|R
5|$|Boy Scouts {{learn to}} use the ideals {{spelled out in the}} Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected <b>patrol</b> <b>leader.</b> Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout <b>patrol</b> <b>leader,</b> the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt {{worked at}} a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an {{instructor}} in American Indian dance. He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a <b>patrol</b> <b>leader</b> and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E
50|$|Later, Rouge's split {{personality}} manifested again, {{with her}} good personality occasionally appearing.
