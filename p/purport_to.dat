5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, the Court {{struck down}} {{part of the}} federal Defense of Marriage Act, in United States v. Windsor.

The Court did not <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.

25|$|Similarly, other {{researchers}} have raised concerns {{about the extent to}} which self-report EI measures correlate with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> measure personality traits. Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the Big Five that stand out as most related to self-report EI– neuroticism and extroversion. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and anxiety. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.|$|E

25|$|The pages <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> {{be three}} {{computer}} printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace {{was in the}} studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the afternoon Shakur was shot.

But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said.|$|E
25|$|Ponce's {{rewards for}} these various {{services}} were extensive. There are two false documents dated to 25 January and 14 June 1141 which <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> record royal donations to Ponce. The {{first is the}} donation of Quiro, which occurred {{on the occasion of}} his betrothal according to the account of the pesquisa of 1207. The second is the donation of San Pedro del Páramo, which it is known that Ponce gave to his wife as part of her bridewealth. The above charters are classified as spurious because they name Alfonso VII as ruling in Baeza and Almería, places he did not conquer until 1147, and they list Martin, Archbishop of Santiago, as confirming. They nevertheless contain a kernel of truth. More securely datable is Alfonso's grant to Ponce the village of Villaverde de Sandoval, {{on the bank of the}} Porma near the possessions which he had given his wife at their marriage, in 1142.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion that}} Rognvald could {{hand over his}} Northern Isles estates to his brother has been {{interpreted}} in various ways. For example, {{it may be that}} he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing. This is also {{one of a number of}} instances in which the writer of the Orkneyinga saga attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald's transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald's holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to be rooted in the writer's interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> describe.|$|E
25|$|Somerled's origins are masked in obscurity and myth. Although no {{contemporary}} pedigree {{exists that}} outlines his ancestry, {{there are over}} a dozen later medieval, early modern, and modern sources that <b>purport</b> <b>to</b> outline Somerled's patrilineal descent. The names that these sources give for his father (GilleBride) and paternal grandfather (GilleAdamnan) appear to be corroborated in patronymic forms recorded in the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster. The names in preceding generations, however, become more unusual, and the more authoritative sources begin to contradict each other. In consequence, two or three generations may be the furthest that Somerled's patrilineal lineage can be traced {{with any degree of}} accuracy. Somerled was almost certainly of Norse–Gaelic ancestry, and nothing is known of his early life. The History of the MacDonalds and the Book of Clanranald relate that his immediate ancestors were prominent in Argyll before being unjustly ejected by Scandinavians and Scots. Although these specific claims concerning his ancestors cannot be corroborated, Somerled's eventual marriage to a daughter of a reigning King of the Isles, and the marriage of one of the former's immediate kinswomen to the son of a King of Scotland, suggests that Somerled belonged to a family of considerable status.|$|E
