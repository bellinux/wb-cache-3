40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} p 53 tumor suppressor protein plays {{an essential role in}} the induction of tetraploid G 1 arrest in response to perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton, termed actin damage. In this study, we investigated the role of p 53, ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM), and catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) in tetraploid G 1 arrest induced by actin damage. Treatment with actin-damaging agents including pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX- 2) increases phosphorylation of Ser- 15 and Ser- 37 residues of p 53, but not Ser- 20 residue. Knockdown of ATM and DNA-PKcs do not affect p 53 phosphorylation induced by actin damage. However, while ATM knockdown does not affect tetraploid G 1 arrest, knockdown of DNA-PKcs not only perturbs tetraploid G 1 arrest, but also results in formation of <b>polyploidy</b> and <b>induction</b> of apoptosis. These results indicate that DNA-PKcs is essential for the maintenance of actin damage induced-tetraploid G 1 arrest in a p 53 -independent manner. Furthermore, actin damage-induced p 53 expression is not observed in cells synchronized at G 1 /S of the cell cycle, implying that p 53 induction is due to actin damage-induced tetraploidy rather than perturbation of actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, these results suggest that p 53 and DNA-PKcs independently function for tetraploid G 1 arrest and preventing polyploidy formation...|$|R

The first experiment was factorial, based on completely randomized design with three factors and three replications that rhizomes were used for treatment. The first factor including different colchicine concentrations (0, 0. 025, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 % that 0 as control). The second factor including two Mentha ecotypes (Ecotype A: Kamarej region and Ecotype B: Pirmohlat region) and the third factors consist of two soaking time (6 h and 12 h). In second experiment, apical meristem was treated. The factorial experiment based on randomized completely design with two factors and five replications. The factors including different colchicine concentrations (0, 0. 035, 0. 07, 0. 15, 0. 3 and 0. 7 %) and two ecotypes. In the third experiment, colchicine as combined with irrigation was applied. For this purpose, a factorial experiment in randomized complete design with two factors (colchicine concentrations: 0, 0. 025, 0. 012, 0. 006 % and two mint ecotypes) and three replications was conducted. At the end of all experiments, survival rate and tetraploidy percentage (by morphological change, stomata traits, flow cytometry and chromosome counts) were measured. The results showed that different treatment had significant effects on survival percent on all experiments and increasing of colchicine concentration caused decreasing plants survival. On the other hand, tetraploidy changes only in the first experiments were observed. Only in 0. 025 % colchicine treatment with 6 h soaking time on ecotype A, 12. 66 % tetraploidy was identified.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. A large {{sector of}} the {{forestry}} industry of South Africa comprises Eucalyptus species, covering approximately 49 % of the forestry plantation area. <b>Polyploidy</b> <b>induction</b> has become an attractive tool to increase yield and reduce invasiveness in forestry species. <b>Polyploidy</b> <b>induction</b> in Eucalyptus using colchicine treatments on seed and axillary buds was undertaken to produce tetraploids {{that could be used}} in breeding programmes; specifically to increase yield and decrease species invasiveness through the production of triploids after crossing with diploid parents. Eight seedlots of E. urophylla and seven of E. grandis were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 00, 0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05 %) at two exposure times (18 h and 24 h), treating two seeds per treatment, repeated eight times. For axillary bud induction, 20 buds of two E. grandis clones and three E. grandis × E. urophylla hybrids and one E. grandis × E. nitens hybrid were treated with four colchicine concentrations (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 %) for three consecutive days. A known tetraploid hybrid E. grandis E. camaldulensis and its corresponding diploid were included as reference material. Seedlings and bud sports were pre-screened by determining stomatal guard cell lengths. Seedlings and bud sports displaying cell lengths significantly (p< 0. 0001) larger than the diploid were selected as putative polyploids. Polyploidy was then confirmed by quantifying the DNA content using flow cytometry. Stomatal frequencies and guard cell chloroplast frequencies were also determined in the induced tetraploid seedlings to evaluate their suitability to discern between ploids. All putative polyploidy seedlings, identified in the pre-screening process, were confirmed, using flow cytometry, as either tetraploids or mixoploids. Of the 17 E. urophylla putative polyploids, from various seedlots, six were tetraploid and 11 mixoploid. In E. grandis one of the five putative polyploids, from various seedlots, was tetraploid and four mixoploid. Pre-screening of bud sports was less accurate; only four of the 12 E. grandis hybrid putative polyploids were mixoploid and only three of the six E. grandis putative polyploids were mixoploid. E. urophylla seedlings were more sensitive to colchicine than E. grandis seedlings displaying a lower survival rate (52 %) than E. grandis (63 %). Extreme treatments that caused the lowest survival rates were also responsible for most of the polyploidy successful inductions; 0. 05 %/ 18 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. urophylla and 0. 03 %/ 24 h and 0. 05 %/ 24 h for E. grandis. Phenotypic effects of colchicine included shorter, thicker roots and hypocotyls; darker leaves; longer and narrower leaves in some tetraploids; and asymmetrical leaf margins in many mixoploids and tetraploids compared with the controls. In the tetraploids, stomata were significantly larger (p< 0. 0001) and less frequent (p< 0. 001). A significant (p< 0. 001) increase in the number stomatal chloroplasts was also ascertained. Confirmed mixoploid seedlings all displayed tetraploid leaves based on stomatal size and thus classified as periclinal chimeras. In bud sports, only leaves with islands of diploid and tetraploid stomata in the confirmed mixoploids were encountered. Mixoploid bud sports were thus either sectional or mericlinal chimeras. Stomatal size proved to be a suitable pre-screening method, especially in <b>polyploidy</b> <b>induction</b> in seedlings. Additionally confirmed tetraploids exhibited significantly different stomatal frequencies and stomatal chloroplast frequencies compared with the diploids, thus proving to be suitable detection methods for polyploidy screenings. <b>Polyploidy</b> <b>induction</b> in seed was effective, however, less effective in axillary buds which requires further research to refine methods...|$|E

The data also reveal that effects of cytomixis in PMCs on the induction of polyploidy and plant growth rate were statistically significant. Tetraploid plants of Linum (4 x = 2 n = 60) had larger vegetative, reproductive parts than their normal diploid plants (2 n = 30).

Results showed that fenugreek allelopathic potential was significantly enhanced by polyploidization. Mixoploid plant extracts have more significant effects (P inf 0. 05) on all target species than that of diploid plants at all tested concentration levels. At the high concentration of 40 g/l, mixoploid plant extract induced 9 % more inhibition on lettuce root growth, 21 % more on peganum, and 36 % more on alfalfa than that from diploid plant.
