25|$|It is {{very hard}} to {{estimate}} the number of <b>Pomaks</b> along with the Turkified <b>Pomaks</b> who live in Turkey, as they have blended into the Turkish society and have been often linguistically and culturally dissimilated. According to Milliyet and Turkish Daily News reports, the number of <b>Pomaks</b> along with the Turkified <b>Pomaks</b> in the country is about 600,000. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community in Turkey stands at 500 members.|$|E
25|$|As of 1873 Kochan (Kotchen) had male {{population}} of 280 <b>Pomaks</b> and 100 houses. According to Stephan Verkovic {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the village had a {{male population}} of 312 <b>Pomaks</b> and 100 houses. In his statistic Vasil Kanchov mentions that in 1900 Kochan (Кочен) is a Pomak village with 773 inhabitants (Bulgarian Muslims) in total.|$|E
25|$|The Macedonian Muslims (or Torbeši), are {{occasionally}} {{also referred}} to as <b>Pomaks,</b> especially in historical context.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the census}} of 1965, 23,138 Turkish {{citizens}} spoke <b>Pomak</b> as mother language. Proportionally, {{they were most}} numerous in Edirne (3.4%), Kırklareli (1.3%) and Çanakkale (1.0%). 2,776 of these could only speak <b>Pomak</b> [...] Another 34,234 spoke <b>Pomak</b> as second best language.|$|R
25|$|A <b>Pomak</b> {{community}} {{is present in}} Turkey, mostly in Eastern Thrace and fewer in Anatolia, where they are called in Turkish Pomaklar, and their speech, Pomakça. The <b>Pomak</b> community in Turkey is unofficially estimated between 300,000 and 600,000.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the Bulgarian Muslims in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes, {{who usually}} have a Bulgarian {{identity}} and are mostly secular Muslims, non-religious or have even adopted Christianity, the ones living on the western fringes of the Rhodopes (in the provinces of Pazardzhik and Blagoevgrad) are strongly religious and have preserved the Muslim name system, customs and clothing. For example, out of 62,431 self-declared Muslims in the Blagoevgrad Province in 2001, 31,857 (more than half) have opted for Turkish ethnicity although the self-declared speakers of Turkish as a mother tongue are only 19,819. Considering that mother tongue in the Bulgarian census is counted {{on the basis of}} a declaration of the respondent and not on actual proof of what language this person speaks at home and that an inquiry of the Ministry of the Interior in 1989 gave only 3,689 ethnic Turks and 56,191 <b>Pomaks</b> for the Blagoevgrad Province, it is highly likely that the vast majority of the Turks in the province are actually <b>Pomaks.</b> A similar phenomenon exists in the Pazardzhik Province where there may be between 10,000 and 15,000 <b>Pomaks.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 May the <b>Pomaks</b> took the yard and {{advanced}} {{to the door of}} the church, but weren’t able to get in – the door was barred by the people inside.|$|E
25|$|After the April {{uprising}} {{started on}} 30 April 1876, {{part of the}} armed men in Batak, led by the voivode Petar Goranov, attacked the Turks. They succeeded to eliminate part of the Ottoman leaders, but were reported to the authorities and 5,000 Bashi-bazouk were sent, mainly <b>Pomaks</b> (Slavic Muslims), led by Ahmet Aga from Barutin which surrounded the town. At that time the <b>Pomaks</b> {{were a part of}} the Ottoman Muslim Millet. After a first battle, the men from Batak decided to negotiate with Ahmet Aga. He promised them the withdrawal of his troops under the condition that Batak disarmed. After the rebels had laid down their weapons, the Bashi-bazouk attacked them and beheaded them.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} Ottoman period the Christian and the <b>Pomak</b> {{parts of the}} {{population}} have experienced a demographic boom. So, in 1873 Petrevene had 122 Christian houses with 414 men and 64 <b>Pomak</b> houses with 160 men. [...] A few among Bulgarian-Christians were craftsmen and grocers, settlers {{from the town of}} Teteven (old: Tetevene, Tetyuvene). During the Russian-Turkish War of 1877/78 the <b>Pomak</b> part of the population in the region escaped temporarily to Macedonia, to come back {{after the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|According to the 1935 census in Turkey, 3881 {{people in}} Eastern Thrace {{identified}} their mother tongue as Bulgarian and 18 382 as <b>Pomak.</b> The overall statistic from 1935 shows that 41 041 people speak <b>Pomak</b> as their mother tongue or as a secondary dialect.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} {{mentioned}} {{for first time}} in 1478 as a settlement with 99 non-Muslim households and 4 widows. In 1873 were counted 210 male inhabitants of <b>pomak</b> origin, living in 90 households. In 1900 year there were 680 <b>pomak</b> people, living in 90 households.|$|R
25|$|Most present-day {{inhabitants}} of the region are Eastern Orthodox Christians, principally of the Greek Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox and Macedonian Orthodox Churches. Notable Muslim minorities are present among the Albanian, Bulgarian (<b>Pomaks),</b> Macedonian (Torbeš), Bosniak, and Turkish populations.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans did not {{normally}} require the Christians to become Muslims. Nevertheless, {{there were many}} cases of forced individual or mass islamization, especially in the Rhodopes. Bulgarians who converted to Islam, the <b>Pomaks,</b> retained Bulgarian language, dress and some customs compatible with Islam..|$|E
25|$|During 1964 the Communist regime made {{an attempt}} to change the Muslim names of the <b>Pomaks</b> in Kochan with Slavic ones but the attempt failed and only those loyal to the regime had their names changed. On 23 April 1972 {{in the town of}} Sarnitsa an {{appointed}} Bulgarian policeman was killed by five native <b>Pomaks</b> because of a confiscated driving license. One of the ravishers surrendered immediately while the rest made {{an attempt to}} escape to Greece but were arrested in Kochan where they had received temporary shelter. That was a good moment for the regime to make a second attempt for a forced name change since the inhabitants of the village were shocked by the incident and the authorities charged them with complicity in the murder. Thus the name change went relatively smooth.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the book}} Ethnographie des Vilayets d'Andrinople, de Monastir et de Salonique in French {{the village was}} {{described}} as [...] "village with 892 households and more than 2100 male inhabitants of <b>pomak</b> origin" [...] as in 1873. In 1900 Vasil Kanchov wrote about a [...] "village with more than 3600 people of <b>pomak</b> origin". In 1916 D. Gadzhanov noted about 4780 <b>pomak</b> people, living in Babyak. Since 1954 - 1955 some neighborhoods of the village have been separated from the village and the population decreased.|$|R
5000|$|Reşadiye is a <b>Pomak</b> {{village in}} the District of Sandıklı, Afyonkarahisar Province, Turkey. {{established}} in 1910 by the <b>Pomak</b> refugees of Čerešovo and Mugla villages nearby today's Smoljan city in Bulgaria, and village named after Sultan Mehmed V Reshad {{which was in the}} crown that year.|$|R

25|$|There are two Islamic {{theological}} seminaries, one in Komotini, {{and one in}} Echinos (a {{small town}} in Xanthi regional unit inhabited almost exclusively by <b>Pomaks),</b> and under Law 2621/1998, the qualification awarded by these institutions has been recognized as {{equal to that of}} the Greek Orthodox seminaries in the country.|$|E
25|$|Almost 80% of {{the people}} {{currently}} residing in Anatolia are Turks. Kurds constitute a major community in southeastern Anatolia, and are the largest ethnic minority. Abkhazians, Albanians, Arabs, Arameans, Armenians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Bosnian Muslims, Circassians, Gagauz, Georgians, Serbs, Greeks, Hemshin, Jews, Laz, Levantines, <b>Pomaks,</b> Zazas {{and a number of}} other ethnic groups also live in Anatolia in smaller numbers.|$|E
25|$|Massacres against Turks and Muslims {{during the}} Balkan Wars {{in the hands}} of Bulgarians, Greeks and Armenians are {{described}} in detail in the 1912 Carnegie Endowment report. The Bulgarian violence during the Balkan War included burning of villages, transforming mosques into churches, rape of women and mutilation of bodies. It is estimated that 220,000 <b>Pomaks</b> were forcefully Christianized and forbidden to bear Islamic religious clothing.|$|E

25|$|According to Milliyet, a 2008 report {{prepared}} for the National Security Council of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia suggested that there are approximately 55 million ethnic Turks, 9.6 million Kurds, 3 million Zazas, 2.5 million Circassians, 2 million Bosniaks, 500,000-1.3 million Albanians, 1,000,000 Georgians, 870,000 Arabs, 600,000, <b>Pomaks,</b> 80,000 Laz, 60,000 Armenians, 25,000 Assyrians/Syriacs, 20,000 Jews, and 15,000 Greeks, 500 Yazidis living in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim {{minority}} in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% {{of the total}} population, consists of speakers of Turkish, Bulgarian (<b>Pomaks)</b> and Romani. Romani is also spoken by Christian Roma {{in other parts of}} the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{isolation}} of the <b>Pomaks</b> and the poverty the emigration continued in the following years. In a message from the minister of war to the Ministry of Internal Affairs is reported that on 11 May 1934, 16 inhabitants of Kochan and Zhizhevo illegally crossed the border with Greece and emigrated after they had been told by a Greek merchant that Greece and Turkey provide land and financial support for Pomak refugees.|$|E

25|$|He was {{banished from}} the Exarchate and exiled in a monastery near Sofia. However, later Theodosius repented again and {{accepted}} as before a pro-Bulgarian position on the Macedonian Question. As result he was rehabilitated and between 1901 and 1906 served as bishop of the Plovdiv eparchy. Bishop Theodosius also led the short-lived eparchy of Gyumyurdzhina, (Komotini) between 1913 and 1919, when the area was part of Bulgaria. During 1913 he participated on the Christianization of the <b>Pomaks</b> in the Rhodopes, a mission held from the Bulgarian Exarhate and IMORO.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other parts}} of the {{southern}} Balkans that experienced centuries of Ottoman rule the Muslim minority of mainly Western Thrace in Northern Greece consists of several ethnic groups, some being Turkish and some Bulgarian-speaking <b>Pomaks,</b> with smaller numbers descended from Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam. The precise identity of these groups is in contention with Turkey insisting that most Muslims in Western Thrace are ethnically Turkish, and Greece claiming many are Pomak and others of local origin who converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language and identity in the Ottoman period. These arguments have territorial overtones, since the self-identity of the Muslims in Western Thrace could conceivably support territorial claims to the region by Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The Peoples' Democratic Party {{originates}} {{from the}} Peoples' Democratic Congress (Halkların Demokratik Kongresi, HDK), a platform composed of various groups including left wing parties Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party, Labour Party, Socialist Party of the Oppressed, Socialist Democracy Party, Socialist Party of Refoundation, the Greens and the Left Party of the Future, the Peace and Democracy Party, some far-left factions, feminist groups, LGBT groups, trade unions and ethnic initiatives representing Alevis, Armenians, and <b>Pomaks.</b> In the 2011 general election, the HDK fielded 61 independent candidates {{in order to}} bypass the 10% parliamentary threshold under the 'Labour, Democracy and Freedom Block'. 36 members were elected, though the election of Hatip Dicle was later annulled by the Supreme Electoral Council and this number subsequently fell to 35.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} language ecology (Mufwene 2001, 2005) on bilingual speech. It is based on first hand data from two undocumented varieties of Romani and <b>Pomak</b> in contact with Turkish in Greek Thrace, in both cases Turkish being an important language for the community’s identity. This analysis shows, on one hand, how the Romani-Turkish fused lect (Auer 1998) was produced by intensive and extensive bilingualism through colloquial contact with the trade language, Turkish. On the other hand, it shows how semi-sedentary <b>Pomak</b> speakers had limited, institutional contact with Turkish, resulting in more traditional codeswitching and emblematic lexical borrowings.
