An empirical model is developed and applied to data collected in northeast Burkina Faso in 2000 and 2002.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} viral suppression following combined treatment with an S/pre-S 1 /pre-S 2 vaccine and lamivudine in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We established a randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare the responses of three different treatment groups: those receiving vaccine monotherapy, lamivudine monotherapy, or combination treatment. Viral response was evaluated via hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression using different levels of classification. Seroconversion was evaluated via HBeAg loss, HBeAg seroconversion, HBsAg loss, and anti-HBs response. We found that the group receiving combination treatment demonstrated a significant increase in viral suppression over that for the lamivudine or vaccine monotherapy group, although the HBeAg seroconversion rate was not different. This enhanced suppression effect in the combination group was reversed after the discontinuation <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>treatment,</b> suggesting that booster doses are required for a sustained viral response.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} costs of {{vaccination}} regimens for introducing inactivated polio vaccine in routine immunization in Brazil. METHODS A cost analysis was conducted for vaccines in five vaccination regimens, including inactivated polio vaccine, compared with the oral polio vaccine-only regimen. The costs <b>of</b> the <b>vaccines</b> were estimated for routine use and for the &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221;, during when the oral polio vaccine is administered to children aged less than five years, independent <b>of</b> their <b>vaccine</b> status, and the strategic stock <b>of</b> inactivated polio <b>vaccine.</b> The presented estimated costs are of 2011. RESULTS The annual costs of the oral vaccine-only program (routine and two National Immunization Days) were estimated at US$ 19, 873, 170. The incremental costs of inclusion <b>of</b> the inactivated <b>vaccine</b> depended on the number <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> doses, presentation <b>of</b> the <b>vaccine</b> (bottles with single dose or ten doses), and number of &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221; carried out. The cost of the regimen adopted with two doses <b>of</b> inactivated <b>vaccine</b> followed by three doses <b>of</b> oral <b>vaccine</b> and one &# 8220;National Immunization Day&# 8221; was estimated at US$ 29, 653, 539.

40|$|Combination {{vaccines}} {{have become}} the preferred choice for immunizing children in high- and middle-income countries. However, these new vaccines are prohibitively expensive for low-income countries, causing them to rely on older, less-expensive vaccines. This product divergence decreases economies of scale for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> and eliminates the financial incentive for manufacturers to maintain production <b>of</b> less-expensive <b>vaccines</b> or even to develop new vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries. This paper treats combination <b>vaccines</b> as bundles <b>of</b> antigens that can be priced as a single item. Such bundles are used to formulate an optimization problem that determines the combination vaccine allocation between vaccine producers and different countries under a price discrimination agreement. The objective of the optimization problem is to satisfy countries' antigen demand at the lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable profit for the vaccine producers. The optimization problem results in a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that maximizes the sum of manufacturing profits and the customer surplus, and hence, it maximizes the total social surplus. Moreover, a constructive heuristic is proposed to determine an approximation to the best allocation <b>of</b> combination <b>vaccines</b> and their range of feasible prices. Computational results show that vaccine prices in all market segments become more affordable as the supply {{of the most complex}} combination vaccines becomes more available to low-income countries.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{metabolic}} profiles were examined from rabies virus (RABV) -infected mice that were either mock-treated or received post-exposure treatment (PET) {{with a single}} dose of the live recombinant RABV vaccine TriGAS. CNS tissue harvested from mock-treated mice at middle and late stage infection revealed numerous changes in energy metabolites, neurotransmitters and stress hormones that correlated with replication levels of viral RNA. Although {{the large majority of}} these metabolic changes were completely absent in the brains of TriGAS-treated mice most likely due to the strong reduction in virus spread, TriGAS treatment resulted in the up-regulation of the expression of carnitine and several acylcarnitines, suggesting that these compounds are neuroprotective. The most striking change seen in mock-treated RABV-infected mice was a dramatic increase in brain and serum corticosterone levels, with the later becoming elevated before clinical signs or loss of body weight occurred. We speculate that the rise in corticosterone is part of a strategy of RABV to block the induction of immune responses that would otherwise interfere with its spread. In support of this concept, we show that pharmacological intervention to inhibit corticosterone biosynthesis, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>treatment,</b> significantly reduces the pathogenicity of RABV.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the twenty-first}} century, the {{development}} of national immunization programmes (NIP) has matured into robust processes where evidence-based methodologies and frameworks have increasingly been adopted. A {{key role in the}} decision-making and recommending processes is played by National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs). In a survey performed among European Union member states, Norway and Iceland, in February 2013, 85 % of the 27 responding countries reported having established a NITAG, and of these, 45 % have formal frameworks in place for the systematic development of vaccination recommendations. Independent of whether a formal framework is in place, common key factors are addressed by all NITAGs and also in countries without NITAGs. The four main factors addressed by all were: disease burden in the country, severity <b>of</b> the disease, <b>vaccine</b> effectiveness or efficacy, and vaccine safety at population level. Mathematical modelling and cost-effectiveness analyses are still not common tools. Differences in the relative weighting of these key factors, differences in data or assumptions on country-specific key factors, and differences in existing vaccination systems and financing, are likely to be reasons for differences in NITAG recommendations, and eventually NIPs, across Europe. Even if harmonization of NIPs is presently not a reasonable aim, systematic reviews and {{the development of}} mathematical/economic models could be performed at supranational level, thus sharing resources and easing the present work-load of NITAGs. Nevertheless, {{it has been argued that}} harmonization would ease central <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> thus reducing the price and increasing access to new vaccines...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} and currently incurable neurological disorder characterised {{by the loss}} of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (a-syn). Oligomeric a-syn is proposed to {{play a central role in}} spreading protein aggregation in the brain with associated cellular toxicity contributing to {{a progressive}} neurological decline. For this reason, a-syn oligomers have attracted interest as therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative conditions such as PD and other alpha-synucleinopathies. In addition to strategies using small molecules, neutralisation of the toxic oligomers by antibodies represents an attractive and highly specific strategy for reducing disease progression. Emerging active immunisation approaches using vaccines are already being trialled to induce such antibodies. Here we propose a novel vaccine based on the RNA bacteriophage (Qbeta) virus-like particle conjugated with short peptides of human a-syn. High titres of antibodies were successfully and safely generated in wild-type and human a-syn over-expressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mice following vaccination. Antibodies from vaccine candidates targeting the C-terminal regions of a-syn were able to recognise Lewy bodies, the hallmark aggregates in human PD brains. Furthermore, antibodies specifically targeted oligomeric and aggregated a-syn as they exhibited 100 times greater affinity for oligomeric species over monomer a-syn proteins in solution. In the SNCA-OVX transgenic mice used, vaccination was, however, unable to confer significant changes to oligomeric a-syn bioburden. Similarly, there was no discernible effect <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> <b>treatment</b> on behavioural phenotype as compared to control groups. Thus, antibodies specific for oligomeric a-syn induced by vaccination were unable to treat symptoms of PD in this particular mouse model...|$|R
