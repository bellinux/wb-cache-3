5|$|Rebuilding and {{refurbishing}} {{the palace}} took {{until well into}} the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s. In 1989 a large trompe-l'œil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> the former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It is thought to have been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.|$|E
5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. <b>Paint</b> <b>in</b> interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E

5|$|Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen {{continued}} to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> Skagen {{until well into}} the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Two core members of the group, Drachmann and Krøyer, died in 1908 and 1909, bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end. There were nevertheless other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, who {{continued to}} visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Ludvig Karsten, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection.|$|E
5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to digital ink and <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> his own naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism. By {{the end of}} the 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years he spent in France. That spring, members of the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish audience as exhibition number two (number one being Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson) at the new art venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in Djurgården. Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.|$|E

It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood fluted columns. Later Rajas, Anup Singh and Surat Singh, also added lot of glitter to this palace with inlaid polychrome glass, intricate mirror patterns, and red and gold <b>paint.</b> <b>In</b> the coronation chamber, there is a shored up alcove, which was used as a throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey <b>paint.</b> <b>In</b> the very last scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to <b>paint.</b> <b>In</b> the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E
5|$|DMA Design founder David Jones began {{developing}} Walker {{following the}} release of Blood Money in 1989. The inspiration for the game's mech originated in a sprite from Lemmings (1991) originally designed for Blood Money. The graphics and animation for Walker were designed by Scott Johnston, who later worked on Hired Guns (1993). Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker's head in position, which could then be altered in Deluxe <b>Paint.</b> <b>In</b> early 1990, Jones scrapped Walker because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called Gore!; this was soon scrapped. Following {{the completion of the}} Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of Shadow of the Beast, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on Walker; Glancy redesigned the game. Raymond Usher wrote the game's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, {{the railway}} to Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903. Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, continued to visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum's has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting their students should continue to <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E
5|$|Isobel (known as Iso) Rae (18 August 1860– 16 March 1940) was an Australian impressionist painter. After {{training}} at Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria Art School, where she studied alongside Frederick McCubbin and Jane Sutherland, Rae travelled to France in 1887 with her family, and {{spent most of}} the rest of her life there. A longstanding member of the Étaples art colony, Rae lived in or near the village of Étaples from the 1890s until the 1930s. During that period, Rae exhibited her paintings at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Society of Oil Painters, and the Paris Salon. During World War I, she was a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment and worked throughout the war in Étaples Army Base Camp. She and Jessie Traill were the only Australian women to live and <b>paint</b> <b>in</b> France during the war, however they were not included in their country's first group of official war artists. Following Hitler's rise to power, Rae moved to south-eastern England, where she died in 1940.|$|E
