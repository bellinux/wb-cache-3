50|$|<b>Patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> {{have several}} {{distinct}} alarm calls that warn {{members in the}} group of predators. Different alarm calls are given by different group members (i.e. adult females, adult males, juveniles, etc.) and certain alarm calls are distinctive of different types of predators. Unlike other primates, <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> rarely take refuge from predators in trees. This is most likely the due to the relatively sparse tree cover in <b>patas</b> <b>monkey</b> habitats. While <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> usually run on the ground away from predators, individuals have been observed to attack predators such as jackals and wildcats. This behavior has been observed in both males and females.|$|R

40|$|Socio-ethological {{studies on}} troops of African green monkeys (AGMs) (#Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus$) and <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> (#Erythrocebus patas$) in Senegal have {{documented}} physical contacts {{between these two}} species. Elevated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) seroprevalence rates have been reported for the different AGM subspecies. We report here {{the extent to which}} <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> are infected and compare the relatedness of the viruses isolated from these two different species. Among the 85 AGMs and 54 <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> studied, 47 % and 7. 5 %, respectively, had antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV- 2 envelope proteins. From two AGMs a virus was isolated. From the <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys,</b> virus isolation was generally not possible, but from one animal that was ill a virus designated pamG 31 was amplified by PCR. In addition, for the two SIVagm isolates, an 830 bm region spanning the env and nef genes was amplified and sequenced. Comparisons of sequences from the env/nef region revealed 80 % identity between pamG 31 and SIVagm isolates from AGMs of the #sabaeus$ subspecies, and 94 % identity between the two SIVagm isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pamG 31 belongs to the SIVagm #sabaeus$ subgroup. This is the first report of a lentiviral infection in a <b>patas</b> <b>monkey.</b> The close genetic relatedness between pamG 31 and SIVagm #sabaeus$ viruses is a strong argument in favour of cross-species transmission of SIV between AGMs and <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> in the wild. For these reasons, we propose to refer to this patas virus as SIVagm-pamG 31. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the central}} dichotomies in primate {{behavior}} is between species {{in which there are}} relationships among females that include stable dominance relationships, and those in which the relationships include weak or unstable dominance relation-ships. This dichotomy has been attributed to differences in food resources, with stable dominance hierarchies occurring in species that feed on usurpable foods. We compared rank-related differences in nonagonistic behaviors considered to be tightly linked to ecology in broadly sympatric vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops) and <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Erythrocebus <b>patas),</b> two closely related cercopithecines that are exemplars of this dichotomy, with the expectation that vervets would exhibit stronger rank differences than <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> in these behaviors. Overall, rank explained {{more than twice as much}} variation among vervets as among <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> in ranging behavior, activity budgets, and diet. Vervets did not, however, exhibit stronger rank differences when they used Acacia xanthophloea habitat, in which foods are more usurpable, compared to Acacia drepanolobium habitat, in which foods are less usurpable. In Acacia drepanolobium habitat, to which patas are restricted, higher-ranking vervets converged in behavior with <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> to a greater extent than lower-ranking vervets, suggesting that social constraints interfere with the foraging efficiency of lower-ranking vervets even in habitats in which there are fewer opportunities to usurp foods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfrican green monkeys (AGMs) {{are divided}} into four species (Cercopithecus aethiops, C. pygerythrus, C. sabaeus, C. tantalus), each {{harboring}} a species-specific simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm). Little {{is known about the}} host and/or viral factors that are responsible for the apathogenicity of SIVagm infections in their natural hosts. In order to analyze the specific selective pressures exerted by the host on the virusin vivo,we compared the genetic evolution of SIVagm. tan in its natural host (C. tantalus) and in a foreign host species (Erythrocebus patas), in which we could obtain a reproducible and persistent infection by SIVagm. tan. As in AGMs, <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> do not develop any disease following SIVagm infection. Our longitudinal study inenv(V 3 -C 3 -V 4 -C 4 -V 5) of SIVagm. tan from three AGMs and three <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> revealed a high ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous mutation frequencies (1. 5 – 6. 2). These data indicate that the selective pressures for stability exerted by AGMs and <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> on SIVagm override positive selection for change reported in pathogenic HIV- 1 infections. The rapid accumulation of mutations observed in AGMs and <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> (0. 4 – 7. 2 × 10 − 2 nucleotide substitutions per site per year) suggests a continuous replication of SIVagm virusesin vivo. We thus propose that nonpathogenic SIVagm infections are the result of a long-term selection of SIVagm variants whose dissemination can be controlled in the host, rather than being explained by a low ability of the virus to replicatein vivo...|$|R

40|$|Fifty monkeys of {{the species}} Erythrocebus patas were fed a control monkey chow, a semi-synthetic diet {{containing}} 25 % lard, or a semisynthetic diet containing 25 % lard and 0. 5 % cholesterol for 2 years. The <b>patas</b> <b>monkeys</b> had naturally occurring atherosclerosis that was greatly accelerated by feeding a diet containing cholesterol. The atherosclerosis involved the aorta, predominantly the abdominal portion, the coronary arteries, and various peripheral vessels. Histologically, the atherosclerosis was characterized by intimal proliferative lesions associated with intra- and extracellular lipid deposition. Complicated lesions that developed after 2 years on the cholesterol-containing diet were associated with lipid crystals, necrosis, mineralization, and encroachment upon the media. Adventitial reactions characterized by increased vascularity {{and the presence of}} inflammatory cells were seen. All of these observations have been described as components of the human atherosclerotic disease process. The similarity of the <b>patas</b> <b>monkey</b> atherosclerosis to human atherosclerosis, the relatively large size and easy handling of the animals, and the fact that previous studies have shown the lipoproteins of both control and cholesterol-fed monkeys to resemble human lipoproteins all contribute to making the <b>patas</b> <b>monkey</b> a useful model for the study of experimental atherosclerosis...|$|R
