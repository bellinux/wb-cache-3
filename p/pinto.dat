5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse {{developed}} from small gaited <b>pinto</b> ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds {{such as the}} Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait.

Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and selectively bred for <b>pinto</b> coloration, they were used for general pleasure and trail riding.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} {{may vary}} from <b>Pinto's</b> manuscript (some sentences are erased {{and others are}} edited). The disappearance of references to the Society of Jesus, {{one of the most}} active religious orders in the Orient, is notable, as there are clear indications of <b>Pinto's</b> relationship with the society. <b>Pinto's</b> memoirs are just that, his memories of events, giving rise to doubts regarding historical accuracy.

The Germans were easily able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely envelop them with six companies of German infantry attacking the camp from the south, south-east and west.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Pintos is {{a simple}} {{operating}} system framework for the 80 x 86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. <b>Pintos</b> could, theoretically, run on a regular IBM-compatible PC. But {{it is difficult to}} get a regular IBM-compatible PC just for this OS, we will run <b>Pintos</b> projects in a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an 80 x 86 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that unmodified operating systems and software can run under it. In class we will use the Bochs and QEMU simulators. <b>Pintos</b> has also been tested with VMware Player. <b>Pintos</b> uses a basic FIFO round robin algorithm for scheduling threads, semaphores, locks and condition variables. The current system has a minimally functional thread system. Our paper is to understand the working of <b>pintos</b> and extend the functionality of this system {{to gain a better understanding}} of synchronization problems byimplement priority scheduling and priority donation...|$|R
