40|$|Lundh {{test and}} <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> results were {{compared}} in 50 patients. In the resulting correlation curve three {{areas of interest}} were differentiated: (1) an area with mean tryptic activity, found in the Lundh test, below 4 U/ml, where an abnormal <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result was also seen; (2) an intermediate area from 4 to 9 U/ml, where <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> results {{may be found in}} discordance with the Lundh test; (3) the normal level, where PABA excretion was shown to be independent of intestinal chymotrypsin activity. In experiments in vitro on the kinetics of the hydrolysis of BTPABA by chymotrypsin the profound influence of the pH on Km and Vmax was shown. This influence of the pH explains why in the intermediate area of pancreatic dysfunction normal <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> results were found in a number of cases. A higher mean pH level of the Lundh test aspirates was found for patients with a normal <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result than for patients with an abnormal <b>PABA</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} prior {{administration}} of 400 mg of cimetidine {{on the outcome}} of the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> was investigated. In 8 patients the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result rose with on average 27. 5 % after the administration of cimetidine. Four of them were selected for these investigations, because a much lower <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result had been obtained than was expected from the Lundh test result. In one patient, the low <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result was in conflict with faecal fat excretion and the clinical condition. Three patients were selected with severe pancreatic dysfunction, as demonstrated by the <b>PABA</b> <b>test,</b> Lundh test and faecal fat excretion. The change effected by cimetidine was shown to be significantly related to duodenal pH and mean trypsin activity as measured in the Lundh test. In a control group of four patients with a <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result in the normal range, no significant effect of cimetidine administration was seen. The beneficial effect of cimetidine can be explained by its known inhibiting influence on gastric acid production, resulting in higher intraduodenal pH with subsequent enhanced enzymatic activity. The importance of intraduodenal pH for the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> result is further stressed by these result...|$|E
40|$|The oral (PABA) {{pancreatic}} {{function test}} (PFT), the secretin-pancreozymin test and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP) {{have been carried}} out in 32 patients with suspected chronic alcohol induced pancreatitis (CAIP) in order to evaluate which, if any, test was most likely to confirm the provisional diagnosis. Thirty one patients had changes of minimal (n = 6) moderate (n = 7) or advanced (n = 18) chronic pancreatitis on pancreatography, whilst one patient had a pancreas divisum. Eight hour urinary PABA excretion was significantly reduced in patients with moderate and advanced structural changes (p less than 0. 001) and correlated significantly with all parameters of the PFT, although eight patients with an abnormal pancreatogram and pancreatic function test had a normal PABA value. The PFT was abnormal in 23 patients, but normal in five patients with an abnormal pancreatogram and low PABA value. Most patients with minimal change pancreatitis had a normal <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> and PFT. We conclude that pancreatography appears to be the most sensitive method for detecting chronic pancreatic damage and for confirming a clinical diagnosis of chronic alcohol induced pancreatitis. Both the PFT and <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> are useful confirmatory tests and whilst the PFT is slightly more sensitive for assessing pancreatic exocrine function, the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> is well tolerated and simple to perform. It may therefore be the complementary investigation of choice for this group of patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{clearance}} of sulphamethoxazole (SMX), {{a compound}} metabolised {{primarily by the}} N-acetyltransferase NAT 1, is increased in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We assessed the activity and kinetic properties of NAT 1 in lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) from CF (n = 17) and control (n = 22) subjects using SMX and p-aminobenzoic acid (<b>PABA)</b> as <b>test</b> substrates. The Km and Vmax values of both substrates in MNL from CF patients and control subjects were not significantly different. The acetylation of PABA (100 microM) by intact MNL from CF patients (n = 4) was not different from the observed in intact MNL from controls (n = 9) (25 +/- 3 pmol h- 1 per 10 (6) MNL vs 27 +/- 4 pmol h- 1 per 10 (6) MNL). These results {{suggest that there are}} not systemic changes in this enzyme in CF. The increased metabolic clearance of SMX may therefore be related to factors other than alterations in the level of activity of the N-acetyltransferase NAT 1.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{pancreatic}} anastomosis after proximal Whipple-type resection: classical pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), has been evaluated over a 5 -year period from 1987 to 1992 in 52 patients. Indications for resection included chronic pancreatitis (n = 9) and neoplasms (n = 43). Reconstruction involved a cephalad end-to-end duodeno-/gastro-jejunal anastomosis with a biliary anastomosis 6 - 8 cm downstream. A separate isolated defunctioned Roux loop {{was used to}} construct a duct-to-mucosa (Wirsung-jejunal) pancreaticojejunostomy. Median postoperative stay was 18. 0 days (range 11 - 32 days); three deaths (operative mortality 5. 8 %) occurred due to sepsis (subhepatic abscess), profound hypoglycaemia and necrotising pancreatitis respectively. These deaths were not related to pancreatic fistula. There were no pancreatic leaks (defined as greater than 50 ml of amylase-rich fluid for more than 7 days). Postoperative exocrine pancreatic function was good as assessed by re-establishment of preoperative weight (achieved in 35 of 40, ie 88 % of surviving PPPD patients), clinical steatorrhoea (present in 10 of 41, ie 24 % of surviving patients resected for neoplasm), {{and the need for}} pancreatic exocrine supplements (required in only 4 of 41, ie 9. 8 % of surviving patients resected for neoplasm). Twenty patients considered to have normal pancreatic remnants underwent a p-aminobenzoic acid (<b>PABA)</b> excretion <b>test</b> at 3 to 18 months after operation. Median PABA excretion index was 48 % (range 24 - 100 %). Isolated defunctioned duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy is a safe procedure offering good functional results after Whipple's PD or PPPD resection...|$|R
40|$|The timely {{differentiation}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and non-tubercular mycobacterium (NTM) species is urgently needed in patient care since the routine laboratory method is time consuming and cumbersome. An easy and cheap method which can successfully distinguish MTC from NTM was established and evaluated. 38 mycobacterial type and reference strains and 65 clinical isolates representing 10 species of mycobacterium {{were included in}} this study. Metabolites of p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB) reduction were identified using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). A spectrophotometric method was developed to detect these metabolites, which was evaluated {{on a number of}} MTC and NTM species. All of the tested NTM species and strains reduced PNB to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), while none of the MTC strains showed a similar activity. Spectrophotometric detection of PABA had 100 % sensitivity and specificity for MTC and NTM differentiation among the type strains and the clinical isolates <b>tested.</b> <b>PABA</b> was identified as one of the metabolites of PNB reduction. All the tested NTM species metabolized PNB to PABA whereas the MTC members lacked this activity. A simple, specific and cost-effective method based on PABA production was established in order to discriminate MTC from NTM from cultured organisms...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The 14 C-triolein breath test, a {{recognised}} {{index of}} fat absorption, and the p-aminobenzoic acid (<b>PABA)</b> <b>test,</b> a 'tubeless ' test of exocrine pancreatic function, {{have both been}} widely used in the diagnosis of malabsorption and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This study evaluates the potential {{of a combination of}} both tests in the investigation of fat absorption and exocrine pancreatic function. Combination of the tests has become technically feasible because of the introduction of high pressure liquid chromatography as the preferred method of analysis for PABA, and use of p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) as the marker for PABA absorption and metabolism. We studied 25 healthy subjects, II patients with exocrine pancreatic disease and 12 patients with gastrointestinal disease. The combined test identified subjects with reduced fat absorption and distinguished subjects with exocrine pancreatic insuf-ficiency from those with an intestinal cause of fat malabsorption. The test could be completed in 7 h and had high patient acceptibility. These findings suggest that the combined 14 C-trioleinbreath test and <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> {{can be used as a}} non-invasive, I-day investigation of fat absorption and exocrine pancreatic function...|$|E
40|$|Although the exocrine {{pancreatic}} {{function test}} (PFD) using a synthetic peptide {{is a simple}} and useful test, it often gives a false positive result in hepatic diseases, renal diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. Attempts were made to solve this problem. PFD combined with the <b>PABA</b> <b>test,</b> PFD combined with the D-xylose test as well as PFD alone were consecutively performed in 15 healthy controls, 15 patients with chronic pancreatitis, 15 with chronic hepatic diseases, 14 with chronic renal diseases and 16 with gastrointestinal diseases. Results of the tests were interpreted according to the following three criteria indicating exocrine pancreatic dysfunction: (A) an abnormal PFD with normal PABA or normal D-xylose test value, (B) a decreased PFD/PABA ratio or PFD/D-xylose ratio and (C) a large difference between PABA and PFD or a small difference between PFD and D-xylose. Specificity and sensitivity, were evaluated. PFD with the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> and PFD with the D-xylose test are very useful for avoiding false results. Criterion (A) with the PFD and PABA tests is the most suitable {{for the evaluation of}} exocrine pancreatic function in patients with possible hepatic, renal and gastrointestinal diseases. Criterion (A) with the PFD and D-xylose tests is almost as useful...|$|E
40|$|Until now {{use of the}} <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> {{together}} with [14 C] PABA to calculate the PABA excretion index has probably been the best adaptation suggested to enhance the specificity of this non-invasive pancreatic function test. Drawbacks of the method are the application of radioactivity, the fact that children, pregnant women, and patients with renal insufficiency have to be excluded from the test, and the possible interference of drugs and isotopes. We propose simultaneous administration of p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) in the <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> and quantification of the urinary PABA and PAS excretion with liquid chromatography. Urinary PABA and PAS excretion in six hours are comparable (69. 5 +/- 8. 4 % and 65. 6 +/- 18. 4 % respectively in five healthy volunteers). Application of the PABA/PAS ratio was compared with the urinary PABA excretion in 21 normal controls, 38 patients with pancreatic disease, and 42 patients without pancreatic pathology. The PABA/PAS ratio and the per cent PABA excretion correlated very well in pancreatic patients: (PABA/PAS ratio) = 0. 0149 (% PABA) + 0. 052 (r = 0. 902). Use of the PABA/PAS ratio enhanced the specificity of the test from 76 to 89 %...|$|E

40|$|Serum {{and urine}} PABA curves {{monitored}} in 13 healthy volunteers were analysed and compared with curves from 11 healthy volunteers after {{administration of the}} gastrokinetic agent domperidone. Both in serum and in urine less variation in the PABA curves was observed after domperidone. Results without domperidone were subdivided in a group with normal gastric emptying (I) and a group with slow gastric emptying (II), based upon the time at which the serum PABA peak was found. Maximal serum PABA concentration, serum PABA at t = 60 min, lagphase and t 1 / 2 for urinary excretion, and % PABA excretion from 0 - 3 h, 3 - 6 h and 0 - 6 h differed significantly between the two groups. Instead, {{no differences were found}} between subgroup I and volunteers after concomitant domperidone administration. In summary, <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> results in serum and urine are influenced by variations in gastric emptying. Domperidone corrects for delayed gastric emptying and thereby narrows the range of normal PABA excretion value...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) mediates liver fibrosis, which can be monitored by the serum determination of the N-terminal peptide of type III procollagen (PIIIP) and laminin. Fibrosis is also an important phenomenon in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). In 23 patients with CP, 38 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 20 healthy controls we compared the serum patterns of PIIIP, laminin and TGFb and assessed whether in CP these markers are correlated with exocrine and endocrine function. In patients with LC, PIIIP and laminin levels were significantly higher, whereas TGFb levels were significantly lower than those of controls. In CP patients, no significant variations were found for PIIIP and laminin, although levels were high in 7 / 23 and in 5 / 23 patients, respectively. TGFb levels in CP patients were higher than those in LC patients, levels being raised in 6 / 23 patients. In LC patients an inverse correlation was found between PIIIP and TGFb, whereas in CP patients, a direct correlation was found between TGFb and PIIIP. Moreover, in CP patients, there was also a positive correlation between TGFb and fasting serum glucose levels, while laminin was correlated with <b>PABA</b> <b>test</b> results. In conclusion: serum biochemical markers of liver fibrosis can be considered of limited value in assessing pancreatic fibrosis; in liver cirrhosis there may be a negative feed-back regulation between TGFb production and the fibrogenetic process; and in chronic pancreatitis TGFb appears to favor fibrosis {{on the one hand and}} the development of hyperglycemia on the other...|$|E
40|$|Particulate {{fractions}} of human small intestinal mucosa contain an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA-peptide), a substrate used for clinical purposes to assess exocrine {{function of the}} pancreas (<b>PABA</b> <b>test,</b> pancreas function test). In this paper we describe the purification of PABA-peptide hydrolase (PPH) by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody (Mab), HBB 3 / 716 / 36, bound to protein A-Sepharose, and the characterization of the purified enzyme. The final preparation of the enzyme was in the immobilized form, i. e., bound to Mab-protein A-Sepharose, and showed a 765 -fold enrichment over the mucosal homogenate. The enrichment factor in purified microvillus membranes was {{comparable to that of}} sucrase-isomaltase, a microvillar marker enzyme. This, together with immunoelectron microscopy using protein A-gold, indicated that PPH is located in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. The enzyme was found to be present throughout the small intestine with the activity in distal ileum being 4. 5 -fold higher than that in the proximal duodenum. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoaffinity-purified PPH under reducing conditions revealed a polypeptide band with a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 100, 000; under nonreducing conditions a major band with Mr 200, 000 was observed. This indicates that PPH consists of two subunits with Mr 100, 000 each, which are held together by one or more disulfide bonds. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme showed marked microheterogeneity, with pI's ranging from 6. 0 to 6. 85, probably due to glycosylation. The Km for PABA-peptide was 16. 7 mM, and the pH optimum was 7. 5 - 8. 0 PPH activity was not inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; pepstatin, leupeptin, amastatin, bestatin, puromycin, iodoacetate, or phosphoramidon. Activity was affected by captopril and Zinkov inhibitor, and in particular by thiol and chelating reagents. Chelator-inhibited PPH could be reactivated by bivalent metal ions, Zn 2 + being the most effective. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of peptides including insulin B-chain, angiotensins I and II, bradykinin and bradykinin derivatives, oxytocin, and substance P, in each case yielding reproducible peptide fragments. On the basis of amino acid analysis of the products it could be concluded that peptides are hydrolyzed preferentially after an aromatic residue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Extraintestinal manifestations in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) {{have been}} described with varying frequencies. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the prevalence of pancreatic duct abnormalities, exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, elevated pancreatic enzymes, hepato-biliary disease, coexisting cholangiographic and pancreatographic duct changes, and elevated serum levels of fibrosis markers in IBD, and to correlate the findings with clinical, endoscopic and histologic variables. From a local patient register, 237 patients were randomly selected and studied. Of these, 170 had ulcerative colitis (UC), 46 had Crohn's disease (CD), and 21 had indeterminate colitis (IC). A detailed history was obtained from medical records and in a face-to-face interview. The patients were screened with a para-aminobenzoic acid (<b>PABA)</b> <b>test</b> and, for pancreatic enzymes, liver function tests, serum aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and laminin. Further pancreatic evaluation included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreato-graphy (ERCP), ultrasound (US), secretin test, and glucagon C-peptide test. Further hepatobiliary evaluation consisted of ERCP, US, and liver biopsy. In IBD, the prevalence rates of pancreatic duct abnormalities and exocrine dysfunction were 8 % and 4 %, respectively. Parallel impairment of exocrine and endocrine functions was shown. Acute idiopathic pancreatitis may complicate IBD. About 7 - 17 % presented with elevated pancreatic enzymes. Enzyme elevation was associated with extensive and histologically active disease and, in some cases, with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Abnormal liver test results were commoner in patients with CD than in patients with UC (30 % versus 11 %). The prevalence of PSC in IBD was 11 %, which is higher than previously reported (3. 7 - 7. 5 %). PSC was commoner in patients with CD than in patients with UC (17. 4 % versus 7. 6 %). About half of the PSC patients had concomitant pancreatic duct changes, and the prevalence of concurrent cholangiographic and pancreatographic duct changes in IBD was 4. 6 %. Both serum PIIINP and laminin were increased in IBD patients. This was not only seen in patients with hepatobiliary disease and PSC, but also in patients with pancreatic disease. In conclusion, pancreatic and hepatobiliary complications in IBD occur with high and similar frequencies in all IBD categories and are associated with each other. They are not clearly associated with the clinical course of IBD...|$|E
