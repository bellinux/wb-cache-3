40|$|As the {{connectivity}} {{of consumer}} devices is rapidly growing and cloud computing technologies {{are becoming more}} widespread, cloud-aided techniques for parameter estimation can be designed to exploit the theoretically unlimited storage memory and computational power of the cloud, while relying on information provided by multiple sources. With {{the ultimate goal of}} developing monitoring and diagnostic strategies, this report focuses on the design of a Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) based estimator for identification over a group of devices connected to the cloud. The proposed approach, that relies on Node-to-Cloud-to-Node (N 2 C 2 N) transmissions, is designed so that: (i) estimates of the unknown parameters are computed locally and (ii) the local estimates are refined on the cloud. The proposed approach requires minimal changes to local (pre-existing) RLS estimators.

50|$|He was consecrated {{bishop of}} Brechin at Peterhead, 26 September 1787, {{and a few}} weeks later was elected to the see of Edinburgh, to which the see of Glasgow was {{afterwards}} united. About the middle of February 1788 the news reached Scotland that on 31 January of that year Prince Charles Edward had died at Rome. Drummond was the first among the bishops to urge that the time had now come for the Episcopalians to give a public <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their <b>submission</b> to the House of Hanover by praying in the express words of the English liturgy for the king and royal family. This was accordingly done throughout Scotland on 25 May. A bill of ‘relief for pastors, ministers, and lay persons of the episcopal communion in Scotland’ having been prepared, Drummond, with Bishops Skinner and Strachan, set out for London in April 1789 to promote its progress through Parliament.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the Jizya tax {{has been}} {{understood}} in Islam as {{a fee for}} protection provided by the Muslim ruler to non-Muslims, for the exemption from military service for non-Muslims, for the permission to practice a non-Muslim faith with some communal autonomy in a Muslim state, and as material <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the non-Muslims' <b>submission</b> to the Muslim state and its laws. Jizya has also been understood {{by some as a}} ritual humiliation of the non-Muslims in a Muslim state for not converting to Islam, while others argue that if it were meant to be a punishment for the dhimmis' unbelief then monks and the clergy wouldn't have been exempted.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{the main body of}} Gurth's force arrived, and encamped in the valley. Llewellyn's chiefs all came in and made their submission, but the people for the most part took to the hills. As, day after day, news came of the terrible {{retaliation}} dealt out by the troops of Harold and Tostig they lost heart altogether, and sent in messengers craving to be allowed to come in and lay down their arms. Gurth at once accepted their submission, and hundreds returned to their homes. In other parts of Wales the feeling that resistance was vain rapidly extended. Their most fertile valleys had all been turned into deserts, and even on their own hills and among their own forests, where they had hitherto deemed themselves safe from attack, they were pursued and hunted down by the now lightly-armed Saxons. From all parts, therefore, offers to submit were sent in, and as a <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> their <b>submission</b> and regret for past behaviour, they seized Griffith their king, killed him, and sent his head to Harold, who thereupon granted them terms, and ordered his forces to withdraw beyond the border.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} the oration Che la Corte è vera scuola non solamente della prudenza, ma delle virtù morali (1624), {{delivered at the}} Accademia degli Umoristi by Agostino Mascardi, a courtier, professor of rhetoric, and renowned member of academies. Mascardi’s oration has traditionally been read as a commendation of the court, and as <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> intellectuals’ willing <b>submission</b> to political powers in the seventeenth century. This article aims to challenge such a reading by proposing a reinterpretation of the text that suggests the oration is, in fact, paradoxical. This article also considers Che la Corte è vera scuola in relation to Mascardi’s other writings on courts, and investigates them in {{the larger context of}} the accademie of early seventeenth-century Rome in an attempt to shed light on the role that academies played for early modern Italian intellectuals in trying to define their relationship to political power...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a discrete-time opinion dynamics {{model in which}} each individual's susceptibility to being influenced by others is dependent on her current opinion. We assume that the social network has time-varying topology and that the opinions are scalars on a continuous interval. We first propose a general opinion dynamics model based on the DeGroot model, with a general function to describe the functional dependence of each individual's susceptibility on her own opinion, and show that this general model {{is analogous to the}} Friedkin-Johnsen model, which assumes a constant susceptibility for each individual. We then consider two specific functions in which the individual's susceptibility depends on the polarity of her opinion, and provide motivating social examples. First, we consider stubborn positives, who have reduced susceptibility if their opinions are {{at one end of the}} interval and increased susceptibility if their opinions are at the opposite end. A court jury is used as a motivating example. Second, we consider stubborn neutrals, who have reduced susceptibility when their opinions are in the middle of the spectrum, and our motivating examples are social networks discussing established social norms or institutionalized behavior. For each specific susceptibility model, we establish the initial and graph topology conditions in which consensus is reached, and develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the initial conditions for the final consensus value to be at either extreme of the opinion interval. Simulations are provided to show the effects of the susceptibility function when compared to the DeGroot model.

In the perspective of electoral justice system, dispute resolution must meet the elements such the right to a settlement of electoral disputes; the election standard devices and procedures are clearly defined; the electoral dispute resolution body who have the knowledge and impartiality; the judicial systems that facilitate the achievement of the decision; the existence of clear regulations concerning the burden <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> and standard <b>of</b> <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> evidence clearly defined; the effective settlement system and meaningful and the effective of stakeholders education. This article intended to examine and assess whether the electoral dispute resolution system that is prepared for concurrent local election is adequate or not in the perspective of electoral justice system. Method used is by analyzing 2015 concurrent election legal framework and institutional framework for organizing and analyzing the elements of the institutional framework of the institutions involved in the resolution of electoral disputes in the concurrent election of 2015. In addition, the analysis was also directed at other aspects in the resolution of electoral disputes such as the availability of prevention system (preventive system) and alternative dispute resolution system {{that can be used in}} the concurrently election dispute resolution 2015. The analysis also uses actual cases that develop during the stages of the concurrent elections for comparison purposes in the implementation of regulations disputed election, as well as to examine the capacity and capability of the electoral dispute resolution body that are responsible for the settlement of electoral disputes...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} reliable point-to-point digital communication {{is to achieve}} a low probability of error while keeping the rate high and the total power consumption small. Traditional information-theoretic analysis uses `waterfall' curves to convey the revolutionary idea that unboundedly low probabilities of bit-error are attainable using only finite transmit power. However, practitioners have long observed that the decoder complexity, and hence the total power consumption, goes up when attempting to use sophisticated codes that operate close to the waterfall curve. This paper gives an explicit model for power consumption at an idealized decoder that allows for extreme parallelism in implementation. The decoder architecture is {{in the spirit of}} message passing and iterative decoding for sparse-graph codes. Generalized sphere-packing arguments are used to derive lower bounds on the decoding power needed for any possible code given only the gap from the Shannon limit and the desired probability of error. As the gap goes to zero, the energy per bit spent in decoding is shown to go to infinity. This suggests that to optimize total power, the transmitter should operate at a power that is strictly above the minimum demanded by the Shannon capacity. The lower bound is plotted to show an unavoidable tradeoff between the average bit-error probability and the total power used in transmission and decoding. In the spirit of conventional waterfall curves, we call these `waterslide' curves. Comment: 37 pages, 13 figures. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
