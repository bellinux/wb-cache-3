25|$|Duchamp's final major {{art work}} {{surprised}} {{the art world}} that believed {{he had given up}} art for chess 25 years earlier. Entitled Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage ("Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas"), it is a tableau, visible only through a <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> in a wooden door. A nude woman can be seen lying on her back with her face hidden, legs spread, and one hand holding a gas lamp in the air against a landscape backdrop. Duchamp had worked secretly on the piece from 1946 to 1966 in his Greenwich Village studio while even his closest friends thought he had abandoned art. The torso of the nude figure is based on Duchamp's lover, the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, with whom he had an affair from 1946 to 1951.|$|E
500|$|At school, Julia starts {{shouting}} at Miranda for letting Annemarie drink soda and eat sandwiches, saying that because Annemarie is epileptic {{she has to}} eat a special diet. Miranda explains that she didn't know any of that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> [...] and sees Colin. She opens the door and he looks at her then kisses her. She then kisses him back. Colin smiles and then runs off.|$|E
500|$|The {{carnival}} in {{this episode}} {{is based on}} The Eastern States Exposition (currently known as The Big E) fair. As a child, Mike Scully went to the fair, and had hoped one day to be a carny. This is the only episode that Mark Kirkland did not tell his parents to watch. This is due to Bart's line [...] "Out of my way, I'm Hitler". Kirkland's stepfather was a lieutenant in World War II and was injured while in combat. Cooder was modeled after David Mirkin, the showrunner of seasons five and six and co-writer and {{the executive producer of}} two episodes in the ninth season. Spud's head shape is modeled after Bart's head. The [...] "fisheye effect", when Cooder is looking through the <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> was drawn by hand, not optically by assistant director Matthew Nastuk. Matt Groening said they had several endings worked out, including one where Homer made the hula hoop over the chimney.|$|E
50|$|Intercoms, <b>peep</b> <b>holes,</b> {{and mail}} slots can all serve {{purposes}} {{similar to the}} door chain when dealing with strangers, and function without opening the door. Of course, these devices do not provide additional protection to the door itself.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the ornate spaces, the building contained a common feature in post offices of the era. The [...] "sneak hole" [...] was a specially constructed, enclosed gallery located above the postal workroom that allowed inspectors to secretly observe the actions of employees through strategically placed <b>peep</b> <b>holes.</b> The [...] "sneak hole" [...] {{is no longer in}} use today.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of H&R magazines. The first and second models are both smooth body, are blued, and are twenty-shot double column. The first model is {{distinguished}} by five cartridge <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> on the left side, a feature eliminated on the second model to prevent mud and sand from entering. In contrast, the third model is parkerized, has two long indentations on the sides to reduce its capacity to a twelve-shot single column magazine because of feeding problems experienced with former models.|$|R
500|$|The east front {{bedroom is}} divided in two with a partition, giving {{the eastern side}} of the {{building}} four rooms on the second floor, with the two middle rooms being used as medium-security cells. The maximum security cells were located in the back of the building, in the south-east corner. These cells are constructed of wood and walled in by stone walls and iron doors. The maximum security cells had no heat, light or bathrooms; air was only able to flow into the room through a slit in the stone wall and a <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> in the iron door. Underneath the cells were two courses of [...] by [...] timbers superimposed on top of one another. These timbers are believed to have been sourced from the original 1792 jail. The timbers are supported by a [...] brick wall and by a fieldstone wall in the cellar. The exterior stone walls are [...] thick on the front and west exterior, but are [...] for the walls that support the maximum security cells. As part of the alterations made by the Society, the solid brick wall was removed and is now supported by steel beams.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{critics of}} the {{experiments}} include psychologists Dr. David Marks and Dr. Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977. Their 1978 article in Nature and 1980 book The Psychology of the Psychic (2nd ed. 2000) described how a normal explanation was possible for Geller's alleged psychic powers. Marks and Kammann found evidence that while at SRI, Geller was allowed to peek {{through a hole in}} the laboratory wall separating Geller from the drawings he was being invited to reproduce. The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the high importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics. Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller's paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that [...] "Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, I believe him to be a very clever, well-practiced magician." ...|$|E
60|$|Such a vigil is an {{excellent}} lesson, since one {{has no choice but}} to look hard at those objects which we usually pass with such half-hearted interest. Through my little <b>peep</b> <b>hole</b> I employed the hours in studying every specimen, from the huge mummy-case which leaned against the wall to those very jewels which had brought us there, gleaming and sparkling in their glass case immediately beneath us. There was much precious gold-work and many valuable stones scattered through the numerous cases, but those wonderful twelve which made up the urim and thummim glowed and burned with a radiance which far eclipsed the others. I studied in turn the tomb-pictures of Sicara, the friezes from Karnak, the statues of Memphis, and the inscriptions of Thebes, but my eyes would always come back to that wonderful Jewish relic, and my mind to the singular mystery which surrounded it. I was lost in the thought of it when my companion suddenly drew his breath sharply in, and seized my arm in a convulsive grip. At the same instant I saw what it was which had excited him.|$|E
50|$|The {{initial release}} of the KSG had a mixed {{reception}} with some having flawless experiences and others having various issues ranging from the selector switch breaking to double feeding. Kel-Tec quickly released a second generation addressing these issues while also offering to upgrade 1st generation KSGs with the second generation improvements for free. Other improvements to the KSG on the 2nd generation include a trigger reset, small shell tube <b>peep</b> <b>holes,</b> and a fix of the action release to be easier to use and ambidextrous.|$|R

50|$|In 2007 Stroud Valleys Arts Space gave Davy and Kristin {{permission}} to create performance work for their annual Site Festival in Stroud. Davy and Kristin thus created and performed Silent Movie, a multimedia performance that mixes projections and live acting. The plot, which recounts {{a love story}} between a couple, is evocative of the silent movie genre {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century. The performance is viewed by an audience of 15 people through <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> made in the front wall of a huge wooden box or a shopping window. In 2008 Silent Movie was shown at the Macau Arts Festival in China.|$|R
5000|$|Signature {{works have}} been his talking lights, such as Streetlight (1997), his series of video sculptures of eyes with {{television}} screens reflected in the pupils, and ominous talking heads such as Composite Still Life (1999). An installation called Optics (1999) examines the polarity between dark and light {{in the history of}} the camera obscura. In his text [...] "Time Stream", Oursler proposed that architecture and moving image installation have been forever linked by the camera obscura noting that cave dwellers observed the world as projections via <b>peep</b> <b>holes.</b> Oursler's interest in the ephemeral history of the virtual image lead to large scale public projects and permanent installations by 2000.|$|R
25|$|In 1899, Mary Day of New Jersey {{observed}} {{a pair of}} chimney swifts nesting in a chimney, and noted the incubation period was 19 days. The first detailed study of chimney swifts began in 1915 by self-taught ornithologist Althea Sherman in Iowa. She commissioned a 28 foot tall tower, of a similar design to a chimney, with ladders and <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> installed to facilitate observation. Chimney swifts nested in her tower, and for over fifteen years, she meticulously recorded her observations, filling over 400 pages. Sherman remarked that although the tower had been designed with a limited knowledge of the nesting behaviour of chimney swifts, {{after many years of}} observation she believed that the original design was ideal.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake Scott from June 19, 1995 to June 21, 1995 in Los Angeles. Scott used a special [...] "fish eye" [...] lens to film some of the scenes, to give that distorted view as if looking through a <b>peep</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Étant donnés (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas, French: Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage.) is Marcel Duchamp's {{last major}} art work which {{surprised}} {{most of the}} art world, who believed {{he had given up}} art for competitive chess almost 25 years earlier, following The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (also known as The Large Glass). It is a tableau, visible only through a pair of <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> (one for each eye) in a wooden door, of a nude woman lying on her back with her face hidden and legs spread holding a gas lamp in the air in one hand against a landscape backdrop.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{established}} in 1781, by Vožd Karageorge, {{on the right of}} the Kamenica river. The town was destroyed during the First Serbian Uprising, when Kučuk-Alija ravaged the Šumadija region in 1804, also burning down Karageorge's house. The renovation began in 1805, when the town was renewed as a fortified city; Karageorge built a new mansion on the ruins of his previous house, and several buildings surrounding, they were all protected with palisades and <b>peep</b> <b>holes,</b> making Topola a strategic settlement. With the successful revolts, Topola gains a political importance. The Vožd further expanded the town, from 1808 to 1813 he built large walls, towers, konaks, a school, a church and many other buildings. Topola became the centre of Revolutionary Serbia, where Karageorge was seated.|$|R
50|$|The 1892 {{core of the}} {{building}} incorporates two large cells, each with an exercise yard and two smaller cells with a single L-shaped yard. Exercise yards are enclosed by concrete walls, {{three and a half}} metres in height. Each of the yards is separately entranced by iron doors with <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> and large draw bolt locks. In each of the four 1892 cells, railway iron rails are imbedded horizontally in concrete piers between the top of the external walls and the ceiling, providing ventilation. The remand cell has railway iron rails spanning the room {{at the top of the}} walls spaced 25 centimetres apart, the ends being imbedded into the walls. The ceilings are lined with tongue and groove hardwood boards.|$|R

5000|$|The main fire chamber {{was at the}} bottom, {{but there}} might be {{additional}} [...] "stoke holes" [...] to allow adding extra fuel at intervals up the slope, as well as <b>peep</b> <b>holes</b> to allow sight of the interior. At the far, top, end there was a chimney, but given the up-draught of the slope, this {{did not need to}} be tall, and might be omitted altogether. The size and shape of the kilns and chambers within varied considerably. Firing was begun at the bottom end and moved up the slope. The fuel might be wood or (generally less often) coal, which affected the atmosphere of the firing; wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one. The weight of pottery produced was about the same as the weight of wood required. Generally saggars were used, at least in later periods. These were an innovation of Ding ware from the north in the Song dynasty.|$|R
