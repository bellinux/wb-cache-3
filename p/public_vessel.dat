5000|$|The {{procedure}} for issuing {{letters of marque}} and the issuing authority varied by time and circumstance. In colonial America, for instance, colonial governors issued them {{in the name of}} the king. During the American Revolution, first the state legislatures, then both the states and the Continental Congress, then, after ratification of the Constitution, Congress authorized and the President signed letters of marque. A shipowner would send in an application stating the name, description, tonnage, and force (armaments) of the vessel, the name and residence of the owner, and the intended number of crew, and tendered a bond promising strict observance of the country's laws and treaties and of international laws and customs. The commission was granted to the vessel, not to its captain, often for a limited time or specified area, and stated the enemy upon whom attacks were permitted.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{fisheries}} and trade, focusing on developing countries. Fish is globally traded, {{and for many}} developing countries, {{it is an important}} net export good. In most of these countries, fisheries are often characterized by poorly defined property rights, accompanied by overcapitalization where too many vessels and fishermen catch too few fish from too small stocks. Management is often de facto open access, where vessels with or without permission to fish land {{as much as they can}} catch due to limited monitoring and enforcement activities. Even in developed countries, many fisheries are poorly managed, and recent studies indicate that marine ecosystems are in global decline. While trade generally is beneficial for growth and welfare, the combination of pure open access and trade liberalization may both reduce welfare and stocks for a country—an outcome that can be reinforced by the common use of bad subsidies. However, trade liberalization may have an additional positive impact by promoting the development of property rights in response to increased fish exploitation. The WTO can play a role by adopting a broader classification of subsidies to help eliminate bad subsidies, such as like <b>public</b> support of <b>vessel</b> construction, fuel subsidies, or fishing rights outside developing coastal countries provided at limited or zero cost. The WTO can also ssist by distinguishing good subsidies (e. g., improving fisheries management or improving monitoring and enforcement), which are desirable targets when rich countries allocate aid resource to developing countries.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} 20, 000 to 40, 000 yachts in Kuwait. The {{majority}} of these yachts is stored on land {{because the number of}} berths in Kuwait is not sufficient to accommodate them all. Besides yachts, there are approximately 1, 000 fishing vessels in Kuwait. The facilities for fishermen are not of sufficient quality. To overcome these problems, the Kuwaiti government initiated the development of a master plan for 9 coastal havens on Kuwait coast. Kuwait is located at the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. It is bordering Saudi-Arabia and Iraq and lies on the northwestern shore of the Arabian Gulf. The emirate covers approximately 20, 000 km 2 and has a population 3. 5 million inhabitants. The coastal havens need to facilitate fishing <b>vessels,</b> yachts, <b>public</b> transport <b>vessels,</b> vessels from the national authorities and incidentally vessels that take refuge in one of these coastal havens. Besides the possible locations of the havens, the demand and need for these facilities is an important aspect. The yachting demand potential gives an indication of the expected development in demand of the yachting industry up to the year 2030. There already is a need for berths in Kuwait at the moment. The master plan accounts for 6750 berths in the year 2030, an increase of 4750 berths in 25 years, and a small {{increase in the number of}} fishing vessels in Kuwait. The master plan contains recommendations for the proposed development directions and functions that have to be allocated for all coastal haven locations. The complexity of the concept of a coastal haven lays within the fact that it has to facilitate yachts, fishing vessels and somewhat larger vessels at the same time. The facility must be multipurpose to some extent, but other aspects must be kept separate in order to provide all users in their needs and meet their expectations. The design requirements and criteria are applied to one coastal haven location and are translated into three layout alternatives for one coastal haven location. The layouts are evaluated with two hydraulic models. These models simulate the wave propagation from an offshore data point into the wave conditions within the coastal haven basins. The modeled wave conditions are those that occur only once during the life of the coastal haven. The layout has to be such that it can protect the vessels from these conditions. During the modeling it is concluded that the layout needs to be such that the basins are relatively closed off. The acceptable wave height within the coastal haven is very limited, because damage to the yachts and speedboats used for fishing is not acceptable in a coastal haven.

5000|$|Bluenose II {{was sold}} to the {{government}} of Nova Scotia in 1971 for the sum of $1. After a number of years of managing the schooner directly, the province gave possession of the ship to the [...] "Bluenose II Preservation Trust". The trust's mandate was to restore the aging schooner to full operational status and continue to operate her for the people of Nova Scotia. Over the winter of 1994-95 the ship’s hull was restored and she was recommissioned in May 1995. During this time Bluenose II was involved in the Sponsorship scandal when the federal government allocated $2.3 million for the schooner through a consulting firm but only a small amount of the money reached the vessel. The trust maintained and operated Bluenose II until 31 March 2005, when the government of Nova Scotia placed the vessel under the management of the Lunenburg Marine Museum Society at the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic. In a controversial move, the head of the trust, Senator Wilfred Moore, refused to release over $600,000 raised by the trust in the schooner's name to the current operators of Bluenose II. Moore agreed to turn over the trust's assets to the province in July 2012 but did not release the financial records from the trust. Bluenose II serves as a goodwill ambassador, tourist attraction in Lunenburg, and symbol of the province. During the summer, she visits ports all around Nova Scotia and frequently sails to other ports on the eastern seaboard. Bluenose II has one of the largest mainsails in the world, measuring 386 m2.

40|$|The Captures Clause of the United States Constitution gives Congress {{the power}} to "make Rules {{concerning}} Captures on Land and Water. " A variety of courts, scholars, politicians and others have recently cited the Clause to support conflicting arguments about the scope of Congress’s power to initiate and prosecute war. Some claim or assume that the Captures Clause gives Congress power over the taking and detention of people, while others conclude that the power is limited to property only. Similarly, those who view Congress’s power broadly understand the Captures Clause as giving Congress {{the power to}} determine what (or whom) may be seized both as method of initiating conflict and as measure of war prosecution. Others maintain that the Clause only gives Congress power over the adjudication and division of property seized by armed private vessels. Virtually all of these accounts rely on original history, yet none examines the Captures Clause in any detail. This Article does so, tracing the meaning of captures through British and Colonial Admiralty documents, prominent works of international law, the Revolutionary War and Articles of Confederation, and the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. The {{result is that the}} eventual language in the Constitution could have been plausibly understood {{in a variety of ways}} prior to the Revolutionary War, but it probably did not include the power to determine what or whom could be taken. The Continental Congress used the word "captures" in a significantly different way - to authorize what goods (but not what people) could be taken by both <b>public</b> and private <b>vessels.</b> This is also the best reading of the Constitution’s text. The Captures Clause illuminates a small but significant area of constitutional history, for captures were extremely important throughout the eighteenth century. And the Captures Clause sheds important light on the meaning of the Letters of Marque and Reprisal, Declare War, and the Commander-in-Chief Clauses. Contrary to the views of almost everyone writing on these topics, the first gave Congress only the power to license private vessels to make captures - it was the Captures Clause that gave Congress the power to determine what property was subject to capture by both public and private forces. This, in turn, supports at least a relatively broad reading of the Declare War Clause, because it gives Congress a power closely tied to the initiation of war. It also means that at least some questions of combat strategy were lodged with Congress, narrowing the possible scope of the Commander in Chief Power. Finally, however, a careful look at the Captures Clause also illustrates gaps and overlaps in the Constitution’s allocation of war powers...|$|R
