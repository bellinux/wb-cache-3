5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home {{by a series of}} governesses and tutors. She {{displayed}} artistic talent early, drawing and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success. She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes in the years to follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit. In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. In a few years, Potter had established her own career, income, and home.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E

50|$|The {{agreement}} with Scholefield allowed for further editions and corrigenda at perhaps ten-yearly intervals. By 1955, Scholefield had enough {{material for a}} third volume covering the 1941-1951 period, but this did not go ahead. Instead, the government approved in 1959 the production of An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand by the then-parliamentary librarian, Alexander Hare McLintock. Government officials regarded that there was thus {{no need for a}} third volume and whilst they allowed for Scholefield to <b>privately</b> <b>issue</b> a supplement, they did not allow him to have the original volumes reprinted. By then, the original print run of 2,000 copies had sold out. The set's retail price was £2 10s.|$|R

25|$|The Royal Mint {{issued a}} total of £1,000 in copper coins. Following an Act in 1840, these were valued at 12 pence to the shilling. All coins issued before 1839 were {{declared}} by this law to be no longer current, and were recalled by the Board of Customs and exchanged by the Royal Mint at their original nominal value for the new coinage. After 1839, no further Manx coins were issued, and they gradually became scarce and were replaced in general circulation on the island by the coinage of the United Kingdom. They did not cease to be legal coinage on Mann until decimalisation in 1971. Banknotes had been <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> for the island since 1865.|$|E

500|$|Members of {{the coin}} {{collecting}} community own some of the Kalākaua pieces. Richard S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins in its 2018 edition lists the quarter dollar as generally the least expensive Hawaii coin, ranging from $50 to $375 for the pieces struck for circulation. [...] Proof coins are much more expensive, especially the 12 cent piece (hapawalu), which brought $43,125 at auction in 2011. The Kalākaua coins have been reproduced, and their designs repurposed for <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> medals. The dies for the original coins were cancelled and are in the Hawaiʻi State Archives.|$|E
500|$|From 1793 to 1857, the cent was {{a copper}} coin {{about the size}} of a half dollar. [...] As rising copper prices made it {{impractical}} to keep striking them, in 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent, issuing a new design, the Flying Eagle cent. [...] The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents, though somewhat thicker and made of copper-nickel. The design caused production difficulties, and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin. [...] Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design, and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield. [...] Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War, when the metal nickel was in short supply. [...] As Mint officials saw that <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> bronze tokens were circulating, they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864, authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy.|$|E
500|$|The {{surplus of}} cents was {{relieved}} {{by the economic}} chaos engendered by the American Civil War, which began in 1861. At {{the end of that}} year, the banks stopped paying out gold, which thereafter commanded a premium over paper money. [...] These greenbacks, beginning in the following year, were issued in large quantities by the federal government. [...] Silver vanished from commerce in June 1862, as the price of that metal rose, leaving the cent the sole federal coin that had not entirely vanished from commerce through hoarding. The glut of cents had by then abated, as merchants had stored them away in quantity—one New York City floor collapsed beneath the load. [...] There were other means of making change which passed in the emergency, from postage stamps to <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> tokens, but the public demand was for the cent—the Philadelphia Mint struck record numbers, and set aside part of the production to be transmitted to other cities. Nevertheless, by July 1862, the cent, in quantity, could only be purchased at a premium of 4% in paper money in major cities in the East. The copper-nickel pieces were nicknamed [...] "nickels", or [...] "nicks". Presentation of coins in payment carried with it no obligation to make change in the same. Accordingly, with a small quantity of [...] "nicks", a shopper could make purchases with exact change, without receiving such makeshifts as merchants' credit slips, that others might not accept at the stated value.|$|E

2500|$|By 1802, the {{production}} of <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> provincial tokens had ceased. However, in {{the next ten years}} the intrinsic value of copper rose. [...] The return of privately minted token coinage was evident by 1811 and endemic by 1812, as {{more and more of the}} Government issued copper coinage was melted down for trade. [...] The Royal Mint undertook a massive recoinage programme in 1816, with large quantities of gold and silver coin being minted. To thwart the further issuance of private token coinage, in 1817 an act of parliament was passed which forbade the manufacture of private token coinage under very severe penalties.|$|E

2500|$|Postal {{cards and}} postcards are small message cards which are sent by mail unenveloped; the {{distinction}} often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn {{between them is}} that [...] "postal cards" [...] are issued by the postal authority or entity with the [...] "postal indicia" [...] (or [...] "stamp") preprinted on them, while postcards are <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though {{there have been some}} cases of a postal authority's issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the back. The postage required for postcards is generally less than postage required for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs, may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.|$|E
2500|$|By 1786, {{two-thirds of}} the coins in {{circulation}} in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. [...] Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine. [...] Even the copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes. [...] The Royal Mint struck no copper coins for 48years, from 1773 until 1821. [...] On the rare occasions when the Royal Mint did strike coins, they were relatively crude, with quality control nonexistent. [...] In February 1787 Williams oversaw the minting {{of the first of}} many <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> copper tokens, some being used to pay workers at the Parys Mine Company. [...] These first tokens bore the image of a hooded Druid, and within two months time were receiving attention in London as a possible solution to the shortage of small denomination coin. [...] Not long after the appearance of the Druid tokens, other cities, businesses, and proprietors would follow suit and begin designing and minting their own small denomination coinage.|$|E

6000|$|... "Expect {{to hear of}} me next in Petersburg or Teheran," [...] he had said, {{turning to}} wave {{farewell}} from {{the steps of the}} Travellers'. But a disease had broken out in the East, there was cholera in Russia, and he was heard of, not so romantically, in Lisbon. They had been through France; he had stopped at manufacturing centres where, producing letters of introduction, he had been shown over works, and noted facts in a pocket-book. In Spain he and Mrs. Dalloway had mounted mules, for they wished to understand how the peasants live. Are they ripe for rebellion, for example? Mrs. Dalloway had then insisted upon a day or two at Madrid with the pictures. Finally they arrived in Lisbon and spent six days which, in a journal <b>privately</b> <b>issued</b> afterwards, they described as of [...] "unique interest." [...] Richard had audiences with ministers, and foretold a crisis at no distant date, [...] "the foundations of government being incurably corrupt. Yet how blame, etc."; while Clarissa inspected the royal stables, and took several snapshots showing men now exiled and windows now broken. Among other things she photographed Fielding's grave, and let loose a small bird which some ruffian had trapped, [...] "because one hates to think of anything in a cage where English people lie buried," [...] the diary stated. Their tour was thoroughly unconventional, and followed no meditated plan. The foreign correspondents of the Times decided their route as much as anything else. Mr. Dalloway wished to look at certain guns, and was of opinion that the African coast is far more unsettled than people at home were inclined to believe. For these reasons they wanted a slow inquisitive kind of ship, comfortable, for they were bad sailors, but not extravagant, which would stop {{for a day or two}} at this port and at that, taking in coal while the Dalloways saw things for themselves. Meanwhile they found themselves stranded in Lisbon, unable for the moment to lay hands upon the precise vessel they wanted. They heard of the Euphrosyne, but heard also that she was primarily a cargo boat, and only took passengers by special arrangement, her business being to carry dry goods to the Amazons, and rubber home again. [...] "By special arrangement," [...] however, were words of high encouragement to them, for they came of a class where almost everything was specially arranged, or could be if necessary. On this occasion all that Richard did was to write a note to Lord Glenaway, the head of the line which bears his title; to call on poor old Jackson; to represent to him how Mrs. Dalloway was so-and-so, and he had been something or other else, and what they wanted was such and such a thing. It was done. They parted with compliments and pleasure on both sides, and here, a week later, came the boat rowing up to the ship in the dusk with the Dalloways on board of it; in three minutes they were standing together on the deck of the Euphrosyne. Their arrival, of course, created some stir, and it was seen by several pairs of eyes that Mrs. Dalloway was a tall slight woman, her body wrapped in furs, her head in veils, while Mr. Dalloway appeared to be a middle-sized man of sturdy build, dressed like a sportsman on an autumnal moor. Many solid leather bags of a rich brown hue soon surrounded them, in addition to which Mr. Dalloway carried a despatch box, and his wife a dressing-case suggestive of a diamond necklace and bottles with silver tops.|$|E
