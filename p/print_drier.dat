Unfortunately, the advance of printed electronics has been held back by the limited minimum resolution, aspect ratio, and feature fidelity of present printing techniques such as gravure, screen printing and inkjet <b>printing.</b> Templated <b>dry</b> <b>printing</b> offers a solution to these problems by patterning nanoparticle inks into templates before drying. This dissertation shows advancements in two varieties of templated dry nanoprinting. The first, advective micromolding in vapor-permeable templates (AMPT) is a microfluidic approach that uses evaporation-driven mold filling to create submicron features with a 1 : 1 aspect ratio. We will discuss submicron surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators made through this process, and the refinement process in the template manufacturing process necessary to make these devices. We also present modeling techniques {{that can be applied}} to future AMPT templates. We conclude with a modified templated <b>dry</b> <b>printing</b> that improves throughput and isolated feature patterning by transferring dry-templated features with laser ablation. This method utilizes surface energy-defined templates to pattern features via doctor blade coating. Patterned and dried features can be transferred to a polymer substrate with an Nd:YAG MOPA fiber laser, and printed features can be smaller than the laser beam width...|$|R

Initially, 3 D capable design software is used to draw the electrode model. The resulting file is simply loaded in a 3 D printer whose resolution is 42 μm on x- and y-axes, and 16 μm on z-axis. The electrode is made by an insulating acrylic-based photopolymer. It consists of 180 conical needles (distance = 250 μm) on a truncated conical base. The metallization process undergoes two steps: sputtering of titanium as adhesion promotion layer and evaporation of gold to lower the impedance and prevent oxidation of the electrode. After electrode characterization, experimental results are presented and compared with planar wet Ag/AgCl electrodes for recording ECG-EEG...|$|R
