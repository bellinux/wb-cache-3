40|$|Post-filling {{alteration}} through biotic and abiotic {{effects is}} a major risk in many shallow <b>petroleum</b> <b>prospects.</b> Once <b>petroleum</b> is trapped in a structure, these processes (e. g. biodegradation and –synthesis, water washing, gas stripping and gravity segregation) generally have strong economic consequences since they lead to a decrease in oil quality and reduce the total volume of petroleum in place.

The difference between wellhead and in situ resource values is examined, as well as drawbacks inherent in the concept of "oil and gas equivalents. " To be successful, any valuation method must correctly account for uncertainty - geologic as well as economic - and the value of flexible management in pursuit of optimal development and use of the resource. Although the traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) technique is workable and reasonably accurate in many applications, it presumes the analyst can clearly distinguish between systematic and non-systematic sources of risk. The real options approach may be better suited for applications where compound risks and managerial flexiibility are likely to {{have a significant impact on}} operations and economic performance. Options-based approaches have been employed within the industry for many years to account for the impact of price volatility and cost fluctuations. Assessing the value of a collection (portfolio) of geologically interdependent <b>petroleum</b> <b>prospects</b> requires a different form of real-options analysis since management holds the option to exploit information spillovers by exploiting prospects sequentially. Dependence among prospects gives value to this option and (perhaps contrary to popular belief) raises the value of the whole above the sum of its parts.

40|$|The {{international}} oil and {{gas industry}} views China as a key country in its search for petroleum exploration and development investment opportunities. China offers a range of opportunities  from mature, producing areas to frontier exploration areas. When Oil and gas companies make investment decisions to explore for and develop petroleum resources in a particular country, they need to examine many aspects of that country. The decision to invest focuses on assessments of the likely economic rewards and the risks involved. In this thesis, I attempt to provide a detailed assessment of various factors affecting the economics of petroleum exploration and development in China from an {{oil and gas}} investors point of view. The thesis is aimed at assisting international oil and gas companies to make investment decisions and assisting their understanding of the <b>petroleum</b> <b>prospects</b> in China.

The thesis quantifies and analyses the impact of Chinese fiscal terms by measuring the Government Take for a range of hypothetical oil field developments. It includes an analysis of the flexibility of the Chinese fiscal terms by quantifying the effect of Government Take on marginal field developments.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many studies (WAES, WEC, CIA, oil companies, etc.) have popularized the idea that world oil {{production}} will reach a maximum in the 1980 's or 1990 's and progressively decline. If cumulative production up to the maximum is calculated and compared to the remaining resources to be recovered or produced (taken from the WEC Delphi Study, for instance) {{it is possible to}} assume other types of evolution for world oil production as well, in particular a plateau extending over a few decades. Because of the continuing importance of oil in the world economy, such an evolution would be far more desirable than a prompt decline. But of course it is important to assess whether this is even possible and/or realistic. The IREP model (IIASA Resources, Exploration and Production model) has essentially been designed, in the initial version which is presented here, to explore such a possibility. Preliminary ideas for the resource model came from the Enerdym model (which was developed with Igor Zimin), especially the conceptual aspects of describing the "life" of a resource, from its initial status of "speculative resource" to its possible production. The IREP model is composed of a number of submodels: resource assessment (the most developed to date), an exploration submodel primarily aimed at obtaining an idea of the effort necessary (drilling, investment, etc.) to discover the assumed resources, and a production submodel directly linked to the exploration submodel but allowing the examination or various scenarios influenced by politico-economic decisions. In addition, the IREP model can also be used as a sensitivity analysis tool to explore how changes in some parameters [...] generally linked to the progress of exploration and/or knowledge of <b>petroleum</b> <b>prospects</b> or basins [...] can influence oil resources and their future production potential. As such, this model is not only a tool which {{can be used in a}} preliminary way for forecasting or assessing, but also a working tool for enabling a better understanding of world oil assessment. The resource assessment submodel has been developed in detail and tested with an application case. Results [...] although preliminary [...] are encouraging, and it was thought that this work could usefully be presented and offered for discussion. The input data for the application case will be refined, and more importance should be attached to the potential validity of the approach than to the first results, shown here in a sample run...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 69 - 71). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico continental slope features approximately 90 intraslope basins offshore Texas and Louisiana. Domes of high elevations, sometimes resulting in a difference of 1000 meters from top to bottom, separate these basins. Considering the recent turn of interest to deeper water <b>petroleum</b> <b>prospects,</b> knowledge concerning the surficial sediments in this area is currently of major economic importance. The continental shelf to the north of this region has been studied in great detail due to its vast stores of petroleum. However, the continental slope and rise have received relatively little attention. Recent studies have interpreted a conglomerate of high-resolution seismic data, but very few sediment samples were used for ground truthing. A suite of 182 piston cores from the northwestern continental slope and continental rise were used in this study, with the intent to identify, illustrate and describe the recent sediments unique to that region. In addition, this study set out to identify the depositional environment of that region, and reflect on surface sedimentation patterns, regional and local. In order to achieve these goals, this study employed select geotechnical tests, shear strength measurements, lithologic descriptions, and high-resolution imagery by x-radiography. Utilizing a geographic information system (GIS), this study attempted to provide a digital database of such sediment physical properties, allowing for convenient analysis purposes in the future. The GIS revealed that a veneer of low shear strength, homogenous clay blankets much of the study area. Erosional patterns were not discovered on a regional scale, but local patterns do exist. The shortest cores retrieved in this study came from locations along basin walls where slumps and slides are common. Alaminos, Bryant, and Keathley Canyons are three large, north-south trending systems of valleys and basins that are believed to have transported much sediment to the abyssal plain within relatively recent periods of geologic time. The only silty sediments encountered in this study were retrieved from these three general locations. In general, the study illustrated that highly localized sedimentation environments occur along the continental slope due to the topographic highs and lows in this region...|$|R
