The results also demonstrate the permeability measured from the FHM is lower than that from the CHM. The fundamental difference between the CHM and FHM is examined from the theory of fluid flowing through porous media.

50|$|Fibers {{are usually}} used in {{concrete}} to control cracking due to plastic shrinkage and to drying shrinkage.

Generally fibers do not increase the flexural strength of concrete, and so cannot replace moment-resisting or structural steel reinforcement. Indeed, some fibers actually reduce the strength of concrete.|$|E

40|$|Chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is one of}} the mjor {{factors that}} {{influence}} the corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete. It has been confirmed that the chloride pereability of cement paste and mortar varies widely depending on the water: cement ratio, type of cement, curing condition and so on. However, {{there are only a few}} reports concerning the chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> This study aims at revealing the effect of curing condition on the chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> in which Portland cement was replaced in various amounts by flyash and blastfurnace slag. The chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> was determined by the accelerate chloride permeability test using a diffusion cell similar to that described in Federal Highway Administration report (FHWA/RD- 81 / 119). In order to relate the porosity or pore size distribution of concrete to it chloride permeability, the mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements were alo conducted. The experimental results showed that the chloride <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> containing flyash and blastfurnace slag was high when the concrete was exposed to a low humidity at the early stage of curing.

The test cubes were 150 mm X 150 mm X 150 mm size subjected to wet-cured and air cured for up to 28 days.

It was found that the air-cured specimens achieved a higher compressive strength and lower water permeability compared with the wet-cured specimens. Foamed concrete with 10 % HA reduced the water permeability with a lower compressive strength at 28 days.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> a pervious <b>concrete</b> pavement {{to transport}} water through {{it depends on}} the intrinsic <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the system. However, this characteristic is usually defined in terms of the porosity of the material. It has been observed that porosity alone is an inadequate indicator <b>of</b> the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> pervious <b>concretes,</b> since the permeability depends on pore sizes, geometry and connectivity also. This paper presents a unique non-destructive method to determine the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> pervious <b>concrete</b> from electrical conductivity measurements. Combining the normalized electrical conductivity <b>of</b> pervious <b>concrete</b> determined using either alternating or direct currents with the porosity of the material, and applying it in a modified version of Kozeny-Carman equation, a new parameter called hydraulic connectivity factor is introduced. This factor {{can be thought of as}} a combination of parameters that describe the pore space volume and geometry in such a way that the intrinsic permeability is related to porosity and hydraulic connectivity factor. Using this factor, and the porosity, the hydraulic conductivity or <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> pervious <b>concrete</b> is determined. The hydraulic connectivity factor also provides a means to classify pervious concretes based on their hydraulic characteristics. The permeability values predicted using this method have a strong correlation with the permeability measured using a falling head permeameter developed at Purdue University for pervious concretes...|$|R

In this paper, the effects of retempering with melamine sulphonate naphthalene-based superplasticizer (RS), water (RW) and withhold water (RWW) on the compressive strength and water <b>permeability</b> (WP) <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> are experimentally investigated. The {{results of this study}} indicated that the compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> retempered with superplasticizer and withhold water, enhanced by increasing the delay in casting, while retempering with water, resulted in a substantial decrease.

The results indicated that the movement of H(2) O through unsaturated concrete was mainly caused by capillary suction and the movement of SO(4) (2 -) through unsaturated concrete should take into account diffusion, advection caused by a capillary suction flow and the reaction between SO(4) (2 -) and the cement hydration products. The <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> was determined by its microstructure.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{properties of}} fluids in the cover layer {{are the main}} indicator of the durability <b>of</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures.

40|$|In this {{research}} work, the durability properties of concrete {{in general and}} the gas <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> in particular are theoretically explained and in the laboratory investigated. The results of this investigation indicate that curing duration plays a significant role in improving the performance properties of concrete. It has been confirmend that compressive strength alone cannot be used to assess the durability properties of concrete. The overpressure method, which is developed to measure the gas <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> is simple, deliver quick test results, is relatively non-destructive, produces repetitive test results and the test procedure does not require preconditioning of test specimens before testing. The method is found to be sensitive for changes in durability parameters, such as variations in w/c ratio and curing duration. The gas permeability coefficients obtained using the overpressure method are compatible to the other durability test values, such as sorptivity, porosity and depth of carbonation. The moisture content in the test specimens is assessed by measuring the relative humidity in the concrete at the time of testing, and using the measured relative humidity values it is possible to distinguish between the effect of porosity and moisture content on the gas <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> (orig.)

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the effect of {{transition}} element oxides, added in the cement raw meal, on the intrinsic <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concrete.</b> Ordinary Portland cements were prepared, in pro-pilot plant scale rom raw mixes coground with 1. 5 % by weight of each of ZnO, V 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3 and ZrO 2. Raw meal of industrial origin and chemical grade oxides were used. The samples were thermally treated up to 4450 Â°C, rapidly cooled in air and coground with gypsum.

Flows methods using triaxial cells and air permeameters were used for measuring the injected water and air flows under pressure. It was found that, the higher the clay content in the mixture, the greater the permeability. At higher water âcementitious ratios, the paste matrix is less dense and easily allows water to ingress into concrete. But at high clay contents of 30 to 40 % clay, the variation in permeability was significantly diminished among different concrete mixtures. The obtained results also show that water permeability was higher than air permeability. However, further work is needed to determine the causes of the observed differences in air and water permeability results...|$|R
