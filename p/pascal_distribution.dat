Due {{to the fact that the}} scarab beetles are, relatively speaking, long lived it is challenging to drive down the adult population below the environmental carrying capacity. Mortality and predator/prey capture rates are modelled using the Weibull and <b>Pascal</b> probability <b>distribution</b> functions, respectively.

40|$|A {{continuous}} time {{model of}} the interaction between crop insect pests and naturally beneficial pest enemies is created using a set of simultaneous, non-linear, ordinary differential equations incorporating natural death rates based on the Weibull distribution. The crop pest is present in all its life-cycle stages of: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The beneficial insects, parasitoid wasps, may be present in either or all parasitized: eggs, larva and pupa. Population modelling is used to estimate the quantity of the natural pest enemies that should be introduced into the pest infested environment to suppress the pest population density to an economically acceptable level within a prescribed number of days. The results obtained illustrate the effect of different combinations of parasitoid wasps, using the <b>Pascal</b> <b>distribution</b> to estimate their success in parasitizing different pest developmental stages, to deliver pest control to a sustainable level.

40|$|We discuss various {{statistical}} {{distributions of}} earthquake numbers. Previously we derived several discrete distributions to describe earthquake {{numbers for the}} branching model of earthquake occurrence: these distributions are the Poisson, geometric, logarithmic, and the negative binomial (NBD). The theoretical model is the `birth and immigration' population process. The first three distributions above can be considered special cases of the NBD. In particular, a point branching process along the magnitude (or log seismic moment) axis with independent events (immigrants) explains the magnitude/moment-frequency relation and the NBD of earthquake counts in large time/space windows, {{as well as the}} dependence of the NBD parameters on the magnitude threshold (magnitude of an earthquake catalog completeness). We discuss applying these distributions, especially the NBD, to approximate event numbers in earthquake catalogs. There are many different representations of the NBD. Most can be traced either to the <b>Pascal</b> <b>distribution</b> or to the mixture of the Poisson distribution with the gamma law. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of both representations for statistical analysis of earthquake catalogs. We also consider applying the NBD to earthquake forecasts and describe the limits of the application for the given equations. In contrast to the one-parameter Poisson distribution so widely used to describe earthquake occurrence, the NBD has two parameters. The second parameter can be used to characterize clustering or over-dispersion of a process. We determine the parameter values and their uncertainties for several local and global catalogs, and their subdivisions in various time intervals, magnitude thresholds, spatial windows, and tectonic categories.

40|$|Four {{families}} of contagious distributions [...] generalized Poisson distributions, generalized binomial distributions, generalized Pascal distributions, and generalized log-zero distributions [...] are investigated in this thesis. The family of generalized Poisson distributions contains five distributions: the Neyman Type A, the 2 ̆ 2 Short, 2 ̆ 2 the Poisson binomial, the Poisson Pascal, {{and the negative}} binomial. The family of generalized binomial distributions contains eight distributions: the binomial Poisson, the binomial binomial, the binomial Pascal, the binomial log-zero, the Poisson with zeros, the binomial with zeros, the Pascal with zeros, and the log-zero with zeros. The family of generalized Pascal distributions contains four distributions: the Pascal Poisson, the Pascal binomial, the Pascal Pascal, and the Pascal log-zero. The family of generalized log-zero distributions contains four distributions: the log-zero Poisson, the log-zero binomial, the log-zero Pascal, and the log-zero log-zero. For each family of contagious distributions, the common probability generating function based on a biological model is derived by application of Feller 2 ̆ 7 s compound distribution theorem and Gurland 2 ̆ 7 s generalized distribution terminology. The common recurrence relation and the common factorial moments or cumulants are derived from the common probability generating function by using the successive differentiation method. Then for each distribution within this family, the particular probability generating function, recurrence relation, and factorial moments or cumulants are easily obtained from common ones. The equations of factorial moments or cumulants are solved. The maximum likelihood equations are derived for some distributions which {{have been shown to}} provide a good or excellent moment fitting. These equations are solved by an iteration procedure, Except for the Neyman Type A distribution and the 2 ̆ 2 Short 2 ̆ 2 distribution in which the maximum likelihood equations are derived from the probability generating functions and solved by the method of scoring, the maximum likelihood equations a re derived from the probability functions and solved by the Newton-Raphson method. Forty sets of biological and accident data classified into five types have been collected from various sources. A Fortran program has been written for fitting each distribution and a numerical example is given to illustrate the fitting procedure. In comparing the fits among these distributions, the chi-square goodness- of-fit values have been calculated and tabulated. The results suggest that the binomial distribution with zeros and the <b>Pascal</b> <b>distribution</b> with zeros be used if one is to describe the empirical data arising from populations having a contagious character. This is not only {{due to the fact that}} the two distributions have provided better fits to all five types of data, but also the fact that their maximum likelihood estimate procedures have no common disadvantages of other distributions. These disadvantages are that not every moment estimate can allow the iteration process to converge and that the probabilities must be recalculated after each iteration...|$|E

These are {{extensions of the}} classical Charlier and Meixner polynomials which are orthogonal polynomials {{with respect to the}} Poisson distribution and the <b>Pascal</b> <b>distribution</b> (negative binomial distribution). For multiple C harlier polynomials we impose orthogonality conditions with respect to&n bsp;r different Poisson distributions (with r > 1) and for multiple Meixner polynomials we use r different Pasc al distributions. Depending on the choice of which parameters we select, we then get multiple Meixner polynomials of the first or of the second kind. We give a generating function for multiple Charlier polynomials an d we explicitly compute the recurrence coefficients for the recurrence r elations connecting the nearest neighbor multiple Charlier polynomials. The most important result is the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of two neighboring multiple Charlier polynomials and the asymptotic behavior o f the distribution of the (scaled) zeros, which turn out to be uniformly distributed, independent of the choice of the parameters of the Poisson distributions. We also investigate the case where one of the parameters depends on the scaling and then find a combination of a uniform distrib ution and a new distribution, which in some cases lives on an interval d isjoint of the interval where the scaled zeros are uniformly distributed. We also give a generating function for multiple Meixner polynomials of the first and of the second kind and we compute the coefficients in the nearest neighbor recurrence relations explicitly. Using these formulas, we are able to build on recent results of Miki, Tsujimoto, Vinet and Zh edanov who introduced non-Hermitian oscillator Hamiltonians for which th e eigenstates can be expressed in terms of multiple Charlier polynomials or multiple Meixner polynomials of the first kind.
