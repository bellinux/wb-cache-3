The route continues further, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lumber yard, where it turns southward and further southeastward into the community of Finch Hill. In Finch Hill, PA106 passes Our Mother of Sorrows Cemetery and intersects with PA247 (Lakeland Drive) {{in the center of the}} town. After PA247, PA106 passes through a small residential district before reaching the Homestead Golf Course.

5|$|Delaware Route 54 Alternate (DE 54 Alt.) is an {{alternate}} route of DE 54 between Bunting and DE 26 in Bethany Beach. The alternate route heads northeast from DE 54 on two-lane undivided Johnson Road, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> mix of farmland and woodland. Upon crossing DE 20, DE 54 Alt. continues north along Bayard Road through more rural areas, {{passing through the}} community of Bayard.

DE 54 Alt. turns east onto Kent Avenue and crosses the Assawoman Canal, where it curves north and passes residential development before ending at DE 26 at Bethany Beach. DE 54 Alt. was designated by 2006.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

A photoelectric cell collects the light which <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the cuvette. <b>A</b> measurement is then given for the amount of absorbed light.|$|R

5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to their people, then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|NY111 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY27A (Main Street) {{in the town}} of Islip. The route proceeds north through the hamlet of Islip along the two-lane Islip Avenue, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> short residential stretch ahead of an intersection with CR50 (Union Boulevard). NY111 soon crosses the nearby Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Islip station, from where it continues north past various businesses and residences. As the road heads northward, it intersects with Bittermint Street, a connector to NY27 (Sunrise Highway) eastbound. After crossing over NY27, the route intersects with a ramp serving the westbound lanes and Islip Boulevard, which connects NY27 westbound to NY111.|$|E

Just past the cemetery, the highway changes names to Hawkes Avenue as it leaves the village for other parts of the town of Ossining. The route continues generally northeastward past homes to the vicinity of NY9A (the BriarcliffPeekskill Parkway), where NY134 forks from Hawkes Avenue and begins to parallel NY9A on Kitchawan State Road, a short connector to nearby Croton Dam Road. Upon intersecting Croton Dam Road, NY134 turns northward and immediately intersects NY9A at an at-grade intersection.|$|E

This junction also serves as the south end of NY9A's overlaps with NY100. NY141 initially heads to the northeast as an independent route, following the two ramps not carrying either direction of NY100. After just , all four ramps merge into a four-lane divided highway, creating a short overlap between NY141 and NY100. The divided highway ends at Brighton Avenue, the first road that it intersects. NY100 splits from NY141 here, following Brighton Avenue southward while NY141 heads southeastward along the two-lane Broadway, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> lightly developed commercial area. After one block, the route intersects Bradhurst Avenue, here a state-maintained street serving as a one-block spur of NY100.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Junius, the route follows an {{alignment}} parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large housing development and by a series of small lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds. NY318 continues on, <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town. Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road (County Route108 or CR108), NY318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets, a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY318 and the Thruway. Past the outlet mall, the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church Corner, where it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E
