40|$|INTRODUCTION We {{describe}} {{an extension of}} Bunched Typing, or the ##- calculus, as described by O'Hearn [2], intended to increase {{the flexibility of the}} system and to suggest further possible routes for investigation of bunched type systems. The system, called #sep extends the two binary context formers of the ##-calculus to n-place context formers with arbitrary separation relations between their members. These relations express pairwise separation constraints on the resources used by the members of the context. The system then allows a slight distinction between the combination of resources and the expression of constraints between resources. This system can express certain constraints that the ##-calculus cannot, and can express other constraints in a clearer way. This system is described more fully, with categorical and functor category semantics, in [1].

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of computer technology}} caused a shift away from real objects as sources of information towards desktop computers as the interfaces to information now (re) presented in a digital for-mat.

Our approach is to design environments that exploit the affordances of real world objects {{and at the same time}} use the potential of computer-based support. Thus, we move from human-computer interaction to human-artefact interaction. Combining the best of both worlds requires an integration of real and virtual worlds resulting in hybrid worlds.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the {{hypothesis}} that explanation of collective action between firms requires partly different variables from that used in explaining collective action between individuals. In order to look at the problem of what determines collective action, a model has been built using alongside social capital, the historical tradition of collective action and the activism of institutional actors as explicative variables of associationism between firms. The empirical results confirm the theoretical hypotheses put forward {{in the first part of}} the paper. First, social capital, institutional activism and experience accumulation, all together, enhance the propensity to collective action between firms. Each variable plays a significant role in explaining inter-firm co-operation. Secondly, these variables, however, affect the behaviour of small firms while the large ones appear to follow a different pattern of conduct. Thirdly, the empirical findings seem also to suggest that social capital and institutional <b>proactive</b> <b>initiative</b> produce synergic effects on collective action.

But can they make any difference in addressing current environmental challenges, which {{are becoming more and}} more global in scope? This PhD thesis explores and analyses the outcomes of <b>proactive</b> <b>initiatives</b> in the field of building energy efficiency, and the governance approaches taken. It addresses outcomes both in the socio-technical system that constitutes the building, and in the institutional sphere. The overarching objective is to contribute to knowledge on the role of local initiatives in addressing current environmental challenges. The thesis focuses on a number of governance initiatives in the form of policies or strategic approaches in urban development projects in Sweden, and one in Denmark. The primary focus has been on <b>proactive</b> <b>initiatives</b> for enhancing the energy efficiency of new buildings. Through a case study approach, the research is based on a combination of methods for data collection, including document studies, interviews and participant observation to analyse the governance approaches in local governance initiatives and the different types of outcomes. A key finding is that the local governance initiatives investigated have played a role in environmental governance through outcomes across socio-technical systems and institutional spheres. The combination of different modes of governing, including authoritative and enabling modes of governing as well as governing by provision, was important for fostering the construction of more energy efficient buildings. Another important element in these governing processes was the active governing throughout the development process. In terms of institutional change, it was shown that relation-building and knowledge advancement were fostered successfully, while it was more difficult to actually mobilise for change. The research also showed how local initiatives are shaped by institutions at higher tiers of government and that the local initiatives also contributed to shaping institutions at the national level. Based on this, the thesis argues for national policy frameworks, which better capture the benefits of local frontrunners...|$|R

Such small mobile devices can now become not only information browsers and service clients, but also information and service providers, complementing or replacing fixed hosts connected to the wireline network. Such mobile resources can be very important for other moving users and mobile devices, creating significant opportunities for many interesting and novel applications. The MobiShare architecture outlined in this paper provides a scalable infrastructure for ubiquitous mobile access to dynamic information and mechanisms for publishing, discovering and accessing heterogeneous mobile resources in a large area, taking into account the context of both providers and requestors. Any wireless communication technology could be employed between a device and the system. In addition, the use of XML-related languages and protocols for describing and exchanging metadata gives the system a uniform, easily adaptable and platform-independent interface, allowing a variety of devices to use it. The overall approach is data-centric and service-oriented, implying that all the devices are treated both as potential providers or requestors of data wrapped as information m-services. ♣ This research is partially supported by EU IST project DBGlobe (IST- 2001 - 32645) under the FET <b>Proactive</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Global Computing for the co-operation of autonomous and mobile entities in dynamic environments. 1...|$|E

We have designed and evaluated a technology-intensive installation at the Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The Museum aims at providing visitors with a comprehensive view {{of the history of}} technology and technical innovations. The science center, the `educational wing' of the museum, focuses on participation and physical interaction. Two important aims are to extend as much as possible the visitors' sensorial experience and allow for reflection. The exhibits include multi-modal interactive installations about scientific and technological themes (e. g. physics, human perception and natural history). We have, rather than adopting a traditional narrative-didactic approach to exhibition design, attempted to provide a forum that relies on implicit design features to encourage dialogue and discussion. The Well of Inventions [URL] is an attempt to provide an arena for discussion, collaboration and communication.
