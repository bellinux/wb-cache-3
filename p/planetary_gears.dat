Instead of vibration signals, this study uses transmission error (TE) signals for fault diagnostics of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> because TE signals (a) are directly related to the dynamic behaviors of gear mesh stiffness and (b) increase as damages on a gear mesh reduce the gear mesh stiffness. A lumped parameter model was used for modeling dynamic behaviors of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear.</b> For more precise modeling, mesh phase difference–between sun, ring, and planet gear – and contact ratio were taken into account in the lumped parameter model.
