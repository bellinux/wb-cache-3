In the present study, we found {{that this is a}} general feature of denitrifiers. Both the periplasmic and membrane-bound nitrate reductases of Ralstonia eutropha, Paracoccus denitrificans, and Paracoccus pantotrophus can utilize <b>potassium</b> <b>selenate</b> and potassium tellurite as electron acceptors. In order to characterize these reactions, the periplasmic nitrate reductase of R. sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans IL 106 was histidine tagged and purified. The Vmax and Km were determined for nitrate, tellurite, and selenate. For nitrate, values of 39 μmol · min− 1 · mg− 1 and 0. 12 mM were obtained for Vmax and Km, respectively, whereas the Vmax values for tellurite and selenate were 40 - and 140 -fold lower, respectively. These low activities can explain the observation that depletion of the nitrate reductase in R. sphaeroides does not modify the MIC of tellurite for this organism...|$|E
40|$|The lattice {{dynamics}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>selenate</b> is analyzed using a rigid-ion model with the selenate groups reduced to rigid bodies. The interatomic {{forces have been}} adjusted only using static structural data. The number of adjustable parameters varies from two to five. Such a simple model is already sufficient to reproduce semiquantitatively the phonon {{dynamics of}} the real system. In particular, the model exhibits the lattice instability leading {{to the existence of}} an incommensurate phase. The characteristics of the resulting soft mode agree with those observed experimentally. The calculated eigenvector, in excellent agreement with the experimental one, is rather insensitive to the details of the interactions. This explains the strong similarities of the incommensurate modulations in most A 2 BX 4 compounds. On the other hand, the form of the soft-phonon branch strongly depends on the force model. It is sufficient to fit the model to the static structure observed at 145 K instead of the one at room temperature, to provoke a conspicuous softening of the branch. The branch minimum is specially sensitive to some potassium-oxygen interactions. The relative size of the cations plays an essential role in the origin of the incommensurate instability. For comparison the results of a similar analysis for Cs 2 SeO 4 are presented. In this case, the unstable or soft character of the lowest 2 branch disappears.

40|$|We {{have made}} {{detailed}} lattice-dynamical {{studies of the}} origin of the incommensurate phase transition in <b>potassium</b> <b>selenate.</b> These were based on a rigid-ion model with Coulomb interactions, and also short-range interactions between restricted numbers of close neighbors. The associated short-range force constants were determined using the static equilibrium conditions for the crystal and the observed Raman frequencies. The calculations were made for the room temperature structure using the quasiharmonic approximation in which the effects of varying temperature were simulated by varying the short-range force constants. In this way we were able to show that the crystal has a low-frequency optic branch of Σ 2 symmetry which displays softening and instability for wave vectors q in the vicinity of q = 0. 3 a* where a* is the first reciprocal-lattice vector along the [l 00] direction. This is in agreement with experimental neutron scattering results and implies a transition to an incommensurate phase. Full sets of dispersion curves at 130 K for the [l 00] direction are presented. We also present comparisons of the calculated and experimental low-frequency Σ 2 and Σ 3 branches at 130, 145, and 250 K. We show, by decomposition of the squares of the normal-mode frequencies into a sum of Coulomb and short-range components, that the balance between these two kinds of interatomic forces is very delicate. This decomposition also shows that a transition to an incommensurate phase is very likely for both the selenate and isomorphous structures. Our model also enables us to predict that uniaxial stress will rapidly depress the transition temperature; a result also in accord with experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{tools of}} {{representation}} theory offer us a powerful insight {{in those terms}} in a system’s Hamiltonian which cause it to become ordered. Such is its power that, in many fields, the vocabulary of representations has become conventional; crystallography remains a notable exception. This thesis develops the existing methods for applying representation theory to symmetry lowering phase transitions in crystalline systems, and presents examples of its use. The opening section reviews the foundations and previous applications of representation theory to magnetic and structural phase transitions. Complimentary to the mathematical framework is {{a discussion of the}} physical interpretation of irreducible representations and basis vectors, the building blocks of any system model constructed in this way. Symmetry arguments are used to qualitatively discuss the symmetry breaking in ferroelectric materials and the role of phase factors in the loss of centro-symmetry. The body of this work is concerned with developing fast, reliable and repeatable methods for applying representation theory to displacive transitions. Calculation of a system’s basis vectors requires both a reliable method, and suitable starting resources. In this section, the first verifiable validation of the tables of Kovalev is presented, along with a strategy for determining the appropriate set of trial functions for use with the method of projection operators. Further, a new module in SARAh-Refine has been written which performs basis vector refinement of powder diffraction data to facilitate quantitative analysis using these techniques. Finally, the techniques of representation theory are applied to two experimental investigations: iron oxyborate and <b>potassium</b> <b>selenate.</b> The use of a single symmetry framework to discuss the structural, magnetic and charge-ordering transitions in these systems demonstrate the power of this technique. Representation theory provides a bridge between structure and properties; this work aims to strengthen the foundations of that bridge. ...|$|E
