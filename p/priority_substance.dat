40|$|The well {{established}} risk assessment COMMPS methodology (Fraunhofer Institut, Schmallenberg, Germany) developed at a European basin scale to identify priority pollutants {{based on their}} exposure and effects, has been applied at a local scale along a double step process: (a) first, the corresponding adapted list of priority pollutants has been obtained from monitoring data at a regional scale; (b) second, a new site pollution risk index has been developed for the relative comparison of the chemical pollution status of the investigated geographical region. As a case study, representative of the Mediterranean area, {{the process has been}} applied to 17 Catalan rivers (NE Spain), using the monitoring data collected between 1997 and 2006 in 207 different sampling sites. After an appropriate selection procedure, 52 parameters were finally used for the calculation of the local <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> and site risk indexes. From the exposure point of view the most relevant substances at the Catalan scale were volatile organohalogen compounds (VOX) and volatile aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene and xylene), whereas the <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> risk index points to dibromomethane (volatile organohalogen compound) and benzo-a-anthracene (PAH) as the most concerning compounds. The local and European <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> indexes have been compared, showing minor differences. Finally, site risk indexes have been calculated and utilized for comparison of the chemical status of different sites. They can be conveniently displayed in quality geographical maps and are considered a valuable tool for the environmental management and risk assessment of the region under study.

40|$|The 2000 / 60 /ECWater Framework Directive {{sets out}} a new {{approach}} for the assessment and management of chemical pollutants (i. e. formerly dangerous substances) in water bodies. The list of main classes of pollutants was revised and a detailed list of <b>priority</b> <b>substances,</b> including <b>priority</b> hazardous <b>substances,</b> has been provided. Moreover, the Directive asks for additional <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> to be identified at national and river catchment level. The implementation of the Directive requires the monitoring of the main pollutants after {{the identification of the}} <b>priority</b> and dangerous <b>substances</b> potentially discharged into each river catchment area, together with the definition of the Environmental Quality Standards. In this paper, an approach based on the integration of the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response model with the Environmental Risk Assessment as a support methodology for the monitoring management (i. e. choice of <b>priority</b> <b>substances,</b> quantification of Environmental Quality Standards, identification of interventions) is presented. In addition, a case study on the assessment of monitoring data concerning industrial and municipal discharges, and the surface waters of theVenice lagoon catchment area is discussed. Since 1998, very strict environmental quality standards and discharge limits have been enforced in the lagoon ofVenice and its catchment area.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) {{is a new}} instrument, that {{inter alia}} has replaced, {{harmonized}} and further developed the control and reduction of point and diffuse discharges of dangerous substances according to Council Directive 76 / 464 /EEC. Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive set out a 'Strategy against pollution of water' which demands specific measures against pollution of water by individual pollutants or groups of pollutants presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment (e. g. by drinking water consumed). For these <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> community-wide water quality standards and emission controls have to be established. On the basis of Article 16 of Directive 2000 / 60 /EC a list of 33 <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> has been adopted by {{the decision of the}} European Parliament and of the Council of November 2001. This list identifies 11 <b>priority</b> hazardous <b>substances,</b> 14 substances subject to a review for identification as possible <b>priority</b> hazardous <b>substance</b> and 8 <b>priority</b> <b>substances.</b> The Commission will make a proposal for the final classification of the 'substances subject to a review' (priority hazardous or <b>priority</b> <b>substances)</b> not later than 12 months after adoption of this list. The planned measures aim at the cessation or phasing out of discharges, emissions and losses to the aquatic environment within 20 years for the <b>priority</b> hazardous <b>substances</b> and at the progressive reduction for the <b>priority</b> <b>substances.</b> In this project the available data for these 33 substances resp. groups of substances for the Federal Republic of Germany were put forward and described in a standardized pattern.

40|$|Modelling has {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} effective and efficient tool {{in the area of}} water quality monitoring with new models taking in vast quantities of data and facilitating the development of more targeted water monitoring programs. With the Water Framework Directive demanding that monitoring requirements for a list of priority substances be met, achieving ‘good’ status in all water bodies by 2015, there is a strong need for improved monitoring programmes. In order to improve future monitoring programmes by making the process more ‘targeted’ a simple risk-based model for the occurrence of priority substances in wastewater treatment plant effluent was devised. This model was developed through the collection of an extensive list of documents relating to priority substances emission factors. These included wastewater treatment licence applications, trade effluent licences, traffic data, rainfall data and census data. It was found that by relating data from each of these sources to historic occurrence data it was possible to conceptualise and develop to a model of risk of occurrence of priority substances. Validation of this model was carried out using data from a 24 month sampling plan at 9 sites in two counties in Ireland. This work has allowed for the compilation of a large dataset of emission factor and <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> occurrence in Ireland where none previously existed. For the first time a risk-based model has been developed for Irish wastewater treatment plant effluents.

40|$|A {{vast number}} of {{household}} sources may potentially contribute to greywater contaminant loads. This paper investigates the sources, presence and potential fate of a selection of xenobiotic organic compounds (listed under the European Water Framework Directive as ‘Priority Substances’) in onsite greywater treatment systems.

A wide range of potential treatment trains are available for greywater treatment and reuse but information regarding the treatment efficiency of priority substances in these systems is almost wholly lacking. Geochemical modelling indicates that <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> removal during treatment {{is likely to be}} predominantly due to sludge/ solid phase adsorption. Since the majority of automated greywater treatment plants periodically discharge sludge to sewers, most systems are likely to be of limited benefit in terms of overall source control.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims {{to protect}} the aquatic {{environment}} and human health by reducing pollutants at the source. In order to achieve this, the concentration of priority substances should be lower than Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) values at the point sources. There are cases when the <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> exceeds the EQS at the effluent discharge, however, they should be met at a distance close to the discharge point. The zones {{in the vicinity of}} discharge points where the priority substances exceed the relevant EQS values are called mixing zones. Article 4 of Directive 2008 / 105 /EC allows member states to designate mixing zones when the pollutant concentrations exceed the EQS values at effluent discharges. But mixing zones should not affect the compliance {{of the rest of the}} water body with EQS standards. Therefore, mixing zone design should meet some defined criteria. Moreover for ensuring that design criteria are met and for facilitating the mixing zone application, member states are provided with a Mixing Zone Guideline. This project applies the Mixing Zone Guidelines at the Rönnskär Smelter located in the Northern Sweden with effluent discharges to the Baltic Sea. A second assessment of mixing zones is done in a mine area with discharge to Brubäcken stream. A “Tiered Approach” used in the guidelines is followed in assessment of mixing zones. The priority substances considered in the effluents are Hg, Cd, Ni and Pb. In the Rönnskär Smelter at Tier 2 determination of mixing zone length is done by the Discharge Test provided with Mixing Zone Guideline. CORMIX model is used for prediction of mixing in Tier 3. In the mine area the concentration of metals at the measured points showed no exceedence of EQSs, therefore there was no need for the mixing zone design. In Rönnskär, for effluents where more than one <b>priority</b> <b>substance</b> exceeded the EQS values, the mixing zones determination is done separately for each metal. Mixing zone AA-EQS criteria were met for each substance within a predefine distance of 500 m from each of the discharge points. However, much more investigation is needed related to the use of total and dissolved metals concentrations, consideration of background concentration and other input data which are site specific. Further research is also needed for mixing zone assessment where the effluent discharges contain multiple priority substances. We also concluded that climate effects, seasonal changes and other factors related to the receiving water characteristics need further investigation for a proper implementation of mixing zones for protection of aquatic and human life in Sweden...|$|E

A reduced model taking into account the significant variables and interactions between variables has shown a good correlation with the experimental results. Additional experiments conducted in natural and deionised water indicated that the alachlor degradation by ultrasound is practically unaffected by the presence of potential OH radical scavengers: bicarbonate, sulphate, chloride and oxalic acid. In both cases, alachlor was readily eliminated (75 min).

In this paper we investigate the relationship between overall persistence in a multimedia environment and the population-level exposure as expressed by intake fraction (iF), which is the cumulative fraction of chemical emitted to the environment that is taken up by members of the population. We first confirm that for any given chemical contaminant and emission scenario the definition of iF implies that it is directly proportional to the overall multi-media persistence, P{sub OV}. We show that the proportionality constant has dimensions of time and represents the characteristic time for population intake (CTI) of the chemical from the environment. We then apply the CalTOX fate and exposure model to explore how P{sub OV} and CTI combine to determine the magnitude of iF. We find that CTI has a narrow range of possible values relative to P{sub OV} across multiple chemicals and emissions scenarios. We use data from the Canadian Environmental Protection Act <b>Priority</b> <b>Substance</b> List (PSL 1) Assessments to show that exposure assessments based on empirical observation are consistent with interpretations from the model.

This report contains a compilation of Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s substance abuse treatment needs and specific research questions based on available stakeholder documents as of June 2001. This study also matches identified substance abuse research needs to recently completed and currently funded research initiatives in Oregon. Comparisons reveal that the state 2 ̆ 7 s research endeavors focus primarily on substance abuse prevention, adolescent treatment, and on partnerships and community mobilization. The majority of basic science endeavors focus on the biochemical effects of alcohol on the brain. Some responsiveness exits to research needs {{in the areas of}} client access and retention, treatment outcomes, Native American community needs, dual diagnosis, systems research, and on treatment provider needs. However, very little research in Oregon attempts to address needs related to family-based treatment, residential treatment, transition, or focuses on effectively treating the state 2 ̆ 7 s incarcerated, minority, disabled, or elderly populations. A need to evaluate Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s changing system of care was also highlighted. The process by which Oregon stakeholders will decide future research priorities is, unclear. Values of leading national substance abuse research organizations were compiled and revealed twenty-six criteria by which research needs might be prioritized. These criteria were adapted into a research priority-rating tool. Some Oregon stakeholders evaluated the usefulness of this tool and results are discussed. Above all, the goal {{of this study is to}} help promote meaningful action that addresses the most pressing needs of Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s consumers of substance abuse services...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{goal of the}} EU - Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve a good chemical status of surface waters. According to Article 1 (c) "specific measures for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of priority substances" must be implemented. For the <b>priority</b> hazardous <b>substances,</b> discharges, emissions and losses must be stopped or phasedout. Therefore {{the goal of this}} project was, on the one hand, to analyse the emission situation of the 33 <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> and to work out propositions to limit emissions, taking particular account of the situation in Germany. On the other hand, the goal was to technically monitor and support the ongoing work at EU-level, including a juridical examination of the EU-Commission's proposals. Substance-specific data sheets were compiled for the 33 <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> in order to present the information and data in a compact form. The relevance of the substances for Germany was evaluated based on the existing monitoring data, current use and emission situation. The important emission paths were analysed in detail for those substances relevant in Germany. Subsequently, national options for action were then identified and described...|$|R
30|$|Recommendations and Perspectives Looking at the – in {{comparison}} to the pesticides – very scarce knowledge for biocidal products, it is necessary to have a closer look at usages, environmental behaviour and ecotoxicity of the <b>priority</b> <b>substances.</b> For the practical application of the biocides, consulting should be given which is orientated on a best-practice procedure for the particular products.|$|R
40|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} pollution of water from chemicals is set out in Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD). As a first step of this strategy, a list of <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> was adopted (Decision 2455 / 2001 /EC) identifying 33 substances or groups of <b>substances</b> of <b>priority</b> concern at Community level. Recently, the European Commission adopted {{a proposal for a}} new Directive to protect surface water from pollution (COM(2006) 397 final). The proposed Directive will set limits on concentrations in surface waters of 41 dangerous chemical <b>substances</b> including 33 <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> and 8 other pollutants that pose a particular risk to animal and plant life in the aquatic environment and to human health. The proposal is accompanied by a Communication (COM(2006) 398 final) which elaborates on this approach and an Impact Assessment (SEC(2006) 947), which illustrates the choices that the Commission made. In addition, the WFD requires Member States to identify specific pollutants in their river basins, and to include them in the monitoring programmes. Monitoring of both WFD <b>priority</b> <b>substances</b> and other pollutants for the purpose of determination of the chemical and ecological status shall be performed according to Article 8 and Annex V of the WFD. The book chapter deals with the guidelines for chemical monitoring available at the current state of preparation for the upcoming directive on Environmental quality standards. JRC.
