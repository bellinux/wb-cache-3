50|$|The {{specific}} measurement {{process for}} one such instrument is as follows.It first optically scans {{the surface and}} measures the lightness variations. The specimen is illuminated with a white light LeD at a 15째 angle and the lightness is detected under threeviewing angles to simulate visual evaluation under different observing conditions: 15째, 45째 and 60째 measured from the specular reflection. The mottling meter is rolled across the surface for a defined distance of 10 to 100 cm and measures the lightness variations point by point. The measurement signal is divided via mathematical filter functions into 6 different size ranges and a rating value is calculated for each angle and mottle size. The higher the value is, themore visible the mottling effect. The measured values are displayed in a graph showing the mottle size on the X-axis and the rating value on the Y-axis. Thus, target values for small and large mottle sizes can be established for <b>paint</b> <b>batch</b> approval as well as process control.|$|E

50|$|In 1954 Beer {{moved to}} the United States, first working at a dry-cleaning {{business}} and then as an artist's model in Los Angeles, California {{at a variety of}} art schools. Dissatisfied with the work she was able to get, in 1956 she returned to Bluefields, where she raised four children as a single mother. To support her children, Beer collected bottles and plastic, sold them to recylers in Managua and used the proceeds to buy vegetables, which she then sold to customers. She began painting as a hobby. She painted the people around her, men working in the fields or on the docks, women cleaning, cooking and washing clothes and gave them away. In 1968, she was encouraged to make her living as an artist by a Dutch ship captain, who also painted. The following year she moved to Managua to see if she could become a professional artist. She got orders and sold works, {{but at the end of}} the year, returned to Bluefield. There was no market for art on the coast, but she would <b>paint</b> <b>batches</b> and either take them to Managua for sale, or sell them to art dealers who came looking for her.|$|R
40|$|The ROADEF {{challenge}} is organized {{every two years}} by the French Society of Operations Research and Decision-Making Aid. The goal is to allow industrial partners to witness recent developments {{in the field of}} Operations Research and Decision Analysis, and researchers to face up a decisional problem, often complex, occurred in industry. In 2005, the subject of this challenge has been proposed by the car manufacturer RENAULT and concerned a car sequencing problem. This problem involves scheduling cars along an assembly line with hard and soft capacity constraints. The industrial problem considered in the challenge differs from the standard problem since, besides capacity constraints imposed by the assembly shop, it also introduces <b>paint</b> <b>batching</b> constraints to minimize the consumption of solvents in the paint shop. We review the exact and heuristic methods of the literature proposed to solve the standard problem and we present the industrial context and the specificities of the challenge problem. We describe the process of the ROADEF' 2005 challenge and the methods proposed by the competing teams. We also analyse the results of these methods on the car sequencing instances provided by RENAULT. The final ranking of the candidates is reported and directions for future research based on the results are drawn. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{plastics}} in the automotive industries has increased {{significantly in the}} past few years. Concerns for the environment and the management of waste is encouraging the recycling and proper use of scrap material. Among others, polypropylene (PP) based bumpers are targeted for recycling because of their large volume and relatively simple material composition. Most of these bumpers are coated with polyurethane based paint which becomes dispersed into the matrix during reprocessing influencing the material properties. This seemed to be an important issue to investigate as it was shown by some other workers that the lowering of properties by the presence of paint particles was more significant than the material deterioration itself. So, with the complete recycling process, {{it is important to understand}} how the dispersed phase influences the processing and later the behaviour of the matrix so that in future investigations this knowledge can be utilised in further development of the recycled material. This has been the main theme of the project with the following major objectives: (i) to remove paint particles from the painted PP bumpers by melt filtration technique (ii) to determine the rheological and mechanical properties of the rubber toughened PP based composites dispersed with paint particles and glass microspheres and (iii) to understand the effect of dispersed phase on these properties by studying the morphology of the composites. Both commercially recycled material and real system blends prepared in the laboratory were studied to observe the effect of dispersed paint on the polymer matrix. Firstly the following materials were characterised using tensile, impact and rheological tests: virgin bumper bar grade material (PPIEPDMlta 1 c); two batches of material injection moulded from the virgin grade and painted with different levels of paint layers as found on car bumpers (unfiltered and melt filtered) and recycled painted bumpers (unfiltered and melt filtered). Extrusion melt filtration was chosen to remove the paint particles from the pp phase and the quantitative measurement of the dispersed phase was done by digital image analysis. Result of this analysis showed that only about 50 % paint was removed following filtration. Little variation was observed in viscosity values for all the samples with unfiltered batches showing slightly higher and filtered samples showing slightly lower viscosity compared to the virgin material. The increased value for the first case was attributed for the paint particles acting as the particulate phase in the matrix. On the other hand, lower viscosity was caused by deterioration of material with chain scission of PP. The elongation and impact strength of the <b>paint</b> dispersed <b>batches</b> decreased drastically compared to the virgin material as the paint particles acted as crack initiators and propagators. For the blends prepared, well characterised paint particles were dispersed into the PP/rubber/talc and PP/rubber matrix to be used as the &quot;real&quot; system. Talc itself is used as a filler in the commercial grades to impart greater stiffness, so composites without talc were worth examining to compare the effect of paint over talc. Also &quot;model&quot; filled systems with glass micro spheres were studied to observe the relative importance of particle shape and filler concentration. The choice to use glass as a model filler was primarily based on its spherical shape, non-deformable nature and relatively small surface area. The glass filled systems served as a comparison and helped in the interpretation of the rheological and mechanical properties of the paint dispersed in the rubber toughened talc filled and unfilled PP. The rheological study over the processing temperature range showed that the presence of small fraction of the dispersed phase (upto 1. 9 vol% for glass beads and 2. 7 vol% for paint particles) had insignificant effect on viscosity and at these levels the effect of particle size, particle size distribution and particle shape can be neglected. Only with increased filler fraction (5 vol %) a trend in increased viscosity was observed. From mechanical testing it was observed that the retention of tensile yield strength was nearly 100 % but elongation at break dropped significantly compared to the base matrices. This reduction was explained by poor interphase between filler and matrix. The modulus values for glass bead filled PP/rubber matrix showed an increasing tendency for high rigidity of the filler itself whereas for paint filled matrix it dropped below the base matrix value. For PP/rubber/talc matrix the scenario was different where a decrease in modulus was observed for all the composites. This was explained by the much high rigidity of talc particles over glass beads and paint particles. Though small sized talc particles acted as reinforcing fillers when added to PP/rubber system, the inclusion of second dispersed phase could not overshadow its effect on matrix thus failing as a weak structure. The drop in modulus for paint dispersed matrices was more significant indicating that irregular shaped paint particles had a smaller degree of interaction with the base matrix compared to spherical glass particles. A sharp decrease in impact strength observed for all the composites again explained the poor adhesion between matrix and dispersed phase which was also attributed from the photomicrographs of the fractured specimens. A separated microstructure was revealed for the composites which emphasised the explanation that the inclusions reduced the ability of the elastomer phase to absorb applied energy by reducing the distance between particles. A decrease in fracture energy and toughness for all the composites was also explained by the same. Models were proposed to predict crack propagation through glass bead and paint particle dispersed in the PP/rubber/talc matrices. For glass beads, crack propagation through the composite was attracted to the equator of particles so fractured surfaces showed clear hemispherical holes and top surfaces of debonded particles. For irregular paint dispersed composites, crack propagated through the interphase of filler and matrix thus debonding the paint particles. The composites under study were also related in terms of their rheology, morphology and mechanical properties. A separated microstructure of the composites as observed from the micrographs leads to the explanation of the slight increase in viscosity of filled composites over unfilled ones. Also poor interphase between filler and matrix leads to decreased property values in mechanical tests compared to base matrices...|$|R
