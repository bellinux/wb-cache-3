40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services implemented in 2006 for Medicare beneficiaries. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2004 - 2005). STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression and recycled predictions were {{used to test the}} disparities in meeting eligibility criteria across racial and ethnic groups. The eligibility thresholds used by health plans in 2006 and new thresholds recommended for 2010 were examined. Racial and ethnic disparities were examined by comparing non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) with non-Hispanic whites (whites) and comparing Hispanics with whites, respectively. Disparities were also examined among individuals with severe health problems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: According to 2006 thresholds, the adjusted odds ratios for meeting eligibility criteria for blacks and Hispanics to whites were 0. 36 - 0. 60 (p<. 05) and 0. 13 - 0. 46 (p<. 05), respectively. Blacks and Hispanics would be 21 - 34 and 32 - 38 <b>percent,</b> respectively, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be eligible than whites according to recycled predictions.

The authors compared minority graduates {{of the program and}} nonminority graduates in several areas: reasons for application, degree of satisfaction, appropriateness of preparation for epidemiologic practice, and current professional activities. A closed-ended questionnaire was mailed to all 87 minority graduates from the program during the period 1970 - 88, and to 172 randomly selected nonminority graduates. Of 259 graduates surveyed, 234 or 90. 3 percent returned the questionnaire [...] 89. 6 percent of minority graduates and 90. 7 percent of nonminority graduates. Virtually all graduates were satisfied with their EIS experience (95. 2 percent), have encouraged others to apply (96. 1 percent), and are the most frequent sources of initial contact of prospective officers (38. 2 percent). Most EIS graduates (71. 2 percent) were still working in epidemiology. Compared with the nonminority graduates, the minority graduates were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be women and to be single. Minority graduates were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than nonminorities <b>to</b> hold academic appointments (44. 2 percent versus 60. 0 <b>percent)</b> and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> work in academic settings as their primary job (11. 5 percent versus 18. 7 percent). At the same time, minority graduates were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have learned of the EIS Program from academic advisors (32. 1 percent versus 19. 4 percent).

This paper begins {{to shed light on}} this issue by exploiting a unique dataset of college students who have been randomly assigned to professors over a wide variety of mandatory standardized courses. We focus on the role of professor gender. Our results suggest that while professor gender has little impact on male students, it has a powerful effect on female students' performance in math and science classes, their likelihood of taking future math and science courses, and their likelihood of graduating with a STEM degree. The estimates are largest for female students with very strong math skills, who are arguably the students who are most suited to careers in science. Indeed, the gender gap in course grades and STEM majors is eradicated when high performing female students' introductory math and science classes are taught by female professors. In contrast, the gender of humanities professors has only minimal impact on student outcomes. We believe that these results are indicative of important environmental influences at work. ...|$|R

A relative lack of gravitational exercise can obviously contribute to bone loss, as shown most clearly in astronauts returning from zero gravity. Because the presence of persistent asthma limits one's ability to exercise, the resulting inactivity and other changes in variables reflecting the severity of asthma (e. g., weight, prednisone use, and airway inflammation) invalidate any reliable analysis of the effects of inhaled glucocorticoids on bone loss in groups that were so dissimilar at base line {{in the absence of a}} randomized scheme of treatment allocation...|$|R
40|$|Children of {{immigrants}} currently account for {{one out of}} every four children in the United States. Census Bureau projections indicate that by 2018, fewer than half of the children in the U. S. will be White, and by 2043, Whites will no longer be the majority of our nation’s population. It is the American-born children and grandchildren {{of immigrants}} that are leading this change in our demographics and will be setting the course for the future of this country. This is the first report to present comparisons of child wellbeing across White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian race-ethnic groups, as well as comparisons between children within these groups whose parents are and are not immigrants. The findings offer both promising insights into the well-being of many children in immigrant families, and devastating evidence of persistent disparities in children’s well-being based on race-ethnicity, home language, and immigrant status. At a time when public investments in low-income children and families, and especially those who are immigrants, are a topic of intense debate, and when the economic circumstances of even those families whose incomes fall above low-income thresholds are increasingly precarious, we must seek to understand these disparities and craft policies that restore equity for all children. Key Findings, by Indicator: Poverty and Near-Poverty Seventy-one percent of Hispanic children with immigrant parents and 65 percent of all Black children with U.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} explores people's perceptions, beliefs, {{and attitudes}} towards intimate partner violence in Bangladesh. Despite {{the importance of}} people's perceptions behind the prevalence of violence against women, no Bangladeshi study has explored further the factors that shape people's perceptions and beliefs. Moreover, far less is known about urban intimate partners outside rural marital relationships. This study utilizes a survey instrument to collect data from Bangladeshi urban college students (n = 331) and {{a small group of}} professionals (n = 99). Of those participants who were in a relationship (n = 313), a majority (73 percent) reported being in a dating relationship and the rest in a marital relationship. Thus, in addition to participants' perceptions of partner violence, the researcher collected data on the prevalence of violence in their relationships. The main factors analyzed in association with people's perceptions and their experiences of intimate partner violence are: gender, age, education, relationship status, profession, and having abusive male friends. Overall, participants' perceptions of partner violence were poor. Out of 430 participants, 191 refused to provide any information on their perceptions about what actions are considered abusive or which relationships experience violence. Another 120 said they "do not know" about intimate partner violence. A good percentage of participants perceived various forms of abuse (especially if perpetrated by men) as "proper. " For example, between 20 and 30 percent of the participants thought destroying partner's belongings, threatening to stop financial support, restricting movement, and stalking are "proper" if perpetrated by men. When examined further, male participants (35 percent) were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> perceive stalking as appropriate compared to females (22 percent). Professionals and those with more education (between 16 and 18 <b>percent)</b> were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> perceive stalking as "proper" compared to students and those with <b>less</b> education (35 <b>percent).</b> In addition to their lack of perceptions about partner violence, the participants held strong patriarchal beliefs and attitudes: between 45 and 55 percent of participants believed that men have ultimate power to control women; 20 percent believed that women who are raped are partly to blame, and 14 percent thought that a man has the right to force his partner to have sex. Once again, the male, young, less educated, and student participants were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> uphold patriarchal beliefs and attitudes. Given the lack of perceptions among participants about partner violence and their strong patriarchal beliefs and attitudes, high levels of violence within participants' own relationships were expected (supported by literature). Sure enough, high levels of partner violence and more alarmingly severe forms of physical abuse were reported, especially by the dating participants (mostly the college students). Between 23 and 27 percent of dating participants were beaten up, kicked, bit, hit, or choked by their partners compared to 12 to 15 percent of married participants. Moreover, 64 percent of participants reported having male friends who were abusive in their relationships. Later, a correlation analysis revealed that students, participants with less education, and dating participants were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have abusive friends, which in turn influenced the prevalence of IPV in their relationships. Those having abusive friends were three times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> perpetrate physical as well as psychological abuse.

40|$|Key Findings Gender {{inequality}} is a frustratingly {{stubborn and}} persistent challenge for many organizations. Not surprisingly, then, practitioners and scholars alike {{have called for}} additional research into gender differences in advancement and pay both to uncover the reasons why they occur and to suggest ways they might be mitigated, if not eliminated. This study answers that call by examining whether formal job posting is superior to informal sponsorships in: (1) fostering the advancement of women into higher-level jobs, (2) reducing the pay gap {{between men and women}} as they progress in organizations, and (3) encouraging women to seek higher-level jobs. Overall, the study’s answers to these questions are “yes,’ “yes,” and “it depends. ” Specifically, the research showed: Across the board, women were far more <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> be successful in their internal job searches when they used formal job posting than when they relied on informal sponsorships. This is not to say, however, that women did better because of gender per se. Rather further analysis showed that it {{had more to do with}} the relative standing of the jobs that women occupied. Specifically, formal job posting was more effective for those in lower-status jobs and functions, as well as for those embedded in large work groups, and in the organization studied (as in many others) these are the jobs, functions and types of work groups that contained relatively large numbers of female employees. Formal job posting trumped informal sponsorships when it came to the equivalency of salary offoes. There was no gender gap when formal job posting was used. When informal sponsorships were utilized, however, men received salary offers that exceeded those of women by an average of 1. 8 percent. Overall, women applied for posted jobs more frequently than men did. Again, this largely reflects the dominance of women in lower level, less visible jobs. When these and other job-related factors were controlled for, women were between 12 and 26 <b>percent</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> apply for posted jobs for which they were qualified. Taken together, these results suggest that women were impeded by gender-related and/or structural factors from using what for them would have been a particularly potent means of seeking advancement to higher-level jobs. Thus, the study strongly suggests that women benefit in terms of both career advancement and pay to the extent companies rely on formal job posting to fill vacancies internally. This is especially true for women who are mired in low status, low visibility jobs. At the same time, though it appears that a reliance on formal job posting will work only if organizations can find ways to overcome the impediments that tend to keep qualified women from making full use of this potentially powerful tool...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} factors {{relating to}} tether use and misuse. Volunteer testing was performed with 37 subjects on 16 different vehicles using 2 forward-facing child restraints (Britax Marathon 70 or the Evenflo Triumph), with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations {{on a set}} of four vehicles. Vehicles were selected to provide a variety of general tether locations (filler panel, upper seatback, lower seatback, floor, or roof), as well as a variety of recommended tether routings with respect to the head restraint: under, over, around. Simple instruction regarding the LATCH system was provided after the fourth trial. Subjects used the tether in 89 % of the 294 forward-facing trials and attached the tether correctly in 57 % of installations. Subjects were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use the tether if they were less than age 40, had previous tether experience, if the tether was located on a filler panel, and if the vehicle did not have any potentially confusing hardware. In addition, tether use was 83 % in the first four trials and increased to 95 % in the last four trials after instruction was provided. Subjects had the greatest difficulty in the pickup truck, which use loops of webbing as a router for the installed position and the tether anchor for the adjacent position; the tether was attached correctly in only 11 percent of installations. Tethers were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be used when the tether anchor was located on the filler panel of sedans, which had a use rate of 95 percent, compared to when the anchor was located on the floor, roof, or seatback, which had use rates ranging from 79 to 89 <b>percent.</b> Tethers were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be attached correctly when there was potentially confusing hardware present, 47 percent, compared to 70 percent. In addition, tether anchors located on the filler panel or mid seatback had higher rates of correct attachment, 60 and 69 percent, respectively, than those on the floor, roof, or lower seatback, which all had correct attachment rates lower than 50 percent. No vehicle tether hardware characteristics or vehicle manual directions were associated specifically with correct tether routing and head restraint position. Installations involving the single tether strap were 10 times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have the tether attached correctly and 1. 7 times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be routed correctly and have the head restraint positioned correctly, compared with installations with the v-shaped tether. Lack of instruction in most vehicle owner’s manuals regarding the routing of a V-style tether more challenging to use. With the single strap-style tether, it was more straightforward to have the tether strap flat and pull it tight, as well as to route it as directed. With the V-style tether, the adjustment hardware was often located underneath or close to the head restraint when installed in the vehicle, making it difficult to tighten. Recommendations to reduce tether misuse include labeling tether anchors, eliminating confusing hardware, allowing any head restraint position (including removal), providing instruction for routing V-style tethers, allowing options in tether routing, and redesigning tether anchors/routers found in pickup trucks...|$|R

They created two applicant profiles that were functionally equivalent. Their resumes were both very strong; they were very successful in their last jobs. When presenting these resumes, no one preferred one applicant over the other and they were seen as equally qualified. Next, a memo mentioning that the applicant was a mother of two children was added to one of the profiles. The resume was also modified to show that the applicant was an officer in a parent-teacher association.

50|$|A {{randomized}} controlled study compared probationers assigned to HOPE (n = 330) to individuals assigned to regular probation (n = 163). After one year, HOPE probationers were 55% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be arrested {{for a new}} crime, 72% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use drugs, 61% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> miss appointments with their supervisory officers, and 53% <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have their probation revoked than those on regular probation. HOPE participants were sentenced on average to 48% fewer days of prison than regular probationers.|$|R
