50|$|The main design {{weakness}} in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin like the CZ 52 and should never be dry-fired. Dry-firing the CZ-45 will also damage the extractor which acts as the firing <b>pin</b> <b>retainer.</b> Damaging the firing <b>pin</b> <b>retainer</b> bulge on the extractor will cause the firing pin {{to fall out of}} the pistol.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Stoner joined Knight's Armament Company. He {{continued}} his AR-10 design work and joined {{it with the}} direct gas system of the AR-15. The end result was the SR-25 (adding together the numbers of the AR-10 and AR-15) which improved the AR-10 design with M16A2 advancements and parts commonality. The original SR-25 was released in the early 1990s and had a heavy free-floating 24 in match grade barrel with a fiberglass handguard. It had a flat top upper receiver with a Mil-Std 1913 rail for mounting optics and a 2-stage match grade trigger. The bolt carrier {{was similar to the}} AR-10's, being chrome plated and having a captive firing <b>pin</b> <b>retainer</b> pin. The SR-25 was designed specifically to fire 168 gr g open-tip match cartridges. Accuracy was guaranteed at or under 1 minute of angle. At first, AR-10 type 20-round magazines were used, but they were later replaced by steel 20-round magazines resembling those used by the M16.|$|E
40|$|The <b>pin</b> <b>retainer</b> band is a 1 - 1 / 4 in. wide {{by about}} 1 / 32 in. thick steel band that is {{stretched}} over the pins circumferentially {{at the joints}} of the solid rocket booster (SRB) motor case segments. Its purpose is to hold the retaining pins in place during flight. Since the band is thin and is mounted stretched, or under tension, over the pins which are greased in place, {{it is necessary to}} protect it thermally. Three typical areas of the band location on the SRB motor case joints were chosen for verifying the cork thermal prection system (TPS) performance on the band: the joint in front of the attach ring, at the aft skirt joint in front of the kick ring and in an unperturbed area at the forward segments of the SRB motor cases. The kick ring area <b>pin</b> <b>retainer</b> band cork TPS passed the test requirements in the region where there are no phenolic splice caps. In the splice cap areas where the band TPS is closed out around the splice with K 5 NA, additional amounts of K 5 NA material is required to adequately protect the steel band. TPS requirements were easily met in the one location where the ends of the steel band are joined together after installation and tensioning. The attack ring area <b>pin</b> <b>retainer</b> band TPS did not quite pass the heat load requirements with the. 375 in. thick cork TPS as used for the kick ring area band. It is recommended that the cork thickness here be increased to. 50 in. The unperturbed area band TPS presented no problems...|$|E
5000|$|When used {{to retain}} piston wrist pins /gudgeon pins the clips {{are known as}} wrist pin clips or wrist <b>pin</b> <b>retainers</b> or gudgeon <b>pin</b> clips [...] The most {{commonly}} used circlip for this application is a simple spring steel circlip , or plain wire ring.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger impact wrenches, typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. <b>Pin</b> <b>retainers</b> used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small impact wrenches, especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|R
50|$|These {{are found}} {{exclusively}} on separating zippers. The <b>pin</b> box or <b>retainer</b> box aligns the insertion pin {{and the rest}} of the separating zipper to begin clasping of the zipper teeth. The insertion pin is the metallic end of the zipper that it placed into the retainer box to allow the joining of the two halves of the zipper.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2013, Taurus {{introduced}} a new G2 model to the Millennium pistol series. The G2 features stippled texturing on the grips, replaces the slide <b>retainer</b> <b>pin</b> with Glock-style pulldown tabs to disassemble the weapon. The Millennium G2 retains the same loaded chamber indicator as the prior Pro models, but replaces the Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system with adjustable 3-dot sights. [...] The Millennium G2 comes in two models, the PT111 chambered in 9mm, and the PT140 chambered in [...]40 caliber. The G2 models are rated for +P loads.|$|R
50|$|Stoddard-Dayton {{was slow}} {{to react to the}} {{emergence}} of a mass market and maintained a high-quality strategy after automobiles ceased to be exclusively rich men's status symbols. They were building cars as good as possible while Ford and General Motors were building as cheap as possible. Stoddard-Dayton continued to expand model offerings at all price points, but never changed fundamental manufacturing methods. The classic example of this was the 11-part radiator cap on the limousine - body, two <b>pins,</b> gasket, gasket <b>retainer,</b> screws, and latch. It was permanently attached to the radiator so that it could not be lost or stolen and could be opened with a flip of the locking lever, even when the engine was hot. Meanwhile, in Detroit, a Ford punch press was punching out caps and then an operation applied threads. True, the threads sometimes stuck and it could not be removed when the radiator was hot - but the Model T was selling for $399.|$|R
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered shank of a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the tapered shank of the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. <b>Retainer</b> <b>pins</b> prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the shank of the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|R
