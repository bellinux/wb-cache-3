40|$|The use of {{catalysis}} {{based on}} platinum group metals (PGMs) in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes is increasing rapidly, e. g. platinum and palladium {{are the most}} commonly used metals in many pharmaceutical processes. A major drawback in their use, however, is the difficulties in removing trace metals from APIs to regulatory levels (< 5 ppm) post catalysis. Furthermore, PGMs are on the European Commission’s 2014 list of 20 critical raw materials, which possess significant risk of dwindling supply and rising cost. This project will address the challenge of PGM removal post-catalysis using electrochemical flow reactors. We have previously demonstrated highly efficient and operationally simple electrochemical technology (batch and flow processes), for the synthesis of organometallic complexes in very high yield and <b>purity</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1). 1 -...|$|E
40|$|The {{depolarization}} {{properties of}} a medium with associated Mueller matrix M are characterized through two complementary sets of parameters, namely the three indices of polarimetric purity (IPP), which are {{directly linked to}} the relative weights of the spectral components of M and provide complete information {{on the structure of}} polarimetric randomness, but are insensitive to the specific polarimetric behaviors that originate the lack of randomness; and the set of three components of purity (CP), constituted by the polarizance, the diattenuation and the degree of spherical purity. The relations between these sets of physical invariant quantities are studied by means of their representation into a common <b>purity</b> <b>figure.</b> Furthermore, the polarimetric properties of a general Mueller matrix are parameterized in terms of sixteen meaningful quantities, three of them being the IPP, which together the CP provide complete information of the amount and sources of depolarization of the medium to which M is associated.

40|$|Fine {{chemicals}} and pharmaceuticals are {{high value added}} products that are produced in modest quantities. They are usually seasonal products that are customer specific and have a short shelf life. These characteristics usually placed a significant constraint in their production, such {{that it is not}} uncommon to see labour intensive batch processes being used instead of the more efficient continues process. This usually led to a significant waste generation during the scale-up from the laboratory to production scale. In addition, the use of hazardous and often toxic homogeneous catalysts makes the product purification and waste disposal an important issue in today's stringent environmental regulations. Microchemical systems offer a new paradigm for meeting these challenges. Recent advances in the design and fabrication of micromixers, microseparators and microreactors bring closer the realization of desktop miniature factories and micropharmacies. They represent a cheap alternative way for the production of specialty {{chemicals and}} pharmaceuticals by a continuas process, allowing simpler process optimization, rapid design implementation, better safety and easier scale-up through replication. This enables rapid product deployment to the marketplace and thus ensuring a significant competitive edge. New basic zeolite catalysts obtained by grafting amino groups onto NaX and CsNaX zeolites exhibit excellent catalytic activities for Knoevenagel condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate (ECA), ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) and diethyl malonate (DEM). The CsNaX-NH 2 catalyst displays higher conversion compared to aminopropylated MCM- 41 for benzaldehyde reaction with ECA and DEM (Figure. 1). The performance of a membrane microreader was tested and compared with that of microreactor, packed bed reactor (PBR) and packed bed membrane reactor (PBMR) for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate to produce ethyl- 2 -cyano- 3 -phenylacrylate. Cs-exchanged NaX faujasite zeolite was used as the base catalyst for this equilibrium-limited reaction. Hydrophilic zeolite membranes were employed in both membrane microreactor and PBMR for the selective removal of water byproduct from the reaction. The product yield per pass was low for the packed bed reactor. Higher yields were observed for the microreactor and PBMR, but the best performance belongs to the membrane microreactor, which displayed both supra-equilibrium conversion and better product <b>purity</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2). Analysis indicated that all water produced by the condensation reaction was completely removed and the membrane was operating below its capacity. This means that the performance of the membrane microreactor is limited mainly by the kinetics, now that both thermodynamic and mass transfer constraints were removed. A nearly fourfold increase in reaction conversion was obtained for the microreactor when CsNaX-NH 2 catalyst was used instead of CsNaX...|$|E

His earliest known works are a Nativity (1490s, Brera) and an Ecce Homo (circa 1495, Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection). One {{of his best}} known works is somber Adoration of the Magi (1495-98), in the National Gallery of London. In addition to the impassive, emotion-dry classicism, and the symmetric geometric logic of <b>purity,</b> this <b>figure</b> is notable for the imaginative cut-away of the building revealing a fanciful mountain backdrop.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{performances}} of metal oxides strongly {{depend on the}} chemical route employed for the synthesis of the powders. Ceria based oxides represent conventional SOFC materials for intermediate temperature applications. Various techniques for synthesizing nanocrystalline ceria based oxide powders {{have been reported in}} literature, including aqueous solution based co-precipitation and sol-gel techniques. In this paper an effective synthesis for the preparation of samaria and gadolinia-doped ceria is presented. The peculiarity of this technique is to combine the low cost of conventional co-precipitation with the small particle size and low calcination temperature of sol-gel chemical routes involving alkoxides. The reaction uses nitrates as metal precursors {{in the presence of a}} polyfunctional amine. Hydrolysis of coordination water performed by the amine leads to the precipitation of hydroxides. Subsequentely, amine favours deprotonation of the hydroxides and the condensation of the oxide at room temperature during ageing, as confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Further thermal treatments, selected on the basis of TGDTA analysis, are only necessary for the burnout of residual organic compounds, so very low calcination temperature is required. FE-SEM observations, EDS and XRD analysis were performed to characterize the powders in terms of morphology, <b>purity</b> and crystallinity. <b>Figure</b> 1 shows diffraction patterns for samarium doped ceria (SDC) at different steps of the synthesis. Figure 2 is a FE-SEM image of the SDC powder after thermal treatment at 350 °C. Powders were pressed into pellets and sintered at selected temperatures to investigate sintering behaviour of the material. Figure 3 shows the morphology of SDC pellet after sintering at 1400 °C for 5 hours. The ionic conductivity of the pellets was assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in air at selected temperatures. The electrical properties were correlated with the microstructure of the pellets, modified according to the different sintering conditions...|$|R
