50|$|According to Charles Horton Cooley (1864-1929), a <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> {{is a small}} {{social group}} whose members share {{personal}} and lasting relationships. People joined in primary relationships {{spend a great deal}} of time together, engage in a wide range of activities, and feel that they know one another well. In short, they show real concern for one another. In every society, the family is the most important <b>primary</b> <b>group.</b> Groups based on lasting friendships are also <b>primary</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> is {{typically}} a small social group (small-scale society) whose members share close, personal, enduring relationships. These groups {{are marked by}} members' concern for one another, in shared activities and culture. Examples include family, childhood friends, and highly influential social groups. The concept of the <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> was introduced by Charles Cooley, a sociologist from the Chicago School of sociology, in his book Social Organization: A Study of the Larger Mind. Although the group initially referred to the first intimate group of a person's childhood, the classification was later extended to include other intimate relations. <b>Primary</b> <b>groups</b> {{play an important role}} in the development of personal identity. A <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> is a group in which one exchanges implicit items, such as love, caring, concern, animosity, support, etc. Examples, of these would be family groups, love relationships, crisis support groups, church groups, etc. Relationships formed in <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> are often long-lasting and goals in themselves. They also are often psychologically comforting to the individuals involved and provide a source of support.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{theory suggests}} that <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> among the dissatisfied participants in an organization tend to decrease the compliance of the participants. But the present study found in a Nationalist Chinese Air Police company that <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> among the dissatisfied actually increase the compliance. An explanation of the conflicting finding will be discussed. The General Problem The significance of <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> in organizational study is well known. The authors of The American Soldiers (1949) found in tactical units that the direct identification with the total symbols of the military organiza-tion as a whole, of the state, or of the political cause {{in the name of}} which a war was fought, was relatively unimportant as contrasted with the feelings of strength and security in the military <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> and loyalty to one's immediate comrades. Such feelings contributed greatly to the combat effective-ness of individual soldiers (see also Shils, 1950; Goodacre 1951; Grinker and Spiegel, 1963; Oanowitz and Little, 1965). A positive relation between <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> and organizational effectiveness has also been found in man...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study is twofold. The first part of the study is {{concerned}} with analyzing and formulating the literature pertaining to <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> study. This body of literature exists within many diverse fields and represents both historical and modern study. This task will establish the theoretical setting necessary for Part II of the study. Part II is concerned with an experiment on selected <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> in which certain hypotheses are postulated and then tested statistically. These hypotheses involve the sociological variables of size of group, age deviation of members, sex of members, duration of group, frequency of contact and hours of contact per week. The sociological variables selected for this study do not represent all the logically possible variables which may be operationally defined and which apply to <b>primary</b> <b>groups.</b> They represent measurable variables which appear {{to be related to the}} natural <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> system. To determine to what extent these variables are related to the <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> system represents the fundamental purpose of Part II of this dissertation. The method by which these variables will be tested involves an experiment utilizing the responses of 75 graduate students to a questionnaire-and-interview technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rising {{magnetic}} flux loops {{in the solar}} convection zone develop an asymmetric shape with a flat preceding part and a steeper following part {{with respect to the}} direction of solar rotation. By a statistical analysis of newly forming sunspot groups we test the conjecture that this geometrical asymmetry leads to an asymmetric distribution of secondary spot groups originating from the legs of the same rising flux loop as the <b>primary</b> <b>group,</b> which develops out of the loop summit. We find that ∼ 10 % of all sunspot groups actually develop secondary groups within ± 20 ◦ longitude distance from the <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> and within one day after its emergence. Those secondary groups related to small <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> (area < 100 millionths of the solar hemisphere) are predominantly located on their eastern (following) side, while for larger <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> the secondaries are more numerous on their western (preceding) side. Both results are consistent with the geometrical asymmetry developed by rising {{magnetic flux}} loops...|$|R
50|$|The first sixty {{pages of}} Social Organization (1909) were a sociological {{antidote}} to Sigmund Freud. In that much-quoted segment Cooley formulated {{the crucial role}} of <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> (family, play groups and community of elders) {{as the source of}} one's morals, sentiments, and ideals. <b>Primary</b> <b>groups</b> are the first groups of individuals one is introduced to and are also influenced in their ideas and beliefs. They are the result of intimate association and corporation. He argued that individuals have two different channels of life- one from heredity and the other from society. Heredity is biological, it is the human nature that human beings are born with. Society is the human nature that is expressed in <b>primary</b> <b>groups</b> that we can be found in all civilizations. But the impact of the <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> is so great that individuals cling to primary ideals in more complex associations and even create new primary groupings within formal organizations.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism with Hcy metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with recurrent cerebral infarction. Methods: 40 patients with recurrent cerebral infarction who were treated in Yulin Third Hospital between December 2013 and December 2016 were selected as recurrent group, 58 patients with primary cerebral infarction were selected as <b>primary</b> <b>group,</b> and 60 healthy volunteers were selected as control group.

Results: CC genotype constituent ratio of recurrent group was significantly {{lower than that of}} <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> and control group while CT genotype and TT genotype constituent ratio were significantly higher than those of <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> and control group; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in recurrent <b>group</b> and <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> were significantly higher than those in control group while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly lower than those in control group; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in recurrent group were significantly higher than those in <b>primary</b> <b>group</b> while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly lower than those in <b>primary</b> <b>group.</b> Serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in patients with CC genotype were significantly lower than those in patients with CT genotype and TT genotype while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly higher than those in patients with CT genotype and TT genotype; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in patients with CT genotype were significantly lower than those in patients with TT genotype while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly higher than those in patients with TT genotype. Conclusion: MTHFR gene C 677 T polymorphism is closely related to the recurrence of cerebral infarction, and allele C mutation to T will affect Hcy metabolism and aggravate inflammatory response...|$|R
