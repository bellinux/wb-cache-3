60|$|Ellen {{felt the}} sun now {{on her left}} cheek and knew that the day was waning and that Colter was {{swinging}} farther to the northwest. She had never before ridden through such heavy forest and down and up such wild canyons. Toward sunset the deepest and ruggedest canyon halted their advance. Colter rode to the right, searching {{for a place to}} get down through a spruce thicket that stood on end. Presently he dismounted and the others followed suit. Ellen found she could not lead Spades because he slid down upon her heels, so she looped the end of her reins over the pommel and left him free. She herself managed to descend by holding to branches and sliding all the way down that slope. She heard the horses cracking the brush, snorting and heaving. One <b>pack</b> <b>slipped</b> and had to be removed from the horse, and rolled down. At the bottom of this deep, green-walled notch roared a stream of water. Shadowed, cool, mossy, damp, this narrow gulch seemed the wildest place Ellen had ever seen. She could just see the sunset-flushed, gold-tipped spruces far above her. The men repacked the horse that had slipped his burden, and once more resumed their progress ahead, now turning up this canyon. There was no horse trail, but deer and bear trails were numerous. The sun sank and the sky darkened, but still the men rode on; and the farther they traveled the wilder grew the aspect of the canyon.|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian {{referred}} to Mair as [...] "an extremely low burner" [...] who [...] "appears to have fantasised about killing a 'collaborator' {{for more than}} 17 years, drawing inspiration from" [...] David Copeland. Copeland, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and admirer of William Luther Pierce (head of the National Alliance) {{was a source of}} great inspiration to Mair when he bombed Black British, South Asian and LGBT populations on a 13-day campaign in 1999 in the hope of triggering a race war within the United Kingdom. Three died and more than 140 were injured, many losing limbs. Copeland was arrested shortly after this final bombing of the Admiral Duncan. Ten days after Copeland's first court appearance, a consignment of goods from the National Alliance headquarters in the United States were sent to Mair's home. According to a <b>packing</b> <b>slip</b> obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mair had bought numerous items from the organisation, including: manuals on the manufacturing of bombs and homemade pistols; 6 copies of Free Speech, a publication of the National Alliance; and a copy of Ich Kämpfe. Over the course of four years, he began to subscribe to Free Speech as well as Secret of the Runes and We Get Confessions. The SPLC released receipts showing that Mair had spent more than $620 buying publications from National Vanguard Books in the years 1993-2003, including works on how to make improvised weapons.|$|E

An additional problem was that, at the time, Italy's taxation imposed the application of a small paper slip similar to a stamp (proving payment of duties) on each and every valve used in the machine. Since dismantling the machine to apply the slips was out of question, the customs allowed Dadda to pay the tax as a forfeit, and gave him a <b>pack</b> of <b>slips</b> to apply on the machine [...] "as soon as possible".

40|$|FOODBALL (Food Biomarkers Alliance) {{is a large}} {{collaborative}} project (22 partners from 11 countries) funded by the JPI HDHL (2015 - 2017) which includes a systematic exploration and validation of nutritional biomarkers to obtain a good coverage of the food intake in different population groups within Europe. One of the aims of FOODBALL is to develop new online resources to facilitate identification of nutritional biomarkers using metabolomics. A major limitation in metabolomics {{is the lack of}} commercial standards to validate putative identifications. The FOODBALL chemical library will facilitate the sharing of not easily accessible standards for diet-derived compounds. It will be a virtual library, with compounds stored in the laboratory where they have been isolated. Version 1. 0 will be an online catalog of pure compounds and reference materials (food extracts, biofluids from animals fed pure compounds, incubation media from in vitro systems to produce metabolites…) made available by FOODBALL partners and associated collaborators. The catalog will contain the list of available compounds with associated data including elemental formula, monoisotopic mass, solubility, origin, purity, available quantity, storage conditions, stability, links to existing databases, type of spectral data available and contact details of the laboratory offering to share the standard. The catalog will be queryable by compound name and chemical structure. In the final version, which should be available at the end of 2016, spectral data (GC-MS, LC-MS, NMR, UV, IR) collected in standardized formats will be made queryable online. Anyone interested in one compound in the catalog will directly contact the provider. A bilateral negotiation will define the terms of collaboration. A financial compensation in addition to the shipping fees is possible if agreed. Contributors and users will have to respect a charter of good practices. For example the provider will have to indicate on a <b>packing</b> <b>slip</b> the minimum information regarding the appearance of the product, quantity, recommended storage conditions, stability and safety information if available. The acquirer will bear all shipping costs, and will have to share the spectral analyses he has acquired on his own analytical platform. This will continuously enrich the content of the chemical library. The library will allow to post a demand for a non-available compound, to stimulate its synthesis or isolation. The greatest need is for human metabolites of food-derived compounds...|$|E
6000|$|The ugly glade {{became a}} place of color and action. The Navajos rode wiry, wild-looking mustangs and drove ponies and burros {{carrying}} packs, most of which consisted of deer-hides. Each Indian dismounted, and unstrapping the blanket which {{had served as a}} saddle headed his mustang for the water-hole and gave him a slap. Then the hides and <b>packs</b> were <b>slipped</b> from the pack-train, and soon the pool became a kicking, splashing melee. Every cedar-tree circling the glade and every branch served as a peg for deer meat. Some of it was in the haunch, the bulk in dark dried strips. The Indians laid their weapons aside. Every sagebush and low stone held a blanket. A few of these blankets were of solid color, most of them had bars of white and gray and red, the last color predominating. The mustangs and burros filed out among the cedars, nipping at the sage and the scattered tufts of spare grass. A group of fires, sending up curling columns of blue smoke, and surrounded by a circle of lean, half-naked, bronze-skinned Indians, cooking and eating, completed a picture which afforded Hare the satisfying fulfilment of boyish dreams. What a contrast to the memory of a camp-site on the Connecticut shore, with boy friends telling tales in the glow of the fire, and the wash of the waves on the beach! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} of nanostructure of calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) in Portland cement (PC) paste under compression {{was characterized by}} the atomic pair distribution function (PDF), measured using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The PDF of the PC paste exhibited a unique deformation behavior for a short-range order below 2. 0 [*]nm, close {{to the size of}} the C-S-H globule, while the deformation for a long-range order was similar to that of a calcium hydroxide phase measured by Bragg peak shift. The compressive {{deformation of}} the C-S-H nanostructure was comprised of three stages with different interactions between globules. This behavior would originate from the granular nature of C-S-H, which deforms with increasing <b>packing</b> density by <b>slipping</b> the interfaces between globules, rearranging the overall C-S-H nanostructure. This new approach will lead to increasing applications of the PDF technique to understand the deformation mechanism of C-S-H in PC-based materials...|$|R

60|$|The square {{is packed}} {{away in the}} centre of Thrums, and irregularly built little houses squeeze close to it like {{chickens}} clustering round a hen. Once the Auld Lichts held property in the square, but other denominations have bought them out of it, and now few of them are even {{to be found in}} the main streets that make for the rim of the cup. They live in the kirk-wynd, or in retiring little houses the builder of which does not seem to have remembered that it is a good plan to have a road leading to houses until after they were finished. Narrow paths straggling round gardens, some of them with stunted gates, which it is commoner to step over than to open, have been formed to reach these dwellings, but in winter they are running streams, and then the best way to reach a house such as that of Tammy Mealmaker the wright, pronounced wir-icht, is over a broken dyke and a pig-sty. Tammy, who died a bachelor, had been soured in his youth by a disappointment in love, of which he spoke but seldom. She lived far away in a town to which he had wandered in the days when his blood ran hot, and they became engaged. Unfortunately, however, Tammy forgot her name, and he never knew the address; so there the affair ended, to his silent grief. He admitted himself, over his snuff-mull of an evening, that he was a very ordinary character, but a certain halo of horror was cast over the whole family by their connection with little Joey Sutie, who was pointed at in Thrums as the laddie that whistled when he went past the minister. Joey became a pedlar, and was found dead one raw morning dangling over a high wall within a few miles of Thrums. When climbing the dyke his <b>pack</b> had <b>slipped</b> back, the strap round his neck, and choked him.|$|R
5000|$|Citron {{was also}} {{described}} by Pliny the Elder, who called it nata Assyria malus. The following is {{from his book}} Natural History:There is another tree also with the same name of [...] "citrus," [...] and bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike for its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand, {{there are some who}} esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an ornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.The citron tree, called the Assyrian, and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons. The leaf {{is similar to that of}} the arbute, except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.The tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to <b>pack</b> all <b>slips</b> of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.It has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Media or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the Parthian grandees employ in seasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.Citrons, either the pulp of them or the pips, are taken in wine as an antidote to poisons. A decoction of citrons, or the juice extracted from them, is used as a gargle to impart sweetness to the breath. The pips of this fruit are recommended for pregnant women to chew when affected with qualmishness. Citrons are good, also, for a weak stomach, but it is not easy to eat them except with vinegar.|$|R
