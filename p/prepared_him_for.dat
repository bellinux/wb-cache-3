5|$|Schneider {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. He honed the style with goaltending consultant Brian Daccord, beginning {{at the age of}} 15. After joining the Canucks as a backup in 2010–11, Schneider began working with the team goaltending coach Roland Melanson, who encouraged him to play shallower in his crease. Schneider adopted the style which required him to be more athletic on first shots, but better <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> rebounds and cross-crease plays. Schneider's strengths are his size and athleticism. His coach with the Moose, Scott Arniel, has also heralded his ability to get into position ahead of time, anticipating plays.|$|E
5|$|When he was {{fourteen}} {{he was sent}} to Winchester College, which was known as both the most academic of the main public schools and also for its discomfort. Schuster's time at St George's had <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> discomfort, however, and he was noted as being very proud of attending the school. While at Winchester Schuster played Winchester College football and was occasionally involved in debates; he was not, however, noted as a particularly exceptional pupil. He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1892; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student, which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying. Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949, an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford. After graduation, he applied to become a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford but was rejected.|$|E

25|$|French {{had already}} created (1909–1912) a major {{memorial}} statue of Lincoln—this one standing—for the Nebraska State Capitol (Abraham Lincoln, 1912) in Lincoln, Nebraska. His {{previous studies of}} Lincoln—which included biographies, photographs, and a life mask of Lincoln by Leonard Volk done in 1860—had <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the challenging task of the larger statue. For the national memorial, he and Bacon decided that a large seated figure would be most appropriate. French started with a small clay study and subsequently created several plaster models, each time making subtle changes in the figure's pose or setting. He placed the President not in an ordinary 19th-century seat, but in a classical chair including fasces, a Roman symbol of authority, to convey that the subject was an eminence for all the ages.|$|E

This <b>prepares</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the more mature relationship with Juliet—one fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets.

25|$|Frindall {{was also}} known for {{producing}} scoring charts for many of his tours with England. He modified the linear scoring system invented by John Atkinson Pendlington and developed by Australian scorer Bill Ferguson into a version that {{is known as the}} Frindall system. Frindall met Ferguson in 1953, when he was 14 years old. The concentration needed to maintain such consistently high-quality work was immense, and Frindall believed it was his time in the RAF that <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the task. Writing honed by his training to be an architect meant that each page was beautifully laid out and easy to read. Every scorecard, like the wagon-wheels he produced to show where a batsman scored his runs after playing a significant innings, was a work of art. Frindall's work was so meticulously accurate that the commentators would habitually trust his figures if they differed from the official scoreboard.|$|E
25|$|Cadoc {{was born}} in Monmouthshire around the year 497. An angel {{announced}} his birth and summoned the hermit Meuthi to baptise and teach him. A holy well sprang up for his baptism and afterwards flowed with wine and milk. It is {{thought that he was}} baptised as Cathmail (Cadfael). After the birth of his son, Gwynllyw went on a wild celebratory raid with a new band of fearless warriors. Among other livestock, he stole the cow of an Irish monk, St. Tathyw of Caerwent. This is probably Tathan, a reputed early abbot of nearby Caerwent whose dedications appear around Llantwit Major. Tathyw was not afraid of Gwynllyw and boldly went to confront him, demanding the return of the cow. On a sudden impulse, or perhaps guided by divine inspiration, Gwynllyw decided Cadoc would go to live under the monk's care, and he was sent away to be educated at Tathyw's monastery in Caerwent. Cadoc picked up a basic knowledge of Latin and received a rudimentary education that <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> further studies in Ireland and Wales. Most important, Cadoc learned to appreciate the life of a monk and a priest.|$|E

500|$|Not much {{is known}} about Cranmer's {{thoughts}} and experiences during his three decades at Cambridge. Traditionally, he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> the adoption of Lutheran ideas, which were spreading during the 1520s. However, a study of his marginalia reveals an early antipathy to Martin Luther and an admiration for Erasmus. When Cardinal Wolsey, the king's Lord Chancellor, selected several Cambridge scholars, including Edward Lee, Stephen Gardiner and Richard Sampson, to be diplomats throughout Europe, Cranmer was chosen to take a minor role in the English embassy in Spain. Two recently discovered letters written by Cranmer describe an early encounter with the king, Henry VIII of England: [...] upon Cranmer's return from Spain, in June 1527, the king personally interviewed Cranmer for half an hour. [...] Cranmer described the king as [...] "the kindest of princes".|$|E

Accompanying them, he spotted in the dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 German troops headed toward them from the east. Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were Fallschirmjäger, among the best soldiers Germany could field. None of his training or experience <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> this situation, outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1. Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit. The platoon's telephone land line to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out, but their SCR-300 radio still worked. Bouck reached Regimental headquarters at Hünningen on the radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action. He was told to [...] "remain in position and reinforcements from the 3rd Battalion will come to support you." ...|$|E

[...] (American Journal of Psychiatry, 1957), was not received well by his colleagues.

The highest {{mountain}} stage, where Fignon could have extended his lead as the better climber, was cancelled by race organizers [...] "due to bad weather". In one of the more outrageous actions of a major tour, on the final stage, an individual time trial, camera helicopters flew in front of Fignon, creating a headwind, and behind Moser, creating a tailwind. Though Fignon repeatedly shook his fists at the obstructing aircraft, they refused to move off. [...] Moser ended up gaining enough time to take the overall race lead, with Fignon being moved back to second place.

[...] Other students came seeking his help in translating passages from their classical studies; they soon gave him the nickname [...] "Homer" [...] on account of his quickness at construing. [...] In November 1857, he took the King's Scholarship examination for admission to Durham Grammar School, located seventy miles away. [...] As his Carlisle teachers had not <b>prepared</b> <b>him</b> <b>for</b> translation of Latin verse, he left a portion of the exam unanswered and felt certain he had failed.
