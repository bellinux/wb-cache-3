5|$|Southwark {{was settled}} by the Romans around 43 CE. It {{served as an}} entry point into London from {{southern}} England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran into what is now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and <b>prisons.</b> <b>In</b> 1796 there were five <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> Southwark—the Clink, King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} of local <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E

5|$|James Neild {{visited the}} Marshalsea {{again during the}} first year of the new building's existence, {{publishing}} a description of it in 1812.

More material is available in a pamphlet, An Expose of the Practice of the Palace, or Marshalsea Court, written in 1833 by an anonymous eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|The Marshalsea (1373–1842) was {{a notorious}} prison in Southwark (now London), {{just south of}} the River Thames. Although it housed a variety of prisoners, {{including}} men accused of crimes at sea and political figures charged with sedition, it became known, in particular, for its incarceration of the poorest of London's debtors. Over half the population of England's <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century were in jail because of debt.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{her final}} {{semester}} of study, Levy moved to Washington, D.C., to become a paid intern with the Federal Bureau of <b>Prisons.</b> <b>In</b> October 2000 she began her internship at the bureau's headquarters, where she {{was assigned to the}} public affairs division. Her supervisor, bureau spokesperson Dan Dunne, was impressed with Levy's work, especially her handling of media inquiries regarding the upcoming execution of Timothy McVeigh, convicted of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Levy's internship was abruptly terminated in April 2001 because her academic eligibility was found to have expired in December 2000.

5|$|His {{father was}} {{released}} after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had {{to continue working}} at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> The Pickwick Papers (1836–1837), David Copperfield (1849–1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.|$|E

The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail {{in an attempt to}} establish whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled so as not to conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of <b>Prisons</b> <b>in</b> September 1889.|$|E
5|$|The main prison {{building}} {{was built in}} 1910–1912 during its time as a United States Army military prison; Alcatraz had been {{the site of a}} citadel since the 1860s. The United States Disciplinary Barracks, Pacific Branch on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a prison of the Federal Bureau of <b>Prisons</b> <b>in</b> August 1934 after the buildings were modernized to meet the requirements of a top-notch security prison. Given this high security and the location of Alcatraz in the cold waters and strong currents of San Francisco Bay, the prison operators believed Alcatraz to be escape-proof and America's strongest prison.|$|E

5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian Embassy siege {{took place}} from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after {{a group of}} six armed men stormed the Iranian embassy in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, members of an Iranian Arab group campaigning for Arab {{national}} sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage—mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors {{as well as a}} police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. Margaret Thatcher's government quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.|$|E
5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E

5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the <b>Prisons</b> <b>in</b> England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of the <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at the Tower was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. The Tower was often a safer place than other <b>prisons</b> <b>in</b> London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
