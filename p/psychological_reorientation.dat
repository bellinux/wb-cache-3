40|$|Abstract. This article {{views the}} bureaucratic form of {{organization}} as both an agent and {{an expression of}} key modern social innovations that are most clearly manifested in the non-inclusive terms by which individuals are involved in organizations. Modern human involvement in organizations epitomizes and institutionally embeds the crucial yet often overlooked cultural orientation of modernity whereby humans undertake ac-tion along well-specified and delimited paths thanks to their capacity to isolate and suspend other personal or social considerations. The organizational involvement of humans qua role agents rather than qua persons helps unleash formal organizing from being tied to the indolence {{of the human body}} and the languish process of per-sonal or <b>psychological</b> <b>reorientation.</b> Thanks to the loosening of these ties, the bu-reaucratic organization is rendered capable to address the shifting contingencies un-derlying modern life by reshuffling and re-assembling the roles and role patterns by which it is made. The historically unique adaptive capacity of bureaucracy remains though hidden behind the ubiquitous presence of routines and standard operating procedures –requirements for the standardization of roles – that are mistakenly ex-changed for the essence of the bureaucratic form. The reigning myth today is that the evils of society can all be understood as evils of impersonality, alienation, and coldness. The sum of these three is an ideology of intimacy…[that] transmutes political categories into psychological categories...|$|E

Osobe ozlijeđene u ratu osobito su izložene tim faktorima. Psihološke reakcije na traumatsku krizu odvijaju se u četiri faze: fazi šoka, fazi reakcije, fazi prilagodbe te fazi reorijentacije. Važno je da se ti faktori identificiraju i pomogne bolesniku na način najprimjereniji svakoj fazi, te utvrde psihološki obrambeni mehanizmi kao i tipični mentalni i psihosomatski simptomi, koji ovise o vrsti i opsegu traume, karakteristikama ličnosti i spremnosti za prihvaćanje liječenja. Most severe {{psychological}} crises {{are caused}} {{by a combination of}} two pathological factors: sel 2 ̆ 7 ious threat to life, loss of limb or organ/or bodily func tion. Those injured in war are exposed {{to one of the most}} diff. icult psychological crises which is caused by: l) threat to his physical survival, 2) loss of limb and/or bodiliy function. Ps. ychological reactions to a traumatic crisis follow specific, well established steps: l. Shock p hase, 2. Reaction phase, 3. Adaption phase 4. Reorientation phase. I t is important to recognize these factors and help the afflicted person in ways appropriate to each specific phase. Otherwise a great ri-sk exis. ts that he will become fixated in one of the three first phases, which will result in serious negat ive consequences for the patient. The medical staff mut be able to recognize both psychological defence mechanisms that are normally activated within each phase as well as typical mental and psychosomatic symptoms. Our manner of treating the injured person must be appropriate at each phase in order that the working through of the crisis can proceed favorably. Defence mechanisms that are activated and the symptoms that a patient experiences are largely dependent on: the type and degree of the trauma, the personality characteristics of the injured person, the availability of appropriate and receptive treatment. Appropriate and involved, receptive treatment are essential for the patient 2 ̆ 7 s <b>psychological</b> <b>reorientation,</b> but also for his somatic recovery...|$|E
40|$|Peace {{is both an}} {{ill-defined}} {{concept and}} an elusive reality, this paper seeks to re-conceptualize the former {{as a means of}} improving the prospects of the latter. In doing so, this study asserts that the concept of a positive peace—meaning a post-conflict situation which is defined by something more than the mere absence of violence—is a realistic objective for modern peacebuilding operations. Nevertheless, the realization of this goal is precluded by an unproblematized belief in the universal benefits of liberal peace processes. This paper will present a critique of, and outline possible alternatives to, this dominant ideational model in order to propose how future peacebuilding operations can avoid the common failures that have undermined recent attempts at establishing a positive peace in post-conflict societies. In the aftermath of a lengthy civil war, numerous questions arise regarding the extent to which fundamental processes such as social reconstruction, combatant reintegration and <b>psychological</b> recovery and <b>reorientation</b> are possible in the attempt to establish a lasting and stable order amongst divisive animosities and mass trauma. These debates are largely centred around the significant disconnect between the inextricably linked notions of negative and positive peace, with the former residing at the despondent limit of the spectrum denoting possibilities of succes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the careers of two photographers, Alfred Stieglitz (1864 - 1946) and Jacob A. Riis (1849 - 1914), and {{examines}} their work {{in terms of its}} educative intentions, content, and consequences. Stieglitz and Riis did not occupy traditional pedagogical roles in schools or universities, but nonetheless they assumed positions of influence and sought to inform and shape the values and actions of their contemporaries. They occupied formative positions within two traditions of photography which have evolved around their respective concerns: photography as a means of social analysis and criticism, and photography as a fine art. ^ As a journalist and seminal figure in the social reform movement of the late 19 th century in America, Riis was among the first photographers in this country to see the potential of the photograph as a direct means of social criticism. By documenting the tenement house conditions of New York City (primarily in the 18802 ̆ 7 s and early 18902 ̆ 7 s), Riis introduced his photographs into a broad campaign for urban reform. Responding to social tensions caused by urbanization and immigration, he used the dominant systems of communication and nonformal education to disseminate information, advocate tenement house improvements, and argue for a more humane approach to the problem of urban poverty. ^ This study concentrates on Riis 2 ̆ 7 s career from the late 18802 ̆ 7 s to the early 18902 ̆ 7 s. During that period, he presented his photographs as lantern slides in a series of public lectures. These lectures subsequently became the content of a book in 1890, entitled How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York. ^ As an artist, intellectual, and leader of avant-garde movements in art, Alfred Stieglitz responded to a less tangible problem and sought to teach a more elusive principle [...] an appreciation of contemporary art. Aware of the <b>psychological</b> and perceptual <b>reorientation</b> which {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century signaled, Stieglitz worked outside of the mainstream of popular culture and established his own alternative network for monitoring cultural changes, contributing to them, and conveying their meaning to an often less than appreciative public. ^ Although Stieglitz worked on many fronts, this study concentrates on the years between 1890 - 1917 during which he founded the radical photographic group, the Photo-Secession, published the innovative quarterly Camera Work, and directed the controversial art gallery 2 ̆ 22912 ̆ 2 which became increasingly devoted to displaying the work of the European and American avant-garde. ^ The thesis of this study is that through their public activities and the nature of their photographic images, Riis and Steiglitz exerted a significant intellectual and ethical influence on their contemporaries and essentially functioned as teachers within the context of nonformal education. The work of both men is analyzed according to their primary messages, their strategies for conveying them, and the implications of their work. In addition to accounts of their projects, the study also traces the educational implications of the photographic images in America during the years leading up to the contributions of Riis and Stieglitz. ^ The study concludes that Riis and Stieglitz exemplify not only two divergent attitudes toward photography but that they also reflect complementary attitudes toward knowledge and teaching. Riis insisted that his contemporaries become more politically engaged, assume responsibility for improving social conditions, and collaboratively work on solving problems in society. Whereas Riis insisted on a sustained and vigorous look outward, into social conditions, Stieglitz invited individuals to reflect more on the process of self-education, the development of individual judgment, insight, and means of self-expression. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1950 s an {{increasingly}} significant strand {{of stress and}} trauma research has been research into separation and divorce. Approaches to separation by researchers in different fields, including sociology (e. g. Orbuch 1992), psychology (eg. White, 1991) and linguistics (e. g. Potter and Wetherall, 1987), all show the evolution of post-modern philosophical trends. The overlap between these fields has increased as the social constructionist theory of language has gained prevalence. In social constructionist theory, our thought {{and the organization of}} our society are products of the language with which we think and organize ourselves. The concepts and values and beliefs of society are implicit in the language available to the individual to interpret his/her own experiences. Research into people's responses to, and interpretations of, their experiences of change has focused increasingly on the language that people actually use in natural communicative contexts, and the accounts that they develop to account for what has happened. This research explores the language used by a group of separated women to account for their separations. The theoretical orientation of the research is social constructionist. The main analytic concept that guides the research is the notion of interpretive repertoires. These are the words and images used by a group of speakers within a society, in relation to specific issues, that invoke the global patterns of understanding of the world that inform the speaker's interpretation of those issues. The research has four main aims. It sets out to identify the characteristics of women's experience of transition, which is their <b>psychological</b> <b>reorientation</b> in response to change. It explores the mechanics and strategies by which women adjust to their separations and the adjustment differences between "dumpers" and "dumpees" and between "newly separated" and "formerly married women". It investigates the ways in which women validate themselves and their stories both by presenting witnesses and the evidence of spokespersons for our society, and by invoking selected discourses of our society. The research shows internal consistency between women's perceptions of a woman's nature and their interpretations of women's roles, and it shows the conflict between the perceived nature and roles of a woman and the discourse of self-actualization...|$|E
