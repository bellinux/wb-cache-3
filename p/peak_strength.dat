40|$|AbstractIt {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the mechanical parameters for unfilled and rough rock joints, such as the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength,</b> can vary with scale. However, due to contradictory results concerning the extent {{and nature of the}} scale effect reported in the literature, it is still a debated subject. A conceptual model developed by Johansson and Stille 2014 suggests how roughness and matedness at different scales influences the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> for fresh, rough and unweathered joint. However, the model's ability to predict how the roughness and matedness affects the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> at different scales was not verified. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the ability of the conceptual model to estimate the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> at different degrees of matedness and scales. A series of direct shear test were carried out at two different scales and two different degrees of matedness. The <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> from the tests was compared to the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> calculated with the conceptual model. The results showed that the model can predict the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> for both the perfectly mated and the unmated joints. No scale effect was observed in the shear tests, which is in line with the predictions using the model. The influence of matedness in combination with scale might explain some of the contradictory findings regarding the scale effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} knock-on atom induced {{damage on the}} <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC) is {{examined}} using an ab initio simulation framework based on Car Parrinello Molecular Dynamics method. The framework examines the effect of impact damage caused by a knock-on atom with velocities corresponding to four different kinetic energy levels (50 eV, 500 eV, 1 keV, and 2 keV) in three different SiC structure samples with different grain boundary (GB) configurations. Analyses show that <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of the examined structures decreases by up to 37 % in samples with GBs due to the impact damage caused by knock-on atom {{when compared with the}} case of single crystalline SiC under similar conditions. Analyses reveal new insights regarding the influence of bond strength change under knock-on atom induced impact damage on <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of the examined structures. It is found that the <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> of the examined structures is a function of change in temperature, impact energy, and GB configuration. In order to extend the observed correlation of the <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> with atomic configurations to other structure types, a fractal dimension-based approach is adopted to predict structure <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> as a function of knock-on atom impact energy, temperature, and GB configuration. Analyses show that the tensile strength of the examined SiC structures increases as a function of their fractal dimension increase. Fractal dimensions also change as a function of change in impact energy level and the corresponding damage in an inversely proportional manner. Based on the observed correlations, an empirical relation to predict structure <b>peak</b> tensile <b>strength</b> as a function of simulation parameters is developed. The developed relation is found to predict strength data of structures not included in the fitting with good accuracy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A field {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} evaluate the influence of disturbance on the measured undrained strength of a varved clay deposit using the Field Vane Test at the National Geotechnical Experi-mentation Site at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Four different field vanes of the same height and diameter but having different blade thickness were used to conduct FVT profiles over a depth of 3. 6 m to 20. 1 m. The geometry of the vanes used produced perimeter ratios ranging from 3. 1 % to 12. 4 %. The {{results show that the}} measured <b>peak</b> <b>strengths</b> are inversely proportional to the perimeter ratio of the vane. Extrapolation of the data to a vane of “zero ” thickness may give a better indication of the in situ undisturbed strength for the use in design.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Specifications for {{laboratory}} {{shear strength}} testing of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) must replicate field conditions while still accounting for time and cost considerations. A database of 414 GCL in-ternal and 534 GCL-geomembrane (GM) interface shear strength results has been assembled. Specifically, {{the results of}} large-scale direct shear tests conducted by a single independent laboratory are evaluated to de-velop guidelines on specimen conditioning. It was found that both the GCL internal and interface <b>peak</b> shear <b>strengths</b> decreased with increasing time of hydration (th). However, the GCL internal shear strength did not change for th beyond 48 hs and the GCL-GM interface shear strength did not change for th beyond 24 hs. The normal stress used during hydration affected significantly the <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> due to bentonite swelling. Hydration under low normal stress followed by consolidation led to similar GCL internal <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> as hydration under high normal stress. However, due to bentonite extrusion, hydration under high normal stress led to consistently lower GCL-GM interface <b>peak</b> shear <b>strength</b> than hydration under low normal stress followed by consolidation.

The effect of hand preference on handgrip strength {{and the relationship of}} anthropometrical characteristics with handgrip strength in wrestlers and controls were also evaluated. Participants were assigned into age groups: children, young adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. Body height and mass, hand dimensions (length, span, and width), and absolute handgrip (in kilograms) were measured. Handgrip strength was similar in wrestlers and controls in the younger age groups (i. e., in children and young adolescents), whereas late adolescent and adult wrestlers exhibited significantly greater <b>peak</b> handgrip <b>strength</b> (p < 0. 05) than their control peers. Nonathletes older than 15 years demonstrated an approximately 10 % greater <b>peak</b> handgrip <b>strength</b> (p < 0. 05) with their preferred hand compared with the nonpreferred hand. In contrast, late adolescent and adult wrestlers exhibited similar handgrip strength with both hands. <b>Peak</b> handgrip <b>strength</b> exhibited a significant linear correlation with all the anthropometric measures examined; however, a higher percentage in the variation in <b>peak</b> handgrip <b>strength</b> was explained by body height and hand length than the other anthropometric variables in both groups. In conclusion, wrestlers exhibit a sport-specific pattern of handgrip strength changes during the developmental years. Body height and hand length exhibited the strongest correlations with handgrip strength during the developmental years in wrestlers and in controls.

To {{improve the}} structural and thermal performance of composite sandwich panels, combinations of UHPC and expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads were investigated. High-performance expanded polystyrene concrete (HPEPC) was tested with various EPS bulk ratios to determine the suitability of the mechanical properties for use as a high-strength lightweight aggregate concrete. As a core material in composite sandwich panels, the mechanical properties of HPEPC were compared with those of EPS mortar. The compressive strength of HPEPC is approximately eight times greater than that of EPS mortar, and the thermal conductivity of approximately a quarter that of EPS mortar. The structural behavior of composite sandwich panels was empirically analyzed using different combinations of cores, face sheets, and adhesive materials.
