25|$|Roberts {{syndrome}} {{is also known}} by many other names, including: Hypomelia-Hypotrichosis-Facial Hemangioma Syndrome, SC Syndrome (once thought to be an entirely separate disease), Pseudothalidomide Syndrome, Roberts-SC <b>Phocomelia</b> Syndrome, SC <b>Phocomelia</b> Syndrome, Appelt-Gerken-Lenz Syndrome, RBS, SC Pseudothalidomide Syndrome, and Tetraphocomelia-Cleft Palate Syndrome. It is a genetic disorder caused by the mutation of the ESCO2 gene on 8th chromosome. Named after the famous Philadelphia Surgeon and Physician, Dr. John Bingham Roberts (18521924), who first described the syndrome in 1919, {{it is one of}} the rarest autosomal recessive disorders, affecting approximately 150 known individuals.|$|E
30|$|Serious {{birth defects}} of the limbs {{were the most}} {{striking}} findings [5, 7, 8, 9], which included <b>phocomelias</b> or longitudinal deficiencies of the extremities. Many individuals had major malformations with remarkable limb shortening of the legs and arms, sometimes in combination with absent hand function. Other malformations {{such as those of}} the ears, eyes [10, 11, 12] and spine [13, 14], as well as genital and visceral defects, have also been observed in patients with thalidomide embryopathy (TE) [3, 10, 15]. Autism spectrum disorders [16] have been reported previously and craniofacial and, recently, maxillofacial malformations [17] were reported. Most individuals have malformations in multiple organ systems.|$|R
40|$|The many {{different}} types and variations of deformities of limbs in animals and man are usually described and grouped from the morphological or genetical point of view. A very few biological experiments have been done {{for the purpose of}} elucidating the causes which produce special types of deformities in the embryo. In an earlier paper (Brandt, 1940) the author has shown that supernumerary limbs such as reduplica-tions and some higher degrees of multiplications can be produced experimentally in the frog embryo by special methods. Contrasting with the group of supernumerary limbs is the group showing stunted growth or even absence of the limb as a whole. On the other hand, there may be absence of parts of a single limb such as <b>phocomelias</b> and stunted growth or abnormal position of the digits. The following experiments are the first which have been published concerning the problem of experimental production of various types of atrophied limbs in the amphibian embryo. MATERIAL AND METHODS The methods of production of atrophied or partly deficient limbs in the embryo are different from those which {{can be applied to the}} adult animal. The removal of parts of aprimordium of the limb or of the whole limb bud in the amphibian embryo is followed by its perfect regeneration. The larva which develops later from such an embryo shows no trace of the operation as a rule, but it was found (Brandt, 1924) that after removal of the limb bud in the embryo newt there was no regeneration of the limb in 6 % of the cases. Implantation of foreign bodies, such as small pieces of coal, wax, or glass, into the primordium of the limb bud is followed either by their elimina-tion in the course of a few hours after the operation or by a large hydrops of the affected area and its adjacent parts which usually causes death of the animal. • The work was aided by a Grant of the Medica...|$|R

25|$|Roberts Syndrome {{is named}} after Dr. John Bingham Roberts (18521924) of Philadelphia, who {{reported}} the disease characteristics in 1919. Roberts reported a disease that was characterized by <b>phocomelia,</b> cleft lip, cleft palate, and a protrusion of the intermaxillary region in three siblings of an Italian couple. The Italian couple were first cousins, which made Roberts Syndrome acquisition more likely for their children due to the diseases autosomal recessive nature.|$|E

Kennedy. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award. The award, given annually to an FDA staff member, came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati. Cardiologist Helen B. Taussig learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and in 1967, testified before Congress on this matter after a trip to Germany where she worked with infants with <b>phocomelia</b> (severe limb deformities). As {{a result of her}} efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States and Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Thalidomide {{was first}} marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name Contergan. The German drug company Chemie Grünenthal {{developed}} {{and sold the}} drug. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure [...] "anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension". Afterwards, it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over-the-counter drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with <b>phocomelia</b> (malformation of the limbs). Only 40% of these children survived. Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with <b>phocomelia</b> due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies {{in a way that}} the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness. The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 {{children}} in 46 countries {{were born with}} deformities such as <b>phocomelia</b> {{as a consequence of}} thalidomide use. [...] The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the foetus if taken after 42 days gestation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{numerous}} {{reports of}} malformations in babies {{brought about the}} awareness of {{the side effects of}} the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include <b>phocomelia,</b> dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs. Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. [...] "The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Probably, {{the most}} {{well-known}} teratogenic drug is thalidomide. It was developed {{near the end of}} the 1950s by Chemie Grűnenthal as a sleep inducing aid and antiemetic. Because of its ability to prevent nausea it was prescribed for pregnant women in almost 50 countries worldwide between 1956–1962. Until William McBride published the study leading to its withdrawal from the market at 1961, about 8- 10 000 severely malformed children were born. The most typical disorder induced by thalidomide were reductional deformities of the long bones of the extremities. <b>Phocomelia</b> otherwise a rare deformity, which therefore helped to recognise the teratogenic effect of the new drug. Among other malformations caused by thalidomide were those of ears, eyes, brain, kidney, heart, digestive and respiratory tract. 40% of the prenatally affected children died soon after birth. As thalidomide is used today as a treatment for multiple myeloma and leprosy, several births of affected children were described in spite of the [...] strictly required use of contraception among female patients treated by it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>phocomelia</b> syndrome are undeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones; however, various abnormalities can occur to the limbs and bones.

Legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands. Individuals with <b>phocomelia</b> will often lack thigh bones, and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close [...] "attachment to the body."According to NORD, individuals carrying <b>phocomelia</b> syndrome will generally show {{symptoms of}} growth retardation previous to and after birth.
