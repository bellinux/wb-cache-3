50|$|A later {{variant of}} the trunk engine re-visited the return {{connecting}} rod layout as the vibrating lever or half-trunk engine. This was a <b>paired</b> <b>engine</b> with two short-stroke trunk engines facing outwards. Their connecting rods from the pistons led to upright 'vibrating levers' that could rock back and forth. These levers rotated a short axle shaft with further levers on it that in turn drove another pair of connecting rods and a shared central crankshaft. These complex engines were {{the invention of the}} Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson and were little used outside these two countries.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design was}} overall not successful. First of all, the hulls, made of hydronalium (aluminium alloy), had limited durability, {{especially}} when sailing {{at high speed}} on a rough sea, resulting in cracks. Propulsion was also not optimal, the gas turbine was not fuel efficient limiting range, and there were problems with the gearing of <b>paired</b> <b>engines.</b> The boats were very compact, and were not comfortable for the crews, being cramped, noisy and prone to vibration. Their advantage of very high top speed, was however limited by sea conditions.|$|E
50|$|Early NK-8-4-engined Il-62s {{suffered}} from indifferent performance {{as well as}} engine fatigue/overheating, sometimes leading to false fire alarms whereby the crew {{might be tempted to}} shut down <b>paired</b> <b>engines</b> to prevent contiguous engine and fuselage damage. Flying with only two <b>paired</b> <b>engines</b> on the same side would, however, render the aircraft unbalanced and difficult to control. Subsequent modifications to the Il-62 and the VC10 (which had a similar engine arrangement) largely rectified this problem. There were two fatal Il-62 losses involving engine failure, both occurring with aircraft owned by LOT Polish Airlines, which had also leased a number of Il-62s from Aeroflot and Tarom. The higher fatality accident (183) was a fully laden Il-62M Flight 5055 on 9 May 1987 which experienced a rear fuselage fire that possibly went unnoticed by the crew, hence their decision not to land at one of two nearby airports. Control of the plane was eventually lost on the return flight to Warsaw, most likely due to one of the auxiliary fuel tanks fitted to some LOT Il-62s having ignited. The other was an unmodified (early version) NK-8-4-powered Il-62 Flight 007 which crashed on 14 March 1980 with 87 fatalities after being fitted with an engine that had previously caused vibration problems when used on two other LOT aircraft (the investigation suggested that the turbine disc was damaged before its final installation).|$|E

50|$|In November 1944, {{following}} on {{from further}} {{work on the}} design, a final concept for the Type 167 was published. As it stood in the final concept, the design featured a large 177 ft (54 m) fuselage which was paired with a sizable wing. This wing, which had a 230 ft(70.1 m) wingspan, possessed an enormous internal volume, which was used to house the fuel for the transatlantic flights envisioned for the type. It was powered {{by a total of}} eight Bristol Centaurus 18-cylinder radial engines; these were the most powerful British-built piston engines available at the time, each being capable of generating 2,650 hp of thrust. These engines which were installed in a unique arrangement of setting each engine in pairs in the wing; instead of using a common crankshaft, the <b>paired</b> <b>engines</b> each had their driveshafts angled towards an enormous central gearbox. They drove a series of eight paired contra-rotating propellers, which were set on four forward-facing nacelles.|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, {{a pair of}} {{prototype}} aircraft, {{known as}} the VJ 101 C, were developed; these were powered by the lighter RB145 turbojet engine, which was mounted in swivelling nacelles instead. However, development of the VJ 101 C would not be straightforward; one major complication was the changing requirements of the BMVg, who decided to switch the aircraft's envisioned mission profile from the interceptor role to a more general fighter instead, which imposed a requirement {{for it to be}} capable of longer low altitude flight endurance, amongst other performance attributes. The new proposal had merged the characteristics of earlier Bölkow, Heinkel and Messerschmitt designs into a sleek, streamlined platform. The VJ 101 C bore some similarities in appearance to the American Bell XF-109, both aircraft having a comparable configuration in terms of possessing <b>paired</b> <b>engines</b> fitted within swivelling nacelles which were positioned at their wingtips. In addition to the wingtip engines, two further lift jets were installed within the fuselage, which functioned to supplement the main engines during hovering flight.|$|E

2500|$|Some civil {{propeller}} driven {{aircraft that}} have used {{one or more}} <b>pairs</b> of <b>engines</b> in push-pull configuration have been flying boats, with engines mounted above the wing and clear of spray.

The Moynet 360 Jupiter was an example of a push-pull aircraft of a less common configuration, where a single conventional fuselage has an engine at either end; the Dornier Do 335 fighter used the same arrangement. [...] For light civil aircraft, the aim was to combine the performance of a conventional twin-engined aircraft with the ease of handling of a single-engined one.|$|R
