5000|$|<b>Paludification</b> is {{the most}} common process by which peatlands in the boreal zone are formed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process is}} {{characterized}} by peat initialization on previously drier and vegetated habitats over inorganic soils, with no fully aquatic phase. Thus the <b>paludification</b> process includes a shift from forests, grassland or long exposed bare land to peatland. The initiation of this accumulation of organic matter (i.e. peat), can be controlled by both allogenic (i.e. external to the ecosystem) and autogenic (i.e. internal to the ecosystem) factors. The hydrological balance is critical for the initiation of peat. The hydrological balance can simply {{be defined as the}} difference between the incoming and outgoing amount of water (e.g. precipitation minus evapotranspiration and minus runoff). Usually it is considered that factors such as climate, geomorphology, geology and soils control this balance. However, <b>paludification</b> may also be just a result of the local accumulation of peat (i.e. autogenic factor).|$|E
50|$|With {{increasing}} <b>paludification,</b> {{which is}} thought to have set in during the periods of occupation, the sites were covered and protected by thick layers of peat and survive in excellent condition. Due to increased peat harvesting during the 19th and 20th centuries, the as yet unexcavated portions are now close to the surface and no longer protected by this natural cover.|$|E
5000|$|The climate factor {{has a great}} {{influence}} on the <b>paludification</b> process. The development of a paludified soil requires a positive hydrological balance during the growing season. Therefore, {{there needs to be}} a shift in local hydrological conditions. Such a shift could be caused by an increase in water inputs or a decrease in outputs. Human activity such as tree removal, natural or human induced forest fires, increase in precipitation, and podsolization, etc. are processes which could change those in- and outputs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNumerical {{studies of}} the {{relationships}} between littoral processes and environmental variables are important because they provide understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on lake systems. In this study, littoral <b>paludification,</b> its occurrence, types and main environmental determinants were studied in boreal lakes with varying size (41 – 560 km 2) and total phosphorus content (4. 5 – 35. 5 μgL− 1) in Finland. The relative importance of catchment characteristics, water quality and water level regulation on <b>paludification</b> was analysed at the lake level (n= 20), whereas the importance of site morphology, soil quality and aquatic vegetation was analysed at the site level (n= 289). This study utilised two novel statistical methods in numerical analyses: generalised linear mixed models and variation partitioning (VP). Bottom ward overgrowth was the main <b>paludification</b> type in the studied lakes. At the lake level, the magnitude of spring flooding and the altitude of the lake had a negative response to <b>paludification,</b> whereas the existence of water level regulation, cover of clay soil and total phosphorus content correlated positively to <b>paludification.</b> At the site level, the <b>paludification</b> was negatively related to slope angle, and positively to the occurrence of clay soil, Glyceria maxima (reed sweet-grass) and the abundance of eutrophy indicator species. However, a considerable amount of variation in littoral <b>paludification</b> both at lake and site levels was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of predictors...|$|E
30|$|In {{boreal forest}} ecosystems, {{successional}} <b>paludification</b> {{is described as}} a dynamic process driven by forest succession between fire events that leads to peat accumulation, and a concomitant thickening of the soil organic layer (SOL), and the formation of waterlogged conditions on a formerly dry mineral soil (Simard et al. 2007). <b>Paludification</b> is influenced by climatic factors and permanent site features, such as surficial deposits and soil texture, as well as by natural fire regimes (Lecomte et al. 2006; Simard et al. 2009; Payette et al. 2013). In boreal regions, in the extended absence of fire, <b>paludification</b> leads to the formation of paludified forests and can reduce forest productivity by up to 50 %– 80 % (Simard et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|Background Successional <b>paludification,</b> {{a dynamic}} process {{that leads to}} the {{formation}} of peatlands, is influenced by climatic factors and site features such as surficial deposits and soil texture. In boreal regions, projected climate change and corresponding modifications in natural fire regimes are expected to influence the <b>paludification</b> process and forest development. The objective {{of this study was to}} forecast the development of boreal paludified forests in northeastern North America in relation to climate change and modifications in the natural fire regime for the period 2011 – 2100. Methods A <b>paludification</b> index was built using static (e. g. surficial deposits and soil texture) and dynamic (e. g. moisture regime and soil organic layer thickness) stand scale factors available from forest maps. The index considered the effects of three temperature increase scenarios (i. e. + 1 °C, + 3 °C and + 6 °C) and progressively decreasing fire cycle (from 300 years for 2011 – 2041, to 200 years for 2071 – 2100) on peat accumulation rate and soil organic layer (SOL) thickness at the stand level, and <b>paludification</b> at the landscape level. Results Our index show that in the context where in the absence of fire the landscape continues to paludify, the negative effect of climate change on peat accumulation resulted in little modification to SOL thickness at the stand level, and no change in the <b>paludification</b> level of the study area between 2011 and 2100. However, including decreasing fire cycle to the index resulted in declines in paludified area. Overall, the index predicts a slight to moderate decrease in the area covered by paludified forests in 2100, with slower rates of <b>paludification.</b> Conclusions Slower <b>paludification</b> rates imply greater forest productivity and a greater potential for forest harvest, but also a gradual loss of open paludified stands, which could impact the carbon balance in paludified landscapes. Nonetheless, as the thick Sphagnum layer typical of paludified forests may protect soil organic layer from drought and deep burns, a significant proportion of the territory has high potential to remain a carbon sink...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} mass {{extinction}} events has largely focused on defining an environmental factor or factors that {{might account for}} specific patterns of faunal demise. Several hypotheses elaborate on how a given environmental factor might affect fauna directly, but differentially, causing extinction in certain taxa but not others.

The role of large-scale habitat change induced by natural successional change from forest to bog (<b>paludification)</b> is examined and how large perturbations (e. g., volcanism, bolide impacts) might favor increased rates of <b>paludification</b> and consequent mass extinctions is considered.

30|$|In this context, {{the main}} {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use information commonly available on forest maps in Canada in order to evaluate the potential for <b>paludification</b> of boreal forest stands in relation to climate change and modifications to the natural fire regime. To achieve this objective we developed a dynamic <b>paludification</b> index. First, we developed a base index projecting the development of paludified forests over time without considering climate change. Then, we added the effects of climate change on the thickening on SOL to this base index in order to forecast the development of paludified forests in response to projected climate change. Finally, forecasted climate change and modifications to the natural fire regime were added to the base index to further explore the development of paludified forests in the context of climate change. Based on information commonly available on forest maps, the <b>paludification</b> index can therefore estimate the effects of both climate change and natural fire regimes on the development of paludified forests at both the local and regional scales.|$|E
30|$|Throughout the boreal region, paludified forests support {{important}} forest industries. It {{is expected}} that any modifications to the climate and natural fire regimes will, in all likelihood, require industries to adapt to new ecosystem conditions and, presumably, to modify their practices. Depending {{on the type of}} harvest practices, forest harvest in paludified forests can both promote or reduce <b>paludification</b> (Lafleur et al. 2010 a, 2010 b), and, as is the case for fire, have important effects on the C budget at the landscape level. This context provides strong incentives for the development of simple tools {{that can be used to}} rapidly and easily forecast the combined effects of climate change and modified fire regime on <b>paludification</b> and forest development.|$|E
30|$|Forests in the {{northern}} Clay Belt are commercially managed for timber and sustain a regionally important forest industry. Historically, forest stands have been harvested by clearcutting, as it {{was thought to be}} compatible with the ecological requirements of the most widespread species, i.e. black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP) (Keenan and Kimmins 1993; McRae et al. 2001). However, concerns raised about the protection of soils and tree regeneration during forest operations sparked important changes in harvest methods, and careful logging (which objectives are to protect tree regeneration and soils, and which, therefore, is conducted during winter when the soil is frozen) gradually replaced clearcutting in the 1990 s. Over the years it appeared that where organic layer is >[*] 30  cm thick, careful logging was suspected to favor <b>paludification</b> and to reduce black spruce forest productivity (Fenton et al. 2005; Lavoie et al. 2005 b). Reports of declining productivity following careful logging initiated an important research program focusing on the effects of silvicultural treatments on stand productivity for sites prone to <b>paludification</b> with the aim of identifying silvicultural treatments most likely to control <b>paludification</b> and maintain forest productivity (Bergeron et al. 2007; Fenton et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|International audienceBlack spruce {{forests that}} {{are located in}} the Clay Belt, within the boreal region of eastern North America, are prone to <b>paludification.</b> <b>Paludification</b> is a natural process where organic layer accumulates on the forest floor, leading to {{substantial}} decreases in forest productivity. This study assessed the ability of using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to remotely sense the organic layer - mineral soil (OL-MS) interface (representing organic layer thickness (OLT)), which has a major influence on the occurrence of <b>paludification</b> in this region. The two chosen sites for this study represented different types of soil and organic layer thicknesses that are linked to different degrees of paludification: low to moderately paludified (site A) and highly paludified (site B). At each site, GPR measurements were collected along three 40 m parallel transects at 20 cm intervals with 200 MHz antenna. GPR interpretations were compared with field manual probing measurements. Detection of this continuous interface was successful at site A (r = 0. 93, P < 0. 001), but mesic and humic horizon clay content limited radar depth penetration, rendering the OL-MS undetectable at site B. However, we found that GPR data, coupled with ground truth information, were effective in mapping the thickness of the organic fibric horizon (r = 0. 79, P < 0. 001) at site B, which could be considered as an indicator of the OLT in highly paludified areas. Overall, GPR appeared effective for mapping the OL-MS interface in the low to moderately paludified site, which is attractive for implementing forest management strategies that will help to stop the advance of <b>paludification...</b>|$|E
30|$|Examining the {{diversity}} dynamics in more detail, after high-severity soil burns, young dense stands are relatively poor {{in terms of}} bryophytes, spiders and orbatid mites. However, the structurally diverse second-cohort stands that are at an intermediate level of <b>paludification</b> are particularly rich in bryophtes, spiders, orbatid mites, and birds (Fenton and Bergeron 2008; Paradis and Work 2011; Doblas-Miranda and Work 2015). This is partially due {{to the presence of}} microhabitats, particularly deadwood and canopy gaps (Fenton and Bergeron 2008; Paradis and Work 2011; Doblas-Miranda and Work 2015; Cadieux and Drapeau 2017). Ultimately, diversity declines in all of these groups as <b>paludification</b> continues and stands open up completely and deadwood is buried in the organic layer, reducing its availability (Moroni et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{economic}} development of Western Siberia {{and changes in the}} taiga as a result of industrial activity make it important to study the process of <b>paludification</b> and degradation of forests. <b>Paludification</b> and the development of peatlands is responsible for the formation of permafrost and forest degradation. The process starts in low-lying areas. Heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground changes with the growth of the moss and peat layer and seasonal freezing begins to exceed summer thawing. Gradually the moss hummocks invade the forest and destroy it. The result is a deterioration in the growth conditions of trees; the soil temperature drops, the soil pores are filled with water, reducing aeration; no new trees appear and finally the trees begin to rot. Theoretical calculations show that the southern march of the permafrost zone will continue for another 400 - 450 miles. To reduce <b>paludification</b> soil and vegetation cover control is beneficial. Removal of the moss increases soil temperatures by 10 - 15 degrees C in the summer. Liming will destroy moss by neutralizing the soil acids and intensifying bacterial action. Burning the moss also creates favourable conditions. Snow accumulation decreases frost penetration and blackening the snow also rapidifies spring melting by 2 - 3 weeks. SOMMAIRE FRANCAIS A SUIVREPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|<b>Paludification,</b> the {{accumulation}} of poorly decomposed organic matter principally originating from Sphagnum, transforms black spruce forests to forested peatlands in the prolonged absence of fire. High-severity wildfires reverse this process by burning the organic matter layer and thus restart forest succession; in contrast low severity wildfires remove only the tree layer and do not reduce <b>paludification.</b> On the Ontario Clay Belt, a physiogeographic region prone to <b>paludification</b> due to its cold climate and poor drainage, current forest harvest practices (Careful Logging Around Advanced Growth; CLAAG) mimic low severity fires by removing trees but lacking forest floor and soil disturbances caused by fire. Historically, prescribed burning after clear cut (PB) {{was used as a}} site preparation technique, and may also be used for controlling <b>paludification</b> as it burns part of the organic soil layer and enhances soil fertility by releasing nutrients. Our retrospective study examines three hypotheses; compared to CLAAG and clear cut, 1) PB has positive effects on soil conditions, 2) controls sphagnum colonisation and 3) results in better growth of black spruce. We sampled 24 sites, using ecological forest classification and harvest records to ensure site equivalency. Results show a significant positive effect of PB on soil decomposition, nutrient contents and pH values. PB reduces Sphagnum establishment and growth. PB significantly increases black spruce growth (terminal shoots), however no difference in mean tree height is observed among treatments. We put forth that these contradictory results could be explained by a time lag in natural regeneration after PB as suggested by forest vertical structure. While not a high severity fire, prescribed burning after clear cut in paludified stands on the Ontario Clay Belt emulates some of its effects. Therefore we conclude that unlike CLAAG, prescribed burning after clear cut facilitates the development of unpaludified stands in a managed landscape...|$|E
30|$|The base <b>paludification</b> index {{produced}} {{slow but}} noticeable increases in {{proportion of the}} study area classified as paludified or nearly paludified. In the absence of fire in 2100 nearly 70 % of the area of the Gordon Cosens Forest could be classified as nearly paludified (26 %) or paludified (42 %). This change is attributable to increased SOL thickness and concomitant change in moisture regime. Stands most susceptible to <b>paludification</b> were generally located on lacustrine surficial deposits or clay till, had fine textured soil (clay to coarse loam), a moisture regime classified as Moist to Very moist, SOL median depth of 20  cm, and an overstorey comprised of black spruce (sometimes accompanied by trembling aspen) (data not shown). Over the projected time frame considered with this base index, most of the stands {{of the study area}} were classified as nearly paludified or paludified.|$|E
30|$|All {{the studies}} {{outlined}} above clearly highlight {{the importance of}} soil burn severity, soil organic layer thickness, and <b>paludification</b> on forest productivity and understory biodiversity in the northern Clay Belt. They also {{emphasize the importance of}} understanding how natural disturbances and successional dynamics shape forest stands and landscapes to successfully and sustainably manage paludified boreal forest ecosystems.|$|E
30|$|Overall, our models {{predict a}} slight (no {{modification}} {{to the current}} fire cycle) to moderate (decreasing fire cycle over time) decrease in area covered by paludified forests within the Gordon Cosens Forest in 2100. This might have several impacts for the forest industries of the Clay Belt as slower <b>paludification</b> rates imply greater forest productivity and potentially a greater potential for forest harvest.|$|E
40|$|As peatlands form {{they create}} a {{temporal}} archive of community development, allow-ing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments {{and the development of}} detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) <b>paludification,</b> the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mech-anism of formation. 2 This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of <b>paludification</b> and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factor...|$|E

30|$|In consequence, the {{introduction}} of the effects of temperature increase in the <b>paludification</b> index did not produce any modifications in the proportion of the study area whether classified as paludified, nearly paludified or not paludified compared to the base index. Hence, despite increasing temperature between 2011 and 2100, the level of <b>paludification</b> of the study area did not change over time. Although our model did not consider the effects of changes in precipitation on <b>paludification,</b> a recent modeling study suggested that in the boreal forest of eastern Canada precipitation could increase by 10 %– 20 % {{by the end of the}} 21 st century (McKenney et al. 2010). An increase in precipitation would logically lead to an increase in peat accumulation rate via the influence of higher water tables and a subsequent decrease in peat decomposition rate (Silvola et al. 1996; Ise et al. 2008). However, increased temperature is expected to lead to an increase in evapotranspiration, therefore leaving less moisture in the system (Soja et al. 2007; Wu 2012) and increasing risks of drought. A decrease in moisture availability in the system would, in turn, induce a lowering of the water table, a thickening of the oxic layer, and an increase in substrate temperature. Together these modifications would depress the peat accumulation rate, but more importantly, increase the peat decomposition rate, resulting in a steady SOL thickness over time. Therefore as two factors are acting in opposite directions (i.e. peat accumulation with time vs. increase in peat decomposition rate in response to climate change), the expected effects of climate change (not considering modifications to the current fire cycle) in our study area could result in a territory similar to the present in terms of paludified area.|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{vegetation}} succession and permafrost {{dynamics in}} subarctic peat plateaus of west-central Canada {{have been studied}} through detailed plant macrofossil analysis and extensive AMS radiocarbon dating of two peat profiles. Peatland inception at these sites occurred around 5800 - 5100 yr BP (6600 - 5900 cal. BP) {{as a result of}} <b>paludification</b> of upland forests. At the northern peat plateau site, located in the continuous permafrost zone, palaeobotanical evidence suggests that permafrost was already present under the forested upland prior to peatland development. <b>Paludification</b> was initiated by permafrost collapse, but re-aggradation of permafrost occurred soon after peatland inception. At the southern site, located in the discontinuous permafrost zone, the aggradation of permafrost occurred soon after peatland inception. In the peat plateaus, permafrost conditions have remained very stable until present. Sphagnum fuscum-dominated stages have alternated with more xerophytic communities characterized by ericaceous shrubs. Local peat fires have occurred, but most of these did not cause degradation of the permafrost. Starting from 2800 - 1100 yr BP (2900 - 1000 cal. BP) consistently dry surface conditions have prevailed, possibly related to continued frost heave or nearby polygon crack formation...|$|E
30|$|Thus, at the {{landscape}} level, when fire cycle is kept constant {{at the current}} level, the slow rate of <b>paludification</b> results in a slight decrease in paludified area regardless of the proportion of high severity fires, suggesting either {{that the rate of}} peat accumulation in the index is too conservative, or that the current highly paludified landscape is not completely in balance with the current climate and fire regime (Payette 2001). Similarly, a decreasing fire cycle is likely to limit the development of paludified stands.|$|E
30|$|Finally, in {{the index}} {{considering}} both climate change and natural fire regime, we first projected forest <b>paludification</b> considering the current fire cycle of 400  years as determined by Bergeron et al. (2004). Then we projected forest <b>paludification</b> allowing the fire cycle to decrease according to projections made by Bergeron et al. (2010). In this sub-index, the fire cycle decreased to 300  years for 2011 – 2041, to 250  years for 2041 – 2071, and to 200  years for 2071 – 2100. Furthermore, based on our own observations, we considered that currently 50 % of fire ignitions resulted in high-severity fires, i.e. fires that left[*]<[*] 5  cm of residual SOL over the mineral soil (Simard et al. 2007). In light of greater uncertainty surrounding {{the impact of the}} climate change on fire severity, we ran our projections considering three proportions of high-severity fires, i.e. 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. Furthermore, we considered that stands with SOL[*]>[*] 120  cm could not be submitted to high-severity fires because {{it is highly unlikely that}} a fire would leave[*]<[*] 5  cm of residual SOL over the mineral soil in such stands. At each time step, fire events and severity were randomly attributed to the forest stands of the study area.|$|E

In this paper, a case study on the ecological security indexes of modern oasis landscapes in Beitun Oasis, Xinjiang, was carried out. The spatial neighbouring parameters, such as the contiguous length, measure of area and patch quantity of oasis landscape patches, affected by desert landscape patches were calculated by using GIS-based buffer analysis, the method of calculating ecological security indexes of oasis landscape was developed, and the dynamic changes of patterns and ecological security indexes of the oasis landscapes since recent 30 years were analyzed. The results showed that soil salinization or alkalization and <b>paludification</b> were major factors affecting the ecological security in Beitun Oasis. Therefore, measures should be taken actively to prevent and control secondary salinization and <b>paludification.</b> The ecological security indexes of the oasis landscape in 1972, 1990 and 2005 were 78. 91, 82. 28 and 83. 86, respectively, which showed the degree of security is improving, and the environment was developing harmoniously between human and nature.

30|$|These {{findings}} {{support the idea that}} site properties, especially soil organic layer thickness and ericaceous shrub abundance, should be taken into account in the development of forest management strategies in paludified forest landscapes. They also support the idea that in areas where management strategies are mainly aimed at regenerating paludified forests, severe soil disturbance (either mechanical or by fire) can be used to reduce SOL thickness and ericaceous shrub cover. In this context, logging methods that disturb the surficial layers, such as traditional clearcutting, ideally followed by prescribed burning, are to be preferred to careful logging practices on sites prone to <b>paludification</b> such as those found in the Northern Clay Belt.|$|E
40|$|Boreal {{black spruce}} (Picea mariana) forests {{are prone to}} {{developing}} thick organic layers (<b>paludification).</b> Black spruce is adapted to this environment by the continuous development of adventitious roots, masking the root collar and {{making it difficult to}} age trees. Ring counts above the root collar underestimate age of trees, but the magnitude of age underestimation of trees in relation to organic layer thickness (OLT) is unknown. This age underestimation is required to produce appropriate age-correction tools to be used in land resource management. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess aging errors that are done with standard ring counts of trees growing in sites with different degrees of <b>paludification</b> (OLT; 0 – 25 cm, 26 – 65 cm, > 65 cm). Age of 81 trees sampled at three geographical locations was determined by ring counts at ground level and at 1 m height, and real age of trees was determined by cross-dating growth rings down to the root collar (root/shoot interface). Ring counts at 1 m height underestimated age of trees by a mean of 22 years (range 13 – 49) and 52 years (range 14 – 112) in null to low vs. moderately to highly paludified stands, respectively. The percentage of aging-error explained by our linear model was relatively high (R 2 adj = 0. 71) and showed that OLT class and age at 0 -m could be used to predict total aging-error while neither DBH nor geographic location could. The resulting model has important implications for forest management to accurately estimate productivity of these forests...|$|E
30|$|In {{areas with}} active fire dynamics, {{conservation}} of old forest {{can be achieved}} in areas large enough compared to the average size of fires, so that certain forest areas can escape fires.

By 9800 BP (705 cm), the site had emerged from the postglacial Daly Sea and a herb-shrub tundra was established. Tundra persisted until 7800 BP when spruce and fir invaded to form boreal forest. Fire at 7300 BP resulted in a brief resurgence of herbs and shrubs, primarily alder, followed by forest re-establishment by 6800 BP. <b>Paludification</b> led {{to an increase in}} Sphagnum and greatly decreased pollen influx after 3000 BP, followed by an increase in shrubs and herbs at the expense of trees after 1000 BP. Today the Grey Islands are dominated by tuckamore (dwarf shrub barrens) with patchy areas of black spruce forest and sphagnum bog.

A major forest fire in the record falls within the 8000 to 6500 BP period of increased fire frequency on the Northern Peninsula.
