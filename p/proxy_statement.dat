25|$|Transaction documents—legal drafting—fall on {{a similar}} continuum. A 150-page merger {{agreement}} between two large corporations, in which both sides are represented by counsel, will be highly formal—and should also be accurate, precise, and airtight (features not always compatible with high formality). A commercial lease for a small company using a small office space will likely be much shorter and will require less complexity, but may still be somewhat formal. But a <b>proxy</b> <b>statement</b> allowing {{the members of a}} neighborhood association to designate their voting preferences for the next board meeting ought to be as plain as can be. If informality aids that goal, it is justified.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to {{give the appearance of}} reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations. The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?" [...] and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common shares outstanding). Enron's <b>proxy</b> <b>statement</b> stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised. Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors’ beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.|$|E
2500|$|One {{provision}} {{on which}} the White House did not take a position and remained in the final bill allows the SEC to rule on [...] "proxy access" [...] – meaning that qualifying shareholders, including groups, can modify the corporate <b>proxy</b> <b>statement</b> sent to shareholders to include their own director nominees, with the rules set by the SEC. This rule was unsuccessfully challenged in conference committee by Chris Dodd, who – {{under pressure from the}} White House – submitted an amendment limiting that access and ability to nominate directors only to single shareholders who have over 5% of the company and have held the stock for at least two years.|$|E

30|$|For the {{corporate}} governance data, we compiled the institutional ownership {{data from the}} Thomson Reuters Institutional (13 F) Holdings (formerly known as CDA/Spectrum database). All other corporate governance variables were first obtained from the RiskMetrics Directors database (formerly known as Investor Responsibility Research Center Takeover Defense database). However, this database does not contain all the governance variables in this study (e.g., data on committee meetings are not available). Also, RiskMetrics only covers S&P 1500 companies beginning in 1996. To complete our corporate governance dataset, we manually collected the remaining data by analysing the <b>proxy</b> <b>statements</b> included in the Direct Edger database. As Direct Edger only incorporates <b>proxy</b> <b>statements</b> commencing from 1992, this effectively limits our governance sample and the related statistical analyses to the period from 1992 to 1997.|$|R

5000|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over [...] "proxy access" [...] which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the <b>proxy</b> <b>statement.</b> Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the <b>proxy</b> <b>statement.</b> The United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement,; however, the rule was struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Also {{around that}} time (1992), the SEC responded to {{complaints}} of excessive executive compensation by tightening the rules of disclosure to increase shareholder awareness of its cost. The SEC began requiring the listing of compensation in <b>proxy</b> <b>statements</b> in standardized tables in hopes of making more difficult the disguising of pay that didn't incentivize managers, or was unreasonably high.|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{ownership}} structure generally extract the insider holdings for officers and directors from <b>proxy</b> <b>statements,</b> which has three disadvantages: (1) the data must be manually extracted, assembled, and {{entered into the}} experimental dataset; (2) dates for the insider holdings are limited to the dates given in the proxy statements; and (3) the insider holdings include only officers and directors. This paper describes a way to construct the holdings for all insiders, not just officers and directors, at any arbitrary time, for any firm reporting to the Securities Exchange Commision (SEC), by using the data files from the SEC’s computerized Ownership Reporting System (ORS). A test of this ORS-based measure against a sample of <b>proxy</b> <b>statements</b> found that, for 90 percent of the 77 useable <b>proxy</b> <b>statements,</b> the ORS-based measure was within 5 percent of the proxy data. The ORS data are noisy, though, and the resulting values for insider holdings could contain both noise and some degree of bias. Although the ORS-based measure almost certainly is not as reliable as proxy data, it is suitable, and sometimes the only feasible alternative, for some research designs. A {{great deal of time}} was spent in ferreting out certain important information about the documentation and the data. This paper furnishes that information in sufficient technical detail to substantially flatten the learning curve for other researchers who want to use the ORS data, whether to derive insider holdings or to study other aspects of the data...|$|R

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied Northway’s motion for summary judgment.
