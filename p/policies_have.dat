5|$|Innovation <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> been {{excessively}} {{focused on}} the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years. However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation. Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU innovation policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which Kirchner's <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> lowered poverty is controversial, with the government's {{reported}} poverty rate being questioned by some experts. According to a 2017 UNICEF report, the cash transfers reduce extreme poverty by 30.8% and general poverty by 5.6%.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Indigenous Peoples {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition. The determining factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories {{and evidence of}} a continued linguistic and cultural identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial cultural and language <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to continue to seek cultural revival.|$|E
5|$|This {{shift in}} the {{economic}} policies of the BJP was also visible in state governments, especially in Gujarat, where the BJP held power for 16 years. Modi's government, in power from 2002 to 2014, followed a strongly neo-liberal agenda, presented as a drive towards development. Its <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> included extensive privatisation of infrastructure and services, {{as well as a}} significant rollback of labour and environmental regulations. While this was praised by the business community, commentators criticised it as catering to the BJP's upper class constituency instead of the poor.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> been implemented {{by state and}} union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E
40|$|China's non-interference <b>policy</b> <b>has</b> {{come under}} {{scrutiny}} {{in regards to}} its growing and deepening relations in Africa. The <b>policy</b> <b>has</b> come to represent an about-face from conditional assistance and investment associated with the Washington Consensus. Although often well received {{in much of the}} global South, this <b>policy</b> <b>has</b> drawn a lot of criticism from the West and others. These commentators have perceived non-interference as an opportunistic and often inconsistent instrument for enabling China's increasing access to African resources and markets. This article suggests that despite some consistent support for the rhetoric of non-interference, China's implementation of the <b>policy</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly varied and context-ualized in reaction to Africa's ever-more diversified political and economic landscape since the early 2000 s.

40|$|Climate {{policy in}} Belgium and the Netherlands {{exhibits}} all the dilemmas of policy-making {{at the present}} juncture: the <b>policy</b> <b>has</b> to be global, but the political system remains largely national, and therefore operates on a relatively ineffective scale.

The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically.
