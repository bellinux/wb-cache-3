They supported Khánh's move against Dinh, Don, Kim and Xuan, but tried to protect Minh by using tanks to shield Minh's house from Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used to arrest the four other leading junta members. Although Minh was taken away, this was {{claimed to be a}} <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> to shield him from some of Khánh's more hawkish supporters, and he was never formally arrested and taken into detention. Throughout the morning the deposed officers were taken one by one to JGS headquarters by the plotters. The generals were then flown to My Khe beach, near Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} Final Fantasy XV, Tabata {{decided to make}} a high-definition remaster of Type-0 for eighth-generation consoles. Developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, Final Fantasy Type-0 HD was {{originally}} announced at E3 2014, and released worldwide in March 2015. After Type-0s release, Tabata stated {{in an interview that he}} wished to explore the distant history of Orience after the events of the game. Trademarks for Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 were registered shortly after the Type-0 trademark, but it was suggested that they were simply a <b>protective</b> <b>measure.</b> During interviews given in 2014, Tabata commented that he wished to work on Type-1 after completing XV, and later explained the conceptual Type series as a means of publishing Final Fantasy games too experimental for the main series. He hoped to continue with the Type series if Type-0 HD was commercially successful.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Concern {{with the}} costs of blood safety is growing, which raises the {{question}} whether safety measures that reduce risk only marginally should be discontinued. Withdrawing such safety measures would allow reallocating resources to more efficient health care interventions, but it might raise moral objections. Materials and Methods: This study evaluates two ethical arguments why discontinuing blood safety measures would be more objectionable than not implementing them. The first argument is that whereas withdrawing <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> causes harm to patients, not starting <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> 'merely' omits to prevent harm. The second argument is that patients who benefit from <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are historically entitled to the continuation of those <b>protective</b> <b>measures.</b> Results: Both arguments are unconvincing. There is only a weak causal connection between removing blood safety measures and harms that transfusion recipients suffer. Moreover, patients are not entitled to the continuation of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> that prove very inefficient, unless applying these <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> rectifies past injustice towards them. Conclusion: Unless stronger ethical objections can be found, blood system operators and regulators should be more willing to withdraw inefficient safety measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper will}} assess {{terrorist}} threats to bridge infrastructure and the cost-effectiveness of <b>protective</b> and counter-terrorism <b>measures.</b> This analysis will consider threat likelihood, cost of security measures, risk reduction and expected losses {{to compare the}} costs and benefits of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to bridges to decide which <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are cost-effective. In this paper, a break-even cost-benefit analysis determines the minimum probability of a successful attack, absent the <b>protective</b> <b>measures,</b> that is required for the benefit of the <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to equal their cost. It was found that unless terrorist threat probabilities are high, then typical <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are not cost-effective. Bridges and other critical infrastructure are subject to a range of natural and man-made hazards, and terrorism is most likely not as important a threat as natural hazards. Economic risks due to terrorism are then compared with risks from flood and seismic hazards. It was found that economic risks to bridges from floods, earthquakes, and ship impact are significantly higher than threats from terrorism...|$|R
25|$|Having {{received}} the first TCR/CD3 signal, the naïve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> {{to ensure that}} a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.|$|E

Fearing potential harm and Doug's growing obsession with her, Rachel hits Doug with a brick and leaves him for dead.|$|E
25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one <b>protective</b> <b>measure,</b> large amounts of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the thymidine kinase of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus thymidine kinase belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.|$|E
40|$|Background. Mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{constitute an}} important cause of morbidity and mortality. The use of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> (PPM) like mats, bednets, screening, repellents, liquid vaporizers, mosquito coils, {{and so forth}} has been advocated as an effective tool in control of mosquito-borne diseases, but data about the safety profile of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> is still scarce. Objective. To study the usage and side effects of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> against mosquitoes among current users in Delhi. Materials and Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study among 350 adult individuals selected by systematic sampling method. Data was collected using pretested semistructured questionnaire after taking written informed consent. Data was analysed using SPSS version 17. Chi-square/Fisher’s Exact test was used for qualitative variables to find association and P value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. Out of 350 families selected, 210 belonged to rural area and 140 to urban area. Personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> were used by 219 (62. 5 %) subjects. Liquid vaporizer was the most preferred method (41. 4 %). Most common perceived side effect of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> was headache (7. 7 %). Other perceived side effects were cough (3. 2 %), sore throat (2. 7 %), allergy (1. 3 %), and eye irritation (0. 9 %) predominantly among coil users. Conclusion. There {{is a need to}} have a close watch for side effects of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> among users.

500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E
500|$|Russo & Russo {{from the}} Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia {{conducted}} a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing {{the effects of the}} carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> against various forms of benign lesions, such as hyperplastic alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to [...] "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" [...] than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. [...] A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.|$|E

Sasuke ultimately tracks him down and they engage in their final battle, during the course of which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan to push Sasuke to his limits. In doing so, Orochimaru is drawn out from Sasuke's body, and Itachi seals him away with his Totsuka blade before finally succumbing to his [...] mysterious illness. As his final act, Itachi implants his Amaterasu technique within Sasuke, meant as a <b>protective</b> <b>measure</b> that will kill Tobi in case he ever tries to approach Sasuke and reveal the truth of their clan's slaughter. Unfortunately, having knew where Itachi's loyalties truly lie, Tobi survived and reveals the truth of Itachi's actions to Sasuke.
