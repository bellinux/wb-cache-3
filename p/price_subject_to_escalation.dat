To do this, we build on a two-country {{model of a}} monetary union with sticky <b>prices</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> asymmetric productivity shocks. For most plausible values of price stickiness, we show that asymmetric shocks under incomplete financial markets {{give rise to a}} lower volatility of national infation rates, which proves welfare improving with respect to the situation of complete financial markets.

40|$|Conventional signals impose {{costs on}} senders through {{receiver}} retaliation {{rather than through}} investment in signal production. While several visual conventional signals have been described (mainly 'badges of status'), acoustic examples are rare; however, several aspects of repertoire use in songbirds are potential candidates. We performed interactive playback experiments to determine whether song-type matches (responding to a song with the same song type), repertoire matches (responding to a song with a different song type, but one in the repertoires of both singers) and unshared song types serve as conventional signals during male-male territorial interactions in banded wrens, Thryothorus pleurostictus. Our results demonstrate that these three signals incite varying levels of receiver aggression: song-type matches induce faster approach than do repertoire matches, and repertoire matches induce faster approach than do unshared song types. Production costs do not differ, while the receiver response does. Because territorial banded wrens approach opponents who signal aggressively, such opponents risk attack. This system will punish and prevent cheaters, as weak males signalling aggression will be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>escalation</b> by stronger or more-motivated opponents...|$|R

Moreover we show that if the shocks are not large the results are independent of the assumption of whether firms know the realization of the monetary shock on impact.

This result can be interpreted as defining a regulation policy yielding efficient outcomes, which consists of imposing constraints on the availability of some inputs for the non-convex firms, and let them act in the market as (constrained) profit maximizers.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method of reducing this bias by <b>pricing</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> a deterministic functional volatility σ = σ (S,t). This instantaneous volatility is chosen as a spline whose weights are determined by a regularised numerical strategy that approximately minimises the difference between Black-Scholes vanilla prices and known market vanilla prices over a range of strikes and maturities; these Black-Scholes prices are calculated by solving the relevant partial differential equation numerically using finite element methods. The instantaneous volatility generated from vanilla options can be used to price exotic options where the skew and term-structure of volatility are important, and we illustrate the application to barrier options...|$|R
