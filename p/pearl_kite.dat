50|$|The <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> Gampsonyx had {{variously}} {{been placed}} with the accipiters, forest-falcons, or elanine kites. It {{was not until}} the 1960s that a similar molt schedule established its affinity to Elanus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> (Gampsonyx swainsonii) is a {{very small}} raptor found in open savanna habitat {{adjacent}} to deciduous woodland. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Gampsonyx. The scientific name commemorates the English naturalist William Swainson.|$|E
50|$|The {{scaled pigeon}} has been {{recorded}} as successfully nesting on a fern (Pteridium aquilinum at ground level, and in the canopy of the tree fern Cyathea cyatheoides). The <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> visits nests of this species as a natural predator.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 {{the band}} {{decided to put}} {{proceedings}} on hold to pursue new projects. Dave Ody released a solo album through Line Out Records called Geen and in 2008 formed the band Mothboxer with Phil Davies and Jon Hawes - ex Mother Black Cap and Robbie Burley - ex <b>Pearl</b> <b>Kites.</b> The band played a few select gigs in London and the South East in 2008 and 2009 ...|$|R
50|$|Later, the <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> was {{classified}} with the falcons. For example, Peters placed {{it with the}} forest falcons in subfamily Polyhieracinae. In the mid-20th century it {{was found to be}} related to Elanus based on morphology and its molt schedule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> feeds {{mainly on}} lizards, {{especially}} Anolis, but also takes small birds and insects; it usually {{sits on a}} high open perch from which it swoops on its prey. The call is a high musical pip-pip-pip-pip or kitty-kitty-kitty.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> is 20.3 - 23 cm {{in length}} and weighs 80 - 95 g. It is the {{smallest}} raptor in the Americas {{and one of the}} two smallest accipitrids in the world (besides the little sparrowhawk). The tiny hawk, another neotropical species, attains a slightly higher weight than the <b>pearl</b> <b>kite.</b> The adult has a black crown, upperparts, wing and tail, a rufous edged white collar, yellow forehead and cheeks, mainly white underparts, and yellow legs. Immature birds are similar to the adults but have white and chestnut tips to the back and wing feathers, a buff collar and some buff on the white underparts. In flight this species looks mainly black above and white below. The northern form G. s. leonae differs from the nominate G. s. swainsonii in that it has rufous flanks.|$|E
50|$|On {{her first}} {{appearance}} as a three-year-old Bolas contested the Listed Cheshire Oaks (a trial {{race for the}} Epsom Oaks) over one mile {{three and a half}} furlongsat Chester Racecourse on 4 May. She was made the 5/1 third choice behind the May Hill Stakes winner Hawajiss and State Crystal in an eight-runner field. Bolas took the lead before half way and kept on well when challenged in the straight to win by one and three quarter lengths from State Crystal with seven lengths back to Hawajiss in third. The filly had never been entered in the Eprom Oaks but at Royal Ascot in June she was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes. In a nine-runner field she was made the 3/1 favourite ahead of Spot Prize (second in the Musidora Stakes), Munnaya (Lingfield Oaks Trial) and Gothic Dream. Bolas took the lead a after a furlong and was never seriously challenged, winning by five lengths and three quarters of a length from Gothic Dream and <b>Pearl</b> <b>Kite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Accipitridae are {{a diverse}} {{family with a}} great deal of {{variation}} in size and shape. They range in size from the tiny <b>pearl</b> <b>kite</b> (Gampsonyx swainsonii) and little sparrowhawk (Accipiter minullus), both of which are 23 cm (9 in) in length and weigh about 85 g (3 oz), to the cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), which measures up to 120 cm (47 in) and weighs up to 14 kg (31 lbs). Wingspan can vary from 39 cm in the little sparrowhawk to more than 300 cm in the cinereous and Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis). In these extreme species, wing chord length can range from 113 to 890 mm and culmen length from 11 to 88 mm. Until the 14th century, even these huge vultures were surpassed by the extinct Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei) of New Zealand, which is estimated to have measured up to 140 cm (55 in) and to have weighed 15 to 16.5 kg in the largest females. In terms of body mass, the Accipitridae are the most diverse family of birds and may also be in terms of some aspects of linear size diversity, although lag behind the true parrots and pheasant family in length diversity. Most accipitrids exhibit sexual dimorphism in size, although, unusually for birds, it is the females that are larger than the males. This sexual difference in size is most pronounced in active species that hunt birds, such as the Accipiter hawks, in which the size difference averages 25-50%. In a majority of species, such as generalist hunters and rodent-, reptile-, fish-, and insect-hunting specialists, the dimorphism is less, usually between a 5% to 30% size difference. In the carrion-eating Old World vultures and snail eating kites, the difference is almost non-existent.|$|E
