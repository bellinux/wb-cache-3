40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of three-level <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> for wind-driven permanent-magnet synchronous generators with unbalanced loads. To increase voltage stress and reduce current harmonics in the electrical power generated by a wind generator, a three-phase, three-level rectifier is used. Because a synchronous rotating frame is used on the AC-input side, {{the use of a}} neutral-point-clamped controller is proposed to increase the power factor to unity and reduce current harmonics. Furthermore, a novel six-leg inverter is proposed for transferring energy from the DC voltage to a three-phase, four-wire AC source with a constant voltage and a constant frequency. The <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> also <b>contain</b> output transformers and filters for power buffering and filtering, respectively. All three output phase voltages are fed back to control the inverter output during load variations. A digital signal processor is used as the core control device for implementing a 1. 5 kV, 75 kW drive system. Experimental data show that the power factor is successfully increased to unity and the total current harmonic distortion is 3. 2 % on the AC-input side. The entire system can attain an efficiency of 91 %, and the voltage error between the upper and lower capacitors is approximately zero. Experimental results that confirm the high performance of the proposed system are presented...|$|R

The negative terminal {{of the solar}} cell array can be directly connected {{to the ground in}} the proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> to avoid the transparent conducting oxide corrosion that occurs in some types of thin-film solar cell array. The proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a dc–dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and a dc–ac inverter.

30|$|In a MTDC grid, {{the most}} vital component, {{providing}} power exchange {{to and from the}} grid, is the <b>power</b> electronics-based <b>power</b> <b>converter.</b> In comparison to synchronous generators, <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> have a time response that can be several orders of magnitude faster, due to the additional control capabilities and the lack of mechanical inertia.

40|$|Modern {{electronics}} {{continues to}} push past boundaries of integration and functional density toward elusive, completely autonomous, self-powered microsystems. As systems continue to shrink, however, less energy {{is available on}} board, leading to short device lifetimes (run-time or battery life). Extended battery life is particularly advantageous in the systems with limited accessibility, such as biomedical implants and structure-embedded micro-sensors. The power management process usually requires compact and efficient <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> to be embedded in these microsystems. This dissertation introduces switched-capacitor (SC) <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> designs that make all these techniques realizable on silicon. Four different integrated SC <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> with multiple control schemes are designed here to provide low-power high-efficient power sources. First, a monolithic step-down <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with subthreshold z-domain digital pulse-width modulation (DPWM) controller is proposed for ultra-low power microsystems. The subthreshold design significantly reduces the power dissipation in the controller. Second, an efficient monolithic master-slave complementary <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with a feedback controller that purely operates in subthreshold operation region is discussed to tailor for the aforementioned ultra-low power applications. Third, we introduce an efficient monolithic step-down SC power stage with multiple-gain control and on-chip capacitor sizing for self-powered microsystems. The multiple-gain control helps the converter to constantly maintain high efficiency over a large input/output range. The size-adjustable pumping capacitors allow the output voltage to be regulated at different desired levels, with a constant 50 % duty ratio. The monolithic implementations in these three integrated CMOS <b>power</b> <b>converters</b> effectively suppress noise and glitches caused by parasitic components due to bonding, packaging and PCB wiring. Fourth, an efficient step-up and step-down SC <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with multiple-gain closed-loop controller is presented.
