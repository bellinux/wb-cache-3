5000|$|In the 1990s KS&EW {{received}} {{technology from}} France for building the Agosta 90B Khalid class submarine. The technology was mostly related to {{construction of the}} pressure hull and out-fitting of the submarine. Drawings, computer aided design tools and more than 20,000 technical documents from France were transferred. Training programs for 300 engineers and technicians took place in France and another 600 personnel were trained in Pakistan. In 1995, surveys and upgrades to naval dockyard infrastructure were carried out by French personnel which included a section building hall, combined outfitting workshop, <b>pipe-bending</b> workshop, hull fabrication workshop, grit blasting and painting facility, dock lift system and a pickling and etching plant. [...] The third Agosta 90B submarine, PNS Hamza, was constructed with the newly developed MESMA air-independent propulsion unit, while the first two (PNS Khalid and PNS Saad) will be retro-fitted during their next overhauls with a [...] "plug" [...] containing a MESMA AIP unit. The submarine's hull will be cut and the plug inserted. The second MESMA unit was shipped in June 2011.|$|E
