The series premiere, [...] "Bop Gun", drew unusually large viewership numbers due to a guest appearance by Robin Williams, but the subsequent episodes had dropped in the ratings, making the viewership of [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] particularly important {{for the future of}} the series.

2500|$|In May 2005, ABC's news {{magazine}} <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> reported claims by season two American Idol contestant Corey Clark {{that he and}} Abdul had an affair during that season, {{and that she had}} coached him on how to succeed in the competition. The fact that Clark came forward {{at a time when he}} was marketing a CD and trying to get a book deal was seen as suspicious by some, but Clark maintains that his career was being prejudiced because of his relationship with Abdul and that is why he came forward with the information to clear his name. For the most part, Abdul refused to comment on Clark's allegations. Simon Cowell came to Abdul's defense, calling Corey Clark a creep and stating [...] "It was just somebody using her to get a lot of publicity for an appalling record, full stop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1984 {{television}} critic Rick Sherwood {{wrote that}} although the sexual tension between Sam and Diane provided a focus for Cheers other characters, their later romance and [...] "the removal of the love-hate subplot [...] much of {{the edge of the}} series [...] lost". In October 1985, Sherwood's interest in the show lessened because of the romance; Diane's affair with Frasier Crane [...] "made things worse". According to Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times in 1986, Glenn Caron (executive producer of Moonlighting) said: [...] "... I think it's masochistic to take two people who seem destined for each other and ask an audience not to see them get together". In 1989, Michael Hill of The Baltimore Evening Sun found the similarity between the Cheers characters and real-life news anchors Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer of <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> [...] "remarkable".|$|E
2500|$|Corey Clark {{was also}} disqualified {{from the show}} because, {{according}} to the Idol producers, Clark had a police record he had not disclosed to the show. [...] However, in 2005, contestant Corey Clark alleged {{in an interview on}} ABC's <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> and in a book, They Told Me to Tell the Truth, So... The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America's Idols, that he and judge Paula Abdul had an affair while he was on the show and that this contributed to his removal. Clark also alleged that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show and tips on song choice. [...] A subsequent investigation by an independent counsel hired by Fox [...] "could not corroborate the evidence or allegations provided by Mr. Clark or any witnesses". [...] Paula Abdul was therefore considered exonerated but an [...] "enhanced non-fraternization policy" [...] was put in place after the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Idol {{producer}} Nigel Lythgoe, who was unimpressed {{with the}} evidence presented on the <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> special, called it [...] "shoddy journalism". [...] Regarding Clark's possession of Abdul's phone number, Lythgoe said, [...] "And I {{know for a fact}} that a lot of the contestants have got Paula's phone number and contact her and she contacts them. Paula's the den mother. ... I don't have a problem with that. She's been a star and now she can help them and that's more than Simon [...]" [...] Lythgoe also addressed Clark's claim that he sent Abdul a secret message by singing [...] "I owe it all to you" [...] on the show by explaining that the serenade was choreographed by the producers. [...] Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{denies that}} {{the timing of}} his revelation {{was part of a}} {{marketing}} ploy, asserting, [...] "If I wanted publicity, I could have done it two years ago when they were first trying to defame my name." [...] Clark states that Abdul and the producers engaged in a character assassination campaign that he could not afford to combat or ignore, and accused them of spreading falsehoods about him throughout the industry in order to ruin his career. Other former contestants who came to publicly back Clark's claims included second season semi-finalist Nasheka Sidall, who, it was stated on <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live,</b> first heard [...] "whispers" [...] about the affair soon after her time on the show as a contestant, and fellow second season finalist Trenyce, who corroborated Clark's claims on CNN's Showbiz Tonight. Clark also points to the fact in his e-book that his Idol roommates Ricky Smith and Ruben Studdard were never asked for their views on the validity of his claims, but that third season winner Fantasia Barrino was questioned as to her opinion about Clark's allegations, which Clark saw as an attempt by Fox or its investigators to use Barrino's following to bias the public against Clark. As Clark states: ...|$|E
