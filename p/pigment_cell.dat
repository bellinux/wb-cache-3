25|$|Humans {{have only}} one class of <b>pigment</b> <b>cell,</b> the {{mammalian}} equivalent of melanophores, to generate skin, hair, and eye colour. For this reason, and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise, melanophores {{are by far the}} most widely studied chromatophore. However, there are differences between the biology of melanophores and that of melanocytes. In addition to eumelanin, melanocytes can generate a yellow/red pigment called phaeomelanin.|$|E
40|$|Unusual {{light-reflecting}} <b>pigment</b> <b>cells,</b> “white <b>pigment</b> cells”, specifically {{appear in}} the periodic albino mutant (ap/ap) of Xenopus laevis and localize {{in the same place}} where melanophores normally differentiate in the wild-type. The mechanism responsible for the development of unusual <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> is unclear. In this study, white <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> in the periodic albino were compared with melanophores in the wild-type, using a cell culture system and a tail-regenerating system. Observations of both intact and cultured cells demonstrate that white <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> are unique in (1) showing characteristics of melanophore precursors at various stages of development, (2) accumulating reflecting platelets characteristic of iridophores, and (3) exhibiting pigment dispersion in response to α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) {{in the same way that}} melanophores do. When a tadpole tail is amputated, a functionally competent new tail is regenerated. White <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> {{appear in the}} mutant regenerating tail, whereas melanophores differentiate in the wild-type regenerating tail. White <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> in the mutant regenerating tail are essentially similar to melanophores in the wild-type regenerating tail with respect to their localization, number, and response to α-MSH. In addition to white <b>pigment</b> <b>cells,</b> iridophores which are never present in the intact tadpole tail appear specifically in the somites near the amputation level in the mutant regenerating tail. Iridophores are distinct from white <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> in size, shape, blue light-induced fluorescence, and response to α-MSH. These findings strongly suggest that white <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> in the mutant arise from melanophore precursors and accumulate reflecting platelets characteristic of iridophores...|$|R
40|$|The {{light and}} {{electron}} microscopic features of <b>pigmented</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the adult}} dog pineal gland have been described. The presence of <b>pigmented</b> <b>cells</b> was a constant characteristic of the dog pineal gland, though wide variations {{in the amount of}} pigment could be found among different animals. Conversely, the localisation of <b>pigmented</b> <b>cells</b> was very constant on the basal surface of the proximal region of the pineal gland. Frequently, clusters of <b>pigmented</b> <b>cells</b> were seen in the posterior commissure and the neighbour meningeal spaces, near the pigmented pineal zone. The pineal pigment has been identified as melanin according to its morphological features and histochemical properties. Several types of granules were identified ultrastructurally, apparently corresponding to different stages of a maturation process. The <b>pigmented</b> <b>cells</b> were identified as a special type of pinealocyte according to their ultrastructural features...|$|R
50|$|Under the anole's skin are <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> called chromatophores {{responsible}} for its usual coloration. Underneath these <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> are specialized <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> called melanocytes which contain the pigment melanin, in response {{to changes in the}} lizards hormones these cells can expand and mask the ordinary <b>pigment</b> <b>cells,</b> resulting in a change to a darker coloration, thus the anole is capable of changing its hue from bright blue, to varying shades of brown or almost completely black when stressed.often the end of the tail,and sometimes the trunk,remains colored during a color change.These lizards also have the ability to change the color of only one half of their bodies.|$|R
2500|$|Glutathione {{plays an}} {{important}} role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. The role of glutathione as a skin whitener was discovered as a side effect of large doses of glutathione. Glutathione utilizes different mechanisms to exert its action as a skin whitening agent at various levels of melanogenesis. It inhibits melanin synthesis by means of stopping the neurotransmitter precursor L-DOPA's ability to interact with tyrosinase in the process of melanin production. Glutathione inhibits the actual production as well as agglutination of melanin by interrupting the function of L-DOPA. Another study found that glutathione inhibits melanin formation by direct inactivation of the enzyme tyrosinase by binding and chelating copper within the enzyme's active site. Glutathione's antioxidant property allows it to inhibit melanin synthesis by quenching of free radicals and peroxides that contribute to tyrosinase activation and melanin formation. [...] Its antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation and other environmental as well as internal stressors that generate free radicals that cause skin damage and hyperpigmentation. In most mammals, melanin formation consists of eumelanin (brown-black pigment) and pheomelanin ( [...] yellow-red pigment) as either mixtures or co-polymers. Increase in glutathione level may induce the <b>pigment</b> <b>cell</b> to produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin pigments. A research by Te-Sheng Chang found lowest levels of reduced glutathione to be associated with eumelanin type pigmentation, whereas the highest ones were associated with the pheomelanin. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that depletion of glutathione would result in eumelanin formation. Prota [...] observed that decreased glutathione concentration led to the conversion of L-Dopaquinone to Dopachrome, increasing the formation of brown-black pigment (eumelanin).|$|E

Three types of chromatophores are {{commonly found in}} amphibians: Xanthophores, which contain yellow, orange, or red pigments and are found uppermost on the dermis; iridophores, which lie below the xanthophores and function by reflecting and scattering white light up through them (in the case of Pseudacris regilla and many other North American frogs, iridophores reflect blue light through the yellow <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> above to create a green frog) and melanophores, which are the deepest <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> and {{are responsible for the}} presence of black and brown pigments.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the qualitative and quantitative distribution of melanocytes in human leptomeninges by histochemical and ultrastructural techniques and to search for melanocytes in the mesothelial linings of the pleural and peritoneal cavities.

50|$|Since {{an image}} from the {{compound}} eye is created from the independent picture elements produced by ommatidia, {{it is important for}} the ommatidia to react only to that part of the scene directly in front of them. To prevent light entering at an angle from being detected by the ommatidium it entered, or by any of the neighboring ommatidia, six pigment cells are present. The pigment cells line the outside of each ommatidium. Each <b>pigment</b> <b>cell</b> is situated at the apex of the hexagons and thus lines the outside of three ommatidia. Light entering at an angle passes through the thin cross-section of the photoreceptor cell, with only a tiny chance of exciting it, and is absorbed by the <b>pigment</b> <b>cell,</b> before it can enter a neighboring ommatidium. In many species, in low-light situations, the pigment is withdrawn, so that light entering the eye might be detected by any of several ommatidia. This enhances light detection but lowers resolution.|$|E

Therefore, studies were performed to determine whether loss of <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> in these depigmenting mice also was associated with loss of the cutaneous immune response. The number of Ia-positive (Ia +) Langerhans cells (LC) /mm 2 on the back and the ear, the sites of sensitization and challenge with dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), was quantified before, during, and after depigmentation.

The young pigmented C 57 BL/vi. vi mice were capable of developing moderate contact hypersensitivity; the older depigmented mice did not sensitize to DNFB. We conclude that the depigmented mice, like human subjects with vitiligo, have a loss of contact hypersensitivity associated with a loss of <b>pigment</b> <b>cells</b> within the epidermis.
