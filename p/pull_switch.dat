5000|$|An {{electric}} <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> {{is attached}} to a toggle type switch: one pull to switch on and next pull to switch off.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use of a}} <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> is to operate a ceiling {{electric}} light. The ceiling fan and mechanical wall fans are also appliances often operated by pull switches. Pull switches may be either two-position (open or closed) or multi-position (allowing for different fan speeds or levels of illumination).|$|E
50|$|In a damp environment, {{electrical}} <b>pull</b> <b>switches</b> have {{a safety}} advantage because the user {{is separated from}} the electricity by a significant distance and if the lead is made of an electrically insulating material, such as cotton string.|$|R

50|$|Mounted {{inside a}} <b>pull</b> <b>switch,</b> {{there could be}} two types of two-position toggle switches. (In both cases the stable {{physical}} open- or closed -situation would be switch in outer and string in upper position.) One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string. The other type would switch to closed (or open) only when releasing after a full pull. With the first type, {{the weight of the}} string and handle could accidentally switch the load intermittently on and off, when still around the initial position (depending on the internal spring). This could potentially increase the danger of overheating in the switch.|$|E
5000|$|The Fender Princeton Reverb is {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} combo, essentially a Princeton with built-in reverb and vibrato. The 12 Watt Blackface version {{was introduced in}} 1964 and available until 1967, in 1968 it was changed to the Silverface version with a drip edge around the grill cloth. Amps produced {{after the end of}} 1969 saw a change in circuitry, the removal of the drip edge and the rectifier was changed from a 5ar4 to a 5u4gb along with a change in bias resistor value, a [...] "boost" [...] <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> to the volume control pot was added in 1977. In 1980 and 1981 the Silverface version was cosmetically changed back to the Blackface. It was discontinued in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|For 1999, the Mustang also {{received}} a change to its taillights, making them edgier, with sharp corners and straight lines {{as opposed to the}} rounded off style of previous years. The lamps were still composed of three vertical segments, reminiscent of the original. Minimal changes occurred from year-to-year, most noticeable was a redesigned center panel in the dashboard for 2001, which now allowed double-din stereo head units, including an in-dash six-CD player. The rear window defroster switch, previously mounted below the headlamp <b>pull</b> <b>switch,</b> was moved to the lower center stack below the stereo. When equipped, the fog lamp switch was relocated to the lower center stack as well, previously, it was on the center console adjacent to the cup holders. The third button on the lower switch panel was for the traction control system (on V8 models). On convertible models, the power roof switch remained on the center console - on coupe models, that switch was replaced with a small coin holder.|$|E
5000|$|Most commercially {{available}} <b>pull</b> <b>switches</b> use a short length of ball chain, which may then {{be connected to}} any number of optional leads for added length or decoration. Leads for decoration or utility are usually made of metal or plastic. They can come in many different shapes ranging from animals, geometric shapes, or look just like a weight.|$|R

5000|$|One {{can tell}} if a {{particular}} amp is a [...] "+" [...] {{by looking for}} a hand-written black [...] "+" [...] mark directly above where the power cord attaches {{to the back of}} the amp. Many dealers increase the price on a Mark IIC+ but often don't know anything about what the [...] "+" [...] means--they often don't even know where to find the [...] "+" [...] mark. Indeed, the mark itself can be forged. An owner can call Mesa/Boogie and ask them to check his or her serial number against their records. Mesa/Boogie only made about 1,400 Mark IIC amps before going to the Mark IIC+.Another cosmetic way of distinguishing a IIC from a IIC+ is the front panel. A IIC has the traditional [...] "Gain Boost" [...] <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> integrated into the master volume, while a IIC+ replaced the switch with a Pull Deep bass booster. Some Coliseum series IIC+'s retained the surplus [...] "Gain Boost" [...] faceplates, though. IIC+'s upgraded from earlier IIC's also retain their original Gain Boost faceplates. However, there are some very early [...] "transitional" [...] C+´s (in the 133xx range) with gain boost on the panel, but it works the same as the pull Deep on the later versions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{types of}} window blinds and {{curtains}} use a cord pull to open, close, raise, and lower them. Some types of ladders like the extension ladder and attic ladder {{can have a}} pullstring that pulls it down from the ceiling. A dock plate can use a pullchain to move it. Some gates have a pullstring on its latch. A <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> uses a chain or string to actuate a switch, commonly used in lighting and ceiling fans. Modern flush toilets use a pullchain attached to a lever that lifts the plunger to release water into the toilet bowl. The photoplayer uses pullchains to generate sound effects for silent films. Pre-1990s North American diesel locomotive train horns used a lever or pull cord to actuate an air valve. Older steam whistles were almost always actuated with a pull cord. A train's emergency brake can be a cord or chain that will stop the train when pulled. Older transit buses and trams/trolleys have a pullcord that a passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop. The Jaguar XK120 sports car's doors have no external handles so it uses an interior pullcord instead. Some grandfather clocks have a pullchain to raise the weights in order to wind the clock's gears. A lifejacket has a pullcord used to inflate it.|$|E
40|$|Fire alarm {{extension}} apparatuses (30, 100) permit actuation of a {{fire alarm}} <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> (11, 21) by persons with a handicap by lowering the position at which the fire alarm <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> (11, 21) can be actuated. The fire alarm extension apparatuses (30, 100) each comprise a clip (33, 133) for attachment to a pull lever (14, 24) of the fire alarm pull switches (11, 21). An elongated member (32, 132) {{is attached to the}} clip (33, 133) for permitting movement of the clip (33, 133) and the pull lever (14, 24) while at a position remote from the pull lever (14, 24) in a direction to permit actuation of the fire alarm <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> (11, 21). In a first embodiment (30), the elongated member (33) is a flat rigid shaft which is mounted to a wall (31) via a mounting block (36) and is guided by dual parallel rails (37 a, 37 b) situated on the mounting block (36). Further, the lever (14, 24) is engaged by a C-shaped clip (33), and the shaft (32) has a T-shaped handle (34). In a second embodiment (100), the elongated member (132) is a coated wire which permits pivotal movement of the lever (14, 24) as well as the cover (12, 22) without mechanical stress to the apparatus (100). Further, the second embodiment has a frictional mechanism (151 b) for inhibiting movement of the cord (132) for preventing inadvertent actuation of the switch (11, 21) and a mechanism (152, 153) for ensuring that a slanted-L-shaped handle (134) remains in a desirable posture for easy grasping by a person.

50|$|In {{addition}} to capturing ghosts, the suction and blowing {{functions of the}} Poltergust 5000 are used to manipulate and carry objects seen in the environment. Many of the game's puzzles are designed around this concept. For example, the player uses the vacuum to carry buckets of water, yank <b>pull</b> <b>switches,</b> spin valve handles, and propel small objects. Other objects, such as certain types of switches and locks, react only when exposed to the Strobulb flash. Early in the game, the player obtains the Dark-Light Device item, which allows the flashlight to reveal invisible doors and furniture.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the analysis of archaeological data in virtual reality presents is the interaction. Within the project of reconstruction of Kaulonia archaeological site in Monasterace (Italy), developers {{had to deal with the}} need to implement an interface system inside the application without using external devices, in order to facilitate archaeologists in the data consultation. A study on a system of movement and interaction with objects in the environment was conducted to create an interface for interaction based on look. Subsequently a method of interaction was developed by eliminating the problem of performing gestures and removing the entire “Learning Step” by users, so that it is possible to select and deselect elements, move around in and rotate the view directly with the movement of the head. As for the selection of the various elements within the application, a “cursor” specially implemented allows users to interact with the interactive elements: whenever users set a hotspot (point of interest) a <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> is activated. Within the application you have a general overview of the excavation seen from above and you can view the 3 D models in the same spot where they were originally found: together with them you can see a brief historical description that contextualizes the object. A continuous progress of the study is allowing to explore new frontiers of digital data analysis in archaeology...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} advancements in powered uppet extremity posthetics has been the advent of "programmable" controllers. These programmable controllas are allowing new operational strategies to be designed and implemented for upper extremity patient populations. Previously, existing technology provided basic functional abilities but continued to limit maximum functional restoration of upper extremity use following amputation and prosthetic fitting. Any additional changes to the "control strategy" of the prosthetic system meant changing hardware with additional costs. This was not a cost-effective treatment protocol for the provider's who were reluctant to explore available options. With these limitations, many patients were forced to adapt to decreased functional capabilities with inadequate piosthetic systems or without the assistance of any prosthesis. Programmable controllets have enhanced the rate and functional abilities of the upper extremity amputee by providing progressive adaptation throughout the rehabilitation process. Input, output and control parameters are optimized as functional demands are increased. For example, the system can be initially setup for ease of use and training and later optimized for function as signal strength and abilities increase. Two patient cases will be presented Case 1 utilizes a single-site myoelectric control, harness <b>pull</b> <b>switch</b> for mode select controlling an electric elbow, wrist and hand (or Greifer). Case 2 utilizes a single-site myoelectric control, nudge "rocker" switch for mode select to control the electric wrist and hand (or Greifer) ...|$|E
50|$|The GDP/GTP {{structural}} {{cycles of}} human Arf1 and Arf6 feature a unique conformational change {{that affects the}} beta2beta3 strands connecting switch 1 and switch 2 (interswitch) and also the amphipathic helical N-terminus. In GDP-bound Arf1 and Arf6, the interswitch is retracted and forms a pocket to which the N-terminal helix binds, the latter serving as a molecular hasp to maintain the inactive conformation. In the GTP-bound form of these proteins, the interswitch undergoes a two-residue register shift that <b>pulls</b> <b>switch</b> 1 and switch 2 up, restoring an active conformation that can bind GTP. In this conformation, the interswitch projects out of the protein and extrudes the N-terminal hasp by occluding its binding pocket.|$|R
50|$|The player {{controls}} Ben E. Factor directly, like {{a platform}} game character. Factor has to avoid all enemy creatures (hitting them would reduce health), and <b>pull</b> <b>switches</b> {{to extend the}} land, or many other things. Factor can find keys on the level to open the locks in the Merry Men's cells. When freed, a Merry Man automatically proceeds on a pre-set mission, {{with the aid of}} helping Factor to free the other Merry Men and complete the level. Once all Merry Men on a level have been freed, Factor has {{to go back to his}} starting point to complete the level. Although colliding with monsters reduces Factor's health, Merry Men are not harmed by monsters.|$|R
50|$|The duo {{also appear}} in the BBC Three stand-up/sketch series Live at the Electric as {{backstage}} crew for the show with Palmer serving as the serious one and Stourton serving as comic relief {{and the one who}} <b>pulls</b> the <b>switch</b> to start the show.|$|R
50|$|There is not {{a single}} tempo or cadence for the chant, since this will depend on the task in hand. For example, hauling in the upper topsail halyard will require a long, heavy pull; if the team is not to be {{exhausted}} halfway through then the leader must ensure that the pace is slow enough to be maintained throughout the job. Hauling in a clewline, by contrast, is relatively quick and easy, so the chant can be quite rapid. It is also not always necessary to use this method of hauling for the whole of a task; often, {{the first part of the}} job can be achieved with simple hand-over-hand <b>pulling,</b> <b>switching</b> over to a coordinated heave for the final tensioning.|$|R
25|$|Hitman: Absolution is a stealth {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the {{gameplay}} centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals. Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipe against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, <b>pull</b> <b>switches</b> to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, <b>pull</b> a <b>switch</b> to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story. The player journeys to various locations, including a mansion, library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and hotel during the story.|$|R
50|$|Episode 2: Enemies in {{this episode}} cannot be killed {{and must be}} avoided at all costs. Levers {{in many of the}} levels can be <b>pulled</b> to <b>switch</b> flame traps on and off. One unique puzzle {{requires}} Alabama to pull a set of levers in the correct sequence.|$|R
50|$|Each {{year the}} opening {{night of the}} Illuminations, The Big Switch On, held in a {{specially}} erected arena with a celebrity <b>pulling</b> a <b>switch</b> {{to turn on the}} six miles of lights. The first switch on ceremony was held in 1934 when Lord Derby flicked the switch to turn on the Illuminations. In 1993 BBC Radio 1 first broadcast the switch on ceremony live when Status Quo were the guest celebrities, before in 1997 BBC Radio 2 started to cover it which continued until 2010, when GMG Radio, under its Real Radio and Smooth Radio brands took over the broadcasting of the switch on. Each year one main celebrity <b>pulls</b> the <b>switch</b> while there are performances in the Radio 2 arena with a pre-switch on concert featuring pop bands, singers and comedians.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the team}} booked {{to switch on}} the famous Blackpool Illuminations, the three were {{presented}} with a challenge to determine which of them would get the honour of <b>pulling</b> the <b>switch.</b> This {{took the form of}} a race from Basel to Blackpool, taking a route of their choice and using any unmodified production car, the only restriction being that they could only use a single tank of fuel. All three presenters chose diesel vehicles - May a Subaru Legacy, Hammond a Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion, to the scorn of his compatriots, and Clarkson a Jaguar XJ. He had dismissed the race as pointless, since the figures indicated no production car at the time could make the distance, and therefore decided to [...] "fail in style and comfort". Finally, the Stig was dropped off in Blackpool to <b>pull</b> the <b>switch</b> if no-one arrived.|$|R

50|$|A general action button is used {{to perform}} {{a wide range of}} {{movements}} in Tomb Raider, such as picking up items, <b>pulling</b> <b>switches,</b> firing guns, pushing or pulling blocks, and grabbing onto ledges. Regular items to pick up include ammo, and small and large medi-packs. Game-specific items are keys and artefacts required to complete a stage. Any item that is collected is held onto in Lara's inventory until it is used. The puzzles that the player encounters across each level vary: pulling specific combinations of levers, a course of timed jumps, avoiding a certain trap or collecting several keystones. Throughout each stage, one or more secrets may be located. Discovering these secrets is optional, and when the player has found one a tune plays. The locations of these secrets vary in difficulty to reach. Some are hidden along the roadside in bushes, others require the completion of a hidden course or optional puzzle to be found. The player is usually rewarded with extra items.|$|R
40|$|Prosthetists {{have been}} fitting externally-powered {{components}} to individuals with “shoulder disarticulation”, upper extremity amputations for decades. These components {{have ranged from}} momentary contact switches that permitted carbon-dioxide to pass through tubes {{in order to create}} an articulating motion, to force sensitive resistors (FSRs) that vary the amount of resistance between thin conductive plates in order to permit varied current to flow and provide input to an electrical motor. Activation of these types of inputs requires contact by the user with their remaining residual limb or, in the case of individuals with congenital deficiencies, phocomelic digits. A variety of <b>pull</b> <b>switches</b> have also been used to harness the body motions provided by the user, which activate an electro-mechanical switch used to drive a motor. With the use of coupled rotary potentiometers, the authors have chosen to investigate a unique approach to ipsilateral shoulder motion as a control source for two degrees of freedom...|$|R
