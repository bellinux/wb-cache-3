5000|$|All-purpose flour is {{the most}} common flour used in baking. Its protein content lies between bread and cake <b>flours</b> and <b>pastry</b> <b>flours.</b> All-purpose is used in many recipes for the reason that people find it’s {{acceptable}} for most household baking needs. It can generally be substituted for recipes that call for either bread or cake flour, however, the final texture of the product may vary slightly. High-protein bread flour absorbs more liquid, so substituting all-purpose flour may result in a slightly stickier dough; while low-protein flour absorbs less liquid, so substituting with all-purpose flour may result in a slightly dry batter.2 ...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, bread flours {{are high}} in gluten (hard wheat); <b>pastry</b> <b>flours</b> have a lower gluten content. Kneading {{promotes}} the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (in contrast to crumbly). The [...] "chewiness" [...] increases as the dough is kneaded for longer times. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development, and very wet doughs left to rise {{for a long time}} require no kneading (see no-knead bread). Shortening inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a pie crust, is desired.|$|R

30|$|The baking premixes are ready-to-bake {{mixtures}} {{that are}} used to make breads or various pastries after adding liquid and are mainly produced for home use. The aluminium concentrations of the baking premixes analysed in this study (mainly ready-to-bake bread flours) were between 1.3 and 737 mg kg- 1. The median value, however, was only 6 mg kg- 1. In three samples, aluminium concentrations greater than 100 mg kg- 1 were detected. The sample containing 113 mg kg- 1 of aluminium was a ready-to-bake premix containing nuts. The other two samples (ready-to-bake <b>pastry</b> <b>flours)</b> with a relatively high aluminium concentration (566 and 737 mg kg- 1) were baking premixes to which sodium aluminium sulphate had been added and that were, according to the manufacturer, originally produced for export but were mistakenly put into circulation in Germany.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{ingredients}} of the <b>pastry</b> are <b>flour</b> - most commonly wheat or buckwheat - mixed with egg, oil, {{warm water and}} salt. These are then mixed together and the dough rolled out into a thin layer. The filling can be either sweet or savoury; the most common fillings are apple, walnut, poppy seed, cottage cheese or tarragon. The chosen filling is then spread onto the sheet of dough, and the dough then formed into a roll.|$|R
50|$|When wheat is milled to make flour, {{the parts}} of the grain are usually {{separated}} and then are recombined to make specific types of flour, such as whole wheat, whole grain, white cake and <b>pastry</b> <b>flour,</b> and all-purpose white flour. If all parts of the kernel are used in the same relative proportions as they exist in the original kernel, then the flour is considered whole grain.|$|E

50|$|In Ireland, {{the flour}} is {{typically}} made from soft wheat, so soda bread is best {{made with a}} cake or <b>pastry</b> <b>flour</b> (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of gluten than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live yogurt or even stout. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.|$|E

Its protein content ranges between 9% and 10%. It is {{available as a}} white flour, a whole-wheat flour, or a white flour with the germ retained but not the bran. It is suitable for pie pastry and tarts, some cookies, muffins, biscuits and other quick breads. Flour is shaken through a sieve {{to reduce the amount}} of lumps for cooking pastry.|$|E
5000|$|Spelt, {{an ancient}} grain, is a {{hexaploid}} species of wheat. Spelt dough needs less kneading than common wheat or durum wheat dough. Compared to hard-wheat flours, spelt flour has {{a relatively low}} (six to nine percent) protein count, just a little higher than <b>pastry</b> <b>flour.</b> That means that plain spelt flour works well in creating dough for soft foods such as cookies or pancakes. Crackers turn out well because they are made from dough that {{does not need to}} rise when baked.|$|E
50|$|In Indonesia, singkong or ketela (cassava) is an {{important}} food. It can be cooked by frying or boiling, or processed by fermentation to make tapai and getuk cake, while the starch is made into krupuk crackers. In time of famine or food shortage, cassava is used to replace rice. In 2011, modified cassava flour became common, and some instant noodle producers have used it silently, especially for low-end instant noodles as a partial substitute of pricy flour. The flour is often added to <b>pastry</b> <b>flour</b> although {{the result is a}} pastry that is a little stiff. Getuk cakes can be difficult to digest for diners not used to it and can result in severe cramps and discomfort.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{estimation}} of safety of most popular snacks and <b>flour</b> <b>pastry</b> products with the extended expiration date and considerable maintenance {{of fat in}} studies in animals. Material and Methods. Influences of snacks products with different maintenance of toxic foods of oxidization and copolymerizing of insoluble in petroleum ether fat components on the organism of animals at the protracted consumption by the haematological and histological methods of research were studied. Results. It was determined that the high concentrations of fat components of copolymerizing and oxidization of some types of snacks and <b>flour</b> <b>pastry</b> wares with the protracted expiration date possessed the toxic operating on the organism of laboratory animals and caused the expressed changes in the morphological and biochemical composition of the blood test, and also pathological processes in the tissue and cells. Conclusion. The analysis of results of undertaken studies proved the necessity of the sanitary-technological provision of safety of products with the extended expiration date and considerable maintenance of foods with oxidization of fat components...|$|R
5000|$|French flour type numbers (type de farine) are {{a factor}} 10 smaller than {{those used in}} Germany, because they {{indicate}} the ash content (in milligrams) per 10 g flour. Type 55 is the standard, hard-wheat white flour for baking, including puff pastries ("pâte feuilletée"). Type 45 is often called <b>pastry</b> <b>flour,</b> and is generally from a softer wheat (this corresponds to what older French texts call [...] "farine de gruau"). Some recipes use Type 45 for croissants, for instance, although many French bakers use Type 55 {{or a combination of}} Types 45 and 55. Types 65, 80, and 110 are strong bread flours of increasing darkness, and type 150 is a wholemeal flour.|$|E
5000|$|Wheat flour is {{a powder}} {{made from the}} {{grinding}} of wheat used for human consumption. More wheat flour is produced than any other flour. Wheat varieties are called [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "weak" [...] if gluten content is low, and are called [...] "hard" [...] or [...] "strong" [...] if they have high gluten content. Hard flour, or bread flour, is high in gluten, with 12% to 14% gluten content, and its dough has elastic toughness that holds its shape well once baked. Soft flour is comparatively low in gluten and thus results in a loaf with a finer, crumbly texture. Soft flour is usually divided into cake flour, which is the lowest in gluten, and <b>pastry</b> <b>flour,</b> which has slightly more gluten than cake flour.|$|E
5000|$|First used {{to grind}} flour as a grist mill, it also {{functioned as a}} saw mill and a fulling mill [...] One of the first owners was Andrew Miller. The mill began a major process of {{modernization}} when purchased by the Brandt family in 1909, {{a time of great}} advances in milling technology in the United States. During the 20th century, roller mills were designed to extract flour from wheat in a process that was more economical than the age-old grinding of grain between two stones. Today, wheat grains are run through two rollers of different sizes that operate at varying speeds. They are then pneumatically lifted and repeatedly sent through the rollers until fully processed. The resulting flour is sifted and bagged under the name of Daisy Organic Flour. During that century of ownership, the Brandt family converted the mill power from water power to electricity and from grist mill to roller mill. Bakeries favored the flour for pretzels and pie crusts as well as the cookies. Bakeries have always favored the mill’s original product - <b>pastry</b> <b>flour</b> - for pretzels and pie crusts as well as cookies. Only <b>pastry</b> <b>flour</b> was produced by the mill during the 18th, 19th centuries because local farmers were only able to grow the varieties of soft wheat that are best suited to the climate in this area of the northeast United States. In 2002 Annville Flouring Mill was purchased by McGeary Organics in order to support the commitment of local farmers to growing organic grains.With access to national transportation systems, McGeary has been able to introduce hard-wheat flours to the mill, adding Bread Flour [...] and All-Purpose Flour [...] to the product line of the Annville Mill. Annville Flouring Mill now produces premium Daisy Organic Flours from both regional and national growers of soft and hard wheat. Spelt flour [...] was the last type of flour added to the product line of the Annville Flouring Mill. Spelt flour was first produced in the Annville Mill in 2002 in response to the rising popularity of ancient grains in the organic food world today.|$|E
50|$|Shortcrust pastry {{is a type}} of pastry {{often used}} for the base of a tart, quiche or pie. It does not puff up during baking because it usually {{contains}} no leavening agent. It is possible to make shortcrust <b>pastry</b> with self-rising <b>flour,</b> however.
