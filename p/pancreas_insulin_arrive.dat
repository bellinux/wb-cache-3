40|$|Although {{the source}} of {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells presents ethical concerns, their use may lead to many clinical beneÞts if differentiated cell types {{can be derived from}} them and used to assemble functional organs.

We have generated cells expressing insulin and other pancreatic endocrine hormones from mouse ES cells. The cells self-assemble to form three-dimensional clusters similar in topology to normal pancreatic islets where pancreatic cell types are in close association with neurons. Glucose triggers insulin release from these cell clusters by mechanisms similar to those employed in vivo.

50|$|The insulin {{concentration}} in blood increases after meals and gradually returns to basal levels {{during the next}} 1-2 hours. However, the basal insulin level is not stable. It oscillates with a regular period of 3-6 min. After a meal the amplitude of these oscillations increases but the periodicity remains constant. The oscillations {{are believed to be}} important for insulin sensitivity by preventing downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells. Such downregulation underlies insulin resistance, which is common in type 2 diabetes. It would therefore be advantageous to administer insulin to diabetic patients in a manner mimicking the natural oscillations. The insulin oscillations are generated by pulsatile release of the hormone from the <b>pancreas.</b> <b>Insulin</b> originates from beta cells located in the islets of Langerhans.

40|$|Patients {{with type}} 1 diabetes, and most {{patients}} with type 2 diabetes, have associated hyperglycemia {{due to the}} absence or reduction of insulin production by pancreatic β-cells.

These observations are proof-of-principle and have intensified interest in treating diabetes by cell transplantation, and by the use of stem cells. Pancreatic stem/progenitor cells could be one of the sources for the treatment of diabetes. Islet neogenesis, the budding of new islets from pancreatic stem/progenitor cells located in or near pancreatic ducts, has long been assumed to be an active process in the postnatal pancreas.

40|$|The {{role of the}} gluco-incretin hormones GIP and GLP- 1 in {{the control}} of beta cell {{function}} was studied by analyzing mice with inactivation {{of each of these}} hormone receptor genes, or both. Our results demonstrate that glucose intolerance was additively increased during oral glucose absorption when both receptors were inactivated.

Thus, gluco-incretin hormones control insulin secretion (a) by an acute insulinotropic effect on beta cells after oral glucose absorption (b) through the regulation, by GLP- 1, of in vivo first-phase insulin secretion, probably by an action on extra-islet glucose sensors, and (c) by preserving the function of the secretory pathway, as evidenced by a beta cell autonomous secretion defect when both receptors are inactivated...|$|R

After 12 -week saxagliptin treatment in high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, significant improvement in <b>pancreas</b> <b>insulin</b> secretion capacity evaluated by hyperglycemia clamp and increased β-cell to α-cell areas ratio were observed. Saxagliptin significantly induced β-cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of proliferation-related factors including c-myc and cyclind D 1 determined with western blotting from the isolated islets. The expression/activity of DPP- 4 was significantly reduced and paralleled with the restoration of SDF- 1 α levels in the saxagliptin-treated diabetic rats, subsequently the key WNT-signaling regulators, β-catenin, and AKT were activated. However, the effect of saxagliptin inducing β-cell proliferation was attenuated when we silenced the SDF- 1 α receptor (CXCR 4) with RNAi in INS cell lines. Collectively, our data indicate that SDF- 1 α mediates the protective effect of saxagliptin on β-cell proliferation, suggesting that DPP- 4 inhibitors have the potential role on delaying β-cell failure and SDF- 1 α could be a therapeutic target of β-cell regeneration...|$|R
