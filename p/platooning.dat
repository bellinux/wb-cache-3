5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the disabled list (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the disabled list, but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with <b>platooning</b> him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E

A mid-season trade brought in veteran Jeff Hackett. In the midst of a late-season slump, General Manager Mike O'Connell fired head coach Robbie Ftorek with nine games to go and named himself interim coach. The Bruins managed to finish seventh in the East, but lost to the {{eventual}} Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in five games. In 2003–04, the Bruins began the season with ex-Toronto Maple Leaf goalie Felix Potvin. Later in the season, the Bruins put rookie Andrew Raycroft into the starting role. Raycroft eventually won the Calder Trophy that season. The Bruins went on to win another division title and appeared to get past the first round {{for the first time in}} five years with a 3–1 series lead on the rival Canadiens.

Most of Stengel's playing {{days were}} after {{offensive}} <b>platooning,</b> choosing left-handed batters against a right-handed pitcher and the converse, was used successfully by the World Series champion 1914 Boston [...] "Miracle" [...] Braves. This set off {{widespread use of}} platooning: Stengel himself was several times during his playing career platooned against right-handers, but the practice fell into disuse around 1930. Stengel reintroduced it to the Yankees, and its prominent use amid the team's success caused it to be imitated by other teams. [...] Bill James deemed Stengel and Earl Weaver the most successful platoon managers.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, 2012, Torres {{agreed to}} a one-year non-conditional {{contract}} {{to return to the}} San Francisco Giants. He began 2013 <b>platooning</b> with Gregor Blanco in left field.

On July 13, he began <b>platooning</b> with Blanco in center field after Jeff Francoeur was called up. His season came to an end on August 1, when he was placed on the disabled list with a left Achilles strain, an injury which he acknowledged prevented him from hitting for power in 2013.

500|$|Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, {{soon after}} the manager's retirement, [...] "He was never {{necessarily}} the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that {{had a chance to}} win, he'd win." [...] Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him [...] "I swear I don't understand {{some of the things he}} does when he manages". Though <b>platooning</b> survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.|$|E

500|$|James {{noted that}} Stengel {{was not only}} the most {{successful}} manager of the 1950s, he was the most dominant manager of any single decade in baseball history. Stengel used his entire squad as Yankee manager, in contrast to other teams when he began his tenure, on which substitutes tended to get little playing time. Stengel's use of <b>platooning</b> meant more players saw more use, and he was generally more prone to put in a pinch hitter or replace his pitcher than other managers. Although only once in Stengel's time (1954) did the Yankees lead the league in number of pinch hitters, Stengel was known for using them in odd situations, once pinch-hitting for Moose Skowron in the first inning after a change of pitcher. Additionally, according to James, Stengel [...] "rotated lineups with mad abandon, using perhaps 70 to 100 different lineups in a 154 game season". Although Stengel was not the first Yankee manager to use a regular relief pitcher—Harris had seen success with Joe Page in 1947—his adoption of the concept did much to promote it.|$|E
500|$|A {{native of}} Brooklyn, Ferguson played {{for two of}} New York's {{earliest}} semi-professional clubs in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the Atlantics and Mutuals. On June 14, 1870, Ferguson provided the hit that created the tying run and he later scored the winning run in a match against the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first team that was composed entirely of professional players. [...] This win brought to an end the Red Stockings' 81 consecutive game winning streak. He is credited with being {{the first player to}} bat from both sides of home plate, known as switch-hitting, but the practice was not popular at first. [...] Among the explanations for this, it is claimed that, due to his personality, players did not want to emulate him. [...] Managers, however, recognized the practice's importance soon after, and began to play their players according to the opposing pitcher that day, known today as <b>platooning,</b> and the advantages that switch-hitting posed would later become accepted strategic baseball philosophy, and many players began to experiment with the idea.|$|E

500|$|Stengel {{tried to}} {{keep a low profile}} during the 1949 Yankee spring {{training}} at St. Petersburg, Florida, but there was considerable media attention as Stengel shuttled rookies from one position on the field to another, and endlessly shuffled his lineup. He had the advantage of diminished expectations, as DiMaggio, the Yankee superstar, was injured with a bone spur in his heel, and few picked New York to win the pennant. There were other injuries once the season began, and Stengel, who had initially planned a conservative, stable lineup in his first American League season, was forced to [...] improvise. Although <b>platooning,</b> playing right handed batters against left handed pitchers and the reverse, against whom they are on average more able to hit, had been known for some years, Stengel popularized it, and his use gave the practice its name, coined by a sportswriter and borrowed from football. For example, {{in the early part of}} the 1949 season, Stengel might against right handers play Bobby Brown at third base and Cliff Mapes and Gene Woodling in the outfield. Against left handers, Stengel might play Billy Johnson at third with Johnny Lindell and Hank Bauer in the outfield.|$|E
500|$|After a {{productive}} 2011 season {{during which he}} [...] "excited fans" [...] and seemed like [...] "a sure bet to crack at least 25 (home runs) the following year and maybe drive in 100 runs", Mayberry's performance instead declined significantly, hitting just [...]245 (a 28-point drop), albeit with similar power numbers (14 home runs and 46 runs batted in compared to 15 and 49 respectively in 2011). After a poor start to the season, some sportswriters questioned whether the Phillies should have prioritized finding a left fielder in free agency to supplant him, who entered the season <b>platooning</b> in left field with Juan Pierre. Mayberry's slump continued into May – on May 1, he held a [...]204 batting average – and ultimately, Pierre excelled {{to the point that}} he became the de facto everyday starter, leaving Mayberry on the bench until late July, when the Phillies traded both Shane Victorino and Hunter Pence, forcing Mayberry to see action, predominantly in center field. Though he played well in August (batting [...]290), he struggled through September, and expectations were relatively low headed into the offseason. A season-in-review article from SBNation.com opined, [...] "(His) adequate defense at all three outfield positions makes him a decent fourth outfielder/bench bat, but at age 29 in 2013, the time for hoping that Mayberry finally puts his significant physical and intellectual gifts together to become an above-average Major League Baseball player appear to have gone completely." ...|$|E

After receiving a text message from his father {{at the beginning of}} May saying he would improve, Ross declared that he was restarting his season and had 10 home runs and 18 RBI in the month. During the month, Ross had a stretch where nine out of 10 hits were home runs, becoming the first player to have a streak of that sort since Mark McGwire in 2001. On May 14, he hit a game-tying three-run ninth inning home run against Francisco Cordero in a 10-inning, 7–6 loss to the Reds. Then, on June 7 he hit a game-winning three-run home run {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning against Cordero to give the Marlins an 8–7 victory over the Reds. Jones was designated for assignment on June 11, putting Ross in sole control of centerfield. In a four-game series with the Colorado Rockies from July 3 through 6, Ross had 15 RBI, becoming the first player to have that many in a four-game series since Carlton Fisk in 1977. Fourteen of those RBI came from July 4 through 6, the most in a three-game span since Sammy Sosa had 16 in 2002.
