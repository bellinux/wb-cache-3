5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's <b>phenotype,</b> {{or physical}} characteristics. <b>Phenotype</b> {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in <b>phenotype.</b> An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the <b>phenotype.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive <b>phenotype</b> is a <b>phenotype</b> that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the <b>phenotype,</b> or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any <b>phenotype</b> {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution).

Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its <b>phenotype.</b> These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.

However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E

40|$|Aging {{studies can}} be {{facilitated}} by refocusing from longevity <b>phenotypes</b> to their proxies (intermediate <b>phenotypes).</b> Robust {{selection of the}} intermediate <b>phenotypes</b> requires data on such <b>phenotypes</b> and life span measured in the same individuals, which {{is not always the}} case in aging studies. A promising approach is to select intermediate <b>phenotypes</b> using information on longevity measured in related individuals. We evaluated feasibility of this approach focusing on 32 geriatric diseases as potential intermediate <b>phenotypes</b> of longevity assessed in the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. Our analyses reveal that geriatric diseases measured in some family members can predict life span in the other family members both individually and cumulatively ensuring that this approach for selection of intermediate <b>phenotypes</b> is feasible.

40|$|BACKGROUND Latent <b>phenotypes</b> are non-adaptive {{byproducts}} {{of adaptive}} <b>phenotypes.</b> They exist in biological systems {{as different as}} promiscuous enzymes and genome-scale metabolic reaction networks, and can give rise to evolutionary adaptations and innovations. We know little about their prevalence in the gene expression <b>phenotypes</b> of regulatory circuits, important sources of evolutionary innovations. RESULTS Here, we study a space of more than sixteen million three-gene model regulatory circuits, where each circuit is represented by a genotype, and has one or more functions embodied {{in one or more}} gene expression <b>phenotypes.</b> We find that the majority of circuits with single functions have latent expression <b>phenotypes.</b> Moreover, the set of circuits with a given spectrum of functions has a repertoire of latent <b>phenotypes</b> that is much larger than that of any one circuit. Most of this latent repertoire can be easily accessed through a series of small genetic changes that preserve a circuit's main functions. Both circuits and gene expression <b>phenotypes</b> that are robust to genetic change are associated with a greater number of latent <b>phenotypes.</b> CONCLUSIONS Our observations suggest that latent <b>phenotypes</b> are pervasive in regulatory circuits, and may thus be an important source of evolutionary adaptations and innovations involving gene regulation...|$|R

5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter <b>phenotype.</b> Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the <b>phenotype</b> – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenomic {{prediction}} for novel traits, {{which can}} be costly and labor-intensive to measure, is often hampered by low accuracy due to the limited size of the reference population. As an option to improve prediction accuracy, we introduced a semi-supervised learning strategy known as the self-training model, and applied this method to genomic prediction of residual feed intake (RFI) in dairy cattle. MethodsWe describe a self-training model that is wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which enables it to use data from animals with and without measured <b>phenotypes.</b> Initially, a SVM model was trained using data from 792 animals with measured RFI <b>phenotypes.</b> Then, the resulting SVM was used to generate self-trained <b>phenotypes</b> for 3000 animals for which RFI measurements were not available. Finally, the SVM model was re-trained using data from up to 3792 animals, including those with measured and self-trained RFI <b>phenotypes.</b> ResultsIncorporation of additional animals with self-trained <b>phenotypes</b> enhanced the accuracy of genomic predictions {{compared to that of}} predictions that were derived from the subset of animals with measured <b>phenotypes.</b> The optimal ratio of animals with self-trained <b>phenotypes</b> to animals with measured <b>phenotypes</b> (2. 5, 2. 0, and 1. 8) and the maximum increase achieved in prediction accuracy measured as the correlation between predicted and actual RFI <b>phenotypes</b> (5. 9, 4. 1, and 2. 4 %) decreased as the size of the initial training set (300, 400, and 500 animals with measured <b>phenotypes)</b> increased. The optimal number of animals with self-trained <b>phenotypes</b> may be smaller when prediction accuracy is measured as the mean squared error rather than the correlation between predicted and actual RFI <b>phenotypes.</b> ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that semi-supervised learning models that incorporate self-trained <b>phenotypes</b> can achieve genomic prediction accuracies that are comparable to those obtained with models using larger training sets that include only animals with measured <b>phenotypes.</b> Semi-supervised learning can be helpful for genomic prediction of novel traits, such as RFI, for which the size of reference population is limited, in particular, when the animals to be predicted and the animals in the reference population originate from the same herd-environment...|$|R

We conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify the shared genetic background of inflammation and cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes</b> using published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We also evaluated whether the pleiotropic effects of such loci were biological or mediated in nature. First, we examined whether 283 common variants identified for 10 cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes</b> in GWAS are associated with CRP level. Second, we tested whether 18 variants identified for serum CRP are associated with 10 cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes.</b> We used a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 1. 1 × 10 - 04 (0. 05 / 463) as a threshold of significance. We evaluated the independent pleiotropic effect on both <b>phenotypes</b> using individual level data from the Women Genome Health Study. Evaluating the genetic overlap between inflammation and cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes,</b> we found 13 pleiotropic regions. Additional analyses showed that 6 regions (APOC 1, HNF 1 A, IL 6 R, PPP 1 R 3 B, HNF 4 A and IL 1 F 10) appeared to have a pleiotropic effect on CRP independent of the effects on the cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes.</b> These included loci where individuals carrying the risk allele for CRP encounter higher lipid levels and risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition, 5 regions (GCKR, PABPC 4, BCL 7 B, FTO and TMEM 18) {{had an effect on}} CRP largely mediated through the cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes.</b> In conclusion, our results show genetic pleiotropy among inflammation and cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes.</b> In addition to reverse causation, our data suggests that pleiotropic genetic variants partially underlie the association between CRP and cardiometabolic <b>phenotypes...</b>|$|R
