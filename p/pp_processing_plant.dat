30|$|The <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> had a {{prevalence}} rate of 22.6 % from chicken meat {{when compared}} to 1.56 % from a <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> in Morocco (Cohen et al. 2007) and 20 % in USA <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> (Russell 2009). Albeit, Salmonella contamination in poultry products from the <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> is primarily due to cross contamination by physical contact during carcass processing such as improper cleaning and disinfection of processing lines, improper chilling and storage temperature, poor worker hygiene and infestation with rodents and insects.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} Rakvere Meat <b>Processing</b> <b>Plant</b> {{dates back to}} the year 1890 when the first {{slaughterhouse}} was opened in Rakvere. In 1905 a new slaughterhouse was built in Rakvere in accordance with the requirements of the time. In 1944 the town’s slaughterhouse and Bauman and Schenkel sausage industry were united and Rakvere Meat <b>Processing</b> <b>Plant</b> was established. The enterprise was reconstructed in the 1960s. In 1963 Kohtla-Järve and Narva meat <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> and joined with the meat <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> in Rakvere. In 1987 a construction deal was closed with the Finnish enterprise [...] "Suomen Rakennusvienti" [...] and by the year 1990 the biggest, most modern meat <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> in the Baltic States possessing the technology corresponding to the European level was finished in Roodevälja just northeast of Rakvere. Rakvere Meat <b>Processing</b> <b>Plant</b> has held the position until this day.|$|R

40|$|Virus protein VP 4 of {{infectious}} bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a protease which separates VPX and VP 3 from the polyprotein. We studied the importance of serine and aspartic acid on cleavage at the VPX/VP 4 junction and analysed {{the role of the}} proposed H 547, D 590, and S 653 catalytic site using five different mutations on VP 4. Our results suggest that the replacement of serine by lysine in AXAAS motifs in serotype II IBDV influences polyprotein (<b>PP)</b> <b>processing</b> by VP 4 and also indicate the presence of an alternative cleavage site. Mutation on D ((510) TLAADK(515)) prevented the cleavage at the VPX/VP 4 junction, but we have found that independently of the importance of those alanines in LAA, D has an important role as part of the cleavage site. Replacement of histidine by proline H 547 P completely abolished <b>PP</b> <b>processing.</b> Mutation on D 590 induced a partial <b>PP</b> <b>processing</b> when it was replaced by proline and the replacement of serine by proline at S 653 P induced a prominent change in <b>PP</b> <b>processing.</b> These results permit us to conclude that IBDV VP 4 has the ability to act according to structural and topographical changes during translational and posttranslational processes and allow multiple hit sites, which serve to increase effectiveness...|$|R

30|$|Mean aerobic {{plate count}} was {{calculated}} as 4.18  cfu/g {{which is less}} than 6.7  cfu/g obtained from a <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> in Morocco (Cohen et al. 2007). Significant difference was observed in aerobic plate counts and enterobacteriaceae counts of chicken between <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> and retail market at 0.006. Mean cfu/g[*]±[*]SD of 3.99 [*]±[*] 2.53 was obtained from <b>processing</b> <b>plant.</b> Although there were differences in Aerobic plate count and Enterobacteriaceae counts obtained between <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> and retail market, where APC were noted {{to be higher than}} ENT counts, counts are reflection of the general sanitary condition of the carcasses and basically at high levels than permitted on such food.|$|R
40|$|A <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> {{consists}} of massive parts including tanks, pipelines, processing columns, frames, and so on. This paper reports {{a method for}} automatically generating the landscape of a <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> from a 2 D sketch input and some control parameters. This is difficult to implement with conventional procedural methods. The {{results show that the}} landscapes of a <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> are satisfactorily represented, while some detailed parts, such as valves, steps, and branching pipelines, are not generated. The generated 3 D geometric data are useful for constructing background scenes in movies and video games, and are also applicable for pre-visualizing a landscape to construct a <b>processing</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Death losses among {{broilers}} {{transported to}} <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> {{are caused by}} poor welfare. The number of birds dying during transport and in <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> shortly after arrival there may serve {{as an indicator of}} the quality of welfare during loading and transport. In the Czech Republic, shipments of broilers to <b>processing</b> <b>plants</b> were monitored from 1997 to 2004. It was found that the mortality of broilers during transport was 0. 247 %, but it varied according to the transport distance to the <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> from 0. 146 % (50 km maximum) to 0. 862 % (> 300 km). The broiler mortality in transit was also influenced by the season of the year. The highest mortality was found in summer months, especially i...|$|R
