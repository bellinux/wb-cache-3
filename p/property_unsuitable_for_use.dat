5000|$|The {{market for}} new raw rubber or {{equivalent}} is large. The auto industry consumes a substantial fraction {{of natural and}} synthetic rubber. Reclaimed rubber has altered <b>properties</b> and is <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in many products, including tires. Tires and other vulcanized products are potentially amenable to [...] "devulcanization", but this technology has not produced material that can supplant unvulcanized materials. The main {{problem is that the}} carbon-sulfur linkages are not readily broken, without the input of costly reagents and heat. Thus, more than half of scrap rubber is simply burned for fuel.|$|R
50|$|Both {{pegylated}} interferon and ribavirin are <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in pregnancy and infancy: newer methods of treatment are urgently required.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, unlike {{cryptographic}} hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, {{which makes it}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in digital signatures.|$|R
5000|$|According to Cisco, [...] "Manchester {{encoding}} introduces {{some difficult}} frequency-related problems {{that make it}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> at higher data rates".|$|R
50|$|Until {{a decade}} ago, foam {{concrete}} has {{been regarded as}} weak and non-durable with high shrinkage characteristics. This {{is due to the}} unstable foam bubbles resulted in foam concrete having <b>properties</b> <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> producing very low density (Less than 300 kg/m³ dry density) as well as load bearing structural applications. It is therefore important to ensure that the air entrained into the foamed concrete is contained in stable at the same time very tiny uniform bubbles that remain intact and isolated, and do not thus increase the permeability of the cement paste between the voids.|$|R
5000|$|Recessed or {{enclosed}} luminaires {{that are}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with dichroic reflector lights {{can be identified}} by the IEC 60598 No Cool Beam symbol.|$|R
5000|$|Low {{planarity}} on vertical levelers {{may make}} this surface finish <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with fine pitch components. Improved planarity {{can be achieved}} using a horizontal leveler.|$|R
50|$|Italian designs {{proved to}} be <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in the Atlantic Ocean. Italian midget {{submarines}} were used in attacks against British shipping near the port of Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|Frost cracks often act as {{sites of}} entry for wood decay organisms, {{including}} insects, fungi and bacteria. Timber damaged {{in this way}} is <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in buildings, etc.|$|R
50|$|Metal {{water bottles}} can be heavier than their plastic {{counterparts}} and readily transfer temperature of contents to external surfaces, {{which makes them}} <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with unusually hot or cold liquids.|$|R
25|$|In {{time the}} keep was {{considered}} to be <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a gaol and its demolition began in 1787. The new gaol was finished in 1791 leaving no visible remains of the castle.|$|R
40|$|Friction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in forming processes of thermoplastic laminates. A model is currently developed to predict the frictional properties of these materials and validation experiments are being conducted. The development of a friction measurement rig for thermoplastic composites is not straightforward. Controlling the transverse pressure profile on the laminate is essential for accurate measurements. Mould deflections and the setup type used (pull-out versus pull-through) have a significant effect on homogeneity of the profile. This is validated by measurements of the pressure profile and analyses of the experimental setup. In turn, the inhomogeneity of the pressure profile can make the experimentally obtained friction <b>properties</b> <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> model validation...|$|R
50|$|Gel packs {{have been}} made with di{{ethylene}} glycol and ethylene glycol both of which can cause illness if ingested in large amounts, making them <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with food. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled such packs.|$|R
2500|$|High-temperature {{electrolysis}} {{has been}} demonstrated in a laboratory, at 108MJ (thermal) per kilogram of hydrogen produced, but not at a commercial scale. [...] In addition, this is lower-quality [...] "commercial" [...] grade Hydrogen, <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in fuel cells.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the pump}} only allows {{the lifting of}} water over a small height. Such an inhibiting factor makes it <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in water drainage or irrigation situations that require water to be lifted over larger heights.|$|R

25|$|The timber {{structure}} stood approximately 33 years, that is, until 1783. A {{report on}} the condition of the bridge in 1778 suggested that decay in the wooden frame made it <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> and it was dismantled five years later.|$|R
2500|$|The Hawaiian laulau {{traditionally}} contains pork, fish, and lu'au (cooked taro leaf). The wrapping is inedible ti leaves (Hawaiian: lau ki). [...] Cooked taro leaf has {{the consistency}} of cooked spinach and is therefore <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a wrapping.|$|R

50|$|The usual {{light source}} in these {{instruments}} {{is a high}} pressure, short-arc xenon lamp. Ordinary xenon arc lamps are <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in the low UV. Instead, specially constructed lamps with envelopes made from high-purity synthetic fused silica must be used.|$|R
50|$|The 1288 meter runway {{cannot be}} {{extended}} {{due to a}} gully {{at one end and}} a hill at the other. This limitation renders the airport <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by medium range jets. The Airport is under the management of GACL.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of fine scale {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) fibres has enabled advances in actuator and sensor applications, including devices for structural control such as the active fibre composite (AFC). Since PZT fibres form active elements within a functional device, fibre characterisation and optimisation is essential. Several commercially available fibres have been studied, which are representative of two dominant processing routes currently utilised: extrusion and suspension spinning. Fibres have been characterised in terms of morphology (shape factor and diameter variability), microstructure (grain size and porosity), and phase composition (XRD). Certain fibres were found to exhibit <b>properties</b> <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> AFC applications, which suggests that commercial production of fine scale PZT fibres may not yet be fully optimised...|$|R
25|$|Further, Cramer's {{rule has}} very poor {{numerical}} <b>properties,</b> making it <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.|$|R
50|$|The Class NG5 {{were all}} {{withdrawn}} from service when the narrow-gauge system in SWA was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960. Since they were <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in the Langkloof, all six 1922-vintage Class NG5 locomotives were sold as scrap in 1962.|$|R
50|$|The UK Royal Life Saving Society {{considers}} lifebuoys <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> {{in swimming}} pools because throwing one into a busy pool could injure the casualty or other pool users. In these locations, lifebuoys have been superseded by {{devices such as}} the torpedo buoy.|$|R
50|$|The {{glass tube}} of a mercury relay must be mounted near-vertically. Their {{sensitivity}} {{can be adjusted}} by adjusting their angle relative to vertical. As sensitivity depends upon angle, they are <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on mobile equipment or with conditions of high vibration.|$|R
30|$|Mixtures {{based on}} {{clopyralid}} with triclopyr gave the best selective control of potted broom plants up to 12  months old. Such mixtures will also preserve grass ground covers. Although fluroxypyr is <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by itself, {{it could be}} assessed in further work <b>for</b> <b>use</b> with clopyralid.|$|R
50|$|Test {{flights were}} halted on the 7 June 1940, just 10 {{days before the}} Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940. During the occupation the Red Army expressed interest in the C.6bis and test flew it, but they determined that it was <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Research Council has {{determined}} that sunscreens with oxybenzone are <b>unsuitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in young children, because {{children under the age}} of two years have not fully developed the enzymes that are believed break it down.
