40|$|The widely differing {{characteristics}} of <b>piece</b> <b>goods</b> often require a manual and labour-intensive handling within the material flow. Typical activities are order-picking and sorting {{with a high}} share of manual handling like decollating, gripping, moving, stacking, rearranging, loading, etc. Innovative gripper systems for the handling of <b>piece</b> <b>goods</b> offer new potentials for further automation. One gripper concept includes the direct transmission of friction forces into {{the surface of the}} object to be gripped and use of these forces, e. g. as gripping force. When the friction values are good and the elements are arranged correctly objects can be gripped frictionally when they can be approached only from above or from the side, e. g. boxes in a composite packaging pattern on a pallet...|$|R
