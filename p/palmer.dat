5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} <b>Palmer.</b> In United States v.

In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in <b>Palmer),</b> the Court distinguished <b>Palmer</b> again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished <b>Palmer</b> on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E

Bernard Davis, who ran Ziff-Davis's editorial department, attempted to hire Roger Sherman Hoar as editor; Hoar turned down the job but suggested Raymond A. <b>Palmer,</b> an active local science fiction fan. <b>Palmer</b> was hired that February, taking over editorial duties with the June 1938 issue. Ziff-Davis launched Fantastic Adventures, a fantasy companion to Amazing, in May 1939, also under Palmer's editorship. <b>Palmer</b> quickly managed to improve Amazing's circulation, and in November 1938, the magazine went monthly again, though this did not last throughout Palmer's tenure: between 1944 and 1946 the magazine was bimonthly and then quarterly {{for a while before}} returning to a longer-lasting monthly schedule.|$|E
