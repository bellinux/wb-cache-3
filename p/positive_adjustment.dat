40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} and synthesize qualitative {{literature on the}} experience of amputation and prosthesis use for adults, and to make recommendations based on these findings for rehabilitation services. Methods: A systematic search of three databases for qualitative research exploring the experience of amputation and prosthesis use for adults was undertaken. Included papers were evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality guidelines. Data were extracted and themes synthesized in accordance with accepted procedures for qualitative metasyntheses. Results: From the 15 papers (13 studies) included in there view, five concepts were identified: (i) Becoming an amputee and facing prosthesis use; (ii) Adjustment to and coping with amputation and prosthesis use; (iii) The role of valued relationships in recovery; (iv) Amputation and prosthesis use in social interaction; and (v) Prosthetically enabled identities. Conclusions: The findings provide a base from which to make suggestions regarding the provision of health rehabilitation services for this population. It is recommended that such services make greater use of psychological interventions and education, include patients’ social support networks, use psychotherapy to support and develop positive coping strategies, and facilitate peer support from those who have already made <b>positive</b> <b>adjustments</b> to amputation and prosthesis use. Implications for Rehabilitation Amputation of a limb and subsequent prosthesis use present major physical, psychological and social challenges.

These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dąbrowski called negative adjustment) and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dąbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our status quo and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated hierarchical value structure (called <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment).</b> This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dąbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be—how the world ought to be.

50|$|Humor {{used as a}} {{positive}} coping strategy may have useful benefits to emotional and mental health well-being. By having a humorous outlook on life, stressful experiences can be and are often minimized. This coping strategy corresponds with positive emotional states and {{is known to be}} an indicator of mental health. Physiological processes are also influenced within the exercise of humor. For example, laughing may reduce muscle tension, increase the flow of oxygen to the blood, exercise the cardiovascular region, and produce endorphins in the body. Using humor in coping while processing through feelings can vary depending on life circumstance and individual humor styles. In regards to grief and loss in life occurrences, it has been found that genuine laughs/smiles when speaking about the loss predicted later adjustment and evoked more positive responses from other people. A person of the deceased family member may resort to making jokes of when the deceased person used to give unwanted “wet willies” (term used for when a person sticks their finger inside their mouth then inserts the finger into another person's ear) to any unwilling participant. A person might also find comedic relief with others around irrational possible outcomes for the deceased funeral service. It is also possible that humor would be used by people to feel a sense of control over a more powerless situation and used as way to temporarily escape a feeling of helplessness. Exercised humor can be a sign of <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> as well as drawing support and interaction from others around the loss.|$|E
40|$|In the main, {{resilience}} literature explains <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> to adversity in {{ways that}} are biased towards western culture. Although studies of resilience among African Americans have reported the importance of kinship, a typically Africentric concept, no studies have explored how family communities promote youths’ <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment,</b> particularly in contexts of poverty. Family communities are a feature of traditional African culture and comprise extended family members, both alive and deceased. We draw on 14 case studies to illustrate how <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> to poverty was facilitated by appreciative attachment to this community. Each case comprised a resilient black South African student who had adjusted well to the complex challenges associated with poverty. An inductive comparison of their resilience processes, as recounted by each participant in narrative and visual form, demonstrated how their <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> was supported by resilience-supporting transactions within their family community. Specifically, expectation-dominated and example-focused transactions, arising from the family community’s accentuation of mutuality, supported resilience. As such, we conclude that black youth resilience follows communal pathways as emphasised by Africentric culture, in general, and kinship systems, in particular, but urge continued critical investigation of the influence of family communities on youths’ resilience.

40|$|MEd, Learner support, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and understand the social-ecological resources which encouraged resilient Basotho youth in the rural areas of the Thabo Mofutsanyana district of the Free State province towards <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the face of poverty and underdevelopment. <b>Positive</b> <b>adjustment,</b> or resilience, is the focus of the International Community-University Research Alliance (ICURA) and International Development Research Centre (IDRC) funded project, called Pathways to Resilience. My study forms part of this broader resilience study. Resilience, or <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> to hardship, can be defined as the capacity of individuals to navigate their way to health-promoting resources that encourage <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and the concomitant capacity of the individual’s family, community and culture to provide these health resources and experiences in culturally meaningful ways. Recently, researchers have suggested that the socio-ecological resources that encourage <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment</b> might differ across ecologies. There is little understanding in South Africa of which resources, within specific ecologies, encourage such <b>positive</b> <b>adjustment.</b> My study seeks to address this gap, with specific reference to Basotho youth in the Thabo Mofutsanyana district in the Free State. I used a qualitative phenomenological strategy of inquiry and participatory visual methods to determine the socio-ecological antecedents of the resilience of 130 resilient Basotho youth from rural areas of the Thabo Mofutsanyana district in the Free State province of South Africa. Using Bronfenbrenner‟s Ecological Systems Theory (1979), Sameroff‟s Transactional Model of Development (2009) and Unger’s Social Ecology of Resilience (2011) as framework, I explored the resources underpinning the resilience of my participants. The findings suggest that the resilient Basotho youth in this study were encouraged to adjust well to the risks of poverty and associated threats by making use of social-ecologically accessible resilience-promoting resources. In other words the resilient Basotho youth found resilience-promoting resources in their microsystems (individual, family, school, peers and nature and pets), mesosystems (social interactions), exosystems (community resources like libraries and medical facilities, and role models) and macrosystems (religious beliefs and practices, pastors, and access to information through television, radio, cell phone, and inspirational publications). The conclusion of my study lays emphasis on the interwovenness of socioecological systems in resilience processes: no one system could be sing led out. The entire ecosystem was involved, reciprocally, in providing the participants with resilience-promoting resources. My findings emphasise the importance of mothers, grandmothers, school and educational resources, religious beliefs and practices, and access to information (through the use of television, radio, computer and inspirational literature) for Basotho youth in the Thabo Mofutsanyana district, but do not suggest that these are the sole pathways to their resilience. Continued research in other parts of South Africa, with additional groups of youth, is needed to reach a comprehensive understanding of the socio-ecological antecedents of resilience among South African youth.
