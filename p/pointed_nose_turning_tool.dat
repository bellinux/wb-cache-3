40|$|The {{requirements}} {{of this investigation}} were to determine optimum tool geometry and cutting conditions for turning Ultra High Strength Alloy Steel (fully heat treated to 120 tons per sq. ins.). The material {{will be used for}} bolts, whose screw threads will be produced by thread rolling. Dimensional accuracy required on the blanks is 0. 0002 ". The material in the above state presents extremely severe conditions, especially on the <b>nose</b> of the <b>turning</b> <b>tool,</b> and results in rapid wear and loss of dimensional accuracy. Application of cutting coolants or lubricants made no measurable improvement on tool nose wear, benefits gained from the use of coolants being confined to reduction of flank wear...|$|R
40|$|Within {{manufacturing}} of metallic components, machining {{plays an}} important role and is of vital significance to ensure process reliability. From a cutting tool design perspective,  tool macro geometry  design  based on physics based  numerical modelling  is highly needed  that can predict chip morphology.   The chip morphology describes the chip shape geometry and the chip curl geometry. The prediction of chip flow and chip shape is vital in predicting chip breakage, ensuring good chip evacuation and lower surface roughness.   To this end, a platform where such a  numerical model’s chip morphology prediction  can be compared with experimental investigation is needed and is the focus of this work. The studied cutting processes are orthogonal cutting process and <b>nose</b> <b>turning</b> process. Numerical models that simulate the chip formation process are employed to predict the chip morphology and are accompanied by machining experiments. Computed tomography is used  to scan the chips obtained from machining experiments and its ability to capture the variation in  chip morphology  is evaluated.   For <b>nose</b> <b>turning</b> process,  chip  curl parameters during the cutting process are to be calculated. Kharkevich model is utilized in this regard to calculate the  ‘chip in process’ chip curl parameters. High speed videography is used to measure the chip side flow angle during the cutting process experiments and are directly compared to physics based model predictions. The results show that the methodology developed provides  the framework where advances in numerical models can be evaluated reliably from a chip morphology prediction capability view <b>point</b> for <b>nose</b> <b>turning</b> process. The numerical modeling results show that the chip morphology variation for varying cutting conditions is predicted qualitatively. The results of quantitative evaluation of chip morphology prediction shows that the error in prediction is too large to be used for predictive modelling purposes...|$|R
