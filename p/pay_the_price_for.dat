25|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} copy a concept from Stockholm, where the trams were run fast and frequently without trailers. However, Oslo Sporveier soon decided to prioritize operating costs and instead run trams and trailers. At first the company operated Class SS trailers, but these proved unsuitable {{in combination with the}} MBOs. Oslo Sporveier was not willing to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> new trailers and therefore chose a combination whereby new bodies were built atop existing undercarriages. Two such contractions were built at Sagene Depot in 1953, designated TO52 and the first unit can into revenue service on 23 November. A major issue with the trailers were doors which would not shut properly, often resulting with the trams running with open doors.|$|E
25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E
25|$|Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer {{liquidated}} the Quilon bank, {{and sealed}} off Malayala Manorama the leading news paper for criticizing the divan. Abraham Mar Thoma spoke about these notorious acts and visited {{those who were}} jailed by him. He further visited the Maharaja of Travancore and complaint about Divans tyrannical rule. Marthoma church at this point passed a church resolution against Divan and independent Travancore which infuriated the divan and ordered for the Metropolitans arrest and imprisonment. However the arrest order was not executed. It was all done at a point of time when other churches and communities of Travancore praised divan or feared to utter a word against the divan. Later the Marthoma church had to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> that social action. The land allotted {{in the heart of}} Thiruvananthapuram to construct a church by Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was taken back. Marthoma church was selectively targeted by Divan, by not giving permissions for construction of cemeteries and new church buildings.|$|E

500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from {{when she was still}} a little girl, was due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was an important element of the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E
500|$|Gather Together {{retains the}} {{freshness}} of Caged Bird, but has a self-consciousness absent from the first volume. Author Hilton Als states that Angelou [...] "replaces the language of social history with the language of therapy". The book exhibits the narcissism and self-involvement of young adults. It is Rita who is the focus, and all other characters are secondary, and they are often presented [...] "with the deft superficiality of a stage description" [...] who <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> Rita's self-involvement. Much of Angelou's writing in this volume, as Als states, is [...] "reactive, not reflective". [...] Angelou chooses to demonstrate Rita's narcissism in Gather Together by dropping the conventional forms of autobiography, which has a beginning, middle, and end. For example, there is no central experience in her second volume, {{as there is in}} Caged Bird with Angelou's account of her rape at the age of eight. Lupton believes that this central experience is relocated [...] "to some luminous place in a volume yet to be".|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to have the character of X killed off in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was made {{at the end of}} the third season. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> collaborating with Mulder. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the fourth season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as [...] "a cheap TV thing". However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an [...] "obligatory" [...] move to have Scully follow suit.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{when two}} University of South Florida {{students}} were arrested on explosives charges in South Carolina, Bedier {{was at the}} forefront of calling for a fair trial and due process. Bedier knew one of the students, Youssef Megahed, casually. For some of his critics, this is proof that he is a terrorist in sheep’s clothing. When the facts are reviewed, they reveal that Bedier had no connections with the man who was convicted, and the man he knew casually was found innocent on all charges. In an interview with the Tampa Tribune, Bedier stated that the video produced by Ahmed Mohamed showing how to make a remote detonator was unacceptable. Mohamed [...] "was sent here on a scholarship to do a doctorate in engineering and not to make videos, and now he's going to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, {{more than}} a {{thousand}} academics signed a petition criticizing Turkey's military crackdown on ethnic Kurdish towns and neighbourhoods in the east of the country, such as Sur (a district of Diyarbakır), Silvan, Nusaybin, Cizre and Silopi, and asking an end to violence. Erdoğan accused those who signed the petition of [...] "terrorist propaganda", calling them [...] "the darkest of people". He called for action by institutions and universities, stating, [...] "Everyone who benefits from this state but is now an enemy of the state must be punished without further delay." [...] Within days, over 30 of the signatories were arrested, many in dawn-time raids on their homes. Although all were quickly released, nearly half were fired from their jobs, eliciting a denunciation from Turkey's Science Academy for such [...] "wrong and disturbing" [...] treatment. Erdoğan vowed that the academics would <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> [...] "falling into a pit of treachery".|$|E
2500|$|The Palestinian radicals' secularism and {{behaviour}} had alienated the traditionalist Shi'ite community; the Shi'a {{did not want}} to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the PLO's rocket attacks from Southern Lebanon. The PLO created a state within a state in South Lebanon and this instigated a fury among Lebanon's Shi'a, who feared a retaliation from the Israelis to their native land in the South. The Shiʿa predominated in the area of southern Lebanon that in the 1960s became an arena for Israel-Palestinian conflict. The state of Lebanon, which always avoided provoking Israel, simply abandoned southern Lebanon. Many of the people there migrated to the suburbs of Beirut, which are known as [...] "poverty belts". The young Shi'a migrants, who had not participated in the prosperity of prewar Beirut, joined many Lebanese and some Palestinian organizations. After many years without their own independent political organizations, there suddenly arose Musa Sadr's Amal Movement in 1974–75. Its Islamist ideology immediately attracted the unrepresented people, and Amal's armed ranks grew rapidly. Amal fought against the PLO in the early days. Later a hard line faction would break away to join with Shi'a groups fighting Israel to form the organization Hezbollah, also known as the National Resistance, who to this day remains the most powerful and organised force of Lebanon and the Middle East. Hezbollah was created as a faction split from Amal Movement, and an Islamist organization which deemed Amal to be too secular. Hezbollah's original aims included the establishment of an Islamic state in Lebanon.|$|E

6000|$|You, {{little sister}} doll, were the heroine. You {{lived in the}} white-washed cottage, all {{honeysuckle}} and clematis without--earwiggy and damp within, maybe. How pretty you always looked in your simple, neatly-fitting print dress. How good you were! How nobly you bore your poverty. How patient you were under your many wrongs. You never harboured an evil thought, a revengeful wish--never, little doll? Were there never moments when you longed to play the wicked woman's part, live {{in a room with}} many doors, be-clad in furs and jewels, with lovers galore at your feet? In those long winter evenings? the household work is done--the greasy dishes washed, the floor scrubbed; the excellent child is asleep in the corner; the one-and-elevenpenny lamp sheds its dismal light on the darned table-cloth; you sit, busy at your coarse sewing, waiting for Hero Dick, knowing--guessing, at least, where he is--! Yes, dear, I remember your fine speeches, when you told her, in stirring language the gallery cheered to the echo, what you thought of her and of such women as she; when, lifting your hand to heaven, you declared you were happier in your attic, working your fingers to the bone, than she in her gilded salon--I think [...] "gilded salon" [...] was the term, was it not?--furnished by sin. But speaking of yourself, weak little sister doll, not of your fine speeches, the gallery listening, did you not, in your secret heart, envy her? Did you never, before blowing out the one candle, stand for a minute in front of the cracked glass, and think to yourself that you, too, would look well in low-cut dresses from Paris, the diamonds flashing on your white smooth skin? Did you never, toiling home through the mud, bearing your bundle of needlework, feel bitter with the wages of virtue, as she splashed you, passing by in her carriage? Alone, over your cup of weak tea, did you never feel tempted to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> champagne suppers, and gaiety, and admiration? Ah, yes, it is easy for folks who have had their good time, to prepare copybooks for weary little inkstained fingers, longing for play. The fine maxims sound such cant when we are in that mood, do they not? You, too, were young and handsome: did the author of the play think you were never hungry for the good things of life? Did he think that reading tracts to crotchety old women was joy to a full-blooded girl in her twenties? Why should SHE have all the love, and all the laughter? How fortunate that the villain, the Wicked Baronet, never opened the cottage door at that moment, eh, dear! He always came when you were strong, when you felt that you could denounce him, and scorn his temptations. Would that the villain came to all of us at such time; then we would all, perhaps, be heroes and heroines.|$|E
