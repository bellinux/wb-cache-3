50|$|The {{process of}} {{moulting}} in birds is as follows: First, the bird begins to shed some old <b>feathers,</b> then <b>pin</b> <b>feathers</b> grow in {{to replace the}} old <b>feathers.</b> As the <b>pin</b> <b>feathers</b> become full feathers, other feathers are shed. This is a cyclical process that occurs in many phases. It is usually symmetrical, with feather loss equal {{on each side of}} the body. Because feathers make up 4-12% of a bird's body weight, it takes a large amount of energy to replace them. For this reason, moults often occur immediately after the breeding season, but while food is still abundant. The plumage produced during this time is called postnuptial plumage. Prenuptial moulting occurs in red-collared widowbirds where the males replace their nonbreeding plumage with breeding plumage. It is thought that large birds can advance the moult of severely damaged feathers.|$|R

Feathers are dead structures at maturity which are gradually abraded {{and need to}} be replaced. Adult birds moult at least once a year, although many moult twice and a few three times each year. It is generally a slow process, as birds rarely shed all their feathers at any one time; the bird must retain sufficient feathers to regulate its body temperature and repel moisture. The number and area of feathers that are shed varies. In some moulting periods, a bird may renew only the feathers on the head and body, shedding the wing and tail feathers during a later moulting period.

25|$|For most of history, turkeys were {{primarily}} raised on small family farms for meat {{and as a}} form of pest control (turkeys are prodigious eaters of insects). But with the advent of factory farming of poultry, turkeys began to be selectively bred for increasingly larger size, focusing especially on the production of breast meat.

The favorite breed at the time was the Broad Breasted Bronze, which was developed from the Standard Bronze. In the 1960s producers began to heavily favor turkeys that did not show the dark <b>pin</b> <b>feathers</b> in their carcass, and thus the Broad Breasted White grew to dominate the industry, a trend which continues to this day.|$|R
40|$|Feather holes have {{traditionally}} been suggested to be feeding traces of chewing lice (mallophagans). There is controversy whether mallophagans are the real source of feather holes. We studied mallophagan infestations and holes in tail feathers of 528 rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta collected 2007 – 2012 in northeast Iceland. Three mallophagans were found, Amyrsidea lagopi (prevalence 13 %), Goniodes lagopi (72 %) and Lagopoecus affinis (51 %). The prevalence of feather holes was 15 % and based on pattern the holes could be separated into two groups termed feather hole swarms (FHS), prevalence 9 %, and single holes (SH), prevalence 6 %. Holes for FHS were concentrated in the central tail feathers and decreased outwards, but holes for SH did not show any such pattern. There was a significant positive relationship {{between the number of}} holes for FHS birds and A. lagopi number, and the prevalence was similar. No other combinations of FHS or SH and the mallophagans indicated any relationship. The observed differences between FHS and SH suggest that feather holes have different origin. Our thesis based on known feeding habits of amblycerans like A. lagopi is that the holes in FHS are created during the <b>pin</b> <b>feather</b> stage when the lice bite the <b>pin</b> <b>feather</b> to draw blood. The holes in FHS were often in lines parallel to the feather shaft and the distance between adjacent holes was similar to the daily growth band, and where apparent the holes were sitting in the light portion of the band suggesting diurnal rhythm in lice feeding activity. Concluding, feather holes in ptarmigan may have various origins, but there is a clear correlation between the presence and numbers of A. lagopi and FHS. This is a novel finding for the grouse family and the genus Amyrsidea and should be a valuable contribution to the studies of feather hole formation.

2500|$|A bird's {{feathers}} undergo {{wear and}} tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or <b>pin</b> <b>feathers,</b> depending {{on the stage of}} growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance.
