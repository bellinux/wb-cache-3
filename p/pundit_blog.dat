Winn bankrolled the {{production}} of a song he wrote entitled “God Believes in You.” He hired his own radio promoter and the song rose to # 23 on Billboard’s Hot Gospel Songs chart and earned him a contract with Shanachie Entertainment. Aside from the track “Moving Forward,” Winn wrote all of the material and brought in guest artists such as Vanessa Bell Armstrong, DeWayne Woods, Jonathan Nelson and Myron Butler for the ensuing “Balance” CD. The contemporary gospel album received high marks in the gospel community upon its autumn 2009 release. “It’s an impressive” debut,” E.J. Gaines wrote on the Gospel <b>Pundit</b> <b>blog.</b> Gospelflava.com’s Gerard Bronner called it, “worth the wait.” ...|$|E

Social Reader {{is an example of}} Casual Information Visualization, and aims to help the user understand and explore blog-based social networks in a daily, real-life setting.

40|$|Metadata onlyPurpose – To {{demonstrate}} how blog searching {{can be used}} as a retrospective source of public opinion. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper a variety of blog searching techniques are described and illustrated with a case study of the Danish cartoons affair. Findings - A time series analysis of related blog postings suggests that the Danish cartoons issue attracted little attention in the English-speaking world for four months after the initial publication of the cartoons, exploding only after the simultaneous start of diplomatic sanctions and a commercial boycott. Research limitations/implications – Blogs only reveal the opinions of bloggers, and blog analysis is language-specific. Sections of the world and the population of individual countries that do not have access to the internet will not be adequately represented in blogspace. Moreover, bloggers are self-selected and probably not representative of internet users. Originality/value - The existence of blog search engines now allows researchers to search blogspace for posts relating to any given debate, seeking either the opinions of <b>blogging</b> <b>pundits</b> or casual mentions in personal journals. It is possible to use blogs to examine topics before they first attracted mass media attention, as well as to dissect ongoing discussions. This gives a retrospective source of public opinion that is unique to blog search engines...|$|R
