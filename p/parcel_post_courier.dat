50|$|Domestic <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> {{service was}} adopted in 1913, 25 {{years after the}} Post Office had agreed to deliver {{international}} <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> packages pursuant to the Universal Postal Union treaty and various bilateral agreements with other nations. Initially, there were no or few postal regulations governing packages mailed by <b>parcel</b> <b>post.</b> E.g., to construct a bank in Vernal, Utah, in 1916, a Salt Lake City company ascertained that the cheapest way to send 40 tons of bricks to the building was by <b>parcel</b> <b>post.</b>|$|R
25|$|Special stamps {{were printed}} for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service {{to help in}} the effort of keeping {{accounts}} and revenues generated from general postage and the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> separate. The twelve <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps had three basic design themes that were associated with the Post Office and its delivery service. The denominations were such that any amount of postage up to one dollar could be made by using no more than three stamps. Three of the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> denominations—20 cents, 25 cents and 75 cents—were new to U. S. Postage.|$|R
25|$|With the {{termination}} of <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps the need for <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Postage Due stamps also ended. They had seen little use since most parcels were properly weighed and paid for at post offices. But in a way analogous to the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> issues they were retained by postmasters and used as regular postage due stamps until the supplies were exhausted. Some were employed well into the 1920s. The 25-cent denomination was of particular use {{since there was no}} correspondingly valued regular postage due stamp.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} in 1913, in January, that the Post Office {{introduced}} domestic <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> service (a belated development, given that international <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious {{that none of these}} stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> series—20¢ - had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¢ stamp.|$|R
50|$|Terminal Railway Post Offices (Term RPO) {{were started}} in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, {{primarily}} to help handle {{the increase in}} volume of <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit <b>parcel</b> <b>post,</b> circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals {{to take care of}} advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few terminals handled <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> almost exclusively. The largest terminal railway post office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York—in 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> almost exclusively. Because <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, First Class Mail was {{restructured}} {{to include}} variable pricing based on size, {{not just on}} weight. Shape-based postage pricing {{is a form of}} dimensional weight. Also at that time, International <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> air service was re-branded as Priority Mail International, and <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> surface service was discontinued for international destinations.|$|R

50|$|In May 2007, the USPS {{restructured}} international service {{names to}} correspond with domestic shipping options. Formerly, USPS International services were categorized as Airmail (Letter <b>Post),</b> Economy (Surface) <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post,</b> Airmail <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post,</b> Global Priority, Global Express, and Global Express Guaranteed Mail. The former Airmail (Letter Post) is now First-Class Mail International, and includes small packages weighing up to four pounds (1.8 kg). Economy <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> was discontinued for international service, while Airmail <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> was replaced by Priority Mail International. Priority Mail International Flat-Rate packaging in various sizes was introduced, with the same conditions of service previously used for Global Priority. Global Express is now Express Mail International, while Global Express Guaranteed is unchanged. The international mailing classes with a tracking ability are Express, Express Guaranteed, and Priority (except that tracking is not available for Priority Mail International Flat Rate Envelopes or Priority Mail International Small Flat Rate Boxes).|$|R

Hitchcock in 1913, greatly increased the volume of mail shipped nationwide, and motivated {{the development of more}} efficient postal transportation systems. Many rural customers took advantage of inexpensive <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> rates to order goods and products from businesses located hundreds of miles away in distant cities for delivery by mail. From the 1910s to the 1960s, many college students and others used <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> to mail home dirty laundry, as doing so was less expensive than washing the clothes themselves.|$|R

50|$|The British {{domestic}} <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> {{service was}} established on 1 August 1883. Commonwealth and foreign <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> services were also established. The eight Australasian colonies (South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, New Zealand, British New Guinea and Fiji) {{and the other}} separate postal services of the colonies joined the UPU in 1891. By 1909/10, over 118 million parcels annually were being carried in the U.K., around 2.5% of which were international.|$|R

International <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> service was replaced by First-class Mail International service for parcels up to four pounds. For heavier parcels and/or printed matter, Priority Mail International, Priority Mail International Flat-Rate, Express Mail International, Airmail M-Bags, and Global Express Guaranteed service is available to foreign countries allowing these types of mail delivery.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> may be {{credited}} to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In {{the first year after}} the establishment of the domestic <b>parcel</b> <b>post</b> in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular postage items, whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The new stamps were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas. Partly owing to some confusion involving their usage, their exclusive use as <b>Parcel</b> <b>Post</b> stamps proved short lived, as regular postage stamps were soon allowed {{to be used to}} pay parcel postage rates.|$|R
