5|$|Long's {{tenure in}} Congress was uneventful, since the Congress was under Democratic Party {{control for the}} six years he served.

In 1886 Long married again, to Agnes Pierce, a teacher and daughter of a Universalist minister; they had one son, born in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Quarry House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and <b>Pensions</b> <b>and</b> is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 January 2009 {{same-sex}} couples {{have had the}} same access to military retirement <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> superannuation as opposite-sex couples. Transgender personnel are also permitted to serve in the ADF, and are provided with support when necessary. The ADF has permitted a contingent of gay and lesbian personnel to march together in the Sydney Mardi Gras since 2008, and from 2013 these personnel have been authorised to wear their uniforms during the parade.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), {{which provides a}} comprehensive federal scheme for the regulation of employee <b>pension</b> <b>and</b> welfare benefit plans offered by employers. While ERISA does not require an employer to offer <b>pension</b> <b>and</b> welfare benefits, it does mandate compliance with its provisions if such benefits are offered. Congress enacted ERISA to eliminate the conflicting and inconsistent regulation of <b>pension</b> <b>and</b> employee welfare benefit plans by state laws. The provisions at issue in the preemption debate are sections 502 (a) and 514 (a) of ERISA...|$|R
5|$|Boycott {{told the}} BBC in 1965 that {{he chose to}} leave school at 17 because he no longer wished to be a {{financial}} strain on his parents, and {{because he wanted to}} pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of <b>Pensions</b> <b>and</b> National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, at the same time playing for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team, and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation's Under-18 team, and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire's County Cricket team committee.|$|E

5|$|In December 1946, the {{government}} of Camille Huysmans inaugurated a medal to be awarded to {{former members of the}} resistance and bestowed various other benefits on other members, including <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> a scheme of state-funded apprenticeships. Individuals were accorded military rank equivalent to their status in the movement during the war, entitling them to title and other privileges. Today the role of the resistance during the conflict is commemorated by memorials, plaques and road names across the country, {{as well as by the}} National Museum of the Resistance in Anderlecht.|$|E

5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced his budget. The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensionersâ€”effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|Obama held {{assignments}} on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.

He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs. As {{a member of the}} Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.|$|E

5|$|One of {{her first}} acts in the post was to help launch an Irish Council for Civil Liberties booklet {{offering}} advice to older people on their rights concerning retirement, access to health and community care, <b>pensions,</b> <b>and</b> elder abuse. Shortly after this she was faced with one {{of her first}} major tasks when she was called on {{to play a role in}} helping to wind up the affairs of Console, a suicide bereavement counselling charity, after the organisation was plunged into crisis by a scandal involving the misuse of funds. McEntee worked with the charity's chief executive to ensure the services it provided would continue to be available. Console's functions were taken over by Pieta House in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, {{making the}} 1892 {{election}} a rematch {{of the one}} four years earlier. The tariff revisions {{of the past four}} years had made imported goods so expensive that now many voters shifted to the reform position. Many westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to the new Populist Party candidate, James Weaver, who promised free silver, generous veterans' <b>pensions,</b> <b>and</b> an eight-hour work day. The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike rebounded against the Republicans as well, although the federal government did not take action.|$|E

5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, <b>pensions,</b> <b>and</b> other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age <b>pensions</b> <b>and</b> payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|While in Congress, Ferraro focused {{much of her}} {{legislative}} {{attention on}} equity {{for women in the}} areas of wages, <b>pensions,</b> <b>and</b> retirement plans. She was a cosponsor of the 1981 Economic Equity Act. On the House Select Committee on Aging, she concentrated on the problems of elderly women. In 1984, she championed a pension equity law revision that would improve the benefits of people who left work for long periods and then returned, a typical case for women with families. The Reagan administration, at first lukewarm to the measure, decided to sign it to gain the benefits of its popular appeal.|$|E
