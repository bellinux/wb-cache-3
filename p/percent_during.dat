However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 <b>percent</b> <b>during</b> the active season.

A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E

Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (this department alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 <b>percent</b> <b>during</b> 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent.

5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens.

The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 <b>percent</b> <b>during</b> the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E

25|$|Chennai Port lies {{on a flat}} {{coastal plain}} known as the Eastern Coastal Plains {{on the east coast}} of the Indian {{peninsula}} known as the Coromandel Coast in the Bay of Bengal. The bed slope is fairly flat. The port is situated on the thermal equator and is also coastal, which prevents extreme variation in seasonal temperature. The climate is tropical, specifically tropical wet and dry, and for most of the year, the weather is hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from a maximum of 42°C in May to a minimum of 18°C in January. The mean minimum temperature is 18°C in January and 26.8°C in May. The mean highest temperature is 29.3°C in December and 39.6°C in May. The port gets most of its seasonal rainfall from the northeast monsoon winds, from mid-September to mid-December. Occasionally, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal hit the coast. The average annual rainfall in the region is about 1298.11mm, with 443.5mm during southwest monsoon (June–September), 753.1mm during northeast monsoon (October–December), 37.3mm during winter season (January–February) and 64.2mm during hot weather (March–May). The monthly average varies from 7mm in April to 308mm in November.

Our work thus allows to clearly distinguish different phenomena: bifurcation which is a ponctual event which occurs before the peak, localization which is a process that covers a range of deformation of several <b>percents</b> <b>during</b> which the peak occurs and finally stationary shear bands which are well-defined permanent structures that can be observed {{at the end of the}} localization process, after the peak...|$|R

Methods: The sample included 213 men (31. 1 %) and women (68. 9 %) with an average age of 76. 53 years. Results: The predictor variables accounted for 10 % of the variance in <b>percent</b> attendance <b>during</b> adoption and transition, respectively. Adding <b>percent</b> attendance <b>during</b> adoption to the prediction of <b>percent</b> attendance <b>during</b> transition increased the explained variance in this phase to 21 %. During maintenance, the predictors accounted for 13 % of the variance in frequency of physical activity; this estimate increased to 46 % when adding in percent attendance from the transition phase. Discussion: These results are encouraging in that the physical activity intervention appears to have been well tolerated by diverse subgroups of older adults.
