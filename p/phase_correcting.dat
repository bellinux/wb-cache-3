50|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} Fresnel zoneplate antennas, one can divide each Fresnel zone into several sub-zones, such as quarter-wave sub-zones, and provide an appropriate phase shift in each of them, thus resulting in a sub-zone <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> zoneplate 5. The problem with dielectric based zoneplate lens antenna is that whilst a dielectric is providing a phase shift to the transmitted wave, it inevitably reflects some of the energy back, so the efficiency of such a lens is limited. However, the low efficiency problem for a zoneplate reflector is less severe, as total reflection can achieved by using a conducting reflector behind the zoneplate. Based on the focal field analysis, it is demonstrated that high efficiency zoneplate reflectors {{can be obtained by}} employing the multilayer <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> technique, which is to use a number of dielectric slabs of low permittivity and print different metallic zonal patterns on the different interfaces. The design and experiments of circular and offset multilayer <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> zoneplate reflectors were presented in 5.|$|E

50|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> {{reflective}} array {{consists of}} an array of phase shifting elements illuminated by a feed placed at the focal point. The word “reflective” refers {{to the fact that}} each phase shifting element reflects back the energy in the incident wave with an appropriate phase shift. The phase shifting elements can be passive or active. Each phase shifting element can be designed to either produce a phase shift which is equal to that required at the element centre, or provide some quantised phase shifting values. Although the former {{does not seem to be}} commercially attractive, the latter proved to be practical antenna configuration. One potential advantage is that such an array can be reconfigured by changing the positions of the elements to produce different radiation patterns. A systematic theory of the phase efficiency of passive <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> array antennas and experimental results on an X-band prototype were reported in 3. In recent years, it became common to call this type of antennas “reflectarrays”.|$|E

50|$|A {{problem with}} the {{multilayer}} zoneplate reflector is the complexity introduced, which might offset the advantage of using Fresnel zoneplate antennas. One solution is to print an inhomogeneous array of conducting elements on a grounded dielectric plate, thus leading to the so-called single-layer printed flat reflector 2. This configuration bears {{much in common with}} the printed array antenna but it requires the use of a feed antenna instead of a corporate feed network. In contract to the normal array antenna, the array elements are different and are arranged in a pseudo-periodic manner. The theory and design method of single layer printed flat reflectors incorporating conducting rings and experimental results on such an antenna operating in the X-band were given in 2.

Conclusion. This thesis investigates the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm {{for performance}} improvement of the electromagnetic band gap resonator antennas (ERAs) with a significantly less computational cost compared to other methods. Our recent investigations into aperture field phase distribution of ERAs indicates that the phase distribution is quite non-uniform for conventional ERAs, resulting in poor quality of radiation patterns and below-optimal directivity. A PSO algorithm is implemented to design two <b>phase</b> <b>correcting</b> structures (PCSs), one made from all dialectric heights and the other made from triple printed layers. A performance comparison between the proposed PSO algorithm and the embedded optimizer in CST Microwave Studio (CST MWS) revealed that the proposed PSO algorithm reached the final design fourteen {{times faster than the}} built-in PSO optimizer in CST MWS. The all-dialectric PCS designed by PSO has significantly enhanced the phase uniformity of the ERA, improving radiation patterns by 4. 6 dB in peak directivity. Following this approach, a printed PCS was designed by the PSO algorithm to achieve a planar structure. The use of PSO resulted in creating the printed PCS by 2480 unit-cell simulations. On the other hand, to design such a PCS by parametric sweep, 729, 000 unit-cell simulations are required. The printed PCS greatly outperforms its dialectric counterpart in terms of phase uniformity and radiation patterns. Aperture efficiency increased by almost ten times and the peak directivity also improved by 9. 6 dB compared to the ERA without PCS. In the end, a low-profile bandpass frequency selective surface (FSS) was designed using the PSO algorithm to verify the versatility of the proposed algorithm in designing various electromagnetic devices. Such FSS can also be designed by the parametric sweep at a significantly higher computational cost. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xx, 61 pages) illustrations (some colour...|$|E
