25|$|Soil liquefaction. In {{the cases}} where the soil {{consists}} of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> of sufficient magnitude and compact, liquefaction of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform settlements and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the 1964 earthquake.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of a deep}} excavation {{is especially}} influenced by the strength and deformability of the soil located {{in front of the}} retaining walls, below the bottom of the excavation. In fine-grained, low-permeability soils, it is usually assumed that the excavation is carried out in undrained conditions, resulting in a significant decrease of the <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures.</b> This effect is beneficial, because the effective stresses are kept nearly at their initial values, but has a transient nature: depending on the problem layout, on the soil permeability and on the rapidity of the construction process, the negative excess pore pressure may dissipate in a time span comparable to that needed to complete the construction. For design purposes, it is essential to consider reasonable values of the <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures,</b> to ensure a satisfactory performance of the construction avoiding at the same time excessive conservatism. This paper illustrates the results of a parametric study, in which finite-element analyses were carried out to evaluate the excess <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> induced by excava-tions and to asses the effects of their variation with time. The mechanical behaviour of the clayey soils was described using a constitutive model based on hardening plasticity, that is reasonably accurate in simulating the generation of excess <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> in undrained conditions. The results of this study are used to provide practical indications about the values of excess <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> to be considered for design...|$|R

25|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. Stability {{is determined by the}} balance of shear stress and shear strength. A previously stable slope may be initially affected by preparatory factors, making the slope conditionally unstable. Triggering factors of a slope failure can be climatic events which can then make a slope unstable, leading to mass movements. Mass movements can be caused by increase in shear stress, such as loading, lateral pressure, and transient forces. Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure,</b> and organic material.|$|E

25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy.

Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E

Cyclic triaxial testing on soft clay samples with vertical drains has been carried out using a large scale cyclic triaxial apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong. The samples used were 300 mm in diameter and 600 mm in height. The samples were anisotropically consolidated under ko condition to simulate the in-situ stress history of the field.

2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). <b>Pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E
2500|$|Real life {{failures}} in naturally deposited mixed soils {{are not necessarily}} circular, but prior to computers, it was far easier to analyse such a simplified geometry. [...] Nevertheless, {{failures in}} 'pure' clay can be quite close to circular. [...] Such slips often occur {{after a period of}} heavy rain, when the <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> at the slip surface increases, reducing the effective normal stress and thus diminishing the restraining friction along the slip line. [...] This is combined with increased soil weight due to the added groundwater.

[...] At the other extreme, slab-shaped slips on hillsides can remove a layer of soil from the top of the underlying bedrock. [...] Again, this is usually initiated by heavy rain, sometimes combined with increased loading from new buildings or removal of support at the toe (resulting from road widening or other construction work).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of analytical and numerical analyses of the effects of perform-ing a pressuremeter test or driving a pile in clay. The geometry of the problem has been simplified by the assumptions of plane strain and axial symmetry.

Stresses, <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures,</b> and deformations are found by assuming that the clay behaves like normally consolidated modified Cam clay. Closed-form solutions are obtained which allow the determination of the principal effective stresses and the strains around the cavity. The analysis which indicates that the intermediate principal stress at critical state is not equal to the mean of the other two principal stresses, except when the clay is initially isotropically consolidated, also permits finding the limit expansion and excess <b>pore</b> <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> by means of the Almansi finite strain approach.
