50|$|The <b>piefort</b> {{misspelling}} has crept {{back into}} the French language as <b>piéfort.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A piedfort or <b>piefort</b> (American English: [...] , [...] , or [...] British English [...] or French pied-fort or <b>piéfort,</b> {{pronounced}} [...] ) is {{an unusually}} thick coin, often exactly twice the normal weight and thickness of other coins {{of the same}} diameter and pattern. Piedforts are not normally circulated, and are only struck for presentation purposes by mint officials (such as patterns), or for collectors, dignitaries, and other VIPs. Piedfort is commonly misspelled as [...] "piefort".|$|E
50|$|<b>Piefort,</b> or more properly, Piedfort, means {{literally}} any coin struck on {{an unusually}} thick planchet as a trial piece or essay.|$|E
5000|$|Impropriety of the <b>piefort</b> {{misspelling}} is {{attested to}} 1917, when the error had become common {{enough to warrant}} a mention in an early numismatic jargon dictionary: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{influential}} Krause and Mishler Standard Catalog of World Coins {{has used}} both piedfort and <b>piefort</b> interchangeably {{for at least}} the prior 3 decades, as of 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>piefort</b> {{misspelling}} {{appears in}} English {{as early as}} 1893, where the author and citing authors give false etymologies of the word relating to the weight (not thickness) of a coin, the depiction of human legs on a coin, and a corruption {{of the name of}} the Dutch city of Liège as [...] "Leg".|$|E
5000|$|Some {{examples}} of Franglais {{are in fact}} imagined or {{examples of}} words being adopted from one language into another {{in the opposite direction}} of what many people believe. People without linguistic training or who don't even bother to check in dictionaries tend to create and perpetuate such urban legends about Franglais. For example, many numismatists think that the French spelling [...] of the English term piedfort is a result of an imagined reintroduction into French of an English misspelling. In fact, the spelling <b>piéfort</b> is found in French dictionaries as an alternative of [...] and even as the only spelling given in the 1932-1935 edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Académie française. [...] and the etymology derived by professional linguists and shown in these dictionaries shows the change in spelling happened within French.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to review}} and compare various {{definitions}} of the "equivalent von Mises stress" (EMVS), which {{is used as a}} criterion to analyse multiaxial stationary Gaussian random stresses in the frequency-domain. Since the original definition of EVMS proposed in 1994 by Preumont and <b>Piéfort,</b> several modified formulations have been suggested by other authors. In particular, this paper focuses on the definitions proposed by Braccesi et al. (2008) and Niesłony (2008). Such modified formulations aimed to correct some incoherencies in the Preumont’s definition of EVMS, which can lead to inaccurate estimations for particular combinations of material fatigue properties. In this work, analytical expressions are derived to check the accuracy of the original and modified EVMS criterion for different random loading types (e. g. pure bending, pure torsion, combined bending plus torsion). Such analytical expressions will allow engineers to understand when the original EVMS criterion and its modifications can safely be applied in fatigue design...|$|E
40|$|Multiaxial {{fatigue failure}} {{criteria}} are formulated {{in time and}} frequency domain. The number of frequency domain criteria is rather small and the most popular one is the equivalent von Mises stress criterion. This criterion was elaborated by Preumont and <b>Piefort</b> {{on the basis of}} well-known von Mises stress concept, first proposed by Huber in 1907, and well accepted by the scientific community and engineers. It is important to know, that the criterion was developed to determine the yield stress and material effort under static load. Therefore the direct use of equivalent von Mises stress criterion for fatigue life prediction can lead to some incorrectness of theoretical and practical nature. In the present study four aspects were discussed: influence of the value of fatigue strength of tension and torsion, lack of parallelism of the SN curves, abnormal behaviour of the criterion under biaxial tensioncompression and influence of phase shift between particular stress state components. Information contained in this article will help to prevent improper use of this criterion and contributes to its better understandin...|$|E
40|$|In the beginning, I {{would like}} to express my sincere {{gratitude}} to my supervisor profes-sor Andre ́ Preumont, {{the head of the}} Active Structures Laboratory for his patience, wise advices, brilliant ideas and suggestions and for his strong insistance and high pressure to achieve better work. I {{would like to}} thank my colleagues: Frédéric Bossens for putting my feet on the right way, Mihaita Horodinca for his big efforts in manufacturing the Stewart platform, Vin-cent <b>Piefort</b> for his advices in the finite element modelling, Ioanica Burda and Salvator Dusabimana for their efforts in building the electronics needed for the flight test, Pierre De Man, Arnaud François, Ioan Doroftei and Xavier Pitoiset for their help and friendship. Special thanks to Mihaita and Ioanica for their support and participation in the parabolic flight test. I am grateful to the team of Micromega Dynamics, in particular, Nicolas Loix, Jean Phillippe Verschueren and Serge Cattoul for their continuous help and cooperation and for their endless industrial and practical advices specially in the electronics. I am also grateful to the other space and vibration isolation research groups who provided us with helpful ideas {{in the construction of the}} Stewart platform. I am deeply thankful to my family in Palestine, particularly, my beloved mother and I send a ray of love and blessing to the memory of my father who died during the period of this work. The words are too little to describe my thanks to my wife and children for their patience and endless support to withstand the challenges of life and work. ...|$|E
