50|$|Commercial art {{galleries}} derive their <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> of artwork, and thus take great care to select art and artists {{that they believe}} will sell, and will enhance their gallery's reputation.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons AT&T Corporation chose to spin off its {{equipment}} manufacturing business was to permit it to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> to competing telecommunications providers; these customers had previously shown reluctance to purchase from a direct competitor. Bell Labs brought prestige to the new company, {{as well as the}} revenue from thousands of patents.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnitude}} of the OCC is important in Marxist crisis theory because of {{its impact on the}} average rate of profit. The implication of a rise in the organic composition of capital is a declining rate of profit; for every new increase in surplus-value realised as <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales,</b> an even larger corresponding increase in constant capital investment becomes necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{gross profit}} method uses the {{previous}} years average {{gross profit margin}} (i.e. sales minus cost of goods sold divided by sales). Current year gross profit is estimated by multiplying current year sales by that gross profit margin, the current year cost of goods sold is estimated by subtracting the gross <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales,</b> and the ending inventory is estimated by adding cost of goods sold to goods available for sale....|$|E

50|$|People were dislocated {{by the war}} {{and some}} had capital trapped abroad, leading to an urgent need to raise funds. The wife of Jewish {{collector}} Julius Freund, for instance, who {{had been forced to}} flee Germany, sold part of his collection through Galerie Fischer as she urgently needed to raise funds. The Nazi regime in Germany sold looted art in order to raise foreign currency and collectors and dealers sought to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> forced by wartime exigencies.|$|E

5000|$|Philip Carteret and Berkeley {{issued the}} Concessions and Agreements of the Proprietors of New Jersey, the [...] "most liberal grant of {{political}} privileges made by any English colonial proprietor to the people". Freedom of conscience was guaranteed and generous land grants were promised. Carteret indeed issued many grants of lands to settlers and landowners, partly {{with the purpose}} of increasing the worth of the colony.

50|$|Until {{payment from}} sales is received, it is {{uncertain}} {{how much of the}} surplus-value produced will actually be realised as <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales.</b> So, the magnitude of profit realised in the form of money and the magnitude of surplus-value produced in the form of products may differ greatly, depending on what happens to market prices and the vagaries of supply and demand fluctuations. This insight forms the basis of Marx's theory of market value, prices of production and the tendency of the rate of profit of different enterprises to be levelled out by competition.|$|E
50|$|Contribution margin {{per unit}} is the {{difference}} between the price of a product and the sum of the variable costs of one unit of that product. Variable costs are all costs that will increase with greater unit sales of a product or decrease with fewer unit sales (i.e., leaving out fixed costs, which are costs that will not change with sales level over an assumed possible range of sales levels). Examples of variable costs are raw materials, direct labor (if such costs vary with sales levels), and sales commissions. The contribution margin per unit of each product multiplied by units sold equals the contribution to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> of that product.|$|E
50|$|Recycling goods {{through the}} secondhand market both reduces use of {{resources}} in manufacturing new goods, and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both significant environmental benefits. However, manufacturers who <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> <b>sales</b> of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods reduces carbon footprint and CO2 emissions significantly compared to the complete product life cycle, because of less production, raw material sourcing and logistics. Often the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology {{has been made to}} analyze how much CO2 emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand hardware versus new hardware.|$|E
