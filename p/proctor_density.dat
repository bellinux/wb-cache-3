40|$|In {{accordance}} with the ZTVT-StB, proof of the achieved compaction for sub-bases without binders using the degree of compaction D_P_r is required. The degree of compaction is calculated as a quotient from the dry density of the layer and the <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> of the corresponding mixture of building materials. Both the dry density and also the <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> of the corresponding mixture of building materials. Both the dry density and also the <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> show a relatively low level of precision so that, taking the law of error propagation into consideration, the result for the degree of compaction is subject to {{a low level of}} precision. Also the similarly named method, to limit the ratio E_v_ 2 /E_v_ 1, is not expedient although it is used quite frequently due to its ease of application. The aim of the project was to develop a more appropriate proof method than the degree of compaction D_P_r. The development of a completely new method was not envisaged. (orig.)

40|$|Fly ash {{is a waste}} {{by-product}} {{obtained from}} the burning of coal by thermal power plants for generating electricity. When bulk quantities are involved, in order to arrest the fugitive dust, it is stored wet rather than dry. Fly ash contains trace concentrations of heavy metals and other substances in sufficient quantities {{to be able to}} leach out over a period of time. In this study an attempt was made to study the leachabilities of a few selected trace metals: Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Pb and Zn from two different types of class F fly ashes. Emphasis is also laid on developing an alternative in order to arrest the relative leachabilities of heavy metals after amending them with suitable additives. A standard laboratory leaching test for combustion residues has been employed to study the leachabilities of these trace elements as a function of liquid to solid ratio and pH. The leachability tests were conducted on powdered fly ash samples before and after amending them suitably with the matrices lime and gypsum; they were compacted to their respective <b>proctor</b> <b>densities</b> and cured for periods of 28 and 180 days. A marked reduction in the relative leachabilities of the trace elements was observed to be present at the end of 28 days. These relative leachability values further reduced marginally when tests were performed at the end of 180 days...|$|R

40|$|CU Structural Soil? {{was invented}} in the mid 1990 ?s to address health and {{longevity}} issues of urban street trees. This 80 percent gravel and 20 percent soil mixture creates a gap graded, rigid stone matrix which conforms to standards for compaction underneath pavement, yet still allows a healthier rooting media than standard urban environments. Ecologically sensitive development and environmental legislation create unique needs for this soil mixture that requires additional research. Porous asphalt allows water to filter through the pavement profile and into a reservoir of NYSDOT Type 2 gravel (Appendix 1. 4) underneath the pavement where it is held and available for groundwater recharge. While this approach addresses water quality and runoff mitigation issues as specified by National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) legislation, replacement of the gravel reservoir with CU Structural Soil? allows for the incorporation of trees into the system to further remove water and add an inherently green aspect this technology. The target audience for this technology is urban and suburban big box parking lots. Additionally, this work examines replacing the asphalt surfaces with turfgrass sod. The use of turfgrass as a surface treatment for periphery parking spaces that receive infrequent traffic has potential benefits as well. These include runoff mitigation, lower surface temperatures {{and the appearance of}} green space, allowing large parking lots to appear smaller than they are. Laboratory studies undertaken to gain insight into the hydrological characteristics of both CU Structural Soil?, Carolina Stalite Structural Soil and their constituent components of gravel, expanded slate, and clay loam soil included porosity and macroporosity studies as well as infiltration and available water holding capacity trials. Our research found that total soil porosity at 95 percent <b>Proctor</b> <b>Density</b> was 31 percent for CU Structural Soil?, of which macropores comprised 57. 4 percent of the total pores. Total soil porosity for the Carolina Stalite Structural Soil at 95 percent <b>Proctor</b> <b>Density</b> was 32. 5 percent, of which macropores comprised 60. 3 percent of the total pores. Comparably, total soil porosity for a clay loam soil compacted to 95 percent <b>Proctor</b> <b>Density</b> was 32. 9 percent with only 2. 3 percent of the pores being macropores. Infiltration for both structural soils at 95 percent <b>Proctor</b> <b>Density</b> was greater than 60 cm per hour, (24 ?/hour) while the clay loam soil resulted in 1. 24 cm (0. 5 ?) per hour. Plant available water for the CU Structural Soil? was 8. 5 percent while the Carolina Stalite Structural Soil was 11 percent, classifying them as similar to a loamy sand. These results indicate that structural soil would be a strong viable alternative to the un-compacted NYSDOT Type 2 stone traditionally used in porous asphalt reservoirs. Field tests based on this research were carried out at test plots located on the Cornell University campus. Combinations of structural soils and both porous and traditional asphalt surfaces were tested as well as different turf surfaces. These experiments not only examined stormwater and runoff mitigation, but also the feasibility and durability of the different turfgrass surfaces on the different reservoir base course materials. Results indicated that tall fescue turf on both CU and Carolina Stalite Structural Soils consistently outperformed zoysiagrass in all traffic and wear tests, as well as in turf quality ratings. Neither grass performed well on a control base of straight gravel, going completely dormant during the summer months. In surface temperature studies, the fescue on both structural soils ranged from 15 ? to 20 ? C cooler than either of the asphalt surfaces. These results conclude that a properly specified turf on structural soil will not only lower surface temperatures and mitigate stormwater runoff, but also provide a wear tolerant surface. Though the zoysiagrass performed poorly in Ithaca?s cool-season climate, observation indicates it may be a suitable choice for warm-season locations in the southeast U. S...|$|E
40|$|Practical-experimental {{trials have}} been carried out in order to {{describe}} the geotechnical reactions of residual waste after mechanical-biological pre-treatment residual waste. Main parameters to be determined were pressure resistance, compactability as well as shear strength and the permeability of the MBP-waste.

The <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> of MBP-materials were about 0. 87 Mg dm/m 3 up to 1. 02 Mg dm/m 3. The determined shear parameter indicate a rather high stability of a MBP-landfill.

It was concluded that polypropylene fiber inclusion is very effective in reducing the compression and swell indices and swell pressures as well as one-dimensional swell amount in saturated condition.

Therefore, fiber reinforcement can effectively reduce swell-shrink movement of expansive soils...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study was undertaken and a field test section was constructed {{to study the}} rate of pavement deterioration which results when topsoil is used in construction of a subgrade. An extensive laboratory testing program showed that the <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> of topsoil was less than for parent material and results indicated that this difference may be approximated by a change in plastic limit.

The accuracy of the predicted deflection increase and the loss in riding qualities resulting from topsoil in the subgrade should be studied further in future test sections...|$|E
40|$|Parameters {{of water}} {{retention}} and air capacity are important factors {{for the evaluation}} of soil material that will be used for vegetative covers or evapotranspiration (ET) covers of landfills. These values are often measured in the laboratory (usually on disturbed samples), but are also estimated from texture, organic matter content and dry bulk density.

This estimation implicitly assumes that the data in the KA 5 compiled from naturally developed soils are also valid for artificially compacted materials.

A greenhouse study was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of soil compaction under three levels of soil water content. Mineral soil was collected from a landing in central British Columbia, Canada and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) seedlings were grown in pots for 12 weeks. Pots were compacted to densities that corresponded to 67, 72 and 76 % of the <b>Proctor</b> maximum bulk <b>density</b> (1798 kg m- 3) for the soil. Volumetric water contents of 0. 10 - 0. 15, 0. 20 - 0. 30 and 0. 30 - 0. 35 cm 3 cm- 3 were maintained by weighing the pots, determining the gravimetric water content and adding the required water. Compaction only had an effect on seedling growth at low water content. Diameter growth and total shoot biomass were significantly smaller for 76 % compaction compared to 67 % compaction. At low water content, 76 % and 72 % compaction caused decreases in new root biomass and 76 % compaction increased shoot macronutrient concentrations. The findings of this study imply that, for the compaction levels observed, water content had a greater impact on seedling growth than compaction...|$|R

The repeat load triaxial testing established that crushed brick would perform satisfactorily at a 65 % moisture ratio level. At higher moisture ratio levels shear strength of the crushed brick was found to be reduced beyond the acceptable limits. The results of the repeat load triaxial testing indicate that only recycled crushed brick with a moisture ratio of around 65 % is a viable material for usage in pavement subbase applications.

The laboratory experimental program included basic and specialized geotechnical tests including particle size distribution, modified <b>Proctor</b> compaction, particle <b>density,</b> water absorption, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), Los Angeles abrasion, pH, organic content and triaxial shear tests. A field demonstration footpath comprising of two sections of recycled glass-waste rock blends with 15 % and 30 % recycled glass content and a third control section with only waste rock was subsequently constructed based on the outcomes of the initial laboratory tests. Subsequently field tests with a nuclear density gauge and Clegg Impact Hammer were undertaken as well as laboratory testing of field samples to assess the geotechnical performance of the trial sections.

Bulk <b>density</b> was the factor that resulted in the biggest changes in penetration force. Good correlations were observed between the cone penetrometer data and punch penetration forces. A prototype punch planter for corn {{was designed}} and built using a commercial vacuum seed meter. The seed meter was evaluated in the laboratory, vertically and inclined. The prototype planter with the seed meter attached was also evaluated in the laboratory. The results were not significantly affected by the working position of the seed meter nor by speeds between 1. 0 and 3. 0 m/s for the seed meter and planter prototype. Field tests were conducted at several residue covers at 2. 0 m/s and no significant differences in plant spacings were observed. The prototype was modified to be able to plant different population rates. Seed spacings of 136, 165 and 210 mm were obtained by constructing three punch wheels with different punch lengths. Laboratory and field tests were run at speeds of 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. The field tests were run in three different residue covers (corn, grain sorghum and soybean). Despite problems with synchronization between the seed meter and punch wheels in some combinations, the length of the punches seemed to cause no significant problems at the speeds tested. A soil cleaning device was designed to reduce the soil disturbance. The volume of soil displaced by the smallest punch wheel was less than half of that displaced by a commercial no-till planter. Planting depth regularity was evaluated, showing good uniformity. Though the results are promising, recommendations for further improvement are proposed, especially related to the synchronization between the seed meter and punch wheel. ...|$|R

This paper presents a laboratory study showing how physical and mechanical characteristics of a silty sand are modified by a low percentage of bentonite. The effects of the addition of bentonite on the silty sand are reflected by an increase in the plasticity index, a reduction in maximum modified <b>Proctor</b> <b>density,</b> and a decrease in hydraulic conductivity. The most significant consequences on the mechanical properties are an increase of compressibility and secondary consolidation coefficients, and a reduction in shear strength. Different mixtures were either dynamically compacted at the optimum water content (compacted samples) or prepared after slurry consolidation from the minimum density (remoulded samples). Although the compacted and remoulded specimens show different isotropic compression lines, their critical-state lines in the v:p¢:q space are identical, where v is specific volume, p' is average effective stress, and q is deviator stress. Comparisons of the mechanical parameters with the existing literature database show that the compression coefficients of the remoulded mixtures are comparable to those of normally consolidated clayey soils of similar plasticity; nevertheless, those of the compacted mixtures are considerably lower. Also, the slopes of their critical-state lines in the q:p' plane are in good agreement with those predicted by empirical correlations for fine-grained soils...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} use of cohesive soils in earthworks requires a certain knowledge of the relevant long term shear strength for a safe and economic design. Generally the strength of compacted cohesive fills {{is assumed to be}} {{the same as that of}} the parent in-situ material, provided that these have been compacted sufficiently (e. g. 100 % <b>Proctor</b> <b>density).</b> To check this assumption and to determine the long term in-situ shear strength, standard triaxial tests as well as full scale in-situ load tests were performed under different boundary conditions on fills built under construction site conditions. The soil used was a regionally typical loess loam, which fullfilled the relevant earthworks specifications. In order to obtain a direct comparison, the full scale tests were extended to load tests on in-situ loess loam. From the comparison of laboratory and field shear strengths the present thesis contains recommendations on how to evaluate laboratory results to estimate in-situ conditions. It could be demonstrated that the effective cohesion c' is strongly dependent on the conditions at compaction and the resulting soil fabric. Characteristic values for the cohesion can be given as a function of the conditions at compaction. From that it is evident, that with respect to shear strength a stricter specification of the air voids ratio is preferable to increased requirements on the relative compaction. (orig.)

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to characterize the tailings deposit at Aitik Mine in terms of its hydro geotechnical properties with more emphasis on hydraulic conductivity and present their vertical and horizontal distribution. In this study, relationship between each parameter has also been identified. The investigation has been done in three sections which cover approximately 3 km 2 of area and 4 - 5 meters vertically. 3 - 5 test pits have been excavated in each section and disturbed and undisturbed samples are collected from various levels. Apart from in situ tests like balloon density, laboratory investigations have been done on the collected samples. These tests includes: <b>Proctor</b> compaction, particle <b>density</b> termination, grain size analysis, and permeability. Evaluation of existing empirical relations between grain size analysis and hydraulic conductivity were also one of the aims of this thesis work. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity has been found to have a good correlation to fine fraction and void ratio. Similar to the results of Jantzer et al (2008), the increased void ratio did not correspond to vertical hydraulic conductivity. Based on evaluation of Hazen (1911) and Chapuis et al (2003) formulas using the samples collected, conclusions have been made. Therefore, Hazen formula (1911) has given 25 and 45 times the measured values of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity respectively. On the other hand, Chapuis et al (2003) has not been succeeded for prediction of hydraulic conductivity of undisturbed samples. However, it has given comparatively good prediction of hydraulic conductivity for disturbed samples which are compacted to their field dry density. Particle density, porosity and void ratio results are in agreement with the range determined by Yunxin (2001), Shamsai (2007), and Jantzer et al (2008) on different tailings deposit. Ice layers are encountered exactly above layers with higher silt and clay contents. Silty SAND is discovered to be the predominant soil type in the investigated area. Because the study was able to cover only part of the whole deposit, further detailed investigation covering the whole area and depth of the deposit is recommended to be done in the future.

It is a relatively inexpensive, light-weight and easy to use device that measures the dynamic penetration resistance of the compacted soil, from which an estimate of soil strength and stiffness characteristics can be made. Owing to its ease of use, many DOTs in the U. S. have employed the DCP in their compaction quality control procedures, and over the past few decades, extensive research has been carried out on the development of correlations between the results of the DCP test and the results of strength and stiffness tests performed on compacted soils (e. g., California bearing ratio, and resilient modulus) The objectives of this research are to refine DCP-based quality assurance and quality control correlations for compaction quality control developed by previous research studies carried out at Purdue for the Indiana Department of Transportation, especially focusing on i) grouping of the soils based on their mechanical response to the DCP loading, and ii) limiting the in situ moisture range of the soils used for development of correlations within - 2 % of the optimum moisture content of the tested soil. The factors outlined above are studied, and in particular, soil grouping is examined critically. The AASHTO (‘A-based’) classification employed previously for classification of soils is replaced by a new classification criteria specifically developed for the DCP test. Soils are grouped into one of the two categories of coarse-grained or fine-grained soils {{on the basis of the}} size of the dominant particle in the soil. The criteria developed for the classification of soil into one of these two categories is based on index properties of the soil, such as the standard <b>Proctor</b> maximum dry <b>density,</b> optimum moisture content, plasticity index (PI) and fines content (percentage passing 0. 075 mm sieve size). For the purpose of refinement of the QA/QC correlations, extensive field and laboratory tests (more than 750 DCP tests) were carried out on soils found in Indiana to add to the existing database of DCP test results. The database was then statistically analyzed for extraction of the representative DCP test value (number of DCP blows required for a specific depth of penetration into the compacted soil) for different types of soil. Results show that the DCP test results for fine-grained soils have a good correlation with the PI, which is indicative of the clay content of the soil, while the DCP test results for coarse-grained soils have good correlations with the optimum moisture content of the soil, which is indicative of the targeted in situ density of the soil. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of the distribution of DCP blow counts in the field revealed that the mean of a minimum of 7 closely spaced tests is required to get a representative blow count of the compacted soil at a given location. More targeted testing is needed to assess the frequency of DCP testing required for larger areas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} has been to {{evaluate}} and understand the effect of caustic alkali solution of varying composition on the behaviour of expansive soil containing mixed layered minerals. Mixed layered minerals are formed {{of two or more}} kinds of inter grown layers, not physical mixtures. Illite - smectite is the most abundant and wide spread of the mixed layered clay minerals in sedimentary rocks and soils and also more common than either discrete illite or smectite. In geotechnical engineering much attention has not been paid to the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals. Much less is known about the behaviour of these soils in polluted environment. Mixed layered minerals are more susceptible to environmental changes as the structural linkages between the layer minerals are weak compared to normal layered phyllosilicates. One important pollutant that can have considerable effect on the behaviour of soils is the caustic alkali contamination released from various industries. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} behaviour of even stable minerals is affected by alkali contamination. However, the effect of caustic alkali contamination on the behaviour of soils containing mixed layered minerals is not known and has been chosen for detailed study. Also to understand the mechanism of their interaction with alkali, it is necessary to study the effect of alkali solutions on the constituent clay minerals viz., montmorillonite and illite under similar conditions. To elucidate the mechanism of soil alkali interaction limited tests were conducted with simple electrolyte solution, as the alkali solution also acts as electrolyte apart from being alkaline. To confirm the mechanism of interaction, tests are also conducted on these soils with industrial spent liquor containing high caustic alkali and suspended alumina obtained from an alumina extraction plant treating bauxite with high alkali solutions at high temperatures. The results obtained in the laboratory are compared with the soil samples contaminated with leaking industrial Bayer's liquid in the field. Studies are also conducted to suggest remedial measures to control the adverse effects of alkali solutions on soil containing mixed layer minerals. The content of the thesis is broadly divide into 8 Chapters - viz., Introduction, Background and overview, Experimental program and procedures, Behaviour of soils containing mixed layer mineral illite - smectite (BCSI), Behaviour of montmorillonite and illite, Influence of Bayer's liquor and study on the field contaminated soils, Measures to control the influence of alkali contamination on BCSI and Summary and conclusions. The broad outline of these chapters is given in Chapter 1. A review of literature on the behaviour of soils containing different types of clay minerals with emphasis on mixed layer minerals has been presented in Chapter 2. The influence of different inorganic contaminants on the properties of soils in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their concentration has been summarized. The importance of changes in surface characteristics of soil particles and the changes in the thickness of diffuse double layer in altering the property of soils at low concentration of contaminants and changes in the mineralogy with high concentrated contaminants such as acids and alkalis has been highlighted. This forms the background information necessary to bring out the scope of the study. Four soils having different mineralogy have been used in this study. These soils are, black cotton soil containing predominantly mixed layer mineral illite - smectite mineral called rectorite, illite, montmorillonite (common smectite) and black cotton soil containing predominantly montmorillonite. The properties of the soils used are described in Chapter 3. Caustic alkali solutions of 1 N, 4 N concentration prepared in the laboratory and industrial alkali-spent liquor are used as contaminants. The spent Bayer's liquor had about 4 N alkali concentration and 10 % alumina in suspension. To simulate the effect of suspended alumina, two more caustic alkali solutions of 1 N and 4 N solutions containing 10 % alumina by weight of solutions are also prepared. To isolate the effect of electrolyte solutions from that of alkali solution, two electrolyte solutions of 1 N and 4 N sodium chloride solutions are also used. Test procedures for conducting various tests such as pH, water adsorption characteristics, X-ray diffraction studies, SEM studies, thermal characteristics and geotechnical properties such as Atterberg limits, Oedometer tests and Shear Strength are given in this chapter. The test procedures are modified, wherever necessary, to bring out the effect of contaminants, particularly the effect of duration of interaction on the properties of soils. The source and properties of black cotton soil are presented in Chapter 4. Detailed x-diffraction studies have confirmed the presence of inter layered illite-smectite mineral viz., rectorite, which is uncommon in Indian expansive soils, and is classified as CH (Clay of high compressibility) as per ASTM soil classification. Effect of alkali and salt solutions of 1 N and 4 N concentration on all physico chemical and geotechnical properties are studied in this chapter. As it is known that presence of certain elements such as aluminium influence the soil alkali interaction, the effect of suspended alumina along with alkali solution has also been investigated. The effect of contaminating fluids such as 1 N NaOH, 4 N NaOH with and without alumina, 1 N NaCl and 4 N NaCl on the geotechnical properties of the soil has been studied. Mineralogical changes were observed by XRD and thermal studies in the soil treated with 4 N NaOH solution and 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina. The interlayer potassium of illite is released and potassium hydroxide is formed in soil treated with 4 N NaOH. Swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH) has formed due to attack of 4 N NaOH + 10 % alumina on silica rather than on rectorite. Thus the studies clearly bring out that the rectorite present in the soil is dissociated only in the presence of strong alkali solutions of concentration of about 4 N. The liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the electrolyte concentration in the case of NaCl solutions. With 1 N NaOH, the liquid limit of soil increased due to increase in the thickness of diffuse double layer due to increased pH. However, <b>Proctor's</b> maximum dry <b>density</b> increased and optimum moisture content decreased with 1 N NaOH. With increase in the concentration of alkali solution to 4 N, the rectorite dissociates into constituent minerals with the formation potassium hydroxide. The liquid limit of soil decreased probably due to the dominating influence of electrolyte nature of hydroxide solution over the effect of increased negative charge on clay particles due increase in the pH on the constituent minerals. <b>Proctor's</b> maximum dry <b>density</b> decreased and optimum moisture content increased with 4 N NaOH. Sediment volume and oedometer free swell at seating/nominal surcharge load of 6. 25 kPa of soil increased in 1 N and 4 N caustic alkali solutions, though by different mechanisms. The increase with 1 N solution is essentially due to increased negative charges on clay mineral surface. However, the increase in swelling with 4 N solution is associated with the dissociation of rectorite mineral and occurs in two distinct phases unlike in the case of 1 N solution. While the first phase can be attributed to the effect of alkaline nature of the solution after reduction in its concentration due to reaction with rectorite and the consequent reduction in its electrolyte nature. The second phase is due to the swelling of the separated constituent minerals in the presence of excess of alkali and occurs after much delay. Consolidation behaviour of rectorite in 1 N and 4 N alkali solutions has been studied in two ways: 1). Loading without waiting for the second stage of swelling to occur, as in standard consolidation procedure and 2). Loading after completion of second stage of swelling which is occurring after considerable delay as explained earlier. Normally one would initiate loading after equilibrium is reached at the end of first stage of swelling and second stage of swelling is not suspected. As there is no second stage of swelling with 1 N solutions, these two types of consolidation tests produced the same results. Abnormal rebound is observed during unloading with 4 N solution in which loading cycle is initiated without waiting for second stage of swelling to complete. It is interesting to note that while the liquid limit of soil decreased with increase in the concentration of alkali solution, the swelling increased. The testing procedure and period of interaction as well as the concentration of alkali solution during the test in these two tests are different. The effects of alkali solution are more severe in case of liquid limit because of thorough mixing and consequent effective reaction during testing. Similarly, the volume changes in soil that has already reacted with 4 N alkali solution when exposed to further to alkali contamination are considerably less compared to uncontaminated soil exposed to fresh contamination. The shear strength of soil treated with 4 N-alkali solution has increased particularly after long period of interaction. This indicates that the soil after mineralogical changes posses good strength. Chapter 5 presents the effect of alkali and salt solutions on the physico chemical and geotechnical properties of component minerals of mixed layered illite/smectite. For this study, commercially obtained montmorillonite (bentonite), naturally occurring black soil containing montmorillonite and commercially pure illite are used. It was observed that montmorillonite alkali reactions would not produce significant mineralogical changes where as illite is dissociated into smectite with the formation of potassium silicate by the interaction of released potassium with soluble silica. This confirms that the ultimate products of rectorite with alkali solutions would be smectite and compounds of potassium. In the absence of mineralogical alterations the liquid limit of montmorillonite decreases due to suppression of diffuse double layer thickness due to dominating influence of alkali solutions on this highly active clay. However a small increase in liquid limit is observed in illite with alkali solutions. Thus the net effect of alkali on rectorite is to decrease the liquid limit with increase in alkali concentration. While the free swell and oedometer swelling of montmorillonite generally decreases with increase in the alkali concentration, they increase in illite. However, in both the minerals the swelling occurs only in one phase. Thus the second phase of swelling that has been observed in rectorite can be attributed to delayed swelling of montmorillonite that has been released by the attack of alkali on rectorite. The behaviour of black soil containing mixed layer mineral contaminated in the field and laboratory by leaking Bayer's spent liquor in an alumina extraction plant has been studied in Chapter 6. The Atterberg limits of the samples treated with liquor are reduced and sediment volume increased. Similarly the swelling at seating load in consolidation test is higher in sample compacted with water and inundated with liquor. X-ray diffraction studies showed that the mineralogical changes are similar to those occurred with 4 N caustic alkali solution. The mineralogical and micro structural changes in the soil samples that are contaminated by leaked spent liquor in the field are relatively more marked. Also the behavior of highly montmorillonite clay, bentonite, has been studied contaminated with liquor in the laboratory. The study on the effect of high concentrated alkali solutions on montmorillonite can be useful to study the effect of interaction on the dissociated montmorillonite. These studies are helpful to suggest some possible remedial measures to control the adverse effect of alkali on soils. Possible Remedial schemes that can be adopted before and after contamination of the soil to control the adverse effect of alkali solutions on the black cotton soil containing mixed layered mineral are listed and their effectiveness examined in Chapter 7. The suggested remedial measures include flushing with water to dilute the effect of alkali, neutralisation with dilute hydrochloric acid, stabilisation of soil with lime and calcium chloride and use of impervious membrane to separate the foundation soil from alkali solution. The effectiveness of different measures as well as the method of their application has been described. Efforts are made to understand the mechanism of remedial action. Consolidation tests conducted on soil contaminated with 4 N alkali solution and inundated with water showed increased swelling due to dilution of the alkali concentration. Though the swelling of contaminated soil can be controlled by passing dilute hydrochloric acid (1 N), the method is not advocated as it can lead to ground water contamination. Mixing the soil with solutions containing up to 5 % by weight of calcium compound in water could not prevent the alkali induced heave in the long run when inundated with 4 N alkali solution. This was due to dissolution of silica by the strong alkali solutions and formation of swelling compounds such as sodium aluminium silicate hydroxide hydrate (SASH). The formation of sodium aluminates occurred only when the alkali solution contained alumina or soil contained calcium compounds. There are no significant variations in the effects of calcium chloride or calcium hydroxide on contaminated soil. Replacing the foundation soil with soil thoroughly contaminated with 4 N alkali solutions and controlling the migration of contaminants into the foundation soil using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geosynthetic membranes can be an effective measure to control the heaving in alkali contaminated foundation soil containing interstratified illite – smectite.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the relationship between}} subgrade strength and moisture content. Major function of subgrade is to provide support to pavement. Subgrade soil type, compacted density and moisture significantly affect pavement design. Surface and subsurface drainage of pavement and from adjoining land also affect subgrade strength significantly. Subgrade strength is mostly {{expressed in terms of}} California Bearing Ratio. The subgrade strength owing to its inconsistency or variable nature poses a challenge for the engineer {{to come up with a}} perfect design pavement. For example, the subgrade is always subjected to change in its moisture content due to precipitation, capillary action, and flood or subside of water table. Change in moisture content causes change in subgrade strength. It becomes quite essential for an engineer to understand the exact nature of dependence of subgrade strength on moisture content. In this study variation of subgrade strength with moisture content was studied considering, the variation of subgrade strength with days soaking and to analyse the relationship between subgrade strength, moisture and days soaking by used statistical software Mnitab 16. Thus the different soil samples were tested for their <b>proctor</b> <b>density,</b> optimum moisture content, California Bearing Ratio after being soaked in water for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days and 4 days and Un-soaked for each sample. Study shows that a strong curvilinear correlation between subgrade strength and moisture content. On increasing number of days of soaking, subgrade strength decreases due to increases of moisture content. The rate of change in subgrade strength per percentage change in moisture content during un-soaked from the optimum moisture content was one to seven times larger than during soaking for four days from optimum moisture content with the average of about five times. So it will help design a good road pavement because subgrade is the foundation of road pavement...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} oxidation of methane in landfill cover soils offers great potential to reduce methane emissions from landfills. High methane degradation rates {{can only be}} accomplished if the supply of atmospheric oxygen to the methanotrophic community is adequate. Thus, if environmental variables such as pH or nutrient status are not limiting, system performance is suggested to be governed by the share of pores available for gas transport. Diffusion tests as well as column studies were conducted to investigate the effect of air-filled porosity and degree of compaction on diffusivity and methane oxidation efficiency. Results show that the effective diffusion coefficient governing oxygen migration through soil is exponentially related to air-filled porosity space and can be significantly decreased by compaction. Discontinuity and tortuosity of the pore system strongly impeded diffusive migration at air-filled porosities below 10 %. In the column study, soil gas composition and methane oxidation rates correlated with both the degree of compaction and the magnitude of advective bottom flux. Low aeration and hence low methane oxidation rates prevailed at high compaction rates and/or high bottom fluxes whereas high rates could be maintained at lower fluxes and/or low compaction rates. At a low degree of compaction (75 % of the <b>Proctor</b> <b>density),</b> fluxes of 3. 5 g CH(4) m(- 2) h(- 1) could be fully oxidized at all times by a sandy loam, the capacity limit of which was not reached during the experiment. Our studies suggest that soils intended for use as methane-oxidizing biocovers are to maintain an air-filled porosity of at least 14 vol. %. At low and medium degree of compaction, this is provided by sands, loamy sands, sandy loams {{and some of the}} coarsely textured loams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural land packers are {{generally}} used following the seeding operation. It {{has been found}} that fields which have been packed usually give higher yields than those which have not been packed, although the reasons for this result are not understood. A laboratory study was undertaken to determine the effect of packing and the effect to determine the effect of packing and the effect of packer weight on soil density and moisture loss. A soil bin system was designed and constructed for the proposed study. The bulk density of the soil in the box was measured with a gamma ray density system. A 12 -inch cultivator shovel was used to till the soil before packing. Two agricultural land packers, a crowfoot and a coil type were used to pack the soil. Four different weights of packers ranging from 60 pounds to 160 pounds per foot of width were used for both packers at three depths of cultivation and at two moisture levels. Based upon the theoretical analysis of gamma transmission, a linear relationship was found between the count rate and the moisture content, and between the count rate and the dry bulk density. These relationships were used in determining the undisturbed bulk density of soil. It was found that the packed density of the soil was essentially the same for all packer weights used. No differences in packed density were detected with changes in depth of cultivation, moisture level, or the type of packer. The packed density increased with depth. Based upon these results an equation of packing was developed which related packed density to Depth. Experimental results were then checked against the theoretical calculations based upon a pressure-sinkage equation. Laboratory compaction tests and consolidation tests were carried out with a <b>Proctor</b> <b>density</b> apparatus and a consolidation apparatus respectively. The results from the compaction tests were compared with the experimental values. The Bossinesq equation was used to draw iso-pressure curves. Densities were calculated by graphical integration of iso-pressure curves using the density-pressure relationship obtained from the consolidation tests. A comparison was made between the densities obtained graphically and experimentally. The trend of calculated values was {{similar to that of the}} experimental values to a depth of four inches. A comparison of the moisture loss from a sample of soil which was cultivated only to that from a sample which was cultivated and packed showed no difference during a period of seven days...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} oxidation of methane in engineered cover soils {{is considered a}} potent option for the mitigation of emissions from old landfills or sites containing wastes of low methane generation rates. A laboratory column {{study was conducted in}} order to derive design criteria that enable construction of an effective methane oxidising cover from the range of soils that are available to the landfill operator. Therefore, the methane oxidation capacity of different soils was assessed under simulated landfill conditions. Five sandy potential landfill top cover materials with varying contents of silt and clay were investigated with respect to methane oxidation and corresponding soil gas composition over a period of four months. The soils were compacted to 95 % of their specific <b>proctor</b> <b>density,</b> resulting in bulk densities of 1. 4 - 1. 7 g cm(- 3), reflecting considerably unfavourable conditions for methane oxidation due to reduced air-filled porosity. The soil water content was adjusted to field capacity, resulting in water contents ranging from 16. 2 to 48. 5 vol. %. The investigated inlet fluxes ranged from 25 to about 100 g CH(4) m(- 2) d(- 1), covering the methane load proposed to allow for complete oxidation in landfill covers under Western European climate conditions and hence being suggested as a criterion for release from aftercare. The vertical distribution of gas concentrations, methane flux balances as well as stable carbon isotope studies allowed for clear process identifications. Higher inlet fluxes led to a reduction of the aerated zone, an increase in the absolute methane oxidation rate and a decline of the relative proportion of oxidized methane. For each material, a specific maximum oxidation rate was determined, which varied between 20 and 95 g CH(4) m(- 2) d(- 1) and which was positively correlated to the air-filled porosity of the soil. Methane oxidation efficiencies and gas profile data imply a strong link between oxidation capacity and diffusive ingress of atmospheric air. For one material with elevated levels of fine particles and high organic matter content, methane production impeded the quantification of methane oxidation potentials. Regarding the design of landfill cover layers it was concluded that the magnitude of the expected methane load, the texture and expected compaction of the cover material are key variables that need to be known. Based on these, a column study can serve as an appropriate testing system to determine the methane oxidation capacity of a soil intended as landfill cover material. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
