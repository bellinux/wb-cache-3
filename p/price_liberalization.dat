The main crops included in the study w ere cotton, sorghum and groundnuts. The instability of area, yield and production were measured, in addition to the analysis of different components of the sources of change in the mean and variance of production. The results of the study revealed that sorghum witnessed a continuous increase in instability during the periods before and after adoption of <b>prices</b> <b>liberalization</b> policy. The instability in groundnuts and cotton production was observed after the adoption of liberalization policy. The instability in area and productivity of the three crops moved in the same direction and their increasing/decreasing trend resulted in increase/decrease in instability. The decomposition analysis of sources of change in mean production indicated that the m ain contribution in change of mean production of sorghum and groundnuts was due to change in mean yield and due to change in mean area in case of cotton. The analysis of decomposition of variance showed that in case of sorghum the changes in the variance of yield accounted for large shares of changes in variance of production whereas in case of cotton and groundnuts the large shares w ere due to area. The changes in the residual term were important in explaining the changes in the variance of production in groundnuts.

50|$|The {{economic}} malaise {{affecting the}} Comecon countries - low growth rates and diminishing returns on investment - led many domestic and Western economists to advocate market-based solutions and a sequenced programme of economic reform. It was recognized that micro-economic reform and macro-economic stabilization {{had to be}} combined carefully. <b>Price</b> <b>liberalization</b> without prior remedial measures to eliminate macro-economic imbalances, including an escalating fiscal deficit, a growing money supply due to {{a high level of}} borrowing by state-owned enterprises, and the accumulated savings of households (“monetary overhang”) could result in macro-economic destabilization instead of micro-economic efficiency. Unless entrepreneurs enjoyed secure property rights and farmers owned their farms the process of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” would limit the reallocation of resources and prevent profitable enterprises from expanding to absorb the workers displaced from the liquidation of non-viable enterprises. A hardening of the budget constraints at state-owned enterprises would halt the drain on the state budget from subsidization but would require additional expenditure to counteract the resulting unemployment and drop in aggregate household spending. Monetary overhang meant that <b>price</b> <b>liberalization</b> might convert “repressed inflation” into open inflation, increase the price level still further and generate a price spiral. The transition to a market economy would require state intervention alongside market liberalization, privatization and deregulation. Rationing of essential consumer goods, trade quotas and tariffs and an active monetary policy to ensure that there was sufficient liquidity to maintain commerce might be needed. In addition to tariff protection, measures to control capital flight were also considered necessary in some instances.|$|E

40|$|Many {{inflation}} stabilizations succeed only temporarily. Using {{a sample}} of 51 episodes of stabilization from inflation levels above 40 percent, we show {{that most of the}} failures are explained by bad luck, unfavorable initial conditions, and inadequate political institutions. The evolution of trading partners'' demand and U. S. interest rates captures the effect of bad luck. Past inflation affects the outcome in two different ways: a long history of high inflation makes failure more likely, while a high level of inflation prior to stabilization increases the chances of success. Countries with short-lived political institutions, a weak executive authority, and proportional electoral rules also tend to fail. After controlling for all these factors, we find that exchange-rate-based stabilizations are more likely to succeed.

Past agricultural growth was largely based on bringing additional physical factors of production into use, including land, irrigation water, labour and new technologies.

For example, the effects on agricultural growth of <b>price</b> <b>liberalization</b> and land titling were dramatic. The rural sector has shown resilience and a capacity for change and adaptation.

50|$|From 1991-1995, {{all sectors}} of the {{national}} economy were affected by the profound economic crisis, triggered {{by the collapse of}} the Soviet Union.

Moreover, Belarus, like the rest of the former Soviet Union republics, was characterized by a general lack of preparedness of the country’s institution and society for the market system of relations. The sharp growth in prices for raw materials and energy resources revealed the technological weakness of the economy with its resource-intensive and low-quality output.

Additional to that the study shed light on the impact of transition process reforms on FDI. The research employed a variety of different data sources and empirical methods, in order to achieve its goals. The empirical analysis indicated that foreign investments in the area of interest were not particularly affected by the presence of corruption. Actually, foreign investors were rather encouraged by both high corruption and the low governance levels. Regarding FDI features, the formulated view is of foreign investments as business entities with secured financial support, export orientation, not significant contribution to labour skills and production increase and with a rather indifferent approach towards taxation.

From 1992 till 2001, the young country suffered its worst economic crisis that left most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, a new national currency, the Moldovan leu was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble. The end of the planned economy meant also that the industrial enterprises would have to buy supplies and sell their goods by themselves, {{and most of the}} management was not prepared for such a change. Moldova undertook a privatisation plan which was effective in the transfer of the ownership of houses to the people. The attempted privatization of production means did not boost the economy as it was desired. International financial institutions, judging the apparent presence of landmarks indicating a modern developed society in 1992, have overestimated the capacity of Moldova's economy and government to withstand the transition to market economy, and imposed the country to open its market to outside goods without implementation of any effective action to support internal production. As a result, Moldova's industry, especially machine building, became all but defunct, and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. Early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and other countries, in addition to work in Russia. One of the reasons for this was that in 1991, 1.3 million Moldovans, or ca. 60% of the workforce, were employed in agriculture, which normally does not require such a large number of people. Remittances from Moldovans abroad account for ca. 30% of Moldova's GDP, the largest percentage in Europe.

In the Polish hog-pork sector the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and the emergence of private firms introduced an effective price transmission mechanism between the processing-retailing and farm levels. This mechanism allowed farm supply to respond to changed demand and to take advantage of increased retail prices. Such a relatively efficient marketing system was made possible by a relatively stable macroeconomic environment and limited government intervention. In August 1989, the Polish government removed most price controls and subsidies in the agrifood sector.
