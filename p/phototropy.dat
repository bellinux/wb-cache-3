He is {{therefore}} now just past eighty, {{and he has been}} a member of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Botanische Vereniging for sixty years. He studied at the Utrecht State University and, like many of his contemporaries, was strongly attracted to plant physiology under Prof. F. A. F. C. Went’s influence. <b>Phototropy</b> and geotropy had become the principal fields of research in Went’s wellequipped laboratory, and Bremekamp’s first scientific work was also devoted to these subjects. His thesis (1912) dealt with the Geotropy of Twining Plants. His publications of the following years were the results of similar studies. In the same year he left for what was then the Dutch East Indies where he was first employed at the Java Sugar Experiment Station; then, until 1921, he taught at the Medical College (N. I. A. S.). After returning to the Netherlands he lectured from 1921 to 1923 on plant physiology at the University of Amsterdam. During these years, too, his scientific work was mainly devoted to <b>phototropy</b> and hydrotropy. In 1924 he accepted a position as professor of botany at the Transvaal University College, South Africa. Initially his research there was also in plant physiology, but, perhaps partly under the influence of local conditions, partly through some shift in his interest, his work became gradually oriented toward morphology and systematics. Certain physiological problems in the Rubiaceae drew his attention to that family (Revision of the South African species of Pavetta). In 1930 he was on leave in the Netherlands. It was on that occasion that I first met him, when he attended the awarding of a Ph. D. to one of his South African students. I had long been familiar with his name. For all students studying with Prof. Went thorough knowledge of the scientific work of “Went’s school” was compulsory. Went’s pupils from the days before the First World War were the scientific models that we tried to follow. Names we pronounced with some awe were, beside Bremekamp, Blaauw, Mrs. Rutten-Pekelharing, Arisz, etc. Meeting Bremekamp and being in his company at a dinner party greatly impressed me. Since that time I have known that Bremekamp was a source of information who would take great pains to answer a question as well as possible...|$|E
40|$|Halobacterium salinarum is a bioenergetically flexible, halophilic {{microorganism}} that can generate energy by respiration, photosynthesis, and the fermentation of arginine. In a previous study, using a genome-scale metabolic model, {{we have shown}} that the archaeon unexpectedly degrades essential amino acids under aerobic conditions, a behavior that can lead to the termination of growth earlier than necessary. Here, we further integratively investigate energy generation, nutrient utilization, and biomass production using an extended methodology that accounts for dynamically changing transport patterns, including those that arise from interactions among the supplied metabolites. Moreover, we widen the scope of our analysis to include phototrophic conditions to explore the interplay between different bioenergetic modes. Surprisingly, we found that cells also degrade essential amino acids even during <b>phototropy,</b> when energy should already be abundant. We also found that under both conditions considerable amounts of nutrients that were taken up were neither incorporated into the biomass nor used as respiratory substrates, implying the considerable production and accumulation of several metabolites in the medium. Some of these are likely the products of forms of overflow metabolism. In addition, our results also show that arginine fermentation, contrary to what is typically assumed, occurs simultaneously with respiration and photosynthesis and can contribute energy in levels that are comparable to the primary bioenergetic modes, if not more. These findings portray a picture that the organism takes an approach toward growth that favors the here and now, even a...|$|E
