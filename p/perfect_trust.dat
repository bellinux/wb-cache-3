500|$|The Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns {{continues}} the parallel of an adherent's quest. Yinxi received his ordination when Laozi transmitted the Daodejing, {{along with other}} texts and precepts, just as Taoist adherents receive a number of methods, teachings and scriptures at ordination. This is only an initial ordination and Yinxi still needed an additional period to perfect his virtue, thus Laozi gave him three years to perfect his Dao. Yinxi gave himself over to a full-time devotional life. After the appointed time, Yinxi again demonstrates determination and <b>perfect</b> <b>trust,</b> sending out a black sheep to market as the agreed sign. He eventually meets again with Laozi, who announces that Yinxi's immortal name is listed in the heavens and calls down a heavenly procession to clothe Yinxi in the garb of immortals. The story continues that Laozi bestowed a number of titles upon Yinxi and took him on a journey throughout the universe, even into the nine heavens. After this fantastic journey, the two sages set out to western lands of the barbarians. The training period, reuniting and travels represent the attainment of the highest religious rank in medieval Taoism called [...] "Preceptor of the Three Caverns". In this legend, Laozi is the perfect Daoist master and Yinxi is the ideal Taoist student. Laozi is presented as the Tao personified, giving his teaching to humanity for their salvation. Yinxi follows the formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.|$|E

In Caragiale's case, Ştefănescu argued, Cioculescu proved his [...] "admirable philological rigor", but did not produce a unitary interpretation of his subject: [...] "There is not [...] a single Caragiale as seen by Şerban Cioculescu." [...] He added: [...] "The finality of Şerban Cioculescu's enterprise is something other than erecting a temple, and is in effect the preservation of interest for I. L. Caragiale's work." [...] This was explicitly stated by the author, who was quoted by George Călinescu as stating: [...] " [...] will indisputably find a writer of great talent to enliven his face." [...] According to Călinescu: [...] " [...] contributions {{on the subject of}} Caragiale merit a <b>perfect</b> <b>trust.</b> [...] The biographical talent, which he will not attribute to himself, is nonetheless present in Şerban Cioculescu." [...] Noting that the main techniques used by his colleague were [...] "insinuation" [...] and [...] "repetition", Călinescu proposed: [...] "For the reader used to architecture, the effect may prove disappointing, but for the refined, especially one bored with the sublime style, the impression is relevant.

However, its unconditional security proof is still missing, {{even though it has}} been proposed for many years. Here, we prove its security against collective attacks with a weak coherent light source in the noiseless case (i. e. no bit error). The only assumptions are that quantum theory is correct, the devices are <b>perfect</b> and <b>trusted</b> and the key size is infinite. Our proof works on threshold detectors. We compute the lower bound of the secret key generation rate using the information-theoretical security proof method. Our final result shows that the lower bound of the secret key generation rate per pulse is linearly proportional to the channel transmission probability if Bob's detection counts obey the binomial distribution.

40|$|Secure quantum key {{distribution}} with multimode Gaussian entangled states and multimode homodyne detectors is proposed. In general the multimode character of both the sources of entanglement and the homodyne detectors can cause a security break even for a <b>perfect</b> channel when <b>trusted</b> parties are unaware of the detection structure. Taking into account the multimode structure and potential leakage of information from a homodyne detector reduces the loss of security to some extent. We suggest the symmetrization of the multimode sources of entanglement as an efficient method allowing us to fully recover the security irrespectively to multimode structure of the homodyne detectors. Further, we demonstrate that by {{increasing the number of}} the fluctuating but similar source modes the multimode protocol stabilizes the security of the quantum {{key distribution}}.

Only a little had she begun to comprehend the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature.

To know something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of earth--perhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven. For whatever breathed and moved was a part of that creation. The coo of the dove, the lichen on the mossy rock, the mourn of a hunting wolf, and the murmur of the waterfall, the ever-green and growing tips of the spruces, and the thunderbolts along the battlements of the heights--these one and all must be actuated by the great spirit--that incalculable thing in the universe which had produced man and soul.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} several issues {{emerging}} in the new digital world. Using Trusted Computing as the paradigmatic example of regulation though code that tries to address the cyber security problem that occurs, where {{the freedom of the}} user to reconfigure her machine is restricted in exchange for greater, yet not <b>perfect,</b> security. <b>Trusted</b> Computing is a technology that while it aims to protect the user, and the integrity of her machine and her privacy against third party users, it discloses more of her information to trusted third parties, exposing her to security risks in case of compromising occurring to that third party. It also intends to create a decentralized, bottom up solution to security where security follows along the arcs of an emergent “network of trust”, and if that was viable, to achieve a form of code based regulation. Through the analysis attempted in this thesis, we laid the groundwork for a refined assessment, considering the problems that Trusted Computing Initiative (TCI) faces and that are based in the intentional, systematic but sometimes misunderstood and miscommunicated difference (which as we reveal results directly in certain design choices for TC) between the conception of trust in informatics (“techno-trust”) and the common sociological concept of it. To reap the benefits of TCI and create the dynamic “network of trust”, we need the sociological concept of trust sharing the fundamental characteristics of transitivity and holism which are absent from techno-trust. This gives rise to our next visited problems which are: if TC shifts the power from the customer to the TC provider, who takes on roles previously reserved for the nation state, then how in a democratic state can users trust those that make the rules? The answer lies partly in constitutional and human rights law and we drill into those functions of TC that makes the TCI provider comparable to state-like and ask what minimal legal guarantees need to be in place to accept, trustingly, this shift of power. Secondly, traditional liberal contract law reduces complex social relations to binary exchange relations, which are not transitive and disrupt rather than create networks. Contract law, as we argue, plays a central role for {{the way in which the}} TC provider interacts with his customers and this thesis contributes in speculating of a contract law that does not result in atomism, rather “brings in” potentially affected third parties and results in holistic networks. In the same vein, this thesis looks mainly at specific ways in which law can correct or redefine the implicit and democratically not validated shift of power from customer to TC providers while enhancing the social environment and its social trust within which TC must operate...|$|R
