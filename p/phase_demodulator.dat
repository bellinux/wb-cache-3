40|$|Recently, the {{performance}} of the constant envelope OFDM (CE-OFDM) was analyzed in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) {{with the help of a}} closed-form approximated expression for the symbol error rate (SER). This expression was obtained with the assumption of having a high carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) which, in effect, linearized the <b>phase</b> <b>demodulator</b> (the <b>phase</b> <b>demodulator</b> was implemented with an arctangent calculator) and simplified the analysis.
