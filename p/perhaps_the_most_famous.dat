5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> and {{successful}} apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who {{embarked on a}} nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced {{to stay on the}} island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.|$|E
5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This {{was the first}} royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> {{example of}} [...] "sensawunda" [...] {{in all of}} science fiction {{involves}} a neologism, {{from the work of}} A. E. van Vogt (Moskowitz 1974): ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Highcliffe - (<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> Alton's <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> landmarks: 5 Grade II* Listed tower buildings, {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Narrow-Fronted Maisonette concept of the 1950s inspired by Le Corbusier) ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> {{proponent of}} the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Some Scottish kings {{were very}} {{interested}} in the development of cannon, including the unfortunate James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460. Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> example of a Scottish cannon. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Seven {{participated in}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> Stanley Cup {{challenge}} of all, that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had struck it {{rich in the}} Yukon gold rush of 1898, The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted {{in the summer of}} 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.|$|E
50|$|Ernest Beaux (8 December 1881 - 9 June 1961) was a Russian-born French perfumer who is {{best known}} for {{creating}} Chanel No. 5, which is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> world's <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> perfume.|$|R
50|$|Gerard was a 1931 {{graduate}} of Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He {{was among the}} Crawfordsville-area cartoonists known as “The Sugar Crick Art School,” Bill Holman <b>perhaps</b> being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> of <b>the</b> group.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, many of Israel's {{historical}} figures {{worked in the}} vineyards and in <b>the</b> wineries. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> were <b>the</b> first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion and his successor, Levi Eshkol.|$|R
5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters are <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that {{take advantage of the}} sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> of all Arabian {{breeding}} operations {{founded in}} Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England, founded 1878. Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including {{visits to the}} stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained {{the remainder of the}} Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> area's <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> visitor {{came on the}} Voyage of the Beagle {{commanded}} by captain Robert FitzRoy, which brought the young naturalist Charles Darwin on 23 December 1833 {{for the first of}} several visits while HMS Beagle carried out its hydrographic survey.|$|R
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|Wiltshire {{is notable}} for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that {{occupied}} southern Britain built settlements {{on the hills}} and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> Neolithic sites in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Some {{collectors}} are completists {{and seek}} {{an example of}} every type of coin within a certain category. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> of these is Louis Eliasberg, the only collector thus far to assemble {{a complete set of}} known coins of the United States.|$|E

40|$|Two initial {{observations}} may be tendered {{concerning the}} canons of interpretations: The literature, almost uniformly, discredits them; the courts, almost uniformly, employ them.

25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> of his {{students}} was the future Pope John Paul II, who was supervised by Garrigou-Lagrange for his doctoral research in the mid-1940s at the Angelicum, and whose encyclical Fides et Ratio is attributed to his training under the learned Dominican.|$|E
25|$|Ireland, {{including}} Northern Ireland, has vibrant folk traditions. The {{popularity of}} traditional instruments such as fiddles has remained throughout the centuries even as analogues in Great Britain died out. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> modern musician from Northern Ireland influenced by folk tradition is Van Morrison.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> play's <b>most</b> <b>famous</b> line—"A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!"—was re-contextualized by {{the more}} recent setting; during the climactic battle, Richard's jeep becomes stuck, hung up {{on a pile of}} debris, and his lament is cast as a plea for a mode of {{transport}} with legs rather than wheels.|$|R
