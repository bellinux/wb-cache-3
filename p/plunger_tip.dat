40|$|This is {{a report}} on the use of {{quasi-static}} tests to predict fundamental parameters for punch valve development. This report summarizes the results from low and high velocity tests performed with 0. 63 and 0. 38 cm diameter plungers, 5 cm long penetrating aluminium and composite targets. The low velocity tests, 0. 025 m/s, were performed to understand the effects and interactions of plunger diameter <b>plunger</b> <b>tip</b> shape, target material, and target support on penetration energy and plunger functionality. High velocity tests, 75 m/s, were compared to low velocity results...|$|E
30|$|The {{push-out}} {{bond strength}} test was performed using a {{universal testing machine}} (model 4411; Instron Corp., Canton, MA, USA). An acrylic device with a central orifice was adapted {{to the base of}} the machine. Each specimen was placed in the device with the top of its cavity against the acrylic surface. The bottom surface of the restoration was loaded with 1 -mm-diameter cylindrical plunger at a crosshead speed of 0.5  mm/min until failure of the tooth-composite bond at the lateral walls of the cavity. The <b>plunger</b> <b>tip</b> was positioned in a way to touch only the filling material, thereby creating no stress at the surrounding walls. The load required for failure was recorded by the testing machine and later converted into MPa values.|$|E
5000|$|Seven {{additional}} Dalek props {{were produced}} for Planet of the Daleks (1973), created by special effects professional Clifford Culley's company Westbury Design & Optical Limited. The production crew referred to these props as [...] "goons". Although fabricated using measurements and moulds taken from an existing prop, the [...] "goon" [...] Daleks exhibited minor differences {{from the original}} Shawcraft builds including the substitution of single dowel neck struts for the trefoil cross section items which were the norm up to this point. The story again called for a Dalek to cut through a metal door, on this occasion the cutting device replacing the <b>plunger</b> resembling the <b>tip</b> of a large soldering iron. This serial also featured a unique variant; the Dalek Supreme.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{designed to}} assess and compare the effects of therapeutic forms of heat and cold on the pain threshold of the normal shoulder is described. Heat and cold were both found to raise the normal pain threshold significantly, the maximum effect occurring immediately following treatment. Ice therapy was more effective than heat, but following both forms of treatment the effect rapidly declined and after thirty minutes {{there was no significant}} effect on the pain threshold. THE use of heat and cold for their analgesic properties is part of everyday practice in physiotherapy departments. Although these treatments are simple in application, they are time-consuming for patients and staff, they need expensive apparatus, and they result in increased demands for hospital transport. The continued use of such therapy is largely empirically based. In this study the effects of heat and cold on the pain threshold of both shoulders of physiotherapy students were measured and compared. METHOD The pain threshold was quantitatively assessed by means of an algesimeter similar to that originally used by Hardy et al. (1952) (Fig. 1). This apparatus consists of a plunger surrounded by a metal sleeve within which is mounted a steel spring. The force in kg. exerted on the tissues by a rounded plastic <b>tip</b> <b>plunger</b> 1 cm. in diameter is read from the scale, which indicates the degree of compression of the steel spring. The pain threshold was taken as the minimum pressure required to produce a sensation of pain. The pressure FIG. 1. —Algesimeter.

40|$|Abstract. Die {{design rule}} for {{semi-solid}} die casting (SSDC) with A 356 electromagnetic stirring (EMS) aluminum alloy, was proposed. The die design rule included inspection of machine, part requirements, parting line determination, sleeve, plunger, gating system, overflow, air vent, ejector pin, and heating line design. The specification of gating system, overflow, air vent, <b>plunger</b> <b>tip,</b> and sleeve suitable for respective part were regulated. Two steps die system of lower-positioned gate and three steps die system of center-positioned gate were manufactured for 4 automobile suspension parts, {{based on the}} die design rule. For the sound filling pattern and solidification behavior, injection speeds of 4 parts were summarized to the interval (from V 1 to V 4). As a result of observing the microstructure of 4 parts after T 6 heat treatment, primary Al-α phase was globularized and fine Si particles were distributed around the grain boundary. The mechanical properties of 4 parts with T 6 heat treatment were investigated and showed ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 330 MPa, yield strength (YS) of 250 MPa, and elongation of 7. 5 % as average...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring biases the plunger rod against the plunger retainer with the <b>plunger</b> <b>tip</b> protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and spring assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of nuclear magic numbers at extremes of isospin {{is a topic}} {{at the forefront of}} contemporary nuclear physics. N= 50 is a prime example, with increasing experimental data coming to light on potentially doubly-magic ^ 100 Sn and ^ 78 Ni at the proton-rich and proton-deficient extremes, respectively. Experimental discrepancies exist in the data for less exotic systems. In ^ 86 Kr the B(E 2; 2 ^+_ 1 → 0 ^+_ 1) value - a key indicator of shell evolution - has been experimentally determined by two different methodologies, with the results deviating by 3 σ. Here, we report on a new high-precision measurement of this value, as well as the first measured lifetimes and hence transition strengths for the 2 ^+_ 2 and 3 ^-_(2) states in the nucleus. The Doppler-shift attenuation method was implemented using the TIGRESS gamma-ray spectrometer and TIGRESS integrated <b>plunger</b> (<b>TIP)</b> device. High-statistics Monte-Carlo simulations were utilized to extract lifetimes in accordance with state-of-the-art methodologies. Lifetimes of τ(2 ^+_ 1) = 336 ± 4 (stat.) ± 20 (sys.) fs, τ(2 ^+_ 2) = 263 ± 9 (stat.) ± 19 (sys.) fs and τ(3 ^-_(2)) = 73 ± 6 (stat.) ± 32 (sys.) fs were extracted. This yields a transition strength for the first-excited state of B(E 2; 2 ^+_ 1 → 0 ^+) = 259 ± 3 (stat.) ± 16 (sys.) e^ 2 fm^ 4. The measured lifetime disagrees with the previous Doppler-shift attenuation method measurement by more than 3 σ, while agreeing well with a previous value extracted from Coulomb excitation. The newly extracted B(E 2; 2 ^+_ 1 → 0 ^+_ 1) value indicates a more sudden reduction in collectivity in the N= 50 isotones approaching Z= 40.
