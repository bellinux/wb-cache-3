40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis on cell pair formation during conjugation in Tetrahymena thermophila. Dansylcadaverine (20 μM), methylamine (20 mM), and bacitracin (2 mg/ml) prevented cell pair formation even when added poststarvation, after mixing of cells of opposite mating types (during <b>the</b> <b>prepairing</b> interaction). Chloroquine (10 and 25 μM) did not inhibit cell pair formation, leading {{to the conclusion that}} inhibition by dansylcadaverine, methylamine, and bacitracin is not due to an alkalinization of the lysosome. These results did not allow us to define the time in <b>the</b> <b>prepairing</b> interaction at which inhibition occurs, nor to identify the cellular components involved, but they did support the hypothesis that an endocytotic event(s) plays a role in the cell contact-mediated recognition which occurs during <b>the</b> <b>prepairing</b> interaction...|$|R
