25|$|A {{solution}} of sodium hydroxide in water was traditionally {{used as the}} most common <b>paint</b> <b>stripper</b> on wooden objects. Its use has become less common, because it can damage the wood surface, raising the grain and staining the colour.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} used as a <b>paint</b> <b>stripper</b> and a degreaser. In the food industry, {{it has been used}} to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare {{extracts}} of hops and other flavorings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemicals}} {{convert to}} GHB {{in the stomach}} and blood stream. γ-Butyrolactone (GBL) is one such prodrug. Other prodrugs include 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B). There may be additional toxicity concerns with these precursors. 1,4-B and GBL are normally found as pure liquids, {{though they may be}} mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use, e.g., as <b>paint</b> <b>stripper</b> or varnish thinner.|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{participating}} in an interagency task {{agreement with the}} Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Air Force to evaluate alternative technologies for aerospace depainting operations that do not adversely affect the environment. An element {{of this study is}} directed towards the evaluation of environmentally advantaged chemical <b>paint</b> <b>strippers,</b> specifically, <b>paint</b> <b>strippers</b> that do not contain methylene chloride. Eight environmentally advantaged, or alternative, chemical <b>paint</b> <b>strippers</b> and two methylene chloride, or baseline, <b>paint</b> <b>strippers</b> were obtained from various manufacturers and incorporated into the depainting study. In addition to being evaluated on their ability to remove paint, the potential of these chemicals to promote corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement was evaluated. The corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement potential of the chemical <b>paint</b> <b>strippers</b> are presented in this report...|$|R

50|$|Solvent <b>paint</b> <b>strippers</b> {{penetrate}} {{the layers of}} paint and break the bond between the paint and the object by swelling the paint.|$|R
25|$|Limonene {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} for {{cleaning}} purposes, such as the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It {{is used as a}} <b>paint</b> <b>stripper</b> and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. All-natural commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing limonene are used by philatelists to remove self-adhesive postage stamps from envelope paper.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial <b>paint</b> <b>stripper.</b> The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out". During a scene in which Roxy and Ronnie argued in the Minute Mart, Womack took a bottle of <b>paint</b> <b>stripper</b> from the shelves, but forgot to stop at the counter to pay for it before exiting.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} {{poisoning}} is {{exposure to the}} organic solvent dichloromethane, found in some <b>paint</b> <b>strippers,</b> as the metabolism of dichloromethane produces carbon monoxide.|$|R

2500|$|Around 1985, the {{pedestal}} {{of the statue}} Valor was vandalized. The word [...] "dykes" [...] (a derogatory term for lesbian) was spray-painted onto the granite. The National Park Service attempted to remove the paint with <b>paint</b> <b>stripper,</b> which failed. It then tried arsenic in 2005, which not only failed to remove the paint but also left purple streaks on the granite. Art restorer Gordon Ponsford said he would use a laser to remove the paint. However, the laser did not remove the arsenic stain.|$|E
