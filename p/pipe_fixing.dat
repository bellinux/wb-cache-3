50|$|At 9 ft {{above rail}} level, the Class 16E boiler {{centre-line}} was the highest-pitched on the SAR at the time. Because {{of this and}} {{the limitations of the}} loading gauge, the boiler was domeless with an inspection manhole on top of the boiler barrel where the dome would have been. Steam was collected through numerous small feeder <b>pipes</b> <b>fixed</b> into two collector pipes which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes then joined together to form a main steam pipe, 7 in in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator located in the smokebox. The steam pipes from the header to each cylinder were 6 in in diameter. The boiler was fitted with two large Pop safety valves mounted ahead of the firebox, one {{on either side of the}} boiler and angled about 80 degrees apart.|$|R

40|$|The airlift {{external}} circulation {{membrane bioreactor}} (AEC-MBR) {{is a new}} MBR consisting of a separated aeration tank and membrane tank with circulating <b>pipes</b> <b>fixed</b> between the two tanks. The circulating pipe is called a H circulating pipe (HCP) because of its shape. With the complex configuration, it was difficult but necessary to master the AEC-MBR&# 39;s hydraulic characteristics. In this paper, simulation and optimization of the AEC-MBR was performed using computational fluid dynamics. The distance from diffusers to membrane modules, i. e. the height of gas-liquid mixing zone (h(m)), {{and its effect on}} velocity distribution at membrane surfaces were studied. Additionally, the role of HCP and the effect of HCP&# 39;s diameter on circulation were simulated and analyzed. The results showed that non-uniformity of cross-flow velocity existed in the flat-plate membrane modules, and the problem could be alleviated by increasing hm to an optimum range (h(m) /B >= 0. 55; B is total static depth). Also, the low velocity in the boundary layer on the membrane surface was another reason for membrane fouling. The results also suggested that HCP was necessary and it had an optimum diameter to make circulation effective in the AEC-MBR...|$|R

5000|$|The Class 16E Pacific was {{designed}} by Watson and built by Henschel, who delivered six locomotives in 1935. With its 72 in diameter coupled wheels, it {{was considered to be}} the most remarkable Cape gauge express passenger locomotive ever built. The coupled wheels were the largest ever used on any less than [...] locomotive, and it had an all-up weight and tractive effort equal to or exceeding that of most Pacifics outside North America. It used rotary cam poppet valve gear driven by outside rotary shafts, which resulted in extremely free-running characteristics. It also boasted the largest fire grate on any Pacific outside North America. The Class 16E had a Watson Standard no. 3A boiler and, at 9 ft above rail level, its boiler centre-line was the highest-pitched on the SAR. This and the limitations of the loading gauge made it impossible to install a normal steam dome and its place was taken by an inspection man-hole. Steam was collected through numerous small feeder <b>pipes</b> <b>fixed</b> into two collector pipes, which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes joined together to form a main steam pipe, 7 in in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator, situated in the smokebox.|$|R

It was on a {{platform}} {{high up in the}} trees opposite a dip in the road between the two old telegraph poles. My recollection is that the tank was as high as the telegraph poles. A vertical pipe from the tank was connected to a horizontal <b>pipe</b> <b>fixed</b> {{to the top of the}} wall. This pipe had a line of small holes along its length. Opening a valve inside the wood allowed the petrol to escape under a considerable pressure head. [...] I only saw this Flamme operated once. Army personnel for the Home Guard laid on a demonstration. The petrol valve was opened and created a huge spray, which reached the opposite side of the road. I think the original idea was that a limited amount of petrol would be released, but the valve remained open. An army Sergeant with a Very pistol fired a round (from the top of the Goods Yard) into the pool of petrol in the road dip, while fuel was still coming out at force.

40|$|This report quantifies certain {{characteristics}} of the rotary bayonets and associated platform piping on the DO detector. The Vacuum Jacketed 4 -inch x 6 -inch and 1. 5 -inch x 3 -inch and the 4 -inch and 6 -inch vacuum pipe articulating jumpers are considered here. The values of greatest importance are the forces required at the bayonet moment arms given in Table II and the stresses summarized in Table III. The forces required should be noted and checked that they are acceptable to the problem. The maximum bending stresses of the vacuum pipes do not exceed 1000 psi and are essentially negligible. The 4 -inch x 6 -inch vacuum jacketed line experiences the maximum bending stress of 10, 300 psi. According to code B 31. 1, the maximum allowable bending stress is 25, 500 psi. The major sources of error in these calculations should be summarized. First, all weights used were approximations and all lengths used were scaled from drawings. Second, while the FRAME MAC{trademark} models resemble the vacuum pipe articulating jumpers, they are definitely simplified.

5000|$|In early versions, {{the valves}} or plugs {{as they were}} then called, were {{operated}} manually by the plug man but the repetitive action demanded precise timing, making automatic action desirable. This was obtained {{by means of a}} plug tree which was a beam suspended vertically alongside the cylinder from a small arch head by crossed chains, its function being to open and close the valves automatically when the beam reached certain positions, by means of tappets and escapement mechanisms using weights. On the 1712 engine, the water feed pump was attached {{to the bottom of the}} plug tree, but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head. There is a common legend that in 1713 a cock boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine self-acting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches (known as the [...] "potter cord"); however the plug tree device (the first form of valve gear) was very likely established practice before 1715, and is clearly depicted in the earliest known images of Newcomen engines by Henry Beighton (1717) (believed by Hulse to depict the 1714 Griff colliery engine) and by Thomas Barney (1719) (depicting the 1712 Dudley Castle engine).

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this research work was to solve the impact of leachate from city garbage on the environment through {{to the use of}} vetiver grass. The experiment was conducted in the Royal Working Area at the Doi Tung Development project, Chiang Rai Province, northern Thailand during 2001 - 03. The city garbage was packed in circular cement blocks, 1. 5 m diam. and 1. 5 m high. Each block was covered with topsoil to a depth of 10 cm. The leachate from the garbage was drained through a <b>pipe</b> <b>fixed</b> at 120 cm and trapped for analysis. The experimental design was an RCB with 5 replications, having 4 treatments in each replication. The treatments included: (i) control, (ii) vetiver grass planted on 50 % of the area with the spacing of 10 x 10 cm, (iii) vetiver grass planted on 75 % of the area with the spacing of 10 x 10 cm, (iv) vetiver grass planted on 100 % of the area with 10 x 10 cm spacing. Root distribution of the vetiver grass was studied using 32 P techniques. 32 P solution was injected into the garbage at the depths of 30, 60, 90, and 120 cm. The results indicated, more roots were found at 30 cm depth, but clearly declined at lower depths. The 32 P radioactivity was detected {{at the edge of the}} block for each depth. Also observed was that the dense roots of vetiver entangled and acted as a underground dam. Treatment # 4 showed the full efficiency in trapping leachate. Moreover, vetiver could absorb more macro elements when it was older. The concentration of residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and sodium absorption ratio (SAR) were f round to be extremely high in the garbage residue, making it unsuitable for normal growth of plants. Yet, the vetiver grass was able to grow in this adverse condition-a miracle plant indeed...|$|R
