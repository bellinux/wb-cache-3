40|$|Here we present, to {{the best}} of our knowledge, the first {{balanced}} light energy budget for a benthic microbial mat ecosystem, and show how the budget and the spatial distribution of the local <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> within the euphotic zone depend on the absorbed irradiance (Jabs). Our approach uses microscale measurements of the rates of heat dissipation, gross photosynthesis and light absorption in the system, and a model describing light propagation and conversion in a scattering–absorbing medium. The energy budget was dominated by heat dissipation on the expense of photosynthesis: in light-limiting conditions, 95. 5 % of the absorbed light energy dissipated as heat and 4. 5 % was channeled into photosynthesis. This energy disproportionation changed in favor of heat dissipation at increasing irradiance, with 499 % of the absorbed light energy being dissipated as heat ando 1 % used by photosynthesis at Jabs 4700 lmolphotonm 2 s 1 (4150 Jm 2 s 1). Maximum <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> varied with depth in the euphotic zone between 0. 0140. 047 O 2 per photon. Owing to steep light gradients, <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> varied differently with increasing irradiances at different depths in the euphotic zone; for example, at Jabs 4700 lmolphotonm 2 s 1, they reached around 10 % of the maximum values at depths 00. 3 mm and progressively increased toward 100 % below 0. 3 mm. This study provides the base for addressing, in much more detail, the photobiology of densely populated photosynthetic systems with intense absorption and scattering. Furthermore, our analysis has promising applications in other areas of photosynthesis research, such as plant biology and biotechnology...|$|R
25|$|Singlet oxygen {{is highly}} reactive, {{especially}} with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting {{damage caused by}} singlet oxygen reduces the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of singlet oxygen can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, singlet oxygen acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate {{play a key role}} in the decision between cell acclimation or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.|$|E
2500|$|Since RuBisCO {{is often}} rate-limiting for {{photosynthesis}} in plants, {{it may be}} possible to improve <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiency</b> by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase catalytic activity and/or decrease oxygenation rates. This could improve biosequestration of [...] and be an important climate change strategy. Approaches under investigation include transferring RuBisCO genes from one organism in another organism,engineering Rubisco activase from thermophilic cyanobacteria into temperature sensitive plants, increasing the level of expression of RuBisCO subunits, expressing RuBisCO small chains from the chloroplast DNA, and altering RuBisCO genes to increase specificity for carbon dioxide or otherwise increase the rate of carbon fixation.. Although, as the levels of CO2 rise, efforts to increase specificity for CO2 may be unnecessary.|$|E
2500|$|One avenue is to {{introduce}} RuBisCO variants with naturally high specificity {{values such as}} the ones from the red alga Galdieria partita into plants. This may improve the <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of crop plants, although possible negative impacts have yet to be studied. Advances in this area include the replacement of the tobacco enzyme with that of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum. In 2014, two transplastomic tobacco lines with functional RuBisCO from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (Se7942) were created by replacing the RuBisCO with the large and small subunit genes of the Se7942 enzyme, in combination with either the corresponding Se7942 assembly chaperone, RbcX, or an internal carboxysomal protein, CcmM35. Both mutants had increased [...] fixation rates when measured as carbon molecules per RuBisCO. [...] However, the mutant plants grew more slowly than wild-type.|$|E

40|$|In a hypersaline {{mangrove}} {{scrub forest}} in northern Florida, coexisting trees of Laguncularia racemosa and Avicennia germinans were either fertilized with nitrogen or phosphorus, or not fertilized (controls). We aimed {{to test whether}} nutrient additions differentially altered photosynthetic performance and resource utilization in these two species. In control trees, photosynthetic rates were higher in L. racemosa than A. germinans. However, leaf nitrogen concentrations were higher in A. germinans than L. racemosa. Avicennia germinans responded to fertilization with nitrogen by increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations and rates of photosynthesis such that they were equivalent to photosynthesis in L. racemosa. Laguncularia racemosa did not show a response to nitrogen additions. Neither species showed strong responses to phosphorus fertilization. Avicennia germinans had high <b>photosynthetic</b> water-use <b>efficiency</b> (photosynthesis/transpiration), but low <b>photosynthetic</b> nitrogen-use <b>efficiency</b> (photosynthesis/leaf nitrogen).
