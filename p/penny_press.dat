2500|$|Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone {{developed}} this new role further by projecting [...] "images" [...] of {{themselves to the}} public.

2500|$|While Hearst's {{many critics}} {{attribute}} the Journal's incredible success to cheap sensationalism, as Kenneth Whyte noted in The Uncrowned King: The Sensational Rise Of William Randolph Hearst, [...] "Rather than racing to the bottom, he [...] drove the Journal and the <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> upmarket. The Journal was a demanding, sophisticated paper by contemporary standards. [...] " [...] Though yellow journalism {{would be much}} maligned, [...] "All good yellow journalists... sought the human in every story and edited without fear of emotion or drama. They wore their feelings on their pages, believing it was an honest and wholesome way to communicate with readers." [...] But, as Whyte pointed out, [...] "This appeal to feelings is not an end in itself... our emotions tend to ignite our intellects: a story catering to a reader's feelings is more likely than a dry treatise to stimulate thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{literature}} of the Renaissance is not monolithic: the royal court, the universities, the general public, the [...] "noblesse de robe", the provincial noble, and the humanist all encountered different influences and developed different tastes. [...] Humanist theater would come slowly to the general public; the old warrior class discovered court etiquette and polished manners only over time; and the extravagance of the Italian-inspired court was frequently criticized by detractors. [...] Literacy itself {{is an important issue}} in the dissemination of the texts of the Renaissance: the culture of the 16th century remains profoundly oral, and the short story, the chivalric novel and Rabelais's works make this orality a central part of their style. Finally, the Renaissance book was a physical and economic object of great scarcity and [...] depending on its size and illustrations [...] of great prestige. [...] A library such as Montaigne's was a rare occurrence for people other than lawyers and members of parliament who had had an elite education in the universities; for the public, the broadsheet or <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> (with woodcut illustrations) sold door to door by colporters would have been their only access to the written word.|$|E

2500|$|Despite these exceptions, Number 10 {{has been}} known as the Prime Minister's {{official}} home for over one hundred years. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, photography and the <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> had linked Number 10 in the public mind with the premiership. The introduction of films and television would strengthen this association. Pictures of prime ministers with distinguished guests at the door became commonplace. With or without the Prime Minister present, visitors had their picture taken. Suffragettes posed {{in front of the door}} when they petitioned H. H. Asquith for women's rights in 1913, a picture that became famous and was circulated around the world. In 1931, Mohandas Gandhi, wearing the traditional homespun dhoti, posed leaving Number 10 after meeting with Ramsay MacDonald to discuss India's independence. This picture, too, became famous especially in India. The freedom fighters could see their leader had been received in the Prime Minister's home. Couse's elegant, understated door—stark black, framed in cream white with a bold white [...] "10" [...] clearly visible—was the perfect backdrop to record such events. Prime Ministers made historic announcements from the front step. Waving the Anglo-German Agreement of Friendship, Neville Chamberlain proclaimed [...] "Peace with honour" [...] in 1938 from Number 10 after his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich.

60|$|The {{newspaper}} disseminates ideas. So, too, {{does the}} book and the pamphlet, and so far as these latter are concerned, their distribution does not at present rest in the same degree upon their value as vehicles of advertisement. They are saleable things unaided. The average book of to-day at its nominal price of six shillings pays in itself and supports its producers. So in a lesser degree does the sixpenny pamphlet, but neither book nor pamphlet reach so wide a public as the halfpenny and <b>penny</b> <b>press.</b> The methods and media of the book trade have grown up, no man designing them; they change, and no one is able to foretell the effect of their changes. At present there is a great movement to cheapen new books, and it would seem the cheapening is partly to be made up for in enhanced sales and partly by an increased use of new books for advertisement. Many people consider this cheapening of new books as being detrimental to the interests of all but the most vulgarly popular authors. They believe it will increase the difficulty of new writers, and hopelessly impoverish just the finest element in our literary life, those original and exceptional minds who demand educated appreciation and do not appeal to the man in the street. This {{may or may not be}} true; the aspect of interest to Socialists is that here is a process going on which is likely to produce the most far-reaching results upon the collective mind, upon that thought-process of the whole community which is necessary for the progressive organization of Society. It is a process which is likely to spread one type of writer far and wide, which may silence or demoralize another, which may vulgarize and debase discussion, and which will certainly make literature far more dependent than it is at present upon the goodwill of advertising firms. Yet as Socialists they have no ideas whatever in this matter; their project of activities ignores it altogether....|$|E

5000|$|Elijah Pierson (1784-1834) was a {{successful}} New York businessman and preacher who {{is best known for}} his later involvement with Robert Matthews ("The Prophet Matthias"). He was born in Morristown, New Jersey and was raised as a religious perfectionist Presbyterian, believing in God's direct interaction in the world in correlation to individual or collective sins. Around 1800, he moved to New York City and began work as a clerk and later as a merchant. He remained unmarried, working on Pearl Street as a merchant, until his 1822 when he met and Sarah Stanford. The two were married and became heavily involved in mission work on Bowery Hill and Five Points, rejecting Yankee Presbyterian in favor of egalitarianism and retrenchment. After eight years of marriage, Sarah died from overwork, driving Elijah mad. During her funeral, Elijah attempted to raise her from the dead, declaring himself [...] "Elijah the Tishbite". His distress over the will of God helped Robert Matthews persuade him to help fund his [...] "Kingdom" [...] in 1832. On July 28, 1834 in Sing Sing, New York, after eating a couple plates of blackberries, Elijah died of poisoning. Robert Matthews was accused and the case became extremely popular in the local <b>penny</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|R

Some early {{publications}} include [...] "Meet the Care Bear Cousins" [...] (based on the first movie), [...] "Sweet Dreams for Sally", [...] "The Witch Down the Street", [...] "The Trouble with Timothy", and [...] "A Sister for Sam."

6000|$|I {{am not a}} sentimentalist; {{therefore}} {{it is not a}} great consolation to me to see all these people breveted as [...] "Heroes" [...] by the <b>penny</b> and halfpenny <b>Press.</b> It is no consolation at all. In extremity, in the worst extremity, the majority of people, even of common people, will behave decently. It's a fact of which only the journalists don't seem aware. Hence their enthusiasm, I suppose. But I, who am not a sentimentalist, {{think it would have been}} finer if the band of the Titanic had been quietly saved, instead of being drowned while playing--whatever tune they were playing, the poor devils. I would rather they had been saved to support their families than to see their families supported by the magnificent generosity of the subscribers. I am not consoled by the false, written-up, Drury Lane aspects of that event, which is neither drama, nor melodrama, nor tragedy, but the exposure of arrogant folly. There is nothing more heroic in being drowned very much against your will, off a holed, helpless, big tank in which you bought your passage, than in dying of colic caused by the imperfect salmon in the tin you bought from your grocer.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, New Jersey {{residents}} Heung Ju Yi and Kyung Hee brought their 3-year-old son, Ethan, to the zoo to visit the popular [...] "Dinosaur Safari" [...] exhibit. After buying their tickets, {{each member of the}} family was given a free souvenir <b>pressed</b> <b>penny</b> as a gift promoting the exhibit. Soon afterward, Ethan swallowed the coin and began choking. His mother, Kyung, said she'd, [...] "thought he'd died." [...] Unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the coin from his throat were followed by rushing the boy to an emergency medical clinic, where X-rays showed it had entered his stomach. The next day, further X-rays revealed that the coin was not passing naturally, and surgery was required to remove it. Two days later, Ethan was put under general anesthesia, and the coin was removed via endoscopy. The surgery revealed that the zinc in the coin had reacted with his stomach acid and begun to dissolve, creating jagged edges that cut the inside of his stomach. The family, which did not have health insurance, were charged over $50,000 for this. In early 2014, the family pressed charges against the zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society for unspecified damages. They claimed the zoo endangered their son since the employee who handed them the coins handed Ethan's directly to him and gave no warning about the choking hazards of small coins.|$|R
50|$|<b>Penny</b> <b>press</b> {{newspapers}} were cheap, tabloid-style newspapers mass-produced in the United States from the 1830s onwards. Mass production of inexpensive newspapers became possible following {{the shift from}} hand-crafted to steam-powered printing.

50|$|The <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> {{was most}} {{noted for its}} price - only one cent per paper - while other {{contemporary}} newspapers were priced around six cents per issue. The exceptionally low price popularized the newspaper in America, and extended {{the influence of the}} newspaper media to the poorer classes. The <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> made the news and journalism more important, and also caused newspapers to begin {{to pay more attention to}} the public they served. Editors realized that the information that interested the upper class did not necessarily interest the penny-paying public. These new newspaper readers enjoyed information about police and criminal cases. The main revenue for the <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> was advertising while other newspapers relied heavily on high priced subscriptions to finance their activities.|$|E

50|$|The <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> {{newspapers}} {{became more}} widely read because journalists made {{the effort to}} keep their content understandable to less educated audiences. They also focused on investigating topics with more factual-based information rather than opinion-based articles, which gave the paper a less biased form of news than the elite newspapers, which were often published by those with special interests. News items and stories were also shorter than those found in elite papers. It was also believed that the working-class audiences would not have enough free time to read longer editorials, hence the shorter and more concise editorials. Human interest stories were also popular with the <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> audiences. Such items took up more space compared to earlier, more expensive papers that used human interest stories more as filler content. The New York penny papers were particularly known for publishing stories about interesting personalities and covering {{different aspects of the}} human condition. To connect with the urban, mostly working-class readership, New York reporters wrote about ordinary people and their experiences. They also wrote about the stock market, entertainers, politics, sports, and weather, all of which became important news and are still considered absolute necessities in a newspaper, thanks to the <b>penny</b> <b>press.</b> Reporters strove to deliver news in a timely manner and sometimes relied on the electric telegraph to gather and share information. <b>Penny</b> <b>press</b> journalists were the first people to report on crises and crime news, something that has become a staple in newspapers since. Continuing reports on the same story were introduced in <b>penny</b> <b>press</b> papers and were read by thousands of people on the same day. This, in combination with the speed of news delivery and thoroughness in the coverage of local news, forever changed the direction of American journalism.|$|E
