25|$|The <b>pre-operative</b> and {{post-operative}} care, facility fees, anesthesia, and medications must {{be taken}} into consideration when reviewing surgery costs. No surgeries are a guaranteed success and therefore a second procedure or a touch-up may be required to achieve the desired appearance. These costs are typically not included in the original cost.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms {{has proven to}} be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using <b>pre-operative</b> data.|$|E
25|$|Prior to surgery, {{the patient}} is given a medical examination, {{receives}} certain <b>pre-operative</b> tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol {{the night before the}} procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on <b>pre-operative</b> medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{transgender}} women {{report a}} significant reduction in libido, depending on the dosage of antiandrogens. A small number of post-operative transgender women take low doses of testosterone to boost their libido. Many <b>pre-operative</b> transgender women wait until after reassignment surgery to begin an active sex life. Raising the dosage of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the libido of some transgender women.|$|E
25|$|In Goodwin v United Kingdom the Court {{ruled that}} a law which still {{classified}} post-operative transsexual persons under their <b>pre-operative</b> sex, violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex.

25|$|The {{cause of}} capsular {{contracture}} is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and hematoma. The surgical implantation procedures that {{have reduced the}} incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a textured surface (polyurethane-coated); limited <b>pre-operative</b> handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions.|$|E

With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Tendon {{transfers}} are {{prescribed for}} young, active cuff-tear patients who experience weakness and decreased range of motion, but little pain. The technique {{is not considered}} appropriate for older people, or those with <b>pre-operative</b> stiffness or nerve injuries. People diagnosed with glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff anthropathy often undergo hemiarthroplasty, which entails replacement of the humerus portion of the shoulder joint. Elderly patients with recurring cuff tears and degenerative glenohumeral arthritis sometimes receive total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement). Another surgery, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, is effective for others.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} or complement to weight-bearing exercise and medication, canine hydrotherapy may speed recovery after operations or slow {{the progression of}} degenerative conditions. It {{may be used as}} a <b>pre-operative</b> fitness regime to allow a dog to maintain condition before an operation if it can not exercise normally. When a congenital condition is identified in a puppy, it may be the case that surgery is not possible until the animal is physically mature; during the period preceding the surgery, hydrotherapy can be employed to maintain the dog's condition.|$|E
25|$|The medical {{treatment}} {{records for the}} reduction mammoplasty are established with <b>pre-operative,</b> multi-perspective photographs of the oversized breasts, the sternal-notch–to-nipple distances, and the nipple-to–inframammary-fold distances. The woman is instructed about {{the purposes of the}} breast reduction surgery, the achievable corrections, the expected final size, shape, and contour of the reduced breasts, the expected final appearance of the breast reduction scars; possible changes in the sensation of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), possible changes in her breast-feeding capability, and possible medical complications. The woman also is instructed about post-operative matters such as convalescence and the proper care of the surgical wounds to the breasts.|$|E
25|$|Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation {{requires}} exact {{positioning of}} the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root {{is considered to be}} optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on <b>pre-operative</b> CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre-operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on <b>pre-operative</b> CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic efforts then {{shift to}} {{determining}} the type- elevated ammonia levels or abnormal organic acids can indicate specific, rare types. Intrauterine growth retardation and other perinatal problems raise {{the possibility of}} transience, while large birthweight suggests {{one of the more}} persistent conditions. Genetic screening is now available within a useful time frame for some of the specific conditions.It is worthwhile to identify the minority of severe cases with focal forms of hyperinsulinism because these can be completely cured by partial pancreatectomy. A variety of <b>pre-operative</b> diagnostic procedures have been investigated but none has been established as infallibly reliable. Positron emission tomography is becoming the most useful imaging technique.|$|E
25|$|The study Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis (2007), {{reported}} that the women attributed their improved self image, self-esteem, and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases that ranged from 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which data supported the 78.6 per cent increase in the woman’s libido, relative to her <b>pre-operative</b> level of libido. Therefore, before agreeing to any surgery, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman’s mental health to determine if breast implants can positively affect her self-esteem and sexual functioning.|$|E
25|$|In a breast-reconstruction procedure, {{within a}} {{multi-stage}} reconstruction-mammoplasty, a tissue expander (a temporary breast-implant device) is emplaced {{and used to}} prepare (shape and enlarge) the recipient site (implant-pocket) to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis. In a non-implant breast-augmentation procedure, some fat-graft injection approaches feature tissue-engineering, which is the <b>pre-operative,</b> external expansion of the tissues of the recipient site to receive the grafts of adipocyte tissue drawn from the woman's body. Non-surgical approaches to breast augmentation can consist either of an externally applied vacuum-device that will expand the tissues of the recipient site. Moreover, in most instances of fat-graft breast augmentation the increase is of medium volumeusually one brassière cup-size or lesswhich usually is the physiologic limit allowed by the metabolism of the woman's body.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} the patient's suitability for undergoing a rhinoplasty procedure, the surgeon clinically evaluates {{him or her}} with a complete medical history (anamnesis) to determine his or her physical and psychological health. The prospective patient must explain to the physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems {{that he or she}} suffers. The surgeon asks about the ailments' symptoms and their duration, past surgical interventions, allergies, drugs use and drugs abuse (prescription and commercial medications), and a general medical history. Furthermore, additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patient's psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeon's <b>pre-operative</b> evaluation of the patient. In the case of men, the surgeon must identify prospective patients presenting the mental traits denoted by the psychiatric acronym SIMON (single, immature, male, over-expectant, and narcissistic), which might indicate a man over-valuing the outcome of a rhinoplasty.|$|E
25|$|AF often occurs after {{cardiac surgery}} {{and is usually}} self-limiting. It is {{strongly}} associated with age, preoperative hypertension, {{and the number of}} vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension preoperatively {{to reduce the risk of}} AF. Also, people with a higher risk of AF, e.g., people with <b>pre-operative</b> hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. Postoperative pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic postoperative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF. When AF occurs, management should primarily be rate and rhythm control. However, cardioversion may be employed if the person is hemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases, anticoagulation should be used.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine <b>pre-operative</b> chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{an ancient}} medical {{specialty}} that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage <b>pre-operative,</b> post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery, urology, vascular surgery, and pediatric surgery. In some centers, anesthesiology {{is part of the}} division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{consultation}} — The {{plastic surgeon}} explains {{the technical and}} aesthetic considerations of the breast lift operation to the woman. That the B technique mastopexy yields improved aesthetic results with a breast-skin pedicle created with a curvilinear incision (an inverted, upper-case letter-B). That said curvilinear incision technique eliminates the medial vertical incision of the Anchor mastopexy, and so creates a lifted bust with breasts of natural size, appearance, and contour, and few surgical scars. The consultation includes detailed, <b>pre-operative,</b> post-operative, and healing-stage photographs that illustrate {{the nature and extent}} of the mastopexy incisions and the resultant scars. That the full healing (scar maturation) might require approximately one year to establish the final contour of the lifted breasts, after the suspensory ligaments and the parenchymal tissue have settled into and upon the chest as an aesthetically satisfactory bust of natural size, appearance, and contour.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the <b>pre-operative</b> {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|E
25|$|The {{plastic surgeon}} delineates the mastopexy incision-plan upon the patient’s breasts and torso; the {{principal}} corrective consideration {{is the correct}} level of the nipple-areola complex upon the breast hemisphere. In most women, the nipple should be located at, or slightly above, the inframammary fold, because emplacing it too high might later lead to a difficult revision surgery. The proper topographic locale for the nipple is determined by transposing the semicircular line of the inframammary fold to {{the face of the}} breast (anterior aspect), thereby configuring a circle, wherein the nipple-areola complex is centred. After determining the nipple locale, the surgeon delineates the remaining skin incisions of the correction, while maintaining the inferior limit of the vertical-incision at a distance above the <b>pre-operative</b> inframammary-fold, which precaution avoids extending the surgical scar to the chest wall after the lifting of the breast and the inframammary fold.|$|E
25|$|After residency, {{students}} take a board examination {{conducted by the}} college of medicine of Guatemala, the Universidade De San Carlos De Guatemala (Medicine Faculty Examination Board), and a chief physician who represents the health care ministry {{of the government of}} Guatemala. The examination includes a written section, an oral section, and a special examination of skills and knowledge relating to anaesthetic instruments, emergency treatment, <b>pre-operative</b> care, post-operative care, intensive care units, and pain medicine. After passing the examination, the college of medicine of Guatemala, Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala and the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala grants the candidate a special license to practice anaesthesia as well as a diploma issued by the Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala granting the degree of physician with specialization in anaesthesia. Anaesthetists in Guatemala are also subject to yearly examinations and mandatory participation in yearly seminars on the latest developments in anaesthetic practice.|$|E
25|$|The usual breast {{augmentation}} {{patient is}} a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body (self image), {{and a history of}} having endured criticism (teasing) about the aesthetics of her person. The studies Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients (2003) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone psychotherapy, suffered low self-esteem, presented frequent occurrences of psychological depression, had attempted suicide, and suffered body dysmorphiaa type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and {{the quality of life of}} the women, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory sexual functioning. Furthermore, most of the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implants; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8.0 per cent of breast augmentation patients had a <b>pre-operative</b> history of psychiatric hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (<b>pre-operative)</b> state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite prosthesis. The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because {{with the passage of time}} the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pre-operative</b> {{assessment}} of patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This {{means that the}} patients are asked to define their goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Functional deﬁcits can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at the individual level rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as dressing, grooming). It is useful to make a distinction between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E
