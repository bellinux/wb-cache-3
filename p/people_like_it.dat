500|$|Despite the novel's immense {{popularity}} upon publication, it has {{not received}} the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is [...] "an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined". Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller ("If that many <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> it can't be any good.") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.|$|E

The director worked 17 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, {{for much of the}} schedule. Del Toro took a new approach to directing actors, allowing [...] "looser" [...] movements and improvisation; the director maintained tight control over the production: [...] "Everything, 100% goes through me sooner or later.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the debut}} of the show on BBC Three, a second series was soon commissioned. Speaking about the second series, Corden said [...] "It's the show {{that we wanted to}} make.

We hope the viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it", while Jones said [...] "Series one had a very {{specific}} storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding. We don't have the same type of storyline in the second series. It's now girl lives with boy's parents in Essex and the joys that might entail." ...|$|E

After a fan spent the majority of a concert shouting for it, the band decided to play it to [...] "see what the reaction is, {{just to see how}} it feels.'" [...] O'Brien said of the song in 2017: [...] "It's nice to play for the right reasons. <b>People</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> and want to hear it. We do err towards not playing it because you don't want it to feel like show business. But we started throwing it in last year." [...] In the same interview, Yorke said: [...] "It can be cool sometimes, but other times I want to stop halfway through and be like, 'Nah, this isn't happening.'" [...] Later that year, the band performed the song during the encore of their headline performance at the Glastonbury Festival.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. <b>People</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} preservation is by salting or outdoor wind-drying. The wind-drying takes around eight weeks. The salting {{is usually}} done {{by putting the}} meat and the blubber in salt, {{a little bit of}} water can be added, it should be so salty, that a potato can float in it. The meat and blubber can be eaten when needed, it can last {{for a very long time}} when lying in salt. It can not be eaten directly as it would be too salty, it must be [...] "watered out" [...] for one to 1½ day, it depends how salty <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> After that the meat must be boiled, the blubber can be boiled or eaten as it is. Today many people also freeze the meat and the blubber, but the traditional way of storage is still practiced, particularly in the villages, and the food lasts longer that way. The Faroese people are aware of the fact that the pilot whales, just like many other ocean mammals, are contaminated and that they should not eat the meat and blubber so often. In some areas there are no whalings for years, and then the people there do not have any whale food unless they get some from relatives or friends from other areas who have enough and wish to share.|$|E

I'm glad <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> and still <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> though I think some of that is nostalgia and a tendency to romanticise peoples' first albums, as though later ones must somehow be less 'authentic'.

2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E
