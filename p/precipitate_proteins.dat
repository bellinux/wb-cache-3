50|$|Phlorotannins are {{a type of}} tannins {{found in}} brown algae such as kelps and {{rockweeds}} or sargassacean species, and in a lower amount also in some red algae. Contrary to hydrolysable or condensed tannins, these compounds are oligomers of phloroglucinol (polyphloroglucinols). As they are called tannins, {{they have the ability}} to <b>precipitate</b> <b>proteins.</b> It has been noticed that some phlorotannins have the ability to oxidize and form covalent bonds with some proteins. In contrast, under similar experimental conditions three types of terrestrial tannins (procyanidins, profisetinidins, and gallotannins) apparently did not form covalent complexes with proteins.|$|E

5000|$|Chicory {{is highly}} {{digestible}} for ruminants {{and has a}} low fiber concentration. Chicory roots are an [...] "excellent substitute for oats" [...] for horses due to their protein and fat content. Chicory contains a low quantity of reduced tannins that may increase protein utilization efficiency in ruminants. Some tannins reduce intestinal parasites. (Excessively large quantities of tannins, however, could bind with and <b>precipitate</b> <b>proteins,</b> resulting in low digestibility and nutrient reduction.) Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India, much development of chicory for use with livestock {{has taken place in}} New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Tannins are {{classified}} as ergastic substances, i.e., non-protoplasm materials found in cells. Tannins, by definition, <b>precipitate</b> <b>proteins.</b> In this condition, they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process. Idioblasts are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain non-living substances. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin or pigments etc. They also can contain tannins. In Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruits, tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells, which are idioblasts of parenchyma cells in the flesh.|$|E
50|$|Tannins can be {{toxic to}} ruminants, {{in that they}} <b>precipitate</b> <b>proteins,</b> making them {{unavailable}} for digestion, and they inhibit the absorption of nutrients by reducing the populations of proteolytic rumen bacteria. Very high levels of tannin intake can produce toxicity that can even cause death. Animals that normally consume tannin-rich plants can develop defensive mechanisms against tannins, such as the strategic deployment of lipids and extracellular polysaccharides that have a high affinity to binding to tannins. Some ruminants (goats, deer, elk, moose) are able to consume feed high in tannins (leaves, twigs, bark) due to the presence in their saliva of tannin-binding proteins.|$|E
40|$|The major antinutritive {{factor in}} Leucaena for {{ruminants}} is condensed tannin (CT). CT bind proteins, incurring {{a negative effect}} on protein utilisation. The two major factors affecting the ability of CT to bind protein have been purported to be CT size and the pH of the reaction environment. To test these hypotheses the <b>protein</b> <b>precipitating</b> capacities of CT extracted from four promising Leucaena genotypes, L. leucocephala (K 636), L. pallida (CQ 3439), L. trichandra (CPI 46568), and L. collinsii (OFI 52 / 88) were assessed. L. leucocephala had approximately half the ability to <b>precipitate</b> <b>protein</b> on a g/g basis than L. pallida or L. trichandra while L. collinsii gave no measurable ability to <b>precipitate</b> <b>protein</b> (reaction environment=pH 5. 0). Increasing or decreasing the pH of the reaction solution away from pH 5. 0 (the isoelectric point of the protein) reduced the ability of CT from all the species to precipitate protein; the decrease being higher a pH 2. 5 than at pH 7. 5. At pH 2. 5 L. leucocephala CT completely lost its capacity to <b>precipitate</b> <b>protein.</b> The relatively poor ability of L. leucocephala CT to bind protein at pHs approximating those at the abomasum suggests L. leucocephala may have the greatest potential of the four Leucaenas tested for increasing the extent of feed protein escaping ruminant degradation for later release and digestion in the small intestine, hence increasing the total amount of protein absorbed by ruminants. CT fractions from each Leucaena were also separated into individual CTs, by size-exclusion chromatography and examined for <b>protein</b> <b>precipitating</b> capacity. In general {{it was found that the}} larger sized CT of the accessions L. pallida and L. trichandra could <b>precipitate</b> more <b>protein</b> than the smaller sized CT.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{differently}} sized condensed tannins from the genus Leucaena, a fodder tree-legume, to bind protein at different pH values was evaluated to characterise their potential biological effects. Two factors affecting {{the ability of}} condensed tannin to bind protein, its major biological activity, have been purported to be the condensed tannin size and the pH of the reaction environment. To test these hypotheses, the protein-precipitating capacities of condensed tannin extracted from four Leucaena genotypes, L leucocephala (UHK 636), L pallida (CQ 3439), L trichandra (CP 146568) and L collinsii (OFI 52 / 88), were assessed. Condensed tannin from L leucocephala had approximately 50 % {{of the ability to}} <b>precipitate</b> <b>protein</b> on a gg(- 1) basis than L pallida or L trichandra, while L collinsii gave no measurable ability to <b>precipitate</b> <b>protein</b> (reaction environment pH 5. 0).
