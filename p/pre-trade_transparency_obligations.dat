Transparency also reduces and reduces extreme order placement by individual investors as they are better informed about how to place orders. Second, increasing transparency also changes trader order sizes. Institutional investors make smaller orders with increas-ing transparency, while individual investors make larger orders. Generally, greater transparency increases volatility, but not liquidity and efficiency.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays studying on over-the-counter trading (OTC henceforth). In Chapter 1, I model {{the formation of the}} inter-dealer network in an OTC market, and study how the network affects prices and volumes in the market. The model explains the empirically observed core-periphery network with dealers' capacity of providing liquidity. Specifically, dealers with large capacity comprise the core of the network, connecting them to all other dealers, while dealers who have small capacity operate at the periphery. In addition, my model matches the empirical finding on the negative relation between markups and order sizes. Furthermore, I show that there may be structural breaks in this negative relationship as variations in order sizes may alter the inter-dealer network. These results suggest that empirical studies on OTC markets should control for the stability of an inter-dealer network to avoid model misspecification. Chapter 2 evaluates how a centralized market could provide an incentive for OTC dealers to reduce opacity in trading. In this chapter, opacity is modeled as Knightian uncertainty faced by investors. I find that while a competitive centralized market provides an incentive for dealers to reduce opacity in an OTC market, a noncompetitive centralized market does the opposite. Competition between the competitive centralized market and the OTC market forces dealers in the latter to reduce opacity. With the noncompetitive centralized market, opportunities for collusion provide an incentive for dealers to increase opacity. Dealers do not have the incentive to reduce opacity in this case. In Chapter 3, we test the model implications in Chapter 2 with an empirical study on the corporate bond markets, and find consistent results. We find that transaction costs of bonds traded only in OTC markets are significantly different from (10 basis points larger than) bonds traded both in OTC markets and the NYSE market. Since the latter contains pre-trade information from the NYSE market, this finding suggests that <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> reduces bonds' trading costs. This result implies that <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> benefits investors but hurts dealers, as the major part of dealers' profits comes from investors' trading costs. We also find that <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> increases bonds' values. Bonds with the NYSE <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> have significantly lower bond yields than bonds without the <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency.</b> Our findings are robust to endogeneity of firms' bond listing decisions on the NYSE. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{increasing}} <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> using data from the Taiwanese stock market which has experienced a gradual increase in transparency. Specifically, we analyze the influence of transparency on the order placement strategies of individual as well as institutional investors, and its effect on market performance. We find that as the <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> increases, the percent of the most aggressive orders decreases significantly while that of the other inside-quote orders increases. Furthermore, the percent of the most conservative orders declines mildly for the institutional investors as market transparency enhances, while the opposite is true for individual investors. Our results indicate greater <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> intensifies the competition in order placement strategy especially for institutional investors, {{at the same time it}} reduces the extreme orders placement of institutional investors. All investors get smarter in placing orders and reduce unnecessary high-cost orders when the market is more transparent. Compared with institutional investors, the individual investors seem to be more patient as order flow information is disclosed, suggesting liquidity providers are mainly individuals. The result of the intraday analysis shows that the intraday pattern of each order category does not change much as transparency increases, the intraday pattern of the more aggressive orders is U-shaped while that of the least aggressive orders is inverse J-shaped. Generally speaking, greater transparency increases price volatility, while it does not improve market liquidity or efficiency.

40|$|This paper investigates an {{important}} feature of market design: <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency,</b> defined as the availability of information about pending trading interest in the market. We {{look at how the}} NYSE’s introduction of OpenBook, which enables traders off the exchange floor to observe depth in the limit order book in real time, affects the trading strategies of investors and specialists, informational efficiency, liquidity, and returns. We find that traders attempt to manage the exposure of their limit orders: the cancellation rate increases, time-to-cancellation shortens, and smaller orders are submitted. The new information OpenBook provides seems to cause traders to prefer managing the trading process themselves, rather than delegating this task to floor brokers. We also show that specialists’ participation rate in trading decreases and the depth they add to the quote goes down, consistent with a loss of their informational advantage or with being "crowded out" by active limit order strategies. We detect an improvement in the informational efficiency of prices after the introduction of OpenBook. Greater <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> leads to some improvement in displayed liquidity in the book and a reduction in the execution costs of trades. We find that cumulative abnormal returns are positive following the introduction of OpenBook, consistent with the view that improvement in liquidity affects stock returns. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{framework}} {{for the assessment of}} financial market liquidity and identifies two types: search liquidity and systemic liquidity. Search liquidity, i. e. liquidity in “normal” times, is driven by search costs required for a trader to find a willing buyer for an asset he/she is trying to sell or vice versa. Search liquidity is asset specific. Systemic liquidity, i. e. liquidity in “stressed” times, is driven by the homogeneity of investors - the degree to which one’s decision to sell is related to the decision to sell made by other market players at the same time. Systemic liquidity is specific to market participants’ behaviour. This framework proves fairly powerful in identifying the role of credit derivatives and transparency for liquidity of corporate bond markets. We have applied it to the illiquid segments of the European credit market and found that credit derivatives are likely to improve search liquidity as well as systemic liquidity. However, it is possible that in their popular use today, credit derivatives reinforce a concentration of positions that can worsen systemic liquidity. We also found that post-trade transparency has surprisingly little bearing on liquidity in that where it improves liquidity it is merely acting as a proxy for <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> or transparency of holdings. We conclude that if liquidity is the objective, <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency,</b> as well as some delayed transparency on net exposures and concentrations, is likely to be more supportive of both search and systemic liquidity than post-trade transparency.

For a given proportion of informed agents, the more trans-parent the market, the more liquid it is. With endogenous information ac-quisition this result can be reversed, since greater transparency reduces the incentive to acquire information and thus lowers the equilibrium number of informed traders. This can reduce liquidity, since in this model informed agents are natural liquidity providers.

40|$|The {{tendency}} to introduce anonymity into financial markets apparently {{runs counter to}} the theory supporting transparency. This paper studies the impact of <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> on liquidity in a market where risk-averse traders accommodate the liquidity demand of noise traders. When some risk-averse investors become informed, an adverse selection problem ensues for the others, making them reluctant to supply liquidity. Hence the disclosure of traders' identities improves liquidity by mitigating adverse selection. However, informed investors are effective liquidity suppliers, as their adverse selection and inventory costs are minimized. With endogenous information acquisition, transparency reduces the number of informed investors, thus decreasing liquidity. The type of information that traders hold {{and the effectiveness of}} insider trading regulation are crucial to distinguish between equilibria. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} ASICs minimum price improvement rule implementation on dark trading and {{the impact on the}} efficiency of Australians pre-trade transparent market for ASX listed cash equities. ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement a regulatory market design change on 26 May 2013 forcing dark-venue trades to offer at-least-one-tick-improvement on prevailing-NBBO-quote. Pre-trade transparent (lit market) and dark markets differ based on their regulatory structures. Lit markets offer <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> and fair-access whilst dark venues are <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency</b> exempt, and do not offer full and fair access to their order book. I construct a 2 SLS framework to model determinants of dark trading and use dark trading as an instrument to examine its effect and impact on market efficiency and market liquidity ex ante and ex post ASICs exogenous regulatory event. I find evidence of a decrease in asymmetric information ex post rule implementation and present evidence of decreased round trip costs of execution within the lit market after ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement. I argue the decrease in transaction costs not only evidence the rules positive effect on motivating liquidity providers to transact on the informed lit-market by influencing both informed and uninformed order flow to be less segmented, but also evidences improved market efficiency and market liquidity conditions of the Australian cash equities market. My results findings inform public debate as market operators and regulators around the world continue to expend significant financial, process, systems and people resources in an attempt to enhance market efficiency as well as identify, detect, investigate and prosecute market manipulation.

40|$|Growth {{in trading}} without <b>pre-trade</b> <b>transparency,</b> ‘dark trading’, has caused {{considerable}} concern among regulators and exchanges worldwide about {{its impact on}} market quality.

We find that low levels of dark trading, as exist in Canada, are largely beneficial, reducing quoted, effective and realized spreads and increasing informational efficiency. Our results are consistent with the notion that, to a point, dark trading increases competition among informed traders who seek to capture rents from liquidity provision while minimizing leakage of their information.

Results indicate that the large special crossings exhibit the best market quality measures in the anonymous regime. Specifically, there is a strong signal that the better informed institutions and their brokers, who are mostly active in the larger stocks gain more advantage from their position after the market reform.

Another crucial property of the model is that it distinguishes between technical and user-friendly information. This distinction makes it possible to limit the obligation to ISPs to the information for which they are in the best position to provide: the technical information on the traffic management measures that they apply, e. g., which traffic streams are subject to special treatment? Which measures are applied and when? The public availability of this technical information creates the opportunity for the other parties in the model to step in and contribute to the formulation of the user-friendly information for end users: which applications and services receive special treatment? When is their effect noticeable? It is expected that the involvement of other parties will lead to multiple, complementary routes for the formulation of the user-friendly information.

40|$|The {{principle}} of transparency in EU law’ explores a variety of <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> in European law, and offers a comprehensive framework to classify and understand those obligations. The {{principle of}} transparency is ubiquitous and multifaceted. The obligations derived from it range from a duty to allow access to documents held by the EU-institutions to a prohibition to change {{the terms of a}} contract concluded after a procurement procedure. But although transparency is a diffuse concept, it has a distinct core: the concept refers to the availability, accessibility and clarity of information. However, the concept of transparency does not in itself determine the target and the timing of <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations,</b> nor does it tell us much about the acceptability of exceptions, and whether information should be provided pro-actively or on request. The author provides a method to determine the exact nature of the <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> that can be derived from the {{principle of transparency}} in concrete situations. She explains how the application of the EU principle of transparency is affected by the manner in which transparency contributes to the realisation of a variety of goals, the context in which it is applied, and the presence of conflicting interests. The key to understanding the principle of transparency is appreciating its instrumental value. By being transparent, governments can promote democracy and individual rights, and improve economic performance. These goals are realised by means of two related but distinct mechanisms. First, transparency aids people in decision-making. Second, it allows them to see what is going on inside government. As such it is a precondition for any attempt to affect what is going on inside that government. Understanding how transparency functions is insufficient though: whether there is an obligation to be transparent is determined by the normative framework that governs the relation between the government and its citizens. This framework differs depending on whether this relation is perceived as one involving the citoyen, homo economicus, or homo dignus. For the citoyen, the overarching principle governing its relation with the government is democracy. For homo economicus, it is the promotion of the internal market and the Treaty freedoms. For homo dignus, it is the respect for human rights. The contents of the principle of transparency are determined by these higher-order principles. Because of that, we can only derive those particular <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> from it that do in fact contribute to the realisation of the state that is embodied in those higher order principles. Because transparency always functions in the same two distinct ways to bring about its positive effects – it facilitates decision-making and allows outsiders to see what public authorities are doing – our understanding of {{the manner in which it}} functions provides us with a way to determine what concrete <b>transparency</b> <b>obligations</b> we can derive from the principle of transparency, provided we know what effects the law requires us to achieve by its observance...|$|R
