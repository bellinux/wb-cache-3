In this paper we investigate the effect of <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> – as compared to continuous interference – on a receiver of digital amplitude modulated signals. To correctly receive the signals, a threshold estimate has to be computed for the proper detection of the symbols. The threshold estimate is based on average received power over an arbitrary length of time. We show that the effect of <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> on the threshold estimate is severe, as compared to that for continuous interference.

40|$|The {{detection}} of partial discharges (PD) {{can help in}} early-warning detection systems to protect critical assets in power systems. The radio-frequency emission of these events can be measured with antennas even when the equipment is in service which reduces dramatically the maintenance costs and favours the implementation of condition-based monitoring systems. The drawback of these type of measurements is the difficulty of having a reference signal to study the events in a classical phase-resolved partial discharge pattern (PRPD). Therefore, in open-air substations and overhead lines where interferences from radio and TV broadcasting and mobile communications are important sources of noise and other <b>pulsed</b> <b>interferences</b> from rectifiers or inverters can be present, {{it is difficult to}} identify whether there is partial discharges activity or not. This paper proposes a robust method to separate the events captured with the antennas, identify which of them are partial discharges and localize the piece of equipment that is having problems. The separation is done with power ratio (PR) maps based on the spectral characteristics of the signal and the identification of the type of event is done localizing the source with an array of four antennas. Several classical methods to calculate the time differences of arrival (TDOA) of the emission to the antennas have been tested, and the localization is done using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to minimize a distance function...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that GNSS receivers for aeronautical applications {{operating on the}} E 5 a/L 5 frequency band {{have to deal with}} interfered signals {{due to the fact that}} this particular portion of the frequency spectrum is shared with other radio-aiding signals.

For this reason this paper focuses on a different class of techniques operating an invertible transform of the received signal. Such new representations of the signal allow decomposing the interfered received digital signal in a set of basis function providing a representation of the incoming signal in another domain where the interference can be better identified and removed.

40|$|A {{number of}} antenna array {{techniques}} for radio interference mitigation in GNSS receivers have been intensively {{studied in the}} last two decades showing that space-only or space-time adaptive processing allows for significant improvements. These investigations were primarily focused on mitigation of continuous interference signals assumed to be of intentional nature in the “quiet” GPS L 1 band. In contrast to the L 1 band, new navigation signals of GPS/Galileo L 5 /E 5 frequency band have to share the radio spectrum with several civil and military radar systems. In a single-antenna GNSS receiver, the <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> originated from such radar systems is usually handled by using the pulse blanking or frequency extinction techniques. In an antenna array system, more efficient mitigation of <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> can be obtained by adding the spatial domain to the signal processing. In this case, the GNSS antenna array receiver may be designed in a way that allows for simultaneous mitigation of continuous and pulsed interferers. In the paper the performance of two space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques has been investigated in interference scenarios with continuous and pulsed sources by using the simulations of a software multi-antenna receiver. It has been shown that the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) processor with a corresponding directional constrain delivers both a good performance in term of code and Doppler receiver tracking errors and minimal distortions of the useful GNSS signal. The second investigated STAP technique was minimum mean square error (MMSE) processor. The effect of the number of the STAP time-taps on the performance of the MVDR and MMSE processors has been shown. The combination of the adaptive array processing with the pulse blanking has been examined showing that the simple-to-implement pulse blanking can noticeably improve the overall performance in <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the performance of}} the waveforms specified by the IEEE 802. 11 a wireless local area network standard when the signal is transmitted over a Ricean fading channel with AWGN and pulsed-noise interference. The <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> is assumed to have constant average power and is either fading or nonfading. The probability of bit error is conditional on the received signal-to-noise power ratio, which is modeled as a random variable. The probability density function of this random variable is obtained either analytically or numerically for each modulation type, and the probability of bit error is evaluated as the expected value of the conditional probability. In one case, use is made of a new technique for the numerical inverse of the Laplace transform in order to evaluate numerically the signal-to-noise ratio probability density function. Due to the complexity of the analysis when both the signal and the interference are subject to Ricean fading, the analysis was simplified by assuming Ricean signal fading with Rayleigh interference fading and vice versa. The results of the analysis show that performance is affected by the degree of signal fading and also depends on the <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> duty cycle. The signal-to-interference power ratio affects the way performance depends on these two factors. Captain, Hellenic Air Forc...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{future use}} of the Galileo E 5 and GPS L 5 bands by the civil {{aviation}} community raises new issues, notably concerning <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference.</b> These bands suffer concomitants radio frequency emissions from DME (Distance Measuring Equipment), TACAN (TACtical Air Navigation), JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) and MIDS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System) systems. These interferences, if ignored, significantly disturb GNSS receivers functioning and prevent them from meeting civil aviation requirements. In order to be used onboard civil aircrafts, the GPS L 5 and Galileo E 5 signals have to be processed so that they allow specified minimum performances. In the following, the study {{will focus on the}} E 5 a/L 5 band, as this band is more impacted by <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> than the E 5 b one [Bastide, 2004]. Also, it can be shown that the impact of JTIDS/MIDS signals on GPS L 5 and Galileo E 5 a signal processing is very low with respect to DME/TACAN signals? one. Consequently they will be omitted herein for simplification purposes. The hot spot is defined as the place where the influence of DME/TACAN signals is the largest on the victim GNSS receivers. Studying the behaviour of a GNSS receiver in this particular interference environment is necessary to guarantee the receiver reaches the minimum performance specified by civil aviation authorities. The usual Figure Of Merit (FOM) used to look at the impact of interference is the degradation of the postcorrelation C/N 0. Indeed, it constitutes a good indicator of acquisition, tracking and data demodulation performance, which are critical operations for the receiver. A GNSS receiver that would not use an Interference Mitigation Technique (IMT) would experience severe post-correlation C/N 0 degradations [Bastide, 2004]; often leading to loss of locks, in the hot spot environment. Thus, two IMTs implemented in the RF front end were proposed. The first one is called the Temporal Blanker (TB). Its digital implementation is described in [Grabowsky, 2002], and its benefits in terms of postcorrelation C/N 0 largely studied in [Bastide, 2004]. It shows that GNSS receivers using the technique would comply with ICAO requirements: using TB, no loss of lock is experienced and the C/N 0 ratio stays above the minimum requirements. On the other hand, FDAF is proposed as an algorithm that would guarantee higher C/N 0 levels in presence of interference. This has already been studied through simulation results in [Raimondi, 2008], neglecting real receivers front-end effects. In addition, the postcorrelation C/N 0 degradation was the only observed FOM, whereas some other indicators are necessary. The paper first describes the threat of introducing new GNSS signals in an already occupied band. Then, the impact of <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference,</b> in terms of post-correlation C/N 0 and AGC gain disturbance will be presented. Then the FDAF algorithm is depicted, along with its capacity to remove interference.

40|$|International audienceCivil Aviation {{standardization}} bodies (ICAO, RTCA, EUROCAE) aim at standardizing GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) {{for aircraft}} navigation. For safety reasons, on-board receivers must guarantee integrity and accuracy performance within the specified environment. The corresponding requirements are {{stated in the}} SARPS and MOPS (Minimum Operational Performance Specification), published by the quoted standardization bodies. Future use of Galileo E 5 a (or GPS L 5) band raises among others interference issues. Indeed, pre-existent RF systems emit in this band, thus interfering with the E 5 a/L 5 signals. The main threat was identified as being DME/TACAN ground beacons. These systems disturb the operation of on-board GNSS receivers in a non bearable manner if no mitigation is implemented. Two interference mitigation techniques (IMT) are proposed to fight this threat, and their performances are studied in the following. First, a baseline technique called temporal blanker {{is used as a}} reference. Its performances had already been assessed in [Bastide, 2004] and were shown to be compatible with civil aviation requirements. The idea is to detect and remove <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> by looking at the signal?s power. Taking into account that the input signal (in absence of interference) should be equivalent to a Gaussian noise, the user can assume with low false detection rate that if the incoming signal?s power is relatively high, it is corrupted by an interference. Then, an innovative technique called Frequency Domain Adaptive Filtering (FDAF) is investigated, and is expected to provide better performance than the baseline technique. The idea is to detect and remove <b>pulsed</b> <b>interference</b> in the frequency domain by looking at the amplitude of the signal?s Fourier transform because the frequency spectrum may be less distorted than the temporal signal. Nevertheless, the second technique is highly constrained by implementation issues, while the first one is not. Hence, its performance and the possible benefits brought by the technique will be presented {{as a function of the}} technique?s design...|$|E

30|$|One of the {{implementations}} of high-sensitive active sensors {{is based}} on the grating coupler effect for the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPP) [1] in the surface-barrier heterostructures with Schottky barrier [2, 3]. Today, there are several techniques of forming a diffraction grating on the semiconductor substrate, namely, the laser-induced periodic surface structures [4], extreme ultraviolet lithography [5], electron beam lithography [6], ion beam lithography [7], nanoimprint technology [8], <b>pulsed</b> laser <b>interference</b> lithography [9], and laser interference lithography [10, 11]. The latter is well known and relatively cheap method that allows to form a planar periodicity on large areas. Unfortunately, the etching of the semiconductor front interface is necessary in this method which leads to additional surface recombination in Schottky barrier [12]. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} interface “metal/semiconductor” remains flat in order to reduce the surface recombination losses in the case of plasmon-polariton photodetector based on Schottky barrier. At the same time, it is also necessary to satisfy the condition for resonant excitation of SPP, which can be implemented due to planar periodicity in the case of periodically profiled “metal/environment” interface. Recently, it has been theoretically predicted in [13] that the geometric interrelation between the profiled interfaces of a corrugated metal film increases the coupling between SPPs excited at the opposite interfaces of the metal film with the increasing of light transmittance into the semiconductor active region and the transformation of SPP peak shape from Lorenz type for films with correlated interfaces to Fano type [14] for anticorrelated interfaces.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{extension}} of life expectancy, the number of elderly people increases, and thus the number of disease and injuries of the locomotor system, especially the hip joint. One of the persistent trend is an increasing trend {{in the number of}} patients with coxarthrosis and implanted total hip endoprosthesis. One of the postoperative complications that occurred after implantation a total hip endoprosthesis is heterotopic ossification (HO). HO is the most common complication that occurs after the implantation a total hip endoprosthesis with recorded cases in the range of 9 - 90 %. HO are insufficiently understood phenomenon, which is characterized by the formation of bone in periarticular tissues. We prospectively followed patients who implanted total hip endoprostheses in the department of orthopedics ZC in Kos. Mitrovica in 2008. and 2009. year. We examined the influence of physical agents on the prevention of HO near the hip joint. In these patients the treatment was carried out kinesiotherapeutic at the Center for Rehabilitation Health Center Kosovska Mitrovica, as well as pulse therapy low frequency magnetic field frequency of 30 Hz, 30 minutes, 8 mT intensity and 15 minutes interferential current, 0 - 100 Hz frequency. All patients were on the rehabilitation of one month (20 days). Based on this research we confirmed the assumption that the use of low frequency <b>pulsed</b> magnetic fields, <b>interference</b> currents and kinesitherapy prevents HO in patients after implantation of total endoprosthesis of the hip joint...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} briefly discusses {{a research}} effort on mitigation techniques of <b>pulsed</b> radio frequency <b>interference</b> (RFI) on a Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) code. This problem is of considerable {{interest in the}} context of providing reliable communications to the space vehicle which might suffer severe degradation due to pulsed RFI sources such as large radars. The LDPC code is one of modern forward-error-correction (FEC) codes which have the decoding performance to approach the Shannon Limit. The LDPC code studied here is the AR 4 JA (2048, 1024) code recommended by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and it has been chosen for some spacecraft design. Even though this code is designed as a powerful FEC code in the additive white Gaussian noise channel, simulation data and test results show that the performance of this LDPC decoder is severely degraded when exposed to the pulsed RFI specified in the spacecraft s transponder specifications. An analysis work (through modeling and simulation) has been conducted to evaluate the impact of the pulsed RFI and a few implemental techniques have been investigated to mitigate the pulsed RFI impact by reshuffling the soft-decision-data available at the input of the LDPC decoder. The simulation results show that the LDPC decoding performance of codeword error rate (CWER) under pulsed RFI can be improved up to four orders of magnitude through a simple soft-decision-data reshuffle scheme. This study reveals that an error floor of LDPC decoding performance appears around CWER= 1 E- 4 when the proposed technique is applied to mitigate the pulsed RFI impact. The mechanism causing this error floor remains unknown, further investigation is necessary...|$|R
