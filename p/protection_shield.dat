2500|$|The game's story {{picks up}} {{shortly after the}} end of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, with the hero of the series, Sam [...] "Serious" [...] Stone, {{continuing}} his goal to defeat his nemesis, Mental. The game begins with Serious Sam being summoned before the Sirian Great Council, where the Council provides him with guidance on how to accomplish his goal to defeat Mental. The Council reveals to Sam that he must collect all five pieces of an ancient Sirian medallion, each held by various groups on five different planets, and states that once Sam has the entire medallion, Mental will be vulnerable. All the planets (except Kleer) are populated by friendly, bobble-headed humanoids, {{but the problem is that}} all the planets are under Mental's control. The Council then instructs Sam to visit all five planets in order to recreate the medallion, only then will Sam become [...] "The One". Confused at the moment and with nothing better to do, Sam accepts the mission. With the medallion finally complete, Sam is now ready to begin the final assault against the greatest enemy of humanity...Mental, who is located on Sirius, once the planet of the great Sirians that visited Earth many times, now the domain of Mental himself. But in order to gain access to Sirius, Sam is asked to storm Kronor, a moon orbiting Sirius that has a massive cannon which could be used to remove Sirius' <b>protection</b> <b>shield,</b> which was a last line of defense for the Sirians against Mental. And so, Sam's mission continues. In the endgame, Sam enters Mental Institution after disabling it and into Mental's throne room. Sam finally encounters Mental in person while the lights are off. Mental tries to reveal to Sam that he is his father, but Sam interrupts by shooting him, thus silencing Mental forever. After that, the Sirian Great Council, even the inhabitants from the planets, celebrate their long-awaited victory against Mental. When the lights come back on however, it is revealed that Mental wasn't there at all and it was instead just a speaker attached to Mental's throne, implying that he actually tricked Sam in order to escape in his starship into deep space (in the Xbox version, the game doesn't show this scene). The credits roll after that, where a dialog of three unknown people is played discussing how this ending might just be another one of Croteam's bad jokes and how big Mental's boss fight could be.|$|E

50|$|Like most shooter games, {{there is}} a life gauge on the top left corner, {{primarily}} a health bar indicating the amount of health available. In addition, {{there is a}}nother bar for energy of the suit worn. When playing as Raptor, his 'TAMSS' suit gives a spherical <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> that blocks off any bullet or explosion, though it cannot block melee attacks from enemies. Any impact on the shield drains the energy bar while keeping the player safe. When playing as Owl, his 'Vampyr's Heart' suit enables his active camouflage and three specific visions, which any, when activated drains the energy bar while giving the player usage to the suit's functions; the bar however does not drain faster when multiple applications of the suit is in use. Players can recharge the energy bars from a special recharge battery booth marked as a blue dot on the minimap. There are also health kits throughout each missions' map, seen as a spinning health box.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between equilibrium and frozen {{is important because}} it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly expanding flow that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.|$|E

40|$|Magnetization {{effects in}} the coils of superconducting {{accelerator}} magnet deteriorate the field quality at injection field level. The CERN field computation program ROXIE has recently been extended to calculate the persistent current using a semi-analytical hysteresis model for hard superconductors. The model is combined with the coupling method of finite- and boundary-elements for the calculation of the non-linear iron yoke. Thi numerical method avoids the meshing of air domains and of the superconducting coil. Disjoint ferromagnetic iron domains can be meshed independently. This allows the easy modeling of very thin layers of arbitrary shape.

40|$|Combining a {{classical}} force field, a tight-binding model, and first-principles calculations, we have studied structural, electronic, and optical properties of double-walled carbon nanotube (DWNT) bundles under hydrostatic pressure. We {{find that the}} outer tube acts as a <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> for the inner tube and the inner tube increases the structure stability {{and the ability to}} resist the pressure of the outer tube. Moreover, the collapsed structures of the double-walled carbon nanotube bundle called "parallel" and "in-between" are more stable than the one called "herringbone". The structural phase transition induces a pseudogap along symmetry line Γ X. Furthermore, the optical properties change greatly after the collapse and a strong anisotropy appears in the collapsed structure. This provides an efficient experimental way to detect structural phase transitions in DWNT bundles. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} response of double-wall carbon nanotubes {{has been investigated}} by means of Raman spectroscopy up to 10 GPa. The intensity of the radial breathing modes of the outer tubes decreases rapidly but remain observable up to 9 GPa, exhibiting a behavior similar (but less pronounced) to that of single-wall carbon nanotubes, which undergo a shape distortion at higher pressures. In addition, the tangential band of the external tubes broadens and decreases in amplitude. The corresponding Raman features of the internal tubes appear to be considerably less sensitive to pressure. All findings lead {{to the conclusion that}} the outer tubes act as a <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> for the inner tubes whereas the latter increase the structural stability of the outer tubes upon pressure application.

30|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} are highly susceptible to Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks {{due to its}} self-configuring property. Flooding DDOS attack is one form of collaborative attacks and the transport layer of such {{networks are}} extremely affected. In this paper we propose ColShield, an effective and collaborative <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> which not only detects flooding attacks but also prevents the flooding attacks through clever spoof detection. ColShield consists of Intrusion Protection and Detection Systems (IPDS) located at various points in the network which collaboratively defend flooding attacks. ColShield detects the attack node and its specific port number under attack. In {{order to reduce the}} burden on a single global IPDS, the system uses several local IPDS for the collaborative mitigation of flooding attacks. The evaluation of ColShield is done using extensive simulations and is proved to be effective in terms of false positive ratio, packet delivery ratio, communication overhead and attack detection time.|$|E

A series of experiments were undertaken to measure the impact force from dropped objects of varied mass and height on single and stacked plates of varied thickness. It was concluded {{that the combination of}} absorptive and non-absorptive materials could be beneficial; specifically, a <b>protection</b> <b>shield</b> for a subsea asset could comprise concrete at the base, polystyrene through the middle, and a thin shell layer of concrete on the outer surface.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{national}} guidelines {{issued by}} all hospital radiology departments concerning {{the use of}} gonadal <b>protection</b> <b>shields</b> for taking X-rays of the pelvis. It is important to follow these guidelines especially when paediatric X-rays are taken. Gonads are very susceptible to radiation as they fall directly {{in the line of}} radiation exposure when pelvic X-rays are taken. AIM: To examine whether these guidelines were being followed. METHODS: This audit considered 355 radiographs taken in a 6 -month period on 149 patients, under the age of 16 years, attending the orthopaedic department at King's Mill Hospital. RESULTS: In only 23 % of the cases studied, the correct use of gonad <b>protection</b> <b>shields</b> had been performed. In 67 % of the unprotected patients, the shields were not used at all. In the remainder, the shield was incorrectly applied. Out of all the patients, 45 % had more than one X-ray thus exposing the gonads to unnecessary radiation. In addition, 8 % of patients had a CT scan, 6 % had fluoroscopy and 42 % had radiographs of other regions of the body. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines should be adhered to as far as possible and efforts always be made to decrease radiation exposure. Application of the current guidelines excludes the first X-ray exposure of the female pelvis and of the pelvis of trauma patients from the use of shields, thus adding to the number of the X-rays done without protection...|$|R
