5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a <b>panoramic</b> <b>film</b> of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

30|$|Historically, the in vivo {{detection}} of changes to dental root morphology {{such as those}} associated with external root resorption (ERR) {{during the course of}} orthodontic treatment or related to trauma has been mainly through use of two-dimensional (2 D) radiographs, most notably periapical radiographs [1]-[3]. Although histological studies have identified a relatively high incidence of apical ERR, 2 D radiographic studies have been less definitive [4],[5] and have in general proven inaccurate for the reliable {{detection of}} small ERR defects [6]. In fact, 2 D periapical radiographs do not reveal external root resorption to an appreciable extent, except for frank apical root resorption, which appears to be in their realm of identification [7]. In addition, there are geometric limitations associated with 2 D imaging of a three-dimensional (3 D) phenomenon; therefore, the quantitative value of 2 D radiographs to measure ERR is questionable [8]-[10]. When considering <b>panoramic</b> <b>films,</b> the distortion in both tooth position and angulation combined with varying magnification, distortion, superimposition, and imaging artifacts {{in different parts of the}} image [11],[12] leads to similar limitations in the use of <b>panoramic</b> <b>films</b> to assess ERR [13]-[15]. Therefore, although 2 D radiography may be a good screening tool, its use in the quantification of ERR remains controversial [9].|$|R

40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{diagnostic}} assessments of anterior tooth and bone status in a randomised cohort of pre-orthodontic patients using panoramic and periapical radiographs. METHOD: Four hundred and forty-four cases with matched periapical and panoramic radiographs were examined by three observers. Two were final-year postgraduate endodontic students and the other, a final-year Honours degree dental student. Multirater Kappa values were used to assess the reliability of the observers, with a value of 1 equating to complete agreement. RESULTS: With the exception of endodontic Class 1 and 2 palatal invaginations, reliability exceeded 0. 95 for all three observers. An assessment of the graduate endodontic students revealed only a marginal increase in the kappa values. Statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) determined that developmental anomalies or tooth/bone pathoses were more reliably detected by observers using periapical radiographs compared with <b>panoramic</b> <b>films.</b> This finding has relevance given the likelihood of anterior dental trauma among young children. CONCLUSION: While there have been considerable improvements in the quality of dental panoramic radiography, the present study indicated that a reliable pre-orthodontic or post-trauma diagnostic assessment should include both panoramic and intra-oral radiographs.

It was later discovered that while panoramic films can prove very useful in detecting and localizing mandibular fractures and other pathologic entities of the mandible, they were not very good at assessing periodontal bone loss or tooth decay.|$|E

It required a specially built projector built by Herman Casler in Canastota, New York and had a ratio similar to full frame, with an aperture of 2.75 in by 2 in. There were also several film formats of various sizes from 50 to 68 mm which were developed from 1884 onwards, including Cinéorama (not to be confused with the entirely distinct [...] "Cinerama" [...] format), started in 1900 by Raoul Grimoin-Sanson.

40|$|Background/purpose: Root {{resorption}} is {{an important}} problem in orthodontic treatment. Basically, the root resorption is evaluated by using two-dimensional images (e. g., periapical <b>films,</b> <b>panoramic</b> <b>films,</b> and cephalometric films). However, {{the use of such}} images sometimes underestimates the root resorption due to incorrect projection and magnification. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the correlations between root resorption and the amount of tooth movement during orthodontic treatment using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Materials and methods: We used CBCT to measure the root resorption and amount of tooth movement around six teeth (bilateral maxillary central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines) in eight patients, before orthodontic treatment and after 7 months of treatment. We then calculated the correlation between root resorption and the amount of tooth movement. Results: The root resorption was largest in the lateral incisors (0. 39  ±  0. 32 and 0. 48  ±  0. 19  mm in the right and left maxillary lateral incisors, respectively), followed by the central incisors (0. 25  ±  0. 16 and 0. 32  ±  0. 34  mm in the right and left maxillary central incisors), and then the canines (0. 18  ±  0. 19 and  0. 19  ±  0. 14  mm in the right and left maxillary canines). The average Pearson's correlation coefficient for the association between root resorption and the amount of tooth movement was – 0. 48. Conclusion: Results show that larger tooth movement after orthodontic treatment may be associated with increased severity of root resorption. This study has demonstrated that CBCT is a useful approach for evaluating apical root resorption after orthodontic treatment...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Our aim in this {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical study}} {{was to assess the}} prevalence rate of eruption of palatally displaced canines, diagnosed at an early developmental stage with posteroanterior radiographs and consequently treated by rapid maxillary expansion. METHODS: A sample of 60 subjects in the early mixed dentition with palatally displaced canines diagnosed on posteroanterior radiographs was enrolled in the trial. Their age range at the first observation (T 1) was 7. 6 to 9. 6 years, with a prepubertal stage of skeletal maturity (CS 1 or CS 2). The 60 subjects were randomly allocated to the treatment group (TG, 35 subjects) or the no-treatment group (NTG, 25 subjects). The TG was treated with a banded rapid maxillary expander; after expansion, all patients were retained with the expander in place for 6 months. Thereafter, the expander was removed, and the patients wore a retention plate at night for a year. The NTG received no treatment. All subjects were reevaluated in the early permanent dentition (T 2) (postpubertal CS 4). The number of dropouts was recorded. The main outcome recorded at T 2 was successful or unsuccessful eruption of the maxillary permanent canines. The starting forms at T 1 for measurements on posteroanterior and <b>panoramic</b> <b>films</b> were compared in the 2 groups with the Mann-Whitney U test (P < 0. 05).

Brooks also complimented Major Bagley in his {{preface to}} his USGS Bulletin: [...] "The plate camera has heen used {{for many years}} in {{topographic}} surveying in the United States and Canada, as well as in many European coimtries, and since 1910 J. W. Bagley, a topographic engineer of the United States Geological Survey, has been employing the <b>panoramic</b> <b>film</b> camera in conjunction with the plane table in surveys in Alaska. Mr. Bagley has devised some new instruments and methods and has proved conclusively that the panoramic camera is extremely valuable in certain kinds of topographic work. Some of the results of his phototopographic surveys are presented in the maps accompanying this bulletin. These maps give conclusive evidence of the refinements that are made possible by the use of that instrument. The methods and instruments here described have thus far been used only in Alaska, but they promise to have a wider appUcation in topographic surveys; hence this bulletin has been prepared. As the camera is used in conjunction with the plane table the bulletin includes also a brief account of the uses of the plane table. Mr. Bagley shows clearly that the field cost of surveys made by the use of the panoramic camera and plane table is far lower than that of surveys made by the plane table alone, and though the compilation of the field data in the office is more laborious the final cost of the completed map is nevertheless lower. The methods here described are especially applicable to regions where the field season is short, the field cost high, and the climatic conditions adverse to topographic work." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of impacted maxillary canine {{is reported to}} be between 1 % and 3 %. The lack of monitoring and the delay in the treatment of the impacted canine can cause different complications such as: displacement of adjacent teeth, loss of vitality of neighbouring teeth, shortening of the dental arch, follicular cysts, canine ankylosis, recurrent infections, recurrent pain, internal resorption of the canine and the adjacent teeth, external resorption of the canine and the adjacent teeth, combination of these factors. An appropriate diagnosis, accurate predictive analysis and early intervention are likely to prevent such undesirable effects. The objective is to evaluate, by means of a retrospective observational study, the possibility of carrying out a predictive analysis of root resorption adjacent to the impacted canines by means of orthopantomographs, so as to limit the prescription of additional 3 D radiography. 120 subjects with unilateral or bilateral maxillary impacted canine were examined and 50 patients with 69 impacted maxillary canine (22 male, 28 female; mean age: 11. 7 years) satisfied the inclusion criteria of the study. These patients were subjected to a basic clinical and radiographic investigation (orthopantomographs and computerized tomography). All <b>panoramic</b> <b>films</b> were viewed under standardized conditions for the evaluation of two main variables: maxillary canine angulations (a, b, g angles) and the overlapping between the impacted teeth and the lateral incisor (Analysis of Lindauer). Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of resorbed lateral incisors depending on sector location and angle measurements. Results indicated that b angle has the greatest influence on the prediction of root resorption (predictive value of b angle = 76 %).

The treatment sample consisted of 51 palatal impacted cuspids (19 unilateral and 32 bilateral) in 35 patients (aged between 10. 5 and 17. 5 y) with a cervical vertebral maturation between cervical stage 1 and 4. Each patient underwent the same combined surgical-orthodontic technique. Anamnestic data as well as pretreatment panoramic radiograph and cephalogram with European Board of Orthodontics analysis were recorded for each case.

40|$|Background: Intraoral radiographs can aid {{in formulating}} a more {{accurate}} diagnosis of periodontal disease. However, it must be considered whether a comparable amount of information can be obtained with modern panoramic radiographs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine to what degree the diagnosable amount of bone loss in patients with aggressive periodontitis or severe chronic periodontitis depends on the type of x-ray technique used. Methods: A total of 110 subjects (63 females) were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis (N = 49) or severe chronic periodontitis (N = 61). In all patients, panoramic radiographs (<b>panoramic)</b> and intraoral <b>films</b> of all regions (eight to 10 single exposures) were available. Analysis of the <b>panoramic</b> and intraoral <b>films</b> was carried out with a computer-assisted technique for linear measurement. The amount of bone loss in reference to the alveolar crest (AC) and bottom of the bony defect (BD) was determined as a percentage of total root length. Results: Depending on the examined tooth and reference point, 47. 01 % to 81. 89 % of all subjects showed differences between intraoral and panoramic measurements that were 10 % of the total root length were found predominantly in the upper molar and premolar regions. In the mandible, differences between intraoral and panoramic measurements that were > 10 % of the total root length were observed for BD and AC at the mesial contour of the central incisor.

The red line depicts the existing bone level, whereas the yellow line depicts where the gingiva was located originally (1-2 mm above the bone), prior to the patient developing periodontal disease. The pink arrow, on the right, points to a furcation involvement, or the loss of enough bone to reveal the location at which the individual roots of a molar begin to branch from the single root trunk; this is a sign of advanced periodontal disease. The blue arrow, in the middle, shows up to 80% bone loss on tooth #21, and clinically, this tooth exhibited gross mobility. Finally, the peach oval, to the left, highlights the aggressive nature with which periodontal disease generally affects mandibular incisors. Because their roots are generally situated very close to each other, with minimal interproximal bone, and because of their location in the mouth, where plaque and calculus accumulation is greatest because of the pooling of saliva, mandibular anteriors suffer excessively. The split in the red line depicts varying densities of bone that contribute to a vague region of definitive bone height.|$|R
