2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a <b>pressure</b> <b>instrument</b> in radiosondes.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} system for quantitative respirator fit testing by negative pressure was evaluated by comparison testing with a computerized aerosol fit test system (Dynatech Frontier Model 260 A). The new negative pressure system measures leakage flow while inspiratory pressures are sustained in a respirator facepiece {{rather than by}} pressure decay. Four phases of comparison testing were graduated by level of control, ranging from non-subject tests with hypodermic needle leakages to fit tests of 125 Air Force personnel. Throughout the series of tests, negative pressure fit factors were consistently more conservative than aerosol fit factors and showed less variability. Leakage flow rates measured by the negative <b>pressure</b> <b>instrument</b> were highly correlated with leak needle cross-sectional area as predicted by principles of air-flow physics. Comparison of subject and non-subject generated aerosol fit factors indicated significant aerosol losses, possibly due to streamlining and respiratory tract deposition.

40|$|A record, of 114 days duration, of {{pressure}} fluctuations {{on the floor}} of the Tasman Sea has been obtained from December 1983 to March 1984 at a site (38 " 30 'S.,l 62 " 38 'E.) near the Lord Howe Rise. The pressure fluctuations are due primarily to the ocean tides, and a first analysis of the record reveals clearly resolved open-ocean amplitude and phase values for four of the diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal components, namely Q 1, 01, N 2 and M 2. Such observational results are important for comparison with global tidal models, and may allow their refinement, especially because tides in the seas around New Zealand are known to be complex. For the present site there is general agreement between the tidal results and the predictions of Schwiderski. The pressure record also shows seismic signals from a strong earthquake that occurred on 7 February 1984 in the Solomon Islands, at a distance of approximately 3000 km from the pressure-record site.

The NHA is composed of several instruments, in-cluding an electronic blood <b>pressure</b> <b>instrument</b> (with pulse curve detection), oxymeter (SpO 2), hemoglobinometer and a core-body thermometer. Their data inputs are the dynamic characteristics of the patient’s condition. The static charac-teristics including, date of birth, sex, height, weight and test date are entered manually or via computer. These in-puts are analyzed by a high performance multi-function data acquisition computer. In a recently published retro-spective study of 203 ICU patients thermodilution cardiac output data were compared with NHA computed CO val-ues. Statistical evaluation, concerning bias, precision and accuracy showed clinically acceptable ranges according to a literature survey. The hemodynamic pattern of two essen-tial hypertensive patients were computed by the NHA and diagnostic and therapeutic directions were demonstrated. The NHA computer-aided clinical decision system provides reliable guidance for hemodynamic evaluation and leads to a scientifically based differential diagnosis of hypertensive patients as a promising screening method.

Russia has recently cancelled an important gas price discount, previously granted to Ukraine, in order to exert pressures related to the situation in Crimea. This movement was a new attempt of Russia to exercise its "power" as a big energy exporter, seriously threatened in the future by the growth of US exports of natural gas. While having a certain interest in countering Russian influence in Europe, the US are limited, for the short term, in their ability to strategically deploy their energy exports for geopolitical purposes. Instead, the United States can support projects to diversify energy sources of the neighbouring countries of Russia, including Ukraine, in order to diminish their dependence on energy imports from Russia.

40|$|Reducing {{water loss}} through bursts {{is a major}} {{challenge}} throughout the developed and developing world. Currently burst lifetimes are often long because awareness and location of them is time- and labor-intensive. Advances that can reduce these periods will lead to improved leakage performance, customer service, and reduce resource wastage. In water-distribution systems the sensitivity of a <b>pressure</b> <b>instrument</b> to change, including burst events, is greatly influenced by its own location {{and that of the}} event within the network. A method is described here that utilizes hydraulic-model simulations to determine the sensitivity of potential pressure-instrument locations by sequentially applying leaks to all potential burst locations. The simulation results are used to populate a Jacobian matrix, quantifying the different sensitivities. This matrix may then be searched to identify different instrument locations to achieve required goals: maximising overall sensitivity to all potential events or selective sensitivity to events in different network areas. It is shown here that by searching this matrix to optimize such selective sensitivity, while minimising instrument numbers, it is possible to provide useful burst-localization information. Results are presented from field studies that demonstrate the practical application of the method, showing that current standard network models can provide sufficiently accurate quantification of differential sensitivities and that, once combined with event-detection techniques for data analysis, events can effectively be localized using a small number of instruments. ...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{temperature}} profile measurements {{made with the}} NWC SVTP instrument reveal considerable structure in vertical temperature gradients, including temperature inversions. Some differences in the macrogradients in the California Current are due to dissimilarities between regions of upwelling, surface countercurrent, and current shear. Sharp small-scale gradient changes may possibly bc caused by differential currents and two-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence generated by current shears and dynamically unstable internal waves. INTRODUCIXON All profiles taken in the California Current region with the Naval Weapons Center’s (NWC) SVTP (sound velocity, temperature, and <b>pressure)</b> <b>instrument</b> show a definite layered structure that is due, in part, to advection from several different sources with incomplete mixing of these water masses. The California Current {{is a continuation of}} the west-wind drift, wherein part of it turns southward along the coast at about 42 ”- 46 ” N lat depending upon the season. The sluggish current, about 700 km wide, flows south-southeast along the coast until it reaches the vicinity of the tip of Baja California, approximately 23 ” N lat, where it turns and flows westward (Sverdrup, Johnson, and Fleming 1942; Reid, Rodcn, and Wyllie 1958). The water making up the west-wind drift imparts a low surface salinity, which increases with depth, and a low surface temperature to the California Cur-rent. South of the subarctic water and west of the California Current is located the warmer and more saline eastern north Pacific central water. Horizontal mixing of this water mass with the California Current increases the salinity near the surface of the California Current creating a salinity minimum in the thermocline at a depth o...|$|E

I. water. - Add 5 mL of CM (2 : 1) mixture to the tube. Vortex vigorously. - Use multiple automatic pipette to add 25 µL of concentrated HCl to lower PH. Lower PH to separate phospholipids from proteins and deactive proteins. Optimum amount of concentrated HCl needs to be determined in the future studies. - After overnight deproteinization, cotton-like residue will appear. - Add 1 mL of fresh D. I. water (20 %). Shake gently upside down. Don’t vortex vigorously to break the protein residue to make sure easy separation of the residue. - Wait until two clear layers appear. - Siphon off the upper water layer. - Wait 30 min to let the leftover clear, then some white residue will appear on the surface, siphon off the residue again. - Evaporate the lower CM mixture layer. Check the temperature of the evaporator before using. - After drying, add 500 µL of inject solvent to dissolve the lipids. Methanol causes a negative peak close to PE peak. Acetonitrile causes a negative peak close to chloroform peak. - Too much chloroform is detrimental to the column and cause big solvent peaks. Small amount of chloroform is needed to dissolve the PI and PS. - To the best knowledge of this lab, acetonitrile (10) :chloroform (1) (v/v) is considered the most suitable inject solvent. - Pour the final mixture into the autosampler vials for HPLC running.
