5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it lacked coal and iron resources and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. <b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> he was shy about performing in public, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of his fondness for the battleship and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the model's aging and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E

2500|$|In bowling, {{one player}} stood out. Cowie took 19 of the 40 Test wickets, {{and no other}} player on either side got into double figures [...] <b>partly,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> England varied their bowling attack for each Test.|$|R
50|$|Kim {{started to}} receive {{critical}} acclaim {{in the late}} 1990s and it is her own belief that her work was <b>partly</b> recognized <b>because</b> at that {{time there was a}} generally strong wave of women’s poets and poetry.|$|R
5|$|<b>Partly</b> <b>because</b> of {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically {{possible for the}} foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the performance of the Soviet army, but <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
5|$|The {{maintenance}} of Taman Sari was abandoned shortly after Hamengkubuwono I died, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the elaborate hydraulic works were {{so difficult to}} maintain. The gardens were neglected and the buildings suffered some damage during the Java War of 1825–1830.|$|E
6000|$|Chad looked amused and interested, {{yet still}} {{somewhat}} in the dark; <b>partly</b> perhaps <b>because</b> Strether's estimate of fun had required of {{him from the}} first {{a good deal of}} elucidation. [...] "It wouldn't do if I left you--?" ...|$|R

5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{volunteer}} citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of {{dissatisfaction with the}} police effort. They petitioned the government to raise a reward {{for information about the}} killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it took several years to reach full production and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5000|$|One {{analogy is}} [...] "fixed costs + {{variable}} costs = total costs [...].similar to.. debt + equity = assets". This analogy is <b>partly</b> motivated <b>because</b> (for a given amount of debt) debt servicing is a fixed cost. This leads to two measures of operating leverage: ...|$|R

5|$|Altrincham {{today is}} an {{affluent}} commuter town, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of its transport links. The town {{has a strong}} middle class presence; {{there has been a}} steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and three ice hockey clubs, Manchester Storm, Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the decreased quality of the content and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E
2500|$|... "In 1856 he was {{recalled}} {{because he}} had failed in the primary naval duty of finding and destroying the Russian squadron - <b>partly,</b> perhaps, <b>because</b> of his preoccupation with the self-imposed task of negotiating with Japan" [...] Yet his agreements with Japan were ratified, and his conduct was officially commended.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} long in coming hither," [...] said the knight, [...] "partly {{on account of}} letters on affairs of State, and <b>partly</b> {{likewise}} <b>because</b> I desired to come alone, thinking that I might better understand how {{it is with the}} lad without the presence of his father or brothers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Open the gate, Caleb," [...] {{said his}} master, {{in a more}} {{soothing}} tone, partly from his regard to the ancient and faithful seneschal, <b>partly</b> perhaps <b>because</b> he thought that angry words would be thrown away, so long as Caleb had a stout iron-clenched oaken door betwixt his person and the speakers.|$|R
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|For the 1893 version a {{baritone}} solo, two bassoons, four {{horns and}} two trumpets {{are added to}} the original scoring. When possible Fauré employed a mixed choir and a female soprano soloist, <b>partly</b> <b>because</b> the soprano lines, particularly the solo in the , are difficult to sing and demand excellent breath control, easier for adult women than for boys.|$|E

The results of the correlation analysis: The coefficient of problem solving and opportunity perception weakened from [...]. 717 to [...]. 444, {{but it is still}} <b>partly</b> mediated <b>because</b> it is still significant (C.R[*]=[*] 7.604 ***). This supports H 3 (see Table 6).|$|R
50|$|Gerardus {{was born}} in the City of Hoorn, The Netherlands on December 25, 1927. His {{education}} was <b>partly</b> interrupted <b>because</b> of the German occupation. Self study and evening classes helped to overcome this lack. At the age of fourteen he started work and became familiar with the electrical trade. Eventually he became an Electrical Supervisor.|$|R
