Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' <b>peripheral</b> <b>vision.</b> Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>vision,</b> apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDisconjugate (different {{in the two}} eyes) oculomotor {{adaptation}} {{is driven}} by the need to maintain binocular vision. Since binocular vision is deficient in strabismus, we wondered whether oculomotor disconjugate adaptive capabilities are deficient in such subjects. We studied eight adult subjects with constant, long-standing convergent strabismus of variable angles (4 – 30 prism D). No subject had severe amblyopia. Binocular vision was evaluated with stereoacuity tests. Two subjects had <b>peripheral</b> binocular <b>vision</b> and gross stereopsis; two other subjects had abnormal retinal correspondence and abnormal or pseudo gross stereopsis. In the other subjects binocular vision and stereopsis were absent. To stimulate disconjugate changes of saccades, subjects viewed for 20 min an image that was magnified in one eye (aniseikonia). Subjects with residual <b>peripheral</b> binocular <b>vision</b> and even subjects with pseudo or abnormal binocular vision showed disconjugate changes of the binocular coordination of their saccades; these changes reduced the disparity resulting from the aniseikonia. In contrast, for subjects without binocular vision the changes were not correlated with the disparity induced by the aniseikonia. Rather, these changes served to improve fixation of one or the other eye individually...|$|R
50|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a {{group of}} rare, genetic {{disorders}} that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina. Some of the most common symptoms of the disease are poor night vision and the loss of <b>peripheral</b> (side) <b>vision.</b> Currently there is no treatment to cure RP. A recent study by NEI-funded researchers showed that gene therapy can help preserve vision in late stage retinitis pigmentosa using canine models. Gene therapy halted the thinning of the retinal layer where photoreceptors are located and preserved the surviving photoreceptors. Research is still on going.|$|R

25|$|In some circumstances, {{fluorescent}} lamps operated {{at the power}} supply frequency (50 or 60Hz) can also produce flicker at the same frequency itself, which is noticeable by more people. This can happen {{in the last few}} hours of tube life when the cathode emission coating at one end has almost run out or a filament is open circuit, and that cathode starts having difficulty emitting enough electrons into the gas fill, resulting in slight rectification and hence uneven light output in positive and negative going AC cycles. Power frequency flicker can also sometimes be emitted from the very ends of the tubes, if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle. Flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>vision</b> than it is when viewed directly, as is all flicker (since the <b>peripheral</b> <b>vision</b> is faster—has a higher critical frequency—than the central vision).|$|E

40|$|Retinal {{prosthetic}} devices evoke rudimentary vision, i. e. dot-shaped percepts ("phosphenes') {{that may}} be combined to affect pattern vision. Such devices may be appropriate for persons blinded by retinodegenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and aim at guiding daily activities such as mobility. Due to their novelty, current devices are limited to persons with end-stage RP {{and no more than}} bare light perception. They are further designed to elicit phosphenes in the central visual field (VF). Yet, persons commonly experience mobility impairment in intermediate stages of RP. Also, mid-peripheral VF zones have been identified as crucial for mobility. This thesis dissertation seeks to explore alternative electrode array layouts for the peripheral VF to assess their utility prior to the full progression of the retinodegenerative disease. Beneficial effects of <b>peripheral</b> phosphene <b>vision</b> for mobility when coexisting with residual central vision of 10 degrees of visual angle (legal blindness), such as that experienced in mid-stage RP, are assessed. Further, efficacy of <b>peripheral</b> phosphene <b>vision</b> in the absence of residual vision, as in end-stage RP, as compared to a central phosphene layout is evaluated. A photorealistic mobility-testing framework for simulated prosthetic and residual vision was developed. In subsequent stages of the project the performance of normally sighted participants (N= 25) performing navigational tasks in a virtual environment, using various layouts of peripheral and central prosthetic <b>vision,</b> was assessed. <b>Peripheral</b> phosphene layouts complementing central residual vision were found particularly useful when circumventing low-lying obstacles - increasing walking speeds by up to 14 % and reducing collisions by up to 21 % as compared to plain residual vision. Visual scanning - related head movements (VSRHM) were reduced by up to 42. 1 %. In the absence of residual <b>vision,</b> <b>peripheral</b> phosphene layouts displayed up to 5. 6 % higher walking speeds, up to 73 % less collisions, and up to 60. 7 % less VSRHM as compared to a central phosphene layout. While benefits of peripheral phosphene layouts have been task-specific, future adjustments in retinal prosthesis designs to realise a peripheral prosthesis might serve to increase the target group and time frame for retinal prosthetic therapy and thus the benefit to the persons with visual impairment...|$|R

40|$|AIMS [...] Both pattern {{electroretinogram}} and peripheral {{colour contrast}} thresholds {{have been shown}} to be abnormal in glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This study evaluates each of these tests as tools for the early diagnosis of glaucoma, compares and contrasts the results, and examines the relation between the two tests in a large cohort of ocular hypertensive patients. METHODS [...] Transient and steady state pattern electroretinograms and peripheral colour contrast thresholds were performed in 45 normal, 37 glaucomatous, and 206 ocular hypertensive eyes. The results were analysed using receiver operating characteristic curves, together with evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of the tests. The relation between the two tests was examined by direct statistical correlation of the results. RESULTS [...] All tests showed high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between normal and glaucomatous eyes. However, there was a significant difference between the two tests for the number of ocular hypertensives considered as abnormal. Forty per cent of ocular hypertensives had abnormal pattern electroretinogram compared with 30 % with abnormal <b>peripheral</b> colour <b>vision.</b> <b>Peripheral</b> colour contrast thresholds showed a significant correlation with both transient and steady state pattern electroretinogram. CONCLUSION [...] Both of these tests {{have been shown to}} be promising new tools for the early detection of glaucoma but the number of ocular hypertensive patients showing abnormal results is rather higher than expected considering the natural history of the condition. Sensitivity in ocular hypertension may be increased by using a combination of both tests. The significant correlation between these psychophysical and electrophysiological tests is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The human {{visual system}} has evolved towards a close {{integration}} of visual information processing and visual data acquisition.

40|$|In {{the digital}} age, writing centers are {{impacted}} by ever-increasing technological advancements that {{provide opportunities for}} {{a wider variety of}} writing center services, including mobile consulting. No longer must writing center consultations between peers take place in the formal location of a university writing center and under the supervision of writing center managers. Instead, consultations can take place in less formal settings, such as coffee houses or university gyms. Jackie Grutsch McKinny’s work explores some of these alternative services that writing centers can offer, especially in her book <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Visions</b> for Writing Centers. In exploring alternate boundaries of a Writing Center, the question becomes how a “writing center” can maintain professional and ethical boundaries between student writers and writing consultants, without the sense of professionalism imposed by the physical boundaries of official writing center locations. Under the theme of Writing Center ethics, I propose an individual presentation about consultant safety and maintaining professionalism in the writing center. Using literature related to writing center safety and professionalism, this presentation will address boundaries between writing center consultants and student writers, and how the physical setting of a writing center affects these boundaries. Drawing upon scholarship regarding ethics in the writing center, this presentation will also address ethical concerns and the role of a writing center consultant as an authoritative peer. The writing center is meant to be a place where “students’ voices can be strengthened,” while maintaining a boundary of professionalism. To support my proposed study, this presentation will present the results of a small-scale autoethnographic study that examines my work in multiple spaces in a writing center, supported by pertinent literature on safety in the writing center and maintaining social and ethical boundaries of professionalism, while still providing a personal and necessary service for students. This ethnographic study generated data on this topic from my own experiences with mobile consulting as a writing center consultant. With these combined resources, this study will attempt to determine where a writing center consultant stands on the spectrum of maintaining professionalism and providing a therapeutic service to student writers, while conducting consultations outside of the official writing center location...|$|R
