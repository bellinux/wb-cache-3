5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

This article explains that there are important physical differences between power grids that are dominated by <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> based sources such as wind and solar and conventional power grids based on synchronous generators. These systems must be properly design to address grid stability and reliability.|$|E

25|$|Micro {{wind turbine}} {{are used to}} harvest wind energy readily {{available}} in the environment {{in the form of}} kinetic energy to power the low <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> devices such as wireless sensor nodes. When air flows across the blades of the turbine, a net pressure difference is developed between the wind speeds above and below the blades. This will result in a lift force generated which in turn rotate the blades. Similar to photovoltaics, wind farms have been constructed on an industrial scale and are being used to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy.|$|E

25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E

25|$|Airflow can be {{harvested}} by various turbine and non-turbine generator technologies. For example, Zephyr Energy Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures energy from airflow to recharge batteries and <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> devices. The Windbeam’s novel design {{allows it to}} operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due {{to the effects of}} multiple fluid flow phenomena. A linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. A lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. HVAC ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the energy requirements and design constraints of a given application.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their success}} with the Donkey Kong Country games in the mid-1990s, {{developer}} Rare built their next Donkey Kong series game upon its predecessors' gameplay but not as a direct sequel. Rare's Gregg Mayles led the effort to create the 3D Donkey Kong. Development began in 1997 for release on the Nintendo 64's disk drive add-on, but was transitioned for release on the base console after the add-on was delayed and eventually canceled. A team of 16 people worked on the title, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages. Donkey Kong 64 was built atop the game engine used in Banjo-Kazooie, and as the Banjo project died down with Banjo-Tooie, staff members joined the Donkey Kong 64 team. Rare announced Donkey Kong 64 with a single screenshot on its website and coverage in the January 1999 issue of Nintendo <b>Power.</b> <b>Electronic</b> Gaming Monthly wrote that the game was playable by the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo, though IGN said that the game debuted at the 1999 event. The game also demoed at Nintendo's 1999 Spaceworld. Donkey Kong 64 {{was expected to be}} a bestseller, as the console's [...] "crowning achievement" [...] in graphics and sound.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} been praised in the gaming press, {{and is still}} highly acclaimed. It has {{collected}} numerous awards, including various [...] "Game of the Year" [...] honors {{by members of the}} gaming media, as well as Nintendo's own best-selling Player's Choice selection. In addition, Super Mario 64 has been placed high on [...] "the greatest games of all time" [...] lists by many reviewers, including IGN, Game Informer, Edge, Yahoo! Games, GameFAQs users, and Nintendo <b>Power.</b> <b>Electronic</b> Gaming Monthly awarded the game a Gold award in its initial review, and in Edge magazine, Super Mario 64 was the first game to receive a perfect score. British magazine Maximum gave it their [...] "Maximum Game of the Month Award", making it the only import game (since Super Mario 64 had not yet been released outside Japan) to win that honor, and attested it to be the greatest game the magazine had ever reviewed. Game Informer initially rated the game a 9.75, but re-rated it a 9.0 a decade later in a [...] "Retro Review". The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu rated Super Mario 64 a 39/40. Common praise focused on the presentation, while criticism was directed at the camera system. Nintendo Power lauded the graphics, sound, and gameplay, but commented the shifting camera angle took getting used to. Next Generation Magazine praised many aspects of the game: musical score, graphics, lack of loading times, and the scale of the game, though they commented that the game is less accessible than previous Mario titles, citing the camera's occasional, erratic movements and lack of optimal angle as frustrating. Maximum found the game's strongest points to be its sense of freedom and the fact that revisiting levels unearths new areas and challenges.|$|E

2500|$|The {{desire to}} <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> {{equipment}} using AC mains power faced a difficulty {{with respect to}} the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube.

2500|$|The {{measurement}} of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in radio technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The {{measurement of}} impedance requires the {{measurement of the}} magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [...] "bridge" [...] methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. Impedance measurement in <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> {{system can}} be viewed as a system {{composed}} of a set of concurrently interacting subsystems to generate, transmit, and distribute electric power.
