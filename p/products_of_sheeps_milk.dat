The best percentage of calcium chloride added to milk was 0. 2 %, {{which resulted in a}} recovery of 97. 5 % of milk proteins. At low pH (4. 5 – 5), the recovery of protein was low, but it increased at higher pH values (5. 5 – 6. 5); recovery was greatest at pH 6. 5. The optimum heating temperature to obtain coprecipitate from <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> was 85 – 95 °C. The functional properties <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate were studied. At pH values higher than 6, there were no differences between the solubility <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> coprecipitate and <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> sodium caseinate, but the solubility of coprecipitate at pH values lower than 5 was relatively higher than those of the caseinate.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} current {{knowledge of}} the main nutritional factors that influence composition <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> and, consequently, its processing into cheese, with special focus on milk fat and protein concentration and characteristics, content of bioactive compounds, somatic cell content, content of aromatic compounds able to improve its organoleptic characteristics and content <b>of</b> toxic substances. <b>Sheep</b> <b>milk</b> composition is strongly influenced by ewe nutrition, especially in highly productive animals. Milk fat concentration is markedly affected by the ewe's net energy (NE) balance, dietary NDF content and dietary supplementation with ruminally protected/inert or unprotected marine and vegetable oils. Milk fat composition can be modified to contain higher levels of human healthy fatty acids (FA), such as conjugated linoleic acid and omega- 3 FA. Milk protein content, and its characteristics, {{are more difficult to}} change than milk fat, although dietary energy seems to have a major role, while diet protein and amino acid supplementation only marginally affect milk protein level and its characteristics. Nutritional stress, and some vitamins, affect the somatic cell content of milk and this impacts cheese yield and quality. Feeds in the diet can markedly influence milk aroma and, consequently, play a role in determining cheese flavor, especially when ewes are pastured. Possible sources and causes <b>of</b> contamination <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> by heavy metals or dioxins, and mycotoxins, through the diet are also addressed.

The study was performed on three family farms with 150 to 300 sheep per farm using semi-extensive farming management based on pasture, typical for sub-Mediterranean area. Bulk-tank milk samples were taken during the entire milking period (from March to July or August, depending on the year) and were analysed for protein, casein, non-protein nitrogen (NPN) and urea content. Significant effect of the year was observed on urea and NPN content (P< 0. 05). In addition, seasons had a significant effect on milk protein, urea and casein content (P< 0. 01).

40|$|International audienceAbstractDuring sheep cheese manufacturing, {{the time}} {{determination}} for such important steps as clotting and cutting time {{relies on the}} experience of the cheese maker or, alternatively, on predetermined reaction times. However, efficient control of coagulation requires a rigorous, objective, inline method to select the optimum time to proceed with clotting and cutting time. Therefore, a near-infrared (NIR) light backscatter fiber optic sensor was implemented in order to monitor coagulation <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> and assess the possibility of estimating both clotting and cutting times during the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>sheep’s</b> cheese. A randomized block experiment with three replications was designed to determine optical, rheological, and visual coagulation parameters in <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> using four enzyme concentrations. The optical response <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> was found to be greater than in goat milk (15 – 20 %) but lower than cow milk (30 – 50 %). The standard error for the optical parameters during the coagulation <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>milk</b> was lower than those observed for the visual parameters. Optical variables were strongly correlated with both visually and rheologically defined coagulation parameters. Rheologically and visually determined clotting and cutting times were successfully predicted using only one optical parameter. Our results suggest that optical parameters generated from the NIR light backscatter profile adequately respond to the kinetic changes induced by varying the concentration of enzyme and that prediction of rheologically determined cutting time using NIR light backscatter is more precise than prediction of visually determined cutting time, i. e., ∼ 50 % lower SEP...|$|R
