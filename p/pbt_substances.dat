Perfluorinated carboxylic acids containing 8 – 14 carbons in a chain were added to the REACH-Candidate List: PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA are persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B), and toxic (T), and are, therefore, designated as <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> under REACH. The longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTrA, and PFTeA are considered to be very persistent and very bioaccumulative substances, so-called vPvB substances. The properties that lead to an SVHC identification are listed in Annex XIII of the REACH regulation.|$|E
40|$|Many {{regulatory}} laws {{resulting from}} {{the enactment of the}} United Nations Stockholm Convention in May 2004, together with the new REACH legislation, have promoted significant new activity in the assessment of Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (<b>PBT)</b> <b>substances.</b> These are chemicals that have the potential to persist in the environment, accumulate within the tissues of living organisms and, in the case of chemicals categorised as PBTs, show adverse effects following long-term exposure. Under REACH, estimated data generated by (Q) SARs may be used both as a substitute for experimental data, and as a supplement to experimental data in weight-of-evidence approaches. It is foreseen that (Q) SARs will be used for the three main regulatory goals of hazard assessment, risk assessment and PBT/vPvB assessment. In the Registration process under REACH, the registrant {{will be able to use}} (Q) SAR data in the registration dossier, provided that adequate documentation is given to argue for the validity of the model(s) used. The experimental determination of the persistence, bioconcentration and toxicity is generally expensive and demanding to perform. For this reason, measuring experimentally the potential PBT profiles of those chemicals that are of potential regulatory interest is considered not feasible. The limited empirical data, the high test costs together with the regulatory constraints and the international push for reduced animal testing motivates a greater reliance on QSAR models in PBT assessment. This report provides an overview of PBT regulations and criteria, and gives a detailed review of QSAR for estimating the biodegradation of chemicals. The role of biotransformation in the modelling of <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> is also described. JRC. I. 3 -Toxicology and chemical substance...|$|E
30|$|The {{different}} European substance regulations (e.g. REACH [1], {{plant protection}} products regulation [2], biocidal products regulation [3], human and veterinary medicinal products regulations [4, 5]) have all recognised that substances that are either persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T) (<b>PBT</b> <b>substances)</b> or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB) (vPvB substances) must be considered as hazardous for the environment due to their potential for eliciting long-term adverse effects. The goal of preventing exposure of humans and the environment to PBT and vPvB substances is thus shared among all EU-based regulatory frameworks. In a comparison between different European and International regulations, Moermond et al. [6] reported that {{there are differences in}} how this goal is achieved, not only regarding technical criteria but also conceptual criteria (e.g. regulatory consequences for PBT and vPvB substances).|$|E

PFOS is classified as a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (<b>PBT)</b> <b>substance</b> by ‘The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’ (OECD). Whereas C 6 chemistry based fluorocarbons exclude the possibility of fluorocarbon products to break down into PFOS and PFOA and the resultant compound perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHA) has 40 times less bioaccumulative effects than that with PFOA (Holme 2012).|$|R

Cashmeran has an environmental hazard classification (R51/53 according to the EU DSD or H411 according to the EU CLP).In this sense, Cashmeran's bio concentration and aquatic toxicity is even {{an order of magnitude}} more favourable than those substances considered as polycyclic musks, and therefore also does not meet those criteria for the materials considered to be included in that group.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the poor}} {{degradability}} of <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances,</b> there is concern that effects in organisms cannot be predicted in the long run. Accumulation in organisms is virtually irreversible {{and the content of}} these substances in the environmental compartments can only very slowly be reduced by lowering the emissions. Moreover, some <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances,</b> such as PFC, have the potential to pollute remote areas through long-range transport via air and water. Even when standardized tests in the laboratory show no toxic effects, chronic effects may occur through long-term exposure to low doses. Because of the long life cycles of organisms {{at the end of the}} food chain, these effects will hardly be predictable. And the concentrations of <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances</b> in man and the environment cannot be predicted over long periods of time. This is another reason why chronic effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, according to the principles of REACH, for <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances</b> no safe levels can be derived for the environment [24].|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} sense of urgency among {{scientists}} and environmental policy-makers concerning the need for improving the scientific foundation supporting international regulations for identifying and evaluating persistent,bioaccumulative, and toxic (<b>PBT)</b> <b>substances</b> and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment. The current national and international regulations define PBTs and POPs in terms of fairly strict criteria that are based {{on the state of the}} science in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. Since then, an evolution in the state of the science has produced new insights into <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> and an array of new methods to identify PBT chemicals. The development of regulatory criteria has not kept up with the rapid development in environmental chemistry and toxicology, and as a result, scientists often find themselves in the situation where guidance on PBT and POPs criteria is limited and, in some respects, out of date. With this background,a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Pellston Workshop brought together experts from academia,government, and industry to reach consensus on the significance of advancements in our understanding of the behavior and potential impact of POPs and PBTs in the environment, the current understanding of the state of the science, as well as recommendations for policy-makers to improve and coordinate national and international regulations on this issue. The workshop builds on the outcome of a previous Pellston workshop, held in 1998, which focused on the evaluation of persistence and long-range transport of organic chemicals in the environment, and is linked to other recent Pellston workshops, among them the Tissue Residue Approach for Toxicity Assessment workshop held in 2007. The results of this workshop are conveyed in a series of 9 articles, published in this issue of Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, and describe the coordination of science, regulation, and management needed to more effectively achieve a common goal of managing chemicals on our planet...|$|E
30|$|Short-chain PFASs {{have a high}} {{mobility}} in {{soil and}} water, and final degradation products are extremely persistent. This results in a fast distribution to water resources, and consequently, also to a contamination of drinking water resources. Once emitted, short-chain PFASs remain in the environment. A lack of appropriate water treatment technologies results in everlasting background concentrations in the environment, and thus, organisms are permanently and poorly reversibly exposed. Considering such permanent exposure, {{it is very difficult}} to estimate long-term adverse effects in organisms. Short-chain PFASs enrich in edible parts of plants and the accumulation in food chains is unknown. Regarding these concerns and uncertainties, especially with respect to the precautionary principle, short-chain PFASs are of equivalent concern to <b>PBT</b> <b>substances.</b> Therefore, they should be identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) under REACH. The SVHC identification should be followed by a restriction under REACH, which is the most efficient way to minimize the environmental and human exposure of short-chain PFASs in the European Union.|$|E
30|$|The {{chemicals}} registered under REACH {{include many}} former “existing chemicals” that are structurally (very) similar to acknowledged POPs (persistent organic pollutants) or PBT chemicals (chemicals that are persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic). Accordingly, these “emerging chemicals” share hazardous properties {{such as high}} persistence and bioaccumulation potential with the structurally related POPs and PBT chemicals. Examples are brominated aromatic substances placed on the market as replacements of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs used as flame retardants; one replacement is decabromodiphenyl ethane, see below) and {{a large group of}} poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) placed on the market as replacements of the so-called long-chain PFASs such as PFOA or PFOS that were used, among others, in impregnating agents. These are cases of incremental substitution or regrettable substitution. Environmental chemists and ecotoxicologists need to use their extensive knowledge on legacy POPs and <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> in order to demonstrate, as quickly as possible, the environmental and health hazards associated with these “new” chemical products. Otherwise, the problems associated with the hazardous chemicals that have been banned (here: PBDEs, long-chain PFASs) will occur again and will then be perpetuated for many years and decades [8].|$|E

30|$|Although the {{substances}} {{differ in}} their properties, uses, exposure pathways and regulatory consequences, {{the outcome of a}} PBT/vPvB assessment should not depend on the framework under which they are evaluated, since the protection goals do not differ.

This is relevant because, for example, many biocides are also used as PPPs or veterinary medicinal products. Since regulatory authorities should aim at making predictable and consistent decisions, a strategy for harmonised PBT identification across the different frameworks is needed. The focus of this paper is on the assessment procedure; it proposes a reasonable interpretation of the available data while considering not only substance properties but also keeping in mind the regulatory consequences.|$|R

In the further course of this project, the water solubility (WP 2) of selected substances will be determined according to the OECD-Guideline 105. Criteria for the selection of model substances will be: high lipophilicity (log KOW > 6) and low volatility, narcotic mode of action, accessibility to analytical determination at low concentrations.

40|$|Air-water {{exchange}} fluxes of persistent, bioaccumulative {{and toxic}} (<b>PBT)</b> <b>substances</b> are frequently estimated using the Whitman two-film (W 2 F) method, but micrometeorological flux measurements of these compounds over water are rarely attempted.

Measured fluxes {{were compared to}} estimates using the W 2 F method, and to estimates from an Internal Boundary Layer Transport and Exchange (IBLTE) model that implements the NOAA COARE bulk flux algorithm and gas transfer model. We reveal an inaccuracy in the estimate of water vapor transfer velocity that is commonly used with the W 2 F method for PBT flux estimation, and demonstrate the effect of use of an improved estimation method. Flux measurements were conducted at three stations with increasing fetch in offshore flow (15, 30, and 60 km) in southeastern Lake Superior. This sampling strategy enabled comparison of measured and predicted flux, as well as modification in near-surface atmospheric concentration with fetch, using the IBLTE model. Fluxes estimated using the W 2 F model were compared to fluxes measured by MBR. In five of seven {{cases in which the}} MBR flux was significantly greater than zero, concentration increased with fetch at 1 -m height, which is qualitatively consistent with the measured volatilization flux.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the results of}} exploratory research carried out during 2007 and 2008 within the JRC¿s Institute for Health & Consumer Protection. The research focused {{on the problem of}} ranking chemicals according to their environmental and toxicological concern, and aimed to develop {{a better understanding of how}} to apply such approaches in the implementation of chemicals legislation, such as REACH and the Water Framework Directive. A number of limitations were identified in existing approaches for the prioritisation of chemicals. For example, the traditional EU tool, EURAM, was difficult to apply in a consistent way due to the fact that many of the data inputs needed were often missing, which meant that high priority was often given to data-poor chemicals, rather than chemicals that were inherently hazardous or likely to cause a significant risk. This project aimed to address limitations such as this by encoding novel ranking methods into a new user-friendly software tool, and by investigating the applicability of the tool in a number of case studies. The tool developed in this project, called DART (Decision Analysis by Ranking Techniques), is made freely downloadable from the JRC website. The applicability of DART tool is illustrated through a set of case studies. The first case study aims to summarise and illustrate different ways in which chemometric ranking methods could be used to supplement the use of QSAR methods in the development of chemical categories. The second case study illustrates how ranking methods could be used to supplement the use of QSAR methods in the context of toxicological assessments of potential persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (<b>PBT)</b> <b>substances.</b> Finally, the third case study, aims to investigate the compatibility of established and novel ranking approaches with the risk assessment paradigm, in which hazard and exposure assessments are integrated into a characterisation of risk.

30|$|Other deficiencies, e.g. {{observed}} while {{screening for}} potential <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances</b> are missing testing proposals, misuse of waiving, and missing documentation of structure activity relationships used to fulfil certain data requirements. In addition, exposure assessment, especially refinement and on-site risk management {{are used in}} an intransparent manner without documentation.|$|R
30|$|European {{regulatory}} {{frameworks for}} chemicals (i.e. registered under REACH, {{plant protection products}} (PPPs), biocides, human and veterinary medicinal products) require that substances undergo an assessment to identify whether they are persistent (P), bioaccumulative (B) and toxic (T), or very persistent (vP) and very bioaccumulative (vB), i.e. to identify them as <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> or vPvB substances according to their properties. We screened current practices, evaluated possibilities and made {{a proposal for a}} harmonised assessment. Our proposal assumes that {{it should be possible to}} identify PBT and vPvB substances on the basis of the data available according to the requirements of the respective legal frameworks. For substances registered as PPPs and mostly also biocides and medicinal products, a ‘definitive assessment’ is often possible. Within REACH, the registrant has to provide all information necessary for PBT assessment regardless of the yearly tonnage of chemicals. But in cases of limited data availability, we suggest using a weight of evidence approach to account for such differences in data availability and type of data across different frameworks and to make use of valuable additional information. We propose to base the evaluation of persistence on degradation half-lives and to normalise a number of parameters (e.g. type of kinetics used, temperature). But further work is needed, e.g. for deriving DegT 50 for water and sediment compartments. For the B-criterion, information other than BCF in fish could be considered and more information related to bioaccumulation processes should be gathered (e.g. in species other than fish, different uptake routes). Testing for T identification is focused on standard aquatic species but could also be complemented by e.g. information from other species. Information such as those read-across from structurally related substances and QSAR are often of importance for screening assessments. The aim of PBT and vPvB identification is to reliably target the problematic substances, with as few false negatives or positives as possible, regardless of the regulatory framework. Each aspect was thus considered in the context of the others for a final balanced decision. As the need for conservatism is interpreted differently under the various frameworks, harmonizing this identification is a challenging task.|$|E
30|$|A further {{regulatory}} {{alternative is}} offered by the “cut-off criteria” of the EU Regulation on Plant Protection Products [10], which provide for a ban on active substances with particularly hazardous properties, the so-called <b>PBT</b> <b>substances</b> [persistent (P), bio-accumulative (B), and toxic (T)]. A further exclusion criterion is targeting endocrine disruptors. The cut-off criteria represent a very progressive instrument in several pieces of Europe’s chemicals legislation, which is oriented more towards the precautionary principle than other international regulations. These criteria have been introduced by policy-makers and require a paradigm shift in the decision-making process. The decision on an approval or ban should in future only {{be based on the}} undesirable substance properties and not, as previously, on a quantitative risk assessment (i.e., the comparison of the expected environmental exposure concentrations with (eco)toxicological threshold concentrations/doses for the harmful impacts on non-target organisms). Experts justify the hazard-based regulation by referring to the high level of uncertainty in the risk assessment for the targeted hazardous properties. The cut-off criteria provide an impulse to develop and use active substances and PPPs that have lower environmental impacts. However, a practical implementation is currently not possible, because the scientific and technical details of the cut-off criteria have not yet been developed and specified in subordinate regulations. The delays in implementation have been due not least to the massive interventions of the European PPP industry, which categorically rejects hazard-based regulation and demands a return to risk assessment, even for undesirable substance properties [50]. The UBA believes that the cut-off criteria are in principle well suited to improve the protection of the environment against particularly hazardous PPPs. Because of this conviction and in accordance with its responsibilities, UBA is also involved in the discussion about the specification and implementation of the cut-off criteria [51, 52]. One particular challenge {{is that it is not}} always clear from an environmental point of view whether an alternative active substance really is better than the banned active substance it is meant to replace. The same task of comparative assessment applies for PPP approval: The EU regulation provides that a PPP containing so-called substitution candidates (e.g., active substances with two out of three PBT properties) should be replaced by a PPP with a lower environmental impact. The methodology of comparative assessment of the environmental hazard or risks of PPPs is—both from a scientific and regulatory viewpoint—challenging and has not been sufficiently tested so far [53]. However, the general public and users rightly demand that in future the assessment authorities should make increased use of their expertise to provide information about the more environmentally favourable alternatives. It remains to be seen how effective the instrument of comparative assessment will prove in terms of making environmental impacts measurable.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} <b>PBT</b> and vPvB <b>substances,</b> we would suggest {{to extend the}} {{responsibility}} of the registrants to include a part of the SVHC-identification.

30|$|Two reasons {{support the}} use of {{alternative}} assessment methods: alternative methods for hazard assessment are necessary, as animal testing should be avoided if possible. On the other hand, there is the problem that for specific situations reliable information needed for assessing the hazard potential of a substance is missed when only the established standard assessment schemes, which consist mostly of laboratory tests, are used. The latter leads to misjudgment of substances, which need to be identified as SVHC. To illustrate this point, a small number exercise can be employed: there is an obvious mismatch between the number of substances registered under REACH and the number of substances identified as PBT/vPvB. Currently, 9032 substances (as of the 31.12. 2015) are registered under REACH. However, there are only 22 substances (as of 3.12. 2015) identified as <b>PBT</b> and/or vPvB <b>substances</b> so far and not all of them have been registered. If all of these would have been registered, that would amount to 0.2  % of the registered substances. In a study by Strempel et al. [2], 94, 483 substances of the European Inventory of Existing Commercial chemical Substances (EINECS register) were screened for PBT and vPvB properties. Based on their results, the authors estimate that approximately 3  % of all the substances in the register, i.e. 2930 substances, might be PBT/vPvB substances. In comparison to the 22 PBT/vPvB substances currently identified, this is a mismatch that can only partially be {{explained by the fact that}} the REACH registration has been in force for merely 9  years.|$|R
