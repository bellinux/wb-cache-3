5000|$|Informed of the incident, Power goes to Ontario Airport {{where he}} uses his time-travel device to [...] "preview" [...] the assassination. A man in a cowboy suit shoots Chang with a dart gun {{concealed}} in a camera, while Sato and the female agent watch helplessly. The shooter then escapes in a limousine with Big Buddha in the back <b>seat.</b> <b>Powers</b> then <b>switches</b> to the present, warns Sato by radio of the threat, and orders the limousine be prevented from following their taxi.

5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. Headlamp washers and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the <b>power</b> <b>seat</b> <b>switches</b> (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|R
