All Soviet heavy submarines are built with a double hull structure, but American submarines usually are single-hulled.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop high {{sensitivity}} micro sensors for bio-magnetic field using NiFe electroplated composite sensing elements, {{it is important to}} study how different plating processes can affect the magnetic properties in terms of the chemical composition and magnetic structure of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer.</b> In this study, to study the effect of the magnetic field on the magnetic structure of the electroplated NiFe <b>layers,</b> magnetic controlled <b>plating</b> in which a longitudinal magnetic field ranging from 0 to 400 Oe is applied during nanocrystalline electroplating of permalloy Ni 80 Fe 20 layer of 2 µm thick onto a 20 µm diameter Cu wire. The magnetic structure of the <b>plated</b> <b>layers</b> is studied by investigating the Giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effect of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer.</b> GMI has been measured from a frequency range of 100 kHz to 50 MHz. It is observed that under conventional electroplating without an external magnetic controlling field, the anisotropy of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> is generally circumferential as indicted by the double peaks of the MI curves in testing at high frequency. When a longitudinal magnetic field is applied during electroplating, the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> shows single peak MI curves, suggesting that the anisotropy is changed from circumferential to longitudinal. The results also show that the sensitivity and resolution of a magnetic field sensor is improved greatly by changing the anisotropy of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> from circumferential to longitudinal...|$|R

A 1. 2 mm-thick non-plated carbon steel sheet and plated steel sheets with zinc alloy (ZAM), pure zinc (GI), zinc alloy including Fe (GA) and Al-Si alloy (AS) were prepared. The melting temperature of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> is 330, 420, 880 and 640 °C, respectively. A 1. 1 mm-thick 6022 aluminum alloy sheet was overlapped on the steel sheet. A rotating tool was inserted from the aluminum alloy sheet side and the probe tip was kept at the position of 0. 2 mm above the lapped interface for 3 seconds. For ZAM and GI, original <b>plated</b> <b>layers</b> {{were removed from the}} interface and intermediate layers were formed at the joint interface. This is because the melting temperature of the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> was lower than the interface temperature under the rotating probe tip during the FSSW. In contrast to that, the partial original <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> remained after welding, and additional layer formed at the <b>plated</b> <b>layer</b> /aluminum alloy interface for GA.

Nitrogen ions were implanted, with energies of − 15 to − 25 keV and doses of 1, 5 and 10 × 1017 atoms cm− 2, to modify the surface properties of Cr <b>plating</b> <b>layer.</b> The surface properties of the films were characterized by XRD, SEM, ruby-ball on disk type tribometer and nanoindenter.

The surface hardness of the Cr 3 + <b>plating</b> <b>layer</b> was increased from 16 to 25 GPa by N+-PSII. Severe wear and higher friction was observed on N+-PSII treated trivalent Cr plating.

The electroless Ni-B <b>plating</b> <b>layer</b> {{was characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Vickers hardness and electrochemical techniques in 3. 5 wt % NaCl aqueous solution. The results showed that TU and SAC had different effects on the morphology and a similar influence on the particle size of the plating. TU slightly decreased the B content in the coating, while SAC had no effect. The two additives reduced the Ni-B plating rate and enhanced the corrosion resistance of the coating. Appropriate amounts of the additives improved higher micro-hardness of the plating. Elements diffusion occurred between substrate and coating during heat-treatment. After heat-treatment the deposited coating layer transformed from an amorphous structure to crystalline. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 012207 jes] All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Direct plating of {{electroless}} Ni-P layers on Al-Ni alloy films {{formed on}} glass substrates was performed using magnetron-sputtered deposition and ion beam-assisted deposition methods. Dissolution of Al from the alloy films {{occurred in the}} initial stage of the plating process and resulted in enrichment of Ni on the surface. Since Ni acts {{as a catalyst for}} the Ni-P deposition reaction, Ni-P deposition occurs on the alloy surface without zincate pretreatment. In the case of an Al- 10 Ni alloy film, however, Ni clusters dropped from the Al-Ni alloy surface, and Ni-P particles grew in the plating bath, causing dissipation of chemicals in the bath. Such particles also readhered to the surface, resulting in a nonuniform <b>plating</b> <b>layer.</b> A lower concentration of Ni in an alloy such as an Al- 3 Ni or Al- 1 Ni alloy resulted in a rather smooth plating surface. In the case of a neutral plating bath containing a low concentration of P, cone structures were formed in the <b>plating</b> <b>layer.</b> Such structures seem to form at the nucleation sites of Ni deposition in the initial stage of the plating process. © 2003 The Electrochemical Society.
