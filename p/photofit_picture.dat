50|$|Inexplicably, the two {{witnesses}} {{who said the}} vehicle was a Vauxhall, later changed their minds and signed statements that the vehicle {{may have been an}} FJ Holden. The Police, believing the car seen parked near the murder scene was the offender's, concentrated on finding the vehicle rather than the driver, no sketch or <b>photofit</b> <b>picture</b> of the suspect was ever released and, despite evidence from the witness who refueled the car that the petrol cap was on the left side which ruled out the vehicle being a Holden, the media only ran pictures of FJ Holdens.|$|E
5000|$|Tate's {{disappearance}} {{occurred within}} sight of her home village shortly after 15:30 (BST) on Saturday 19 August 1978. Her bicycle and scattered newspapers were found lying {{in the middle of}} a quiet country lane by two friends with whom she had spoken minutes earlier. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a maroon Triumph (or vehicle of very similar visual appearance) in the lane at around the time of the disappearance, and police issued a <b>photofit</b> <b>picture</b> of a man they wanted to question in relation to the abduction. This individual was described as being a [...] "very handsome man" [...] in his early 20s with a pale complexion, short dark hair, who had been wearing a light-coloured shirt.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an indexing {{and a quick}} sort method {{that could be used}} to find the possible matching guilty pictures from the police database by using a tracing software and eyewitness descriptions about the suspected guilty profile. It is well known that databases located in the police departments have a large amount of prerecorded convicted guilty pictures. Searching a picture from database for recognition is very hard and it may take too much time. In addition to this, it can also require to track many redundant pictures to find the correct guilty. There is, of course, no guarantee that <b>Photofit</b> (robot <b>picture)</b> is included in database. Therefore police departments have difficult problems to recognize exact guilty using Photofits described by eyewitness. In this paper, a matrix construction using particular distances on face has been demonstrated. In order to find these certain points on the face, a new point selection schema and some existing recognition methods are presented. Finally, three different determinant values of this matrix are computed and are used for picture indexing in the database. In the test environment, the system results 30 different matches with the predefined Photofits by using this indexing algorithm together with a face tracing software and a patch program, proving that the tracking time for redundant pictures is reduced...|$|R
50|$|McLean's {{disappearance}} {{was made}} public knowledge on 22 April. Tanner spoke {{from his home in}} Lenton, Nottingham, and said how he had given McLean a farewell kiss on platform 2 of Oxford railway station as he boarded his train home. He also explained how he and McLean had been joined by a long-haired man as they sat drinking coffee in the station concourse. He said the stranger seemed to know McLean well and offered her a lift home. McLean's parents, Joan and Malcolm, took part in a press conference on 24 April and appealed for help in finding their daughter. Police had briefed journalists at the conference to pose questions to Tanner that would ultimately reinforce their suspicion that Tanner was involved in the disappearance. Meanwhile, searches continued around Argyle Street and nearby scrubland, and police frogmen dragged the River Cherwell. Police issued a <b>photofit</b> <b>picture</b> of the man whom Tanner claimed to have met at Oxford station, but nobody came forward to place him at the station with McLean and Tanner.|$|E
