Natural draft counterflow towers and mechanical draft counterflow and crossflow towers are considered. The Merkel, Poppe and e-NTU heat and mass transfer {{methods of analysis}} are derived from first principles, as these methods form the cornerstone of wet-cooling tower performance evaluation. The critical differences between these methods, when applied to fill performance analyses and cooling tower performance evaluations, are highlighted. The reasons for these differences are discussed {{with the aid of}} <b>psychrometric</b> <b>charts.</b> A new extended empirical relation for the loss coefficient of fills is proposed where the viscous and form drag effects are accounted for as well as the buoyancy, momentum and fill height effects. The empirical equation for the transfer characteristic of fills is extended to include the effects of fill height and the inlet water temperature. Empirical equations to predict the temperature inversion profile, height of the temperature inversion and the height from which air is drawn into the cooling tower are developed. The influence of temperature and humidity inversions on the performance of wet-cooling towers is subsequently investigated. A comprehensive analytical computer program is developed to predict and optimize the performance of wet-cooling towers. Computer programs are also developed to generate cooling tower performance curves, analyze fill performance test data and plot <b>psychrometric</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R

The major challenge is to ensure a continuous ‘cold chain’ from producer to consumer in order to guaranty prime condition of goods. In this framework, the suitability of ZigBee protocol for monitoring refrigerated transportation has been proposed by several authors. However, up to date there was not any experimental work performed under real conditions. Thus, the main objective of our experiment was to test wireless sensor motes based in the ZigBee/IEEE 802. 15. 4 protocol during a real shipment.

Thermal discomfort may be a key driver of passenger perceptions of airport service levels, specially under capacity overload situations.

40|$|Abstract. This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} results of a long-term thermal comfort monitoring effort in the so-called OEKOHAUS building in Petronell, Lower Austria. This building mainly acts as an educational facility for the Museum of Natural History of Vienna and includes also office and short-term occupancy spaces. It was established in an existing building, adapted and refurbished in 1996. At the time of refurbishment, it clearly exceeded the applicable standard thermal requirements for building elements. Given the building's unique mixed use, it displays a highly fluctuating occupancy pattern. Subsequent to the recent installment of energy and indoor climate monitoring system, multiple streams of data are being collected. Specifically, indoor environmental variables relevant to thermal comfort in a number of zones in the building have been monitored and evaluated. Collected data include indoor temperature and relative humidity, which were represented and analyzed for different zones of the building in terms of <b>psychrometric</b> <b>charts</b> (for a monitoring period in Winter 2012 / 13).

40|$|In {{order to}} protect heat {{disorder}} due to hot environment, the authors have developed a model for predicting body temperatures, which has the following three characteristics: 1) regulatory thermal sweating is expressed as a linear function of the mean skin temperature under constant metabolic rate, 2) sweat efficiency is expressed {{as a function of}} skin wettedness, and 3) the effect of wetted clothing, defined as clothing wettedness, caused by dripping sweat on physiological responses is considered.

A coefficient kadp of individual variability on regulatory thermal sweating was identified, which equals 1 for an average person. The analysis of sweating characteristics using human experimental data indicated that the variation of kadp appeared not only between individual subjects but between the same subjects.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{technical}} feasibility {{of an alternative}} method of decoupling air-conditioning systems function {{within the context of}} ecological issues. The system is a variant of dedicated outdoor air systems to separate dehumidification and cooling in air conditioning equipment. The project specifically investigates locating these components within the building envelope. Placement in the envelope moves the systems closer to fresh air and offers architectural expression for components that are normally out of sight. Designers, engineers, building science, mechanical, structural, biologist, and architectural engineers ideally as agents offer beneficial improvement to the system. The reduction in size of components into the building envelope offers risk. The thesis design space uses historical works, biological analogues, and past work to ground the technical understanding of the topic. Specific use of biological inspired design realizes translation from other systems to improve the alternative decoupled air conditioning system.

40|$|Chinese vernacular {{dwellings}} are low-energy buildings constructed {{before the}} advent of modern external services. No work has been published that incorporates an exacting assessment of the environmental performance of these buildings. The principal aim of this research was to investigate the environmental performance of Chinese vernacular skywell dwellings quantitatively and to establish a model of rigorous and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative research in this area. This was done by analysis of on-site measurements and computer simulation of the environmental performance of eight vernacular skywell dwellings in three villages in south-eastern China - Xidi, Zhifeng and Yuyuan. Environmental performance and building form are examined in relation to current knowledge of the social and economic life of the villages in the past centuries, and to the environmental comfort and the activities of present-day residents of the eight dwellings and other vernacular houses in the villages. It has previously been noted that, in general, the courtyard/skywell of vernacular dwellings decreases in size with progression from northern China to southern China as the climate becomes warmer. However, the mean size of the skywells was found to differ considerably between the three climatically similar villages - large skywells were found in Yuyuan village, medium sized skywells in Xidi village and very small skywells in Zhifeng village. While physical factors were found to be important in determining house form; socioeconomic, cultural and security considerations were found to be strong influences as well. The investigation of the natural illumination of Chinese vernacular dwellings conducted in this study was the first quantitative study of the distribution of natural light in these houses. Houses in the three villages were found to differ in their distribution of illumination according to local skywell form. In all three villages residents were found to take various actions to pursue satisfactory daylighting. Two patterns of daylighting isolux contour in skywell dwellings were identified and analysed. The first comprehensive quantitative study of the thermal performance of Chinese vernacular skywell dwellings was conducted by on-site measurement and administration of questionnaires to residents. Residents of Xidi and Zhifeng were found to appreciate the coolness of their houses in summer, but residents of all three villages found their houses unacceptably cold in winter. The efforts made by residents to mitigate extremes of heat and cold appear to be important in ensuring their thermal comfort. Evidence was obtained that evaporative cooling had a substantial influence on the temperature in the skywells of dwellings in Xidi and Zhifeng villages. In addition to the buffering of temperature by thermal mass, evaporative cooling was found to further reduce the fluctuation in temperature inside the skywell and is likely to have been the main reason that the mean dry bulb temperatures inside the skywells in these villages were lower than the mean external dry bulb temperatures. It is proposed that evaporative cooling in skywells can be exploited even in humid conditions, because natural ventilation can ensure exchange of air between the exterior and the interior of the skywell. Summer temperature/humidity data obtained in the most used spaces of skywell dwellings in the three villages were plotted on <b>psychrometric</b> <b>charts</b> and were examined in relation to the boundaries of predicted thermal comfort zones. The acceptability of thermal conditions in the dwellings that was predicted using this approach was very much lower than that reported by residents. Residents appear to be more tolerant of high humidity with the presence of natural ventilation. Such air movement is desirable to improve the thermal comfort for house occupants in hot and humid conditions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|Evaporative coolers {{lower the}} {{temperature}} of air using the principle of evaporative cooling, unlike typical air conditioning systems which use vapor-compression refrigeration or absorption refrigerator. Evaporative cooling is the addition of water vapor into air, which causes a lowering of {{the temperature of}} the air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat, which affects {{the temperature of the}} air, and converted into latent heat, the energy present in the water vapor component of the air, whilst the air remains at a constant enthalpy value. This conversion of sensible heat to latent heat is known as an adiabatic process because it occurs at a constant enthalpy value. Evaporative cooling therefore causes a drop in the temperature of air proportional to the sensible heat drop and an increase in humidity proportional to the latent heat gain. Evaporative cooling can be visualized using a <b>psychrometric</b> <b>chart</b> by finding the initial air condition and moving along a line of constant enthalpy toward a state of higher humidity.|$|E
5000|$|An average-sized {{wash load}} will convert {{approximately}} 4965 kilojoules of ambient heat into latent heat that {{is stored in}} the evaporated water, as follows. A typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water, after being spun in a laundry machine. To determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry, weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried. The difference is {{the weight of the}} water that was evaporated from them. Multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kJ/kg, which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram, to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water, or multiply by 0.6250 kWh/kg to get kilowatt-hours. (Note: If the moisture later condenses inside the house, the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly.) [...] To obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation, the process can be traced on a <b>psychrometric</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E
50|$|Evaporative cooling is most {{effective}} when the relative humidity is on the low side, limiting its popularity to dry climates. Evaporative cooling raises the internal humidity level significantly, which desert inhabitants may appreciate as the moist air re-hydrates dry skin and sinuses. Therefore, assessing typical climate data is an essential procedure to determine the potential of evaporative cooling strategies for a building. The three most important climate considerations are dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and wet-bulb depression during the summer design day. It is important {{to determine if the}} wet-bulb depression can provide sufficient cooling during the summer design day. By subtracting the wet-bulb depression from the outside dry-bulb temperature, one can estimate the approximate air temperature leaving the evaporative cooler. It is important to consider that the ability for the exterior dry-bulb temperature to reach the wet-bulb temperature depends on the saturation efficiency. A general recommendation for applying direct evaporative cooling is to implement it in places where the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air does not exceed 22 °C (71.6 °F). However, in the example of Salt Lake City, the upper limit for the direct evaporative cooling on <b>psychrometric</b> <b>chart</b> is 20 °C (68 °F). Despite this lower value, this climate is still suitable for this technique.|$|E
