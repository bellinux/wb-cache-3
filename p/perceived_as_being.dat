5|$|The {{early years}} of the 19th century once again saw an {{increased}} public interest in abolition. Since Napoleon had reintroduced slavery in the French colonies, support of abolition was no longer <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> pro-French.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E
40|$|Childbirth is {{a pivotal}} event in a woman’s life. Labor support plays an {{important}} role in this experience be-cause it influences the woman’s classification of the birth experience as positive or negative. Studies of adult women have identified the type of labor support that enhances the childbirth experience. Few studies, how-ever, have identified the type of labor support that ado-lescents <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> helpful. The purpose of this study was to identify the nursing behaviors that adoles-cents <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> helpful during labor. A descrip-tive study was conducted with a convenience sample of 16 adolescents. Findings indicated that adolescents’ needs focus on pain relief, nonjudgmental nursing care, and emotional support...|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} made {{as an attempt}} to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live {{performances}} on film, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> offensive, the film was screened as a midnight movie, received positive notice, and developed a cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

30|$|Furr and Funder (2004) {{have argued}} that {{behaviour}} which is exhibited in family/parenting roles may transfer to other roles that an individual <b>perceives</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> similar. This concept, known as interrole behavioral congruence (Diener & Larsen, 1984), serves as the driving mechanism {{used in this study}} to demonstrate the influence parenting roles can have on leadership styles at work.|$|R

25|$|The {{religion}} of ancient Greece {{was a form}} of nature worship that grew out of the beliefs of earlier cultures.

25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people may be <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|In the OLAP {{industry}} ROLAP {{is usually}} <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> able to scale for large data volumes, but suffering from slower query performance {{as opposed to}} MOLAP.

25|$|Per capita butter {{consumption}} {{declined in}} most western nations during the 20th century, {{in large part}} because of the rising popularity of margarine, which is less expensive and, until recent years, was <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> healthier.

25|$|During the 1920s {{concerns}} about antisemitism increased across Europe. By 1928, nations were increasingly legislating immigration, which at times prevented Jews from entering, {{and some of}} the new European states, established after the First World War, perceived Jewish immigrants as a threat to their political stability. Many countries feared that immigrating Jews from the east would bring revolutionary political ideas with them; Jews were also <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> a negative moral influence on society.|$|E
25|$|Grey {{noise is}} random white noise {{subjected}} to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted A-weighting curve) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies. This {{is in contrast to}} standard white noise which has equal strength over a linear scale of frequencies but is not <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> equally loud due to biases in the human equal-loudness contour.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the haptic {{perception}} of parallelity on a horizontal plane showed that what subjects haptically <b>perceive</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> parallel deviates considerably from what is physically parallel. The deviations could be described with a subject-dependent orientation gradient in the left-right direction. The questions underlying the present study are the following: (1) Does the haptic perception of parallelity in the midsagittal plane also show systematic deviations from veridicality? (2) Are the unimanual and bimanuel performances again quantitatively but not qualitatively different...|$|R
25|$|Sex {{trafficking}} {{increases the}} risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic can be both a cause and a consequence of sex trafficking. On one hand, child-prostitutes are sought by customers because they are <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> less likely to be HIV positive, and this demand leads to child sex trafficking. On the other hand, trafficking leads to the proliferation of HIV, because victims, being vulnerable and often young/inexperienced, cannot protect themselves properly, and get infected.|$|E
25|$|Cosmetic use {{is also an}} {{important}} cue for forming impressions, particularly of women. Those wearing heavy makeup are seen as significantly more feminine than those wearing moderate makeup or no makeup and those wearing heavy or moderate makeup are seen as more attractive than those wearing no makeup. While a woman wearing no makeup is <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> more moral than the other two conditions, there is no difference between experimental conditions when judging personality or personal temperament.|$|E

50|$|Another way is {{to stare}} at an object behind the picture {{in an attempt to}} {{establish}} proper divergence, while keeping part of the eyesight fixed on the picture to convince the brain to focus on the picture.
