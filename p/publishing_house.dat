50|$|As major {{commercial}} <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> increasingly {{declined to}} publish manuscripts in the 1970s and 1980s {{that did not}} appear to guarantee commercial success, authors sought out <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> like Gibbs Smith.|$|R
30|$|First, <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> in the work-unit system {{played an}} {{important}} role in carrying out administrative initiatives and representing individuals. As soon as administrative orders, regulations, and policies of the central and local governments were sent to <b>publishing</b> <b>houses,</b> editors were organized to study government documents. Also, in the work-unit system, editors were tightly connected to the state and society through <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> as their work units, which served as mediators between the state and individuals (Lu and Perry 1997). For example, editors who needed their birth certificates notarized by public notary agencies were required to obtain approval from their <b>publishing</b> <b>houses.</b> Also, editors studying abroad who wanted their spouse, children, or parents to visit them needed to receive approval letters from the <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> with which they were formerly affiliated.|$|R

5|$|After van der Linden's {{death in}} 1885, Lie paid his teacher's widow {{a total of}} 1,000gulden to acquire the Zending Press; the funds were, in part, {{borrowed}} from his friends. He changed the printer's name to Lie Kim Hok soon afterwards. He devoted {{most of his time}} to the <b>publishing</b> <b>house,</b> and it grew quickly, printing works by other authors and reprinting some of Lie's earlier writings. The <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> was, however, unable to turn a profit. That year he published a new syair, consisting of 24quartets, entitled Orang Prampoewan. He also wrote opinion pieces in various newspapers, including Bintang Betawi and Domingoe.|$|E
40|$|Some <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> in Portugal had {{a notable}} {{political}} role {{from the end}} of the 1960 s to the late 1970 s. They published books that clearly opposed Salazar’s regime, and after the Revolution of April 25 th they kept publishing works that greatly contributed to the political debate in the country. At least 24 of these political <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> were located in the city of Oporto, although their distribution and influence could reach the whole of Portugal. In this paper I present a general outline of these <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> and analyze in detail some of them. To conclude, I indicate which <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> were more important in the Portuguese political process both before and after the Carnation Revolution, pointing out some specificity of Oporto political publishing features...|$|R
