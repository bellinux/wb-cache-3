25|$|The Susquehanna Boom {{lost its}} {{profitability}} for three main reasons. First was the <b>periodic</b> <b>floods</b> that swept down the West Branch Valley following the winter snow melt and the spring rains. The West Branch Valley was devastated by a flood in 1894. The sawmills {{along the river}} were largely destroyed. The boom was washed away close to two million of board feet (5,000 m³) of freshly cut timber were washed down the Susquehanna River. Second were the newly constructed railroads in North Central Pennsylvania. These railroads were able to transport the fresh timber more quickly and were less risky, expensive and dangerous than floating the logs down the West Branch Susquehanna River and its tributaries. Thirdly, little thought for the future was placed when the massive stands of old growth forest were harvested during the 19th century. The mountains were clear cut. The tops of the trees were left to dry. The passing steam trains spread burning embers along the railroad tracks. These embers would spark devastating fires that prevented the forests from regrowing. Without trees the sawmills could no longer process timber, the mills closed and eventually the boom itself was forced to close in 1908.|$|E
2500|$|Bannon's {{strategic}} {{thinking has}} {{been influenced by}} Neil Howe's and William Strauss's Fourth Turning theory, which proposes that [...] "populism, nationalism and state-run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. [...] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with {{only a limited number}} of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order. [...] Forests need periodic fires; rivers need <b>periodic</b> <b>floods.</b> Societies, too." [...] The book is said to have been a major influence on Bannon's film Generation Zero.|$|E
5|$|<b>Periodic</b> <b>flooding</b> of the Canning River {{from the}} dam is {{required}} to disperse seed, stimulate germination and ensure seedlings survive, recharge shallow groundwater tables that are important during periods of drought and to discourage and prevent weed growth.

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{whether the}} Channeled Scabland landforms were formed mainly by multiple <b>periodic</b> <b>floods,</b> or {{by a single}} grand-scale cataclysmic flood from late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Missoula or from an unidentified Canadian source, continued through 1999. [...] Shaw’s team of geologists reviewed the sedimentary sequences of the Touchet beds {{and concluded that the}} sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries. Rather, they proposed that sedimentation in the Glacial Lake Missoula basin was the result of jökulhlaups draining into Lake Missoula from British Columbia to the north. [...] Further, Shaw’s team proposed the scabland flooding might have partially originated from an enormous subglacial reservoir that extended over much of central British Columbia, particularly including the Rocky Mountain Trench, which may have discharged by several paths, including one through Lake Missoula. This discharge, if occurring concurrently with the breach of the Lake Missoula ice dam, would have provided significantly larger volumes of water. [...] Further, Shaw and team proposed that the rhythmic Touchet beds are the result of multiple pulses, or surges, within a single larger flood.|$|E
2500|$|Vancouver {{lies just}} north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate. Both are {{classified}} as dry-summer subtropical (Csb) on the Köppen climate classification, with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the Cascade Range create something of a venturi effect, leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the Willamette Valley, Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including [...] "silver thaw" [...] storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power {{in the city for}} almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is [...] Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2–4 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as Celilo Falls. <b>Periodic</b> <b>floods</b> have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May, 1948. The 1948 Memorial Day flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby Vanport, Oregon. Other unusual storms include the Columbus Day windstorm of 1962 and an April 5, 1972 tornado which rated F3 on the Fujita scale, striking a local school. A F1 tornado struck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a [...] path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.|$|E
