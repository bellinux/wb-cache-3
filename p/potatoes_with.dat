5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely <b>potatoes</b> (<b>with</b> a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E

25|$|The borzoi is a quiet, but {{athletic}} and independent dog. Most borzois are almost silent, barking only very rarely.

Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but will turn aggressive if handled roughly.

25|$|Some animists also view {{plant and}} fungi life as persons and {{interact}} with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has {{to be carried out}} respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer karakia invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet <b>potatoes,</b> <b>with</b> both understood as having arrived in Aotearoa together in the same canoes. In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can {{come in the form of}} libations of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.|$|E

500|$|He was {{regarded}} worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions. He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised {{the wearing of}} black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs {{from side to side}} in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet. A stickler for proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a Privy Councillor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that [...] "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance." [...] The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48inches (122cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and <b>potatoes</b> <b>with</b> horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch.

500|$|Early on, the Waldorf was a {{laughing}} stock with its {{large number of}} bathrooms and was known briefly as [...] "Boldt's Folly" [...] after Boldt, or [...] "Astor's Folly", with the general perception of the palatial hotel being {{that it had no}} place in New York City. It appeared destined for failure. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. [...] Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children the day after the Waldorf opened. [...] The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. [...] Despite the rain, the ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid $5.00 for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt donated the services of the New York Symphony Orchestra led by Walter Damrosch to provide the music for the event. Even with proper escort, women of the times generally did not venture into hotels, but those attending also toured the facilities. While Boldt made news by insisting the Waldorf's waiters be clean-shaven even though he wore a beard, his decision to hire young Oscar Tschirky was one of the key factors in the hotel's success. Oscar was personable, humble and very willing to tend to patrons' needs on an individual basis. More than thirty years later, Tschirky was able to recall the Waldorf's opening day and the names of many of the Social Register guests who made the hotel successful when it hosted the charity concert and dinner. Business soon picked up and it earned $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period. By 1895, the Waldorf added a five story addition. [...] This brought the hotel's ballroom down to the main floor; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes, into the Waldorf. [...] Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room, where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth. [...] In winter, waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked <b>potatoes</b> <b>with</b> butter.|$|E
