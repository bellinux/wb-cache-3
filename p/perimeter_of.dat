2500|$|Viète {{obtained}} his formula {{by comparing}} the areas of regular polygons with [...] and [...] sides inscribed in a circle. The first term in the product, , is the ratio of areas of a square and an octagon, the second term is the ratio of areas of an octagon and a hexadecagon, etc. Thus, the product telescopes to give the ratio of areas of a square (the initial polygon in the sequence) to a circle (the limiting case of a -gon). Alternatively, the terms in the product may be instead interpreted as ratios <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> the same sequence of polygons, starting with the ratio <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> a digon (the diameter of the circle, counted twice) and a square, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> a square and an octagon, etc.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of finding a minimum cost path in a graph. In particular, {{we consider}} the perimeter search technique and we investigate {{the possibility of using}} very large perimeters. We present an algorithm designed to use <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary size. Our algorithm generates the perimeter incrementally and makes use of a technique called backward pruning for reducing the search effort. A qualitative analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively use <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> very large size...|$|R

5|$|A {{rectangular}} swimming area on {{the southern}} bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned {{off from the rest}} of the lake by a <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E

Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, {{takes care of the}} place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E

Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in use for {{the final of the}} Olympic football tournament.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover {{that it was just}} as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

5|$|Marine General Rathvon M.

Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
