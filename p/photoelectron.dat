40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} ultra-low kinetic energy <b>photoelectrons.</b> Many experimental techniques employed {{for the detection of}} <b>photoelectrons</b> require the presence of (more or less) weak electric extraction fields in order to perform the measurement. Our studies show that ultra-low energy <b>photoelectrons</b> exhibit a characteristic shift in their apparent measured momentum when the target system is exposed to such static electric fields. Already fields as weak as 1 V cm(- 1) have an observable influence on the detected electron momentum. This apparent shift is demonstrated by an experiment on zero energy <b>photoelectrons</b> emitted from He and explained through theoretical model calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{transverse}} {{instability in}} the Photon Factory has been observed and described by Ohmi ‘l]as an instability of a positron beam in a storage ring induced by <b>photoelectrons.</b> (I would like to mention that W. Stoeffl {{also pointed out that}} <b>photoelectrons</b> may produce an effective wake-field somewhere in the middle of 1994). The <b>photoelectrons</b> are produced by synchrotron radiation in the beam pipe wall and accelerated by the transverse electric field of the beam. A transverse kick given by the <b>photoelectrons</b> to the trailing bunches depends on the off-set of the previous bunches. The situation is, in general, analogous to the beam break-up [2]inducedby the regular transverse wakefields, and to the recently described ion-induced transverse instability [3] of an electron beam. The processes defining the density distribution of the <b>photoelectrons</b> are quite complicated. Detailed description of the instability requires computer simulations...|$|R
5000|$|Secondary {{electrons}} are electrons generated as ionization products. They {{are called}} 'secondary' {{because they are}} generated by other radiation (the primary radiation). This radiation {{can be in the}} form of ions, electrons, or photons with sufficiently high energy, i.e. exceeding the ionization potential. <b>Photoelectrons</b> can be considered an example of secondary electrons where the primary radiation are photons; in some discussions <b>photoelectrons</b> with higher energy (>50 eV) are still considered [...] "primary" [...] while the electrons freed by the <b>photoelectrons</b> are [...] "secondary".|$|R

40|$|Kinetic {{modeling}} {{results are}} analyzed {{to examine the}} transport of <b>photoelectrons</b> through the nightside inner magnetosphere. Two sources are considered, those on the dayside from direct solar illumination and those across the nightside from light scattered by the upper atmosphere and geocorona. A natural filter exists on the nightside for the dayside <b>photoelectrons.</b> Coulomb collisions erode the distribution at low energies and low L shells, and magnetospheric convection compresses the electrons as they drift toward dawn. It is shown that for low-activity levels a band of <b>photoelectrons</b> forms between L = 4 and 6 that extends throughout the nightside local times and into the morning sector. For the scattered light <b>photoelectrons</b> the trapped zone throughout the nightside is populated with electrons of E less than 30 eV. At high L shells near dawn, convective compression on the nightside yields an accelerated population with electrons at energies up to twice the ionospheric energy maximum (that is, roughly 1200 eV for dayside <b>photoelectrons</b> and 60 eV for scattered light electrons). Modeled energy and pitch angle distributions are presented to show the features of these populations...|$|R

Very great resolving power is obtained and considerable precision in determining the exact position of the lines (i. e. the energies of the <b>photoelectrons).</b> The numbers of LIII electrons of gold ejected by the Kα 1 x-ray of molybdenum have been plotted as a function of the angle of ejection and compared with the theoretical longitudinal distribution predicted by Schur...|$|R
25|$|<b>Photoelectron</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{is usually}} {{done in a}} high-vacuum environment, since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present.

25|$|Through the {{defects in}} the crystal, the {{electron}} {{is able to}} reduce its energy and become trapped in the atom.

25|$|A photoabsorbed photon {{transfers}} all {{its energy}} to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a <b>photoelectron</b> {{that is likely to}} ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic photon or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} increasing photographic sensitivity is to separate photoholes away from <b>photoelectrons</b> and sensitivity sites. This should reduce {{the probability of}} recombination. Reduction sensitization is one possible implementation of this concept.

40|$|The {{noise in}} a hybrid {{photomultiplier}} tube is investigated. <b>Photoelectrons</b> produced at the photocathode are accelerated towards a silicon P-I-N diode. They create electron-hole pairs in the depletion {{region of the}} diode and produce an amplified current of gain M, which is not due to avalanche multiplication by the internal field in the diode, but multiple ionisations of the primary <b>photoelectrons.</b> The gain increases linearly with an acceleration voltage, VPC, beyond a threshold voltage, which is necessary for <b>photoelectrons</b> to penetrate {{the top layer of}} the material. Above 1 Hz, we observed only shot noise. The shot noise is the sum of two contributions: (i) full shot noise due to photon absorption in the diode, because the photocathode is partially transparent; (ii) a specific white noise due to the multiplication of primary <b>photoelectrons.</b> It is shown that the multiplication mechanism gives rise to a white noise 2 ̆ 6 amp;aM’a PK...|$|R

This can be compared with the image contrast degradation reported for sub-40nm pitches later in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Photoelectric effect: This {{describes}} {{the case in}} which a gamma photon interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the resulting <b>photoelectron</b> is equal to the energy of the incident gamma photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50 keV (thousand electron volts), but it is much less important at higher energies.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelength}} of the <b>photoelectron</b> {{is dependent on}} the energy and phase of the backscattered wave which exists at the central atom.

The phase and amplitude of the backscattered wave are dependent on the type of atom doing the backscattering and the distance of the backscattering atom from the central atom. The dependence of the scattering on atomic species makes it possible to obtain information pertaining to the chemical coordination environment of the original absorbing (centrally excited) atom by analyzing these EXAFS data.|$|E

25|$|For a given metal, {{there exists}} a certain minimum {{frequency}} of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the threshold frequency. Increasing {{the frequency of the}} incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each <b>photoelectron.</b>|$|E
