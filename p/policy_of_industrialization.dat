They investigate manufacturing industry by means of in depth analyses of trends in employment and value added, as well as through brakdowns of export flows and income and prosperity levels. Since the end of WWII it appears that Italian economic growth has largely been formed by the constant, massive flow of exports of personal and household goods and light mechanically-engineered products, that a sizeable flow of exports is attributable to growth in the industrial districts, and that growth by the industrial districts and the <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> in Southern Italy have together engineered a major territorial dispersion of both light and heavy industr...|$|E

The improvement of India's economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade {{is one of the}} most often cited (see also economy of India, The Commanding Heights). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as outsourcing - one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. South Korea and North Korea provide another example of trade-based development vs autocratic self-sufficiency.

However, {{it was not until the}} early 1980 s that they emerged as {{entities}} that enjoyed a monopolistic concentration of capital. Many firms appeared in Korea in the 1950 s, with some of them accumulating a huge influx of wealth. The chaebol were formed during the rule of Syngman Rhee, supported by the sale of property formerly owned by the colonial Japanese government, foreign aid, and an import-substitution industrialization policy (Choi 2007). When Park Chung-hee came to power in 1961, a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> and financial support contributed to the advancement of the Korean chaebol system (Amsden 1989). Moreover, in the 1980 s, the chaebol wanted a more liberal financial system that would allow greater control over capital and investment. At the same time, they also wanted the system to remain protected to the extent that it provided them with cheap credit (Amsden and Euh 1992). According to Lee et al. (2002), the top 30 chaebol owned 12 security companies (out of a total of 25), 18 insurance companies (out of a total of 35) and 18 investment trust companies (out of a total of 38) in 1988. The chaebol became less dependent on government-controlled commercial banks, while the government lost much of its power to influence the chaebol’s investment decisions.|$|E
30|$|The state-led {{industrial}} policy strategy {{began in the}} 1970 s in Indonesia during the Suharto regime, driven by a large windfall in government oil revenue from 1973 to 1980 {{through the development of}} state-owned firms. The government strictly protected the state-owned firms and other domestic producers from international competition by providing tariff and non-tariff barriers, raw material subsidies, and credit subsidies in addition to maintaining undervalued exchange rates [3, 4]. Whereas the share of the manufacturing sector to GDP increased, empirical studies generally agreed that there was no gain and potentially negative TFP growth in the manufacturing sector in Indonesia during the period between 1975 and 1985 [5 – 7]. In 1986, the devaluation of the exchange rate of the rupiah against the US dollar triggered a shift in foreign direct investment (FDI) from the Asian newly industrialized economies to Indonesia, which promoted a labor-intensive manufacturing base in industries such as textiles, shoes, wood products, and processed food. As a result of an increasingly open economic policy, the share of manufacturing products has significantly expanded in terms of foreign exports since the middle of the 1980 s. Furthermore, with the development of the machinery industry driven by FDI, the export of machinery products has also increased since the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The shift to an FDI-led import substitution <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> has resulted in an increase in TFP for the manufacturing sector of Indonesia.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the Cuban-American struggle to control Cuba 2 ̆ 7 s postwar {{economic development in}} the period 1944 - 1952. Cuba emerged {{from the war in}} a strong position to negotiate with the United States. The Americans required sugar and Cuba had plenty of it. When the United States suggested to Cuba 2 ̆ 7 s President, Ramon Grau San Martin, a strategy for economic development that de-emphasized the sugar industry and instead recommended industrial growth and a suitable climate for foreign investment, including restraints upon labor, the Cuban government refused to comply. Cuba needed to sell sugar and market conditions were favorable for sales. ^ But by 1947 circumstances had changed. The United States no longer needed as much sugar from Cuba, so Havana was forced to modify its stance. When the new Cuban President, Carlos Prio Socarras, realized that the Americans were no longer willing to grant its sugar petitions, he began to look for new markets. At the same time the Cubans drafted a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrialization.</b> Prio also opened Cuba 2 ̆ 7 s doors to military links with the Americans, an initiative which the United States viewed as fundamental to achieve internal security. President Prio, however, resisted American pressures to modify his labor policy which tolerated strikes and provided for higher wages. He needed the political support of the workers and refused to take measures to restrict them. Employers criticized him and the United States lost trust in the Cuban President. The military coup orchestrated by Fulgencio Batista on March 10, 1952, found Prio politically weak. Cuban capitalists and the Truman Administration supported the new regime. They turned to Batista in the hope that a strong hand could help them achieve their goals. The United States and Cuba were finally in basic agreement on the strategy to develop the Cuban economy. ^ This study is based upon archival research at the United States National Archives, the Harry S. Truman Library, and the University of Florida Libraries, as well as upon contemporary Cuban and American documents and publications. Interviews with persons who participated in the events also helped in reconstructing the Cuban side of the story. ...|$|E

While other Mexican towns pursued <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>industrialization,</b> San Miguel—on the economic, political, and cultural margins of revolutionary Mexico—worked to demonstrate that it preserved an authentic quality, earning designation as a “typical Mexican town” by the Guanajuato state legislature in 1939.

Lisa Pinley Covert examines how this once small, quiet town became a UNESCO World Heritage Site and home to one of Mexico’s largest foreign-born populations. By exploring the intersections of economic development and national identity formation in San Miguel, she reveals how towns and cities in Mexico grappled with change {{over the course of the}} twentieth century. Covert similarly identifies the historical context shaping the promise and perils of a shift from an agricultural to a service-based economy. In the process, she demonstrates how San Miguel could be both typically Mexican and palpably foreign and how the histories behind each process were inextricably intertwined...|$|R
