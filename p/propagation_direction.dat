25|$|The {{output of}} a wind wave {{model is a}} {{description}} of the wave spectra, with amplitudes associated with each frequency and <b>propagation</b> <b>direction.</b> Results are typically summarized by the significant wave height, which is the average height of the one-third largest waves, and the period and <b>propagation</b> <b>direction</b> of the dominant wave.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{properties}} of visible light are intensity, <b>propagation</b> <b>direction,</b> frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization, while its speed in a vacuum, 299,792,458 metres per second, {{is one of}} the fundamental constants of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{the optical}} {{property}} of a material having a refractive index {{that depends on}} the polarization and <b>propagation</b> <b>direction</b> of light. These optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical stress.|$|E

They occur by the mixing of different phonon modes having <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> oblique to the interfaces. The phonon transmission rates are calculated for superlattices with a finite number of periods, and significant dips are predicted for frequencies corresponding to zone-center, zone-boundary, and coupled-mode stop bands...|$|R
25|$|However, for waves {{perpendicular}} to a coast line or in closed laboratory wave channel, the second definition (S2) is more appropriate. These wave systems have zero mass flux and momentum {{when using the}} second definition. In contrast, according to Stokes' first definition (S1), there is a wave-induced mass flux in the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>direction,</b> which has to be balanced by a mean flow U {{in the opposite direction}} – called the undertow.|$|E
25|$|For {{longitudinal}} waves such as {{sound waves}} in fluids, {{the direction of}} oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk solid can be transverse as well as longitudinal, {{for a total of}} three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the shear stress and displacement in directions perpendicular to the <b>propagation</b> <b>direction,</b> while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in seismology.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' second {{definition}} of wave celerity {{is for a}} frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This {{is different from the}} first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone, i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>direction.</b> This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes' second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so ŪE<nbsp&0 for waves propagating in the positive x-direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach.|$|E

25|$|Acoustic phonons are {{coherent}} {{movements of}} atoms of the lattice {{out of their}} equilibrium positions. If the displacement is {{in the direction of}} propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name acoustic). Displacement perpendicular to the <b>propagation</b> <b>direction</b> is comparable to waves in water. If the wavelength of acoustic phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero energy. Acoustic phonons exhibit a linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of acoustic phonons tend to zero with longer wavelength. Longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons are often abbreviated as LA and TA phonons, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the surface, {{there is}} a fluid motion {{associated}} with the free surface motion. While the surface elevation shows a propagating wave, the fluid particles are in an orbital motion. Within the framework of Airy wave theory, the orbits are closed curves: circles in deep water, and ellipses in finite depth—with the ellipses becoming flatter {{near the bottom of}} the fluid layer. So while the wave propagates, the fluid particles just orbit (oscillate) around their average position. With the propagating wave motion, the fluid particles transfer energy in the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>direction,</b> without having a mean velocity. The diameter of the orbits reduces with depth below the free surface. In deep water, the orbit's diameter is reduced to 4% of its free-surface value at a depth of half a wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Media {{that have}} {{different}} indexes of refraction for different polarization modes are called birefringent. Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the material with a significantly different <b>propagation</b> <b>direction,</b> due to refraction. For example, {{this is the}} case with macroscopic crystals of calcite, which present the viewer with two offset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through them. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. In addition, the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normally birefringent will become so when subject to mechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization of light beams, include the use of prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection in a prism set designed for efficient collinear transmission.|$|E
50|$|Ring lasers are {{sometimes}} modified to allow only one <b>direction</b> of <b>propagation</b> {{by placing a}} device into the ring which leads to different losses for different <b>propagation</b> <b>directions.</b> For instance, {{this could be a}} Faraday rotator combined with a polarizing element.|$|R

40|$|The {{realism of}} ray-based {{spectral}} parameterization of convective gravity wave drag, which considers the updated moving {{speed of the}} convective source and multiple wave <b>propagation</b> <b>directions,</b> is tested against the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard the Aqua satellite. Offline parameterization calculations are performed using the global reanalysis data for January and July 2005, and gravity wave temperature variances (GWTVs) are calculated at z = 2. 5 hPa (unfiltered GWTV). AIRS-filtered GWTV, which is directly compared with AIRS, is calculated by applying the AIRS visibility function to the unfiltered GWTV. A comparison between the parameterization calculations and AIRS observations shows that the spatial distribution of the AIRS-filtered GWTV agrees well {{with that of the}} AIRS GWTV. However, the magnitude of the AIRS-filtered GWTV is smaller than that of the AIRS GWTV. When an additional cloud top gravity wave momentum flux spectrum with longer horizontal wavelength components that were obtained from the mesoscale simulations is included in the parameterization, both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the AIRS-filtered GWTVs from the parameterization are in good agreement with those of the AIRS GWTVs. The AIRS GWTV can be reproduced reasonably well by the parameterization not only with multiple wave <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> but also with two wave <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> of 45 degrees (northeast-southwest) and 135 degrees (northwest-southeast), which are optimally chosen for computational efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Seismic wave {{propagation}} in organized matter usually results in azimuthal variations of longitudinal waves (Pwaves), {{as well as}} the effect of birefringence in transversal waves (S-waves), which results in two orthogonal shear waves with contrasting velocities. In this paper we present the results of the anisotropic seismic properties of five samples of muscovitequartz mylonites collected in different parts of a fold in the Saas Fee region, Western Internal Alps. The P-wave velocities in these rocks varies from 5. 73 to 6. 32 km/s, whereas the high-velocity shear wave (S 1) varies from 3. 82 to 4. 22 km/s and the low velocity (S 2) from 3. 73 to 4. 09 km/s. The anisotropy in these rocks is relatively high and reaches values from 9. 5 % for P-waves, and almost 11 % for shear wave splitting. Both anisotropy and <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> seem to be related to from the strong preferred orientation of quartz and muscovite but also depend of muscovite modal content within the different specimens. Development of preferred orientation of minerals destroys and disperses the single crystal seismic properties, which causes a decrease of wave velocities and a dispersion of <b>propagation</b> <b>directions,</b> of both compressional and shear waves. Since the preferred orientation of quartz and muscovite can be directly related to the main macroscopic structures in these rocks (foliation, lineation, and pole of foliation) and the anisotropic seismic properties are related to the preferred orientation, it is possible to determine the <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> in terms of these structures. Due to the relatively high muscovite content, many of the maximum propagation velocities are parallel/subparallel to the foliation and some parallel to the lineation of the reference frame. On the other hand, <b>directions</b> of minimum <b>propagation</b> cannot be directly related to the foliation pole. The presence of folds in the mid-to lower crust can exert changes in the <b>propagation</b> <b>directions</b> due to the foliation variation around such structures, mainly in the P-waves...|$|R
