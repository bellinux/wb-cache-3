However, given the highly complex nature, and lack of control on RTL design, <b>push-button</b> <b>types</b> of synthesis is not accepted by most designers. Interactive design space exploration with assistance of tools and algorithms can be more eective because it provides control of all steps of synthesis. In this paper, we propose an interactive RTL design environment, which enables designers to control design steps. In our interactive envi-ronment, the user can control the design process at every stage, observe the eects of design decisions, and manually override synthesis decisions at will. Finally, we present a set of experimental results that demon-strate the benets of our approach. Our combination of automated tools and interactive control by the designer results in quickly gener-ated RTL designs with better performance than fully-automatic results, comparable to fully manually optimized designs. 1...|$|R
5000|$|At the train's inauguration Taptuka, a Hopi chief led the ceremony. The train used {{a mix of}} old and new {{lightweight}} cars, including full-length dome cars (called [...] "Big Domes") {{built by}} the Budd Company. There were improved reclining chairs in the coaches, [...] "classic and popular music...on individual, <b>push-button</b> <b>type</b> receivers," [...] and bar service on the upper level of the dome car via a dumb waiter.The San Francisco Chief was one of few Santa Fe trains to survive the purge in 1967 - 1968, as dozens of trains were discontinued. The discontinuances were prompted in large part by the cancellation of railway post office contracts in 1967. Another survivor, the Grand Canyon, provided through service to Los Angeles at Barstow, California. Amtrak chose the route of California Zephyr for Chicago - San Francisco service, and the San Francisco Chief made its last run on April 30, 1971.|$|R
50|$|The Six's {{thermometer}} {{is known}} for separations in the mercury column, in particular after shipment, though accidental knocks have been known causes as well.Separations can usually be corrected by swinging the thermometer as is done to reset a mercury clinical thermometer; the centrifugal force forces the mercury together again.Should a marker become partly buried in the mercury, it can either be pulled up again with the magnet or exposed to an extreme temperature that leaves the marker uncovered. If a strong external magnet is used to pull up the markers in the <b>push-button</b> <b>type</b> with the magnetic plate in place, {{there is a risk}} of damaging the weak magnet behind the scale, or magnetising the steel in the markers either weakening or enhancing the pulling force against the capillary tube on {{all or part of the}} scale so that the thermometer no longer works properly.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Much {{effort in}} {{register}} transfer level (RTL) design {{has been devoted}} to developing “push-button ” types of tools. However, given the highly complex nature, and lack of control on RTL design, <b>push-button</b> <b>type</b> synthesis is not accepted by many designers. Interactive design with assistance of algorithms and tools can be more effective if it provides control to the steps of synthesis. In this paper, we propose an interactive RTL design environment which enables designers to control the design steps and to integrate hardware components into a system. Our design environment is targeting a generic RTL processor architecture and supporting pipelining, multicycling, and chaining. Tasks in the RTL design process include clock definition, component allocation, scheduling, binding, and validation. In our interactive environment, the user can control the design process at every stage, observe the effects of design decisions, and manually override synthesis decisions at will. We present a set of experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of our approach. Our combination of automated tools and interactive control by the designer results in quickly generated RTL designs with better performance than fully-automatic results, comparable to fully manually optimized designs.
