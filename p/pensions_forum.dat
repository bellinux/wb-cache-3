5000|$|World <b>Pensions</b> <b>Forum</b> {{director}} M. Nicolas Firzi {{has argued}} that the Brexit debate should be viewed within the broader context of economic analysis of EU law and regulation in relation to English common law, arguing: [...] "Every year, the British Parliament is forced to pass tens of new statutes reflecting the latest EU directives coming from Brussels - a highly undemocratic process known as 'transposition'... Slowly but surely, these new laws dictated by EU commissars are conquering English common law, imposing upon UK businesses and citizens an ever-growing collection of fastidious regulations in every field".|$|E

If we continue to hold major energy companies that don’t have an answer to a basic financial test, we are just gambling. We have to take a fiduciary responsibility - these are not good bets." ...|$|E

In the same year, {{chairman}} Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children {{and all sorts of}} other things", remarks for which he later apologised. By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called [...] "pariah status". Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority <b>Pension</b> Fund <b>Forum</b> (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.|$|R
