A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19kHz <b>pilot</b> <b>tone</b> on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.|$|E

For this reason, in this article we propose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize placement and power of the comb-type <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> that are used for least square (LS) channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems. To optimize the <b>pilot</b> <b>tones,</b> upper bound of MSE is used as the objective function of PSO. The effects of Doppler shifts on designing <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> are also investigated.

40|$|A novel {{frequency}} domain training sequence {{and the corresponding}} carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator are proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over frequency-selective fading channels. The proposed {{frequency domain}} training sequence comprises two types of <b>pilot</b> <b>tones,</b> namely distinctively spaced <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> with high energies and uniformly spaced ones with low energies. Based on the distinctively spaced <b>pilot</b> <b>tones,</b> integer CFO estimation is accomplished. After the subcarriers occupied by the distinctively spaced <b>pilot</b> <b>tones</b> and their adjacent subcarriers are nulled {{for the sake of}} interference cancellation, fractional CFO estimation is executed according to the uniformly spaced <b>pilot</b> <b>tones.</b> By exploiting a predefined lookup table making the best {{of the structure of the}} distinctively spaced <b>pilot</b> <b>tones,</b> computational complexity of the proposed CFO estimator can be decreased considerably.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{wireless}} communications in recent years, the need for high speed data transmission is increased. OFDM is a promising candidate for achieving high data rates in mobile environment due its resistance to ISI, which is a common problem found in high speed data communication. Channel Estimation for wireless OFDM systems requires transmission of <b>pilot</b> <b>tones.</b> The success of channel estimate at a desired BER and Doppler frequency is highly dependent on how the pilot signals are arranged.

50|$|Residual {{high-frequency}} {{components of}} the signal remaining after de-multiplexing can be problematic when recording to analog magnetic media. While the higher frequencies are unlikely to survive filtering in the recording deck, the 19 kHz tone is within the 20 to 20,000 Hz frequency range for many tape formats, including compact cassette, and typically provides an audible beat (difference) tone {{in conjunction with the}} tape head bias signal used when recording. The recording may also be saturated by the <b>pilot</b> <b>tone.</b> More importantly, the <b>pilot</b> <b>tone</b> interferes with the proper functioning of noise reduction systems such as Dolby B, C and S.
