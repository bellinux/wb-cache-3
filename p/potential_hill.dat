The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural-property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal-induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in <b>potential</b> <b>hills</b> (or/and <b>potential</b> wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule.

Measurements of the dc and rf plasma density and potential profiles near the exit of hollow cathodes by miniature fast-scanning probes suggests that turbulent ion acoustic fluctuations and ionization instabilities in the cathode plume significantly increase the energy of the ions that flow from this region. Increases in the discharge current and/or decreases in the cathode gas flow enhance the amplitude of the fluctuations and increase the number and energy of the energetic ions, which increases the erosion rate of the cathode electrodes.

Physical phenomena such as the half-integer quantum Hall effect and high carrier mobility are critically dependent on interactions with impurities/substrates and localization of Dirac fermions in realistic devices.
