5|$|A {{connection}} to the defunct LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch, {{not part of the}} main project, was <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> 1963 and again in 1967, as were branches along other LIRR lines to outer Queens areas without rapid transit service. An alternate to the Southeast Queens line was also <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> 1963 and again in 1967 {{as an extension of the}} IND Fulton Street Line, east from Euclid Avenue under Pitkin Avenue and Linden Boulevard, or east from Lefferts Boulevard under Liberty Avenue. Both options would continue east to Jamaica, then turn south under Merrick Boulevard to Springfield Boulevard. The Rockaway extension and both Fulton Line extensions were previously proposed as part of the 1929 and 1939 IND Second System plans, and were ultimately not incorporated into the main Program For Action plan.|$|E
