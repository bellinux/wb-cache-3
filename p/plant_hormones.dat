5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to inhibit the early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> known as gibberellic acids, and they also inhibit the germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E

40|$|Hormone {{transporters}} {{are crucial}} for <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> action, which is underlined by severe developmental and physiological impacts caused by their loss-of-function mutations. Here, we summarize recent knowledge {{on the individual}} roles of <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> transporters in local and long-distance transport. Our inventory reveals that many hormones are transported by members of distinct transporter classes, with an apparent dominance of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family and of the Nitrate transport 1 /Peptide transporter family (NPF). The current need to explore further hormone transporter regulation, their functional interaction, transport directionalities, and substrate specificities is briefly reviewed...|$|R
25|$|Her {{research}} {{focused on}} <b>plant</b> <b>hormones,</b> seed biology and plant DNA repair. She {{is best known}} for her work on the gas ethylene, in particular for demonstrating that ethylene is a natural plant hormone, and that it is the major regulator of ageing and the shedding of leaves and fruits. She also originated the concept of the target cell as a model for understanding plant hormone action.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>hormones</b> are {{chemicals}} that {{in small amounts}} promote and influence the growth, development and differentiation of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to seed development, dormancy, and germination. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf abscission and even plant death.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{specific}} tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs {{in the absence of}} cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, auxins and other <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.|$|E
50|$|Strain VK of Bacillus safensis is a salt-tolerant microbe, and {{can grow}} beyond the 0-10% salt range {{for the general}} {{microbial}} species. This strain can grow in 14% NaCl, with a pH ranging from 4 to 8. Strain VK also contains genes that encode for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase enzyme. This enzyme is able to generate 2-oxobutanoate and ammonia (NH3) by cleaving the precursor of <b>plant</b> <b>hormone,</b> ethylene 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate. This enables the plant to tolerate salt, heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Because of these features, Bacillus safensis VK is a powerful <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> producer.|$|R
50|$|In <b>plants,</b> the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> Jasmonate allows binding between SCF-COI1 to the JAZ {{transcription}} factor. Degradation of the JAZ {{transcription factor}} {{allows for the}} transcription of the jasmonate responsive genes.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{involved}} in modulating senescence of organs in plants and are therefore considered as a <b>plant</b> <b>hormone.</b> In addition, they are directly involved in regulation of programmed cell death ...|$|R
25|$|Cytokinins or CKs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that influence cell division and shoot formation. They were called kinins {{in the past when}} the first cytokinins were isolated from yeast cells. They also help delay senescence of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. Cytokinins and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of <b>plant</b> <b>hormones</b> affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.|$|E
25|$|Some live {{seeds are}} dormant and need more time, and/or {{need to be}} {{subjected}} to specific environmental conditions before they will germinate. Seed dormancy can originate {{in different parts of the}} seed, for example, within the embryo; in other cases the seed coat is involved. Dormancy breaking often involves changes in membranes, initiated by dormancy-breaking signals. This generally occurs only within hydrated seeds. Factors affecting seed dormancy include the presence of certain <b>plant</b> <b>hormones,</b> notably abscisic acid, which inhibits germination, and gibberellin, which ends seed dormancy. In brewing, barley seeds are treated with gibberellin to ensure uniform seed germination for the production of barley malt.|$|E
25|$|The (dynamic and {{environment}} responsive) pattern of auxin distribution within {{the plant is}} a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers). It is achieved through very complex and well coordinated active transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body — by the so-called polar auxin transport. Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other <b>plant</b> <b>hormones.</b> For example, the ratio of auxin to cytokinin in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.|$|E
50|$|Recently, a Bradyrhizobium strain was {{discovered}} to form nodules in Aeschynomene without producing nod factors, suggesting {{the existence of}} alternative communication signals other than nod factors, possibly involving the secretion of the <b>plant</b> <b>hormone</b> cytokinin.|$|R
