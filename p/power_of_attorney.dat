The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and acreage to allow private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands.

From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on Passions. Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad {{in the middle of a}} tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the Vendetta plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz.

Government statistics project that by 2041, almost {{one in three}} in Hong Kong’s population will be aged 65 or above. Combined {{with one of the}} lowest birth rates and also highest life expectancy in the world (in fact, the highest for women), the need for a comprehensive legal framework to enable the elderly to make financial planning for the vicissitudes of life has become imminent. For the general population, simple and affordable legal instruments such as the enduring <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> are particularly useful. Yet, the Enduring <b>Powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Attorney</b> Ordinance is based primarily on an English statute of 1985, which itself has been revamped a decade ago in 2005. In light of these concerns, the present paper will, first, examine inexpensive financial management services that are currently used by the elderly in Hong Kong; second, focus on the enduring <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorney</b> with a view to identifying legal and practical impediments to their widespread use; and third, propose ways to reinvigorate the enduring <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attorneys</b> and align them with cultural practices in Hong Kong...|$|R
