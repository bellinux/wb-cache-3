40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. In January 2004, a consortium {{of public and private}} sector organisations commissioned Warwick Business School to carry out the United Kingdom Survey of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises' (SME) Finances, 2004. This was the first representative survey of SMEs to offer a close analysis of businesses with fewer than 250 employees, their main owners and their access to external finance. A second survey was conducted in 2008, where business owners were interviewed by telephone about the finances they have used or applied for in the last three years, their financial relationships, the characteristics of the business and personal details. In 2007, another consortium of UK public sector bodies, small business representative organisations and finance providers agreed to sponsor a similar survey to the 2004 survey, conducted by the Centre for Business Research based at the University of Cambridge. This study is held at the UKDA under SN 6049, with the title United Kingdom Survey of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises' Finances, 2007. It aimed to compile another benchmark and to identify any changes or trends that had emerged since 2004, but made a number of changes to the 2004 questionnaire, so {{that it is not a}} direct member of the UKSMEF series, but stands alongside it as a separate cross-sectional survey. The UKSMEF 2008 survey was conducted by the same Principal Investigator as the 2004 survey, based at Warwick Business School, and the 2008 report provides direct comparison between the 2004 and 2008 surveys. The aims of the 2004 study were to provide benchmarking data on the availability of credit to SMEs, collect information on the relationship between SMEs and their <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> and to develop a general-purpose micro database for quantitative research on business finances (offering, for example, scope for comparison with United States business finance). Main Topics : Topics covered in the survey included personal characteristics of the owner/manager, firm demographics, <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> relationship with main bank, use of grant finance, commercial loans, assets and asset-based finance, credit cards and equity finance, use of business advice, main business problems and financial qualifications, income and balance sheet information.

40|$|For the {{rational}} entrepreneur, {{the investment in}} the creation of a business plan should lead to some economic advantage in terms of measurable business value. Conversely, the absence of a business plan should lead to poor performance of the young enterprise. Given the ubiquity of business plans, the de facto accepted hypothesis holds that among a sample of entrepreneurs, those with business plans should outperform (e. g. survival, profit, sales, growth etc.) those without. In this study, a systematic 10 -year literature review was conducted to assess the state of the empirical body of knowledge with regard to the entrepreneur's business plan. This review finds that empirical attempts to confirm the assumed relational causality in the direction from business planning to new venture performance have yielded findings that are mixed, contradictory, and inconclusive. In the absence of clear evidence to support arguments of economic rationale, researchers have argued the importance of testing alternative rationale to explain the ubiquity of the business plan. In this study, the theory of institutionalisation was tested as an alternative to economic rationale in predicting the likelihood of an entrepreneur developing a formal business plan. The specific setting for the research was South African information technology start-ups. A questionnaire was developed deriving constructs from prior studies in the domain. Entrepreneurs were approached directly, as well as through organisational stakeholders in the South African technology entrepreneurship environment. Respondents completed an online questionnaire, yielding a final sample of 80 valid responses. The profile of respondents was found to be generally consistent with other probabilistically-sampled studies in the population. Corresponding with the three institutional pressures, three hypotheses were tested. Support was found for coercive pressure originating from <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> The study did not find support for the hypothesised mimetic behaviour among technology entrepreneurs (mimetic force), nor for the normative force hypothesised as resulting from a tertiary-level business education. Statistical regression analysis suggested that a range of wider factors appears to be influencing the South African technology entrepreneur's decision to write a business plan. This findings of this research offer practical implications for entrepreneurs, educators, <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> and entrepreneurship researchers...|$|E

40|$|As {{shown in}} the {{international}} business literature, the ability of controlling owners to extract private benefits is greater in countries with weaker legal institutions. In these countries, providing credible financial information could play an especially important role in reducing information asymmetry between private firms and external <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> For our sample of firms across 68 countries, we find that firms with greater financial reporting credibility (i. e., annual financial statements reviewed by an external auditor) experience significantly lower perceived problems in gaining access to external finance.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{literature suggests that}} the specialization patterns of venture capital (VC) funds and their finance providers is an interesting aspect of the venture investment process. It is often asserted that the specialization patterns regarding their investments differ considerably according to their preferred stage of enterprises, development or industry sector indicating the heterogeneity {{in the way they}} are organized. However, there is little empirical research on the identification of the specific investments choices of VC firms and on the relation between their investment activities and their sources of finance. VC investors form their specialized investments by placing constraints on their investment activities in order to control for the information uncertainty and manage the risks factors involved in the companies. These constraints include the specialization in the funding of specific industries or stages of the enterprisesÃ¢Â�Â� development not only regarding favourable expected returns but also according to their different degrees of risk aversion, the organizational structure and their strategic goals. The current dissertation is aimed at exploring the investment strategies of the different types of VC firms prior to the investment and how the preferences of sources of funds are related with the activities of the VC firms they finance. For the empirical analysis of this study, a sample of sixteen western European countries is used during the period 1987 - 2004. The results show that investors such as captives who could accept lower returns while they pursue a wider set of goals invest in less risky VC activities. Independent VC firms are induced by the need to enhance their reputation through their good performance and thus, focus their investments in later stage activities where the portfolio firms are closer into getting public. VC firms that are financed by fund providers with high liquidity needs such as banks are more likely to invest in later stage ventures with lower risk while when they are financed by investors with modest liquidity risks such as pension funds invest in early stage ventures. Finally VC firms backed by investors with strategic goals regarding the development of their ideas in the market such as academic institutions, invest in high technology industries. The determinants of VC finance have important implications for <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> VC firms, policymakers and academics. A better understanding of the investment strategies of VC investors will provide researchers an insight into how funds are allocated across industries, entrepreneurs with an insight into the availability of VC and potential sources of funding, <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> with the knowledge of how VC firms allocate their funds and VC firms with a greater understanding of their industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{description of the}} financial environment for households and small businesses in a defined geographical region. It develops a new, functional approach to financial access surveys, which involves asking detailed questions about how respondents meet their financial needs—from purchasing inventory to paying for large, medical expenses—rather than focus on a narrow set of financial products. This approach identifies innovative financial tools which arise in response to their needs that traditional surveys miss, and is a scalable complement to financial diaries and other more detailed approaches. From here, we survey the <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> ranging from large state and private banks, to moneylenders, shopkeepers and other households, {{with the aim of}} developing the first comprehensive approach to mapping an area’s financial landscape.

40|$|Using {{detailed}} hand-collected data on {{the backgrounds}} of board members of S&P companies we show that venture capitalists (VCs) {{play an important role}} in mature public firms long after their initial public offering (IPO). Almost one-third of mature public companies have at least one VC on their board. Their presence is not limited to mature companies that were VC-backed at the time of their IPO – over one-third of mature firms with VC directors were not VC-backed at the time of their IPO. Using an instrumental variables approach, we show that the presence of VCs has a substantial effect on the investment policies of mature firms. VCs have a significant positive effect on the research and development (R&D) intensity and on the innovation output of mature public firms. In addition, VC directors are positively related to the acquisition of VC-backed entrepreneurial firms, firm investment in corporate venture capital (CVC) and on the frequency of joint ventures and strategic alliances with other VC-backed firms. Thus, in addition to their function as <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> monitoring and advice for small private firms, VCs play a significant role in mature public firms by promoting innovation activity and facilitating deals between these firms and other VC-backed entrepreneurial start-ups. Overall, our evidence illustrates a much broader role for VCs than has been established in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{shareholder}} value {{has been a}} major change in Western economies since the 1980 s. This growth has reignited debates concerning relations between investors and managers. The book argues that investors are more than passive <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> on whose behalf managers seek to maximize shareholder returns. Instead, many investors directly influence management practice, through investor engagement. The book examines the role of institutional investors and private equity firms, two types of investors with overlapping but different reasons for engagement. Questions addressed include: What are the incentives, and disincentives, for investment engagement? How is investor engagement organized? What areas of management practice are of particular concern to investors? The discussion shows in detail how private equity firms {{play a major role in}} developing new companies, beyond the provision of finance, especially in the IT, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical sectors. The discussion is primarily based on British and US research. The debate has wider international relevance, because there are strong pressures for establishing shareholder value as the international 'norm' for systems of corporate governance. Following a detailed discussion of Germany, the authors conclude that there is no inevitable trend to shareholder value: shareholder value depends upon complementary institutional arrangements in national business systems, which are far from universal. The book concludes with a critical analysis of the justifications for shareholder value and investor engagement, highlighting the weaknesses of both efficiency and equity justifications...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSOver {{the course}} of the 20 th century, {{corporate}} social and environmental reporting (CSR), also referred to as sustainability reporting, has increased dramatically in its extent and importance. The research study documents the relative importance of aspects of corporate social and environmental reporting to stakeholders. It also documents the views that various stakeholder groups hold regarding the effectiveness of reporting. These views were obtained by following a process of focused interviews with senior executives and managers of organisations representing eight different stakeholder groups. The main findings that emerged reveal that stakeholders such as shareholders, financial analysts and <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> attach a high level of importance to the economic performance of companies. However, they indicated that they have a very limited interest in the social and environmental performance of companies and make very little use of the information contained in CSR. Employees, customers, communities, NGOs and regulators have a high interest in the social and environmental performance and reporting, although they realise that sound economic performance is essential for the continuing existence of companies. All stakeholder groups indicated that engagement by companies regarding CSR is very limited {{and that there is a}} perception amongst stakeholders that reporting is positively biased. CSR in South Africa is not meeting the requirements of many stakeholder groups. A structured process of proactive engagement with stakeholders is required to improve the relevance of CSR. Such a process of engagement could, over time, revise the perception that CSR is not an accurate reflection of company performance...|$|E

40|$|Before the Global Financial Crisis many <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> had growth {{mandates}} {{and actively}} pursued development finance deals {{as a way}} of gaining higher returns on funds with regular capital turnover and re-investment possible. This was able to be achieved through high gearing and low presales in a strong market. As asset prices fell, loan covenants breached and memories of the 1990 ’s returned, banks rapidly adjusted their risk appetite via retraction of gearing and expansion of presale requirements. Early signs of loosening in bank credit policy are emerging, however parties seeking development finance are faced with a severely reduced number of institutions from which to source funding. The few institutions that are lending are filtering out only the best credit risks by way of constrictive credit conditions including: low loan to value ratios, the corresponding requirement to contribute high levels of equity, lack of support in non-prime locations and the requirement for only borrowers with well established track records. In this risk averse and capital constrained environment, the ability of developers to proceed with real estate developments is still being constrained by their inability to obtain project finance. This paper will examine the pre and post GFC development finance environment. It will identify the key lending criteria relevant to real estate development finance and will detail the related changes to credit policies over this period. The associated impact to real estate development projects will be presented, highlighting the significant constraint to supply that the inability to obtain finance poses...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing debate on the {{changing}} geographical organization of the financial sector and the decreasing importance of regional financial centres. Our contribution explores a fresh perspective on this issue by looking at knowledge and risk management {{in different parts of}} the financial sector with an empirical focus on private equity in Germany. The argument we put forward is that the ways in which <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> manage knowledge and risk shape their organizational and geographical structure. In our analytical framework we distinguish between three ideal-type modes of knowledge management: the relationship, the data and the network mode. These modes differ in the types of knowledge exchanged, the actors involved and in the role and nature of relevant contacts and relationships. The shift from relationship to data mode in credit provision in Germany serves an example of how a new mode of knowledge management is associated with changes in the geographical organization of financial actors and activities. To illustrate the network mode we then focus on knowledge management in private equity in Germany, which involves a variety of different actors and links both regional and interregional networks. Our empirical research shows that the resulting organizational and geographical struc¬tures are rather complex and have nodes in regional financial centres. While these centres benefit from private equity activities, their chances for re-vitalization and a re-regionalization of financial expertise on the basis of private equity are nonetheless limited. So far, Munich seems to be the (only) one location where private equity – cross-fertilized by other local financial actors – has initiated a self-supported development which strengthens Munich as a financial centre...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine and explain the complex interrelationships which {{influence}} the ability of firms to create value for their <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> and other stakeholders (loosely referred to in practice as ‘integrated thinking’). In doing so it examines the inter-relationships between: Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk; delivering on corporate strategy; non-financial corporate reporting; and, board oversight. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted with Board Chairs and Non-Executive Directors of large listed companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) (where Boards are required to have a Social and Ethics sub-committee and approve integrated reports which have been mandatory since 2010) and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) (where Board directors’ liability legislation results in Boards being reluctant to adopt integrated reporting which is voluntary). Findings: The research finds that contemporary reporting processes, and in particular those set out in the King III Code and the International Integrated Reporting Framework, influence cognitive frames enhancing Board oversight and assisting organisations in managing complexity. This results in increased awareness of the impact of environmental and social issues and governance processes together with a broader view of value creation despite investor disinterest. Research implications: A number of avenues of research are suggested to further examine the interrelationships identified. Practical implications: The research assists the development of practice and policy by articulating and enhancing our understanding of linkages, which loosely fall under the vague practitioner term ‘integrated thinking’. Social implications: The conceptualisation can inform national and global discussions on the appropriateness of corporate reporting and governance models to achieve sustainable development. Originality/value: The paper conceptualises emerging and complex interrelationships. The cross country comparison allows an assessment of the extent to which different national social contexts with differing governance and reporting frameworks lead to different perspectives on, and approaches to, value creation...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is about financing practices of Pakistani-immigrant and indigenous-owned small travel agents. The study provides {{an understanding of}} the capital structures of businesses owned by both groups and compares these to draw similarities and differences between both groups. The research integrates the "ethnic enclave" immigrant theory, the capital structure theory in particular the Pecking Order Hypothesis, the role of "networks" in business financing, and the business life-cycle theories. The research question and the research hypotheses emerged from the literature reviewed. Ten case studies, five Pakistani businesses and five indigenous businesses, confirmed the hypotheses which formed the basis of a survey of a large sample of sixty businesses, thirty in each group. The case study data is considered invaluable since it provided the real evidence of the sensitive nature of financial information in these businesses. The methodology adopted was a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The findings of the study show that there are more similarities than differences among the capital structures of both groups of businesses. The nuclear family plays a crucial role throughout the life-cycle of the business in both groups. The role of family labour is not as prominent as among other industries such as Confectionery, Tobacconists, and Newsagents (CTN's). Informal sources of finance are preferred over formal sources by both groups of businesses due to their availability and lower cost. The Pecking Order Hypothesis theory applies to both groups of businesses. The main sources of formal finance were high street banks, bank overdrafts and loans. Pakistani businesses were not disadvantaged in any way by the formal <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> This {{research is}} the first to report on the comparative capital structures among both groups of businesses.

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{the gaps in}} the literature on foreign aid, and tries to fill some of them focusing particularly on Niger, a country that has received aid since its independence in 1960, yet remains one of the world's poorest. The work contributes to the literature in three ways: First, it addresses moral hazard: the relationship between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the country is analysed through a historical case study. Niger's requests for assistance are accompanied by promises to undertake reforms; however, once aid is disbursed, these undertakings rarely materialize. Despite this record of poor (and deteriorating) compliance, IMF aid continues to flow, engendering perverse incentives and moral hazard. Secondly, it analyses whether aid is associated with poverty reduction. Aid is correlated with poverty, which is to be expected due to its pro-poor targeting nature. However, this study found increases in poverty associated with communities which were recipients of aid. To shed more light on this, households receiving aid were compared with those receiving no project assistance at all, and with households who benefited from non-aid based development projects. The results showed that changes in poverty levels among aid recipient households were not statistically different to those among households receiving no assistance. However, households benefiting from aid under-performed those who benefited from other projects. Thirdly, it explores whether aid brings utility to households through the provision of public goods. The results suggest that aid projects do help households. However, other sources of development projects are more efficient at doing so. Information is the key: it is a vital prerequisite for projects {{to address the needs of}} the population, and not all donors have the same information. Information can be obtained through co-funding projects with other donors, although there are also coordination costs. The models estimated allow the prediction of the benefits a project could provide to a household. Such predictive abilities could allow policymakers to coordinate donors' initiatives to maximize their effectiveness. However, at present Niger lacks the capacity to achieve such coordination. Furthermore, such an approach would involve having to reduce the least efficient donors to mere <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> (i. e. channel their resources through other donor types), a role they might not be willing to accept...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to investigate, theoretically and empirically, whether financial development (bank development and stock market development) {{has led to}} economic growth in Bangladesh, and it explores the important factors behind {{the evolution of the}} financial system itself. The literature survey in Chapter 2 argues that finance enhances growth while banks and stock markets are complementary in development; however the application to low-income countries is unclear. After reviewing financial sector policy and institutional background in Bangladesh in Chapter 3, a combination of various theoretical insights into one structural framework is proposed in Chapter 4. Our empirical findings for Bangladesh in Model l using the ARDL cointegration method are as follows. Both banks (quasi-money/GDP) and the stock market (number oflisted companies) have enhanced physical capital accumulation from 1980 to 2005. Using the same cointegration technique, growth in GDP per capita is found to lead to growth in banks (private-credit/GDP ratio). And there is a cointegrating relationship between banks and the stock market which indicates that debt and equity are complementary. The main message from Chapter 6 is that the finance-growth nexus can be shown to operate in the case of Bangladesh where banks are the main <b>providers</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> The key policy implication of Model l is that overall financial development (banks and stock markets) can lead to economic growth, while feedback effects promote further financial activity. We then identify and assess relationships that operate within the stock market itself. Model 2 A begins the analysis of the stock market infrastructure by relating the number of listed shares to the value of traded shares or turnover (market liquidity). Empirical results in Chapter 7 for Bangladesh using the ARDL approach show support for cointegration from 1990 Ql to 2005 Q 4. Model 2 B then investigates the relationship between trading activity and price volatility on the stock exchange. Using a GARCH framework and Granger Causality tests, empirical results in Chapter 8 indicate that trading volume and particularly trading value carry predictive power for price volatility with daily data from 1995 to 2007. The overall conclusion in Chapter 9 is that to understand the finance-growth nexus in Bangladesh it is necessary to appreciate the essential role played by banks as well as the forces behind the stock market. The encompassing framework presented here along with its reinforcing and constrained features points to a growth-promoting and sustainable fmancial structure for central bank regulators to target.
