5|$|In Western Europe, after Theophrastus, botany {{passed through}} a bleak period of 1800 years when little {{progress}} was made and, indeed, many of the early insights were lost. As Europe entered the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries), a period of disorganised feudalism and indifference to learning, China, India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age.

The Chinese dictionary-encyclopaedia Erh Ya probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs, each with a common name and illustration. Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>botany</b> were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court. These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses — and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants.

40|$|The {{authors have}} taken the Italian city of Ferrara {{as an example of}} the {{remedies}} against syphilis, commonly used worldwide in the 1800 s. After having identified the terminologies used to diagnose syphilis, they evidence the legislative behaviours of the government authorities in 19 th century in Italy and, in particular, the social and sanitary measures taken in Ferrara to limit the spread of the syphilis epidemic. Historical sources permitted description of the remedies employed in Ferrara from the beginning to the end of that century, not only to treat conditions linked directly to the malady itself, but also its complications and secondary pathologies. The pharmacopoeia written for the apothecaries of Ferrara by Antonio Campana, a famous professor of <b>Pharmaceutical</b> Chemistry and <b>Botany,</b> won a great reputation and distribution in the international medical world not only of the first half of the 1800 s.

40|$|The present work is {{a review}} of the {{remedies}} in use in Ferrara against tuberculosis in the 1800 s. The work started from the discovery of accounts describing methods and remedies. These remedies were also in use world wide. Of particular interest is the work by Antonio Campana, a famous professor of <b>Pharmaceutical</b> Chemistry and <b>Botany</b> in Ferrara, who wrote a pharmacopoeia which had several editions from 1797 until 1841. The Farmacopea Ferrarese was addressed to the apothecaries of Ferrara. Nevertheless, due to its great reputation it had an international distribution. It provided us with an exhaustive view about the medical field in Ferrara in the early 1800 s. The remedies adopted in the city {{in the second half of}} the century were in line with those present abroad. The work was also supported by the discovery of statistical accounts of the Sant’Anna hospital from 1871.
