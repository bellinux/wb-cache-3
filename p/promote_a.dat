5|$|Between its closing as a rail {{bridge and}} its reopening as a {{pedestrian}} span, the bridge has seen occasional fires; {{two in the}} 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008.

50|$|In grammar, a circumstantial voice, or circumstantial passive voice, is <b>a</b> {{voice that}} <b>promotes</b> <b>an</b> oblique {{argument}} of a verb {{to the role}} of subject; the underlying subject may then be expressed as an oblique argument. A given language may have several circumstantial voices, each <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> different oblique argument. One very common circumstantial voice is the ordinary passive voice, which <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> patient to the subject position.|$|R

Hoffmann had previously published a number of conventional directmate Babsons, {{but this one is}} significant as it is the first cyclic Babson: rather than black promotions being matched by White, they are related in cyclic form: Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> queen means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> bishop, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> bishop means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> rook, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> rook means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> knight, and Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> knight means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> queen.|$|R

5|$|Organized into {{separate}} departments, {{each with its}} own chief reviewer, the Analytical Review focused on politics, philosophy, natural history, and literature. To <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> disinterested air, its reviewers were anonymous, signing their work with pseudonymous initials.

With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E

The Open Fuel Standard Act (OFS), introduced to Congress in May 2011, is intended to <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> massive adoption of flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on ethanol or methanol. The bill requires that 50 percent of automobiles made in 2014, 80 percent in 2016, and 95 percent in 2017, would be manufactured and warranted to operate on non-petroleum-based fuels, which includes existing technologies such as flex-fuel, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, plug-in electric and fuel cell.|$|E

25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its <b>promoted</b> rank. <b>Promoting</b> <b>a</b> piece {{has the effect of}} changing how that piece moves.

(Which can be a reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by <b>promoting</b> <b>a</b> gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|R
