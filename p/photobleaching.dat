We concluded that chromosomes move poleward along kinetochore fiber microtubules that remain stationary {{with respect to}} the pole while depolymerizing at the kinetochore. In those experiments, bleached zones in anaphase spindles showed some recovery of fluorescence with time. We wished to determine the nature of this recovery. Was it due to turnover of kinetochore fiber microtubules or of nonkinetochore microtubules or both? We also wished to investigate the question of turnover of kinetochore microtubules in metaphase.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} method allowing to quantify slip {{at the wall}} in viscous polymer fluids, based on the observation of the evolution under simple shear flow of a <b>photobleached</b> pattern within a fluorescent labeled polymer melt. This straightforward method provides access to slip length at top and bottom interfaces in the 1 μm to 1 mm range and to the actual shear rate experienced by the fluid. Based on simple optical imaging and image analysis techniques, this method affords an improvement compared to previously reported methods in which the <b>photobleached</b> fluorescence intensity profiles before and after shear were compared and measured by scanning a photomultiplier. The present method relies on a direct determination of the displacement profile inside the polymer fluid from {{an analysis of the}} 3 D evolution of the whole <b>photobleached</b> pattern. We demonstrate the potential of this method with measurements of the slip length for an entangled PDMS melt, {{as a function of the}} shear rate, in contact with several weakly surfaces i. e. end-tethered PDMS or polystyrene (PS) chains, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of trimethoxy(octadecyl) silane (OTS), and a glassy PS thin-film.

25|$|The cell {{achieves}} {{its height}} {{in the water}} column by synthesising gas vesicles. As the cell rises up, it is able to increase its carbohydrate load through increased photosynthesis. Too high and the cell will suffer <b>photobleaching</b> and possible death, however, the carbohydrate produced during photosynthesis increases the cell's density, causing it to sink. The daily cycle of carbohydrate build-up from photosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism during dark hours is enough to fine-tune the cell's position {{in the water column}}, bring it up toward the surface when its carbohydrate levels are low and it needs to photosynthesis, and allowing it to sink away from the harmful UV radiation when the cell's carbohydrate levels have been replenished. An extreme excess of carbohydrate causes a significant change in the internal pressure of the cell, which causes the gas vesicles to buckle and collapse and the cell to sink out.|$|E

2500|$|In FRAP, {{a region}} is briefly exposed to intense light, irrecoverably <b>photobleaching</b> fluorophores, and the {{fluorescence}} recovery due to diffusion of nearby (non-bleached) fluorophores is imaged. [...] A primary advantage of FRAP over FCS is {{the ease of}} interpreting qualitative experiments common in cell biology. [...] Differences between cell lines, or regions of a cell, or before and after application of drug, can often be characterized by simple inspection of movies. FCS experiments require a level of processing and are more sensitive to potentially confounding influences like: rotational diffusion, vibrations, <b>photobleaching,</b> dependence on illumination and fluorescence color, inadequate statistics, etc. [...] It {{is much easier to}} change the measurement volume in FRAP, which allows greater control. In practice, the volumes are typically larger than in FCS. [...] While FRAP experiments are typically more qualitative, some researchers are studying FRAP quantitatively and including binding dynamics. [...] A disadvantage of FRAP in cell biology is the free radical perturbation of the cell caused by the <b>photobleaching.</b> [...] It is also less versatile, as it cannot measure concentration or rotational diffusion, or co-localization. [...] FRAP requires a significantly higher concentration of fluorophores than FCS.|$|E

We compared the spectrum of five different lamp candidates for indoor “daylight PDT” and investigated their ability to <b>photobleach</b> protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Furthermore, we measured the amount of PpIX activating daylight available in a glass greenhouse, which can be an alternative when it is uncomfortable for patients to be outdoors. The lamps investigated were: halogen lamps (overhead and slide projector), white light-emitting diode (LED) lamp, red LED panel and lamps used for conventional PDT. Four of the five light sources were able to <b>photobleach</b> PpIX completely. For halogen light and the red LED lamp, 5000 lux could <b>photobleach</b> PpIX whereas 12, 000 lux were needed for the white LED lamp. Furthermore, the greenhouse was suitable for daylight PDT since the effect of solar light is lowered only by 25 %.

40|$|Restricted Access. We {{have studied}} the {{spreading}} and retraction dynamics of a dye doped smectic multilayer domain in the collapsed state of a Langmuir monolayer at the air–water interface. We find that the domain undergoes shearing when excited with an appropriate wavelength in the epifluorescence setting of the microscope. The shearing leads to displacement of the stack of layers and results in asymmetric spreading of the domain. Eventually, due to line tension, the domain transforms into a circular shape. Here, the domain area was about twice that of the initial area. Under reflection setting of the microscope, with white light, we observe that the domain retracts to a smaller area. During the course of retraction, we find successive generation and evolution of edge dislocation loops leading to thickening of the domain. Our analysis on the variation of the normalized area of the domain with time yields different characteristic time constants for spreading and retraction. The spreading and retraction of the domain can be understood by invoking changes in interfacial tension due to <b>photobleached</b> surface active products and the depletion of <b>photobleached</b> products, respectively...|$|R

50|$|FLIP {{is often}} used and is closely {{associated}} with Fluorescence recovery after <b>photobleaching</b> (FRAP). The major {{difference between these two}} microscopy techniques is that FRAP involves the study of a cell’s ability to recover after a single <b>photobleaching</b> event whereas FLIP involves the study of how the loss of fluorescence spreads throughout the cell after multiple <b>photobleaching</b> events. This difference in purpose also leads to a difference in what parts of the cell are observed. In FRAP, the area that is actually photobleached is the area of interest. Conversely, in FLIP, the region of interest is just outside the region that is being photobleached. Another important difference is that in FRAP, there is a single <b>photobleaching</b> event and a recovery period to observe how well fluorophores move back to the bleached site. However, in FLIP, multiple <b>photobleaching</b> events occur to prevent the return of unbleached fluorophores to the bleaching region. Like FLIP, FRAP is used in the study of continuity of membranous organelles. FLIP and FRAP are often used together to determine the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins. FLIP {{can also be used to}} measure the molecular transfer between regions of a cell regardless of the rate of movement. This allows for a more comprehensive analysis of protein trafficking within a cell. This differs from FRAP which is primarily useful for determining mobility of proteins in regions local to the <b>photobleaching</b> only.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Previous {{observations}} {{indicated that the}} lamellipodium ("leading edge") of fibroblasts contains a dense meshwork, as well as numerous bundles (microspikes) of actin filaments. Most, if not all, of the filaments have a uniform polarity, with the "barbed " end associated with the membrane. I investigated whether and how actin subunits exchange in this region by microinjecting living gerbil fibroma cells (IMR- 33) with actin that had been labeled with iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine. After incorporation of the labeled actin into the lamellipodium, I used a laser microbeam to <b>photobleach</b> a 3 - 4 -~,m region at and surrounding a microspike, without disrupting {{the integrity of the}} structure. I then recorded the pattern of fluorescence recovery and analyzed it using a combination of TV image intensification and digital image processing techniques. Fluorescence recovery was first detected {{near the edge of the}} cell and then moved toward the cell's center at a constant rate of 0. 79 + 0. 31 ~m/min. When only part of the lamellipodium near the edge of the cell was <b>photobleached,</b> the bleached spot also moved toward the cell's center and through an area unbleached by the laser beam. These results indicated that steady state incorporation of actin subunits occurred predominantly at the membrane-associated end of actin filaments, and tha...|$|R

Transgenic tobacco seedlings with promoter fusions from genes for thylakoid membrane proteins exhibit a similar expression behavior: a CAB-[beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion is not expressed in herbicide-treated seedlings, whereas PC-, FNR-, PSAF-, and ATPC-promoter fusions are expressed, although at reduced levels. All identified segments in nuclear promoters analyzed that {{have been shown to}} respond to light also respond to photodamage to the plastids. Thus, the regulatory signal pathways either merge prior to gene regulation or interact with closely neighboring cis elements. These results indicate that plastids control nuclear gene expression via different and gene-specific cis-regulatory elements and that CAB gene expression is different from the expression of the other genes tested.

40|$|Terrestrially derived {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} (DOM) impacts the optical properties of coastal seawater and affects carbon cycling on a global scale. We studied sequential long-term photochemical and biological degradation of estuarine {{dissolved organic matter}} from the Satilla River, an estuary in the southeastern United States that is dominated by vascular plant-derived organic matter. During photodegradation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss (amounting to 31 % of the initial DOC) was much less extensive than colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) loss (50 % and 56 % of the initial CDOM and FDOM), and analysis of kinetics suggested a reservoir of DOC that was resistant to photodegradation.

5000|$|Before <b>photobleaching</b> can occur, cells must be {{injected}} with a fluorescent protein, often a [...] {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP), which will allow the targeted proteins to fluoresce and therefore be followed throughout the process. Then, a region of interest must be defined. This initial region of interest usually contains the whole cell or several cells. In FLIP, <b>photobleaching</b> occurs just outside the region of interest; therefore a <b>photobleaching</b> region {{also needs to be}} defined. A third region, the region where measurement will take place, needs to be determined as well. A number of initial scans need to be made to determine fluorescence before <b>photobleaching.</b> These scans will serve as the control scans, to which the photobleached scans will be compared later on. <b>Photobleaching</b> can then occur. Between each bleach pulse, it is necessary to allow time for recovery of fluorescent material. It is also important to take several scans of the region of interest immediately after each bleach pulse for further study. The change in fluorescence at the region of interest can then be quantified in one of three ways. The most common is to choose the location, size and number of the regions of interest based on visual inspection of the image sets. The two other, rather new but more reliable approaches are either by detecting areas of different probe mobility on an individual image basis or by physical modeling of fluorescence loss from moving bodies.|$|E
