For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E

2500|$|Society of St. Pius V— In 1983, nine U.S. SSPX priests {{broke with}} or {{were forced to}} leave the SSPX's Northeast USA District partly because they were opposed to Lefebvre's {{instructions}} that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by Pope John XXIII. [...] Those in SSPX circles refer to these priests as [...] "the nine". [...] They began their organization by refusing to complete a transaction of a church that the SSPX was attempting to purchase, {{using one of the}} nine priests as the buyer. [...] The founding priests took the money intended for the purchase of the church and kept the church for themselves. [...] A number of the SSPV's priests and the lay <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> their Masses are openly sedevacantist, a thesis rejected by the SSPX. [...] Other issues occasioning the split were: Lefebvre's order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals; the insistence that all Society Masses be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal; the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of Pope Paul VI.|$|E
