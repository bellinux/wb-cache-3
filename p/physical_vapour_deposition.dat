40|$|High {{temperature}} nanoindentation {{has been}} employed {{to study the}} influence of temperature on mechanical properties of ceramics in Ti 1 -xAlxN system. The temperature had a strong effect on the hardness of the bulk single crystal TiN (TiNbulk), leading to a drop from 21. 4 ± 0. 4 GPa at 22 °C to 13. 7 ± 0. 4 GPa at 350 °C. Plastic deformation of TiNbulk mainly occurred along the (110) crystallographic planes, over the temperature range 22 °C – 350 °C, suggesting that the drop in hardness with the temperature was attributed to a change of ease of plastic slip. Hardness of magnetron sputtered Ti 0. 66 Al 0. 34 N coatings dropped with temperature {{in a similar manner}} to TiNbulk, although from a higher starting value. Approaching the compositional atomic ratio Al : Ti = 1 : 1, maximum hardness was reached and the thermal stability of hardness improved. It was proposed that the high hardness stability with the temperature of magnetron sputtered coatings is linked to the presence of the two crystallographic domains, fcc TiN and stabilized fcc AlN. The small difference between the lattice parameters of these phases seems to be accommodated by distortion of lattices, in order to form coherent boundaries between domains. It has been shown that stabilised fcc AlN formed during deposition and remained in the structure after annealing at 600 °C. Aluminium addition increased the activation energy for slip from 0. 75 eV for TiNbulk to 1. 26 eV for Ti 0. 48 Al 0. 52 N coatings. These values indicate the deformation took place by lattice controlled dislocation glide mechanism. The hardness of industrial cathodic arc Ti 0. 4 Al 0. 6 N films decreased with temperature in a similar way to TiNbulk, although at higher values. High deposition energies promoted fcc AlN alongside fcc TiN, and a change of growing direction from (200) to (111).

In addition, it also needs to display minimal non-specific binding in order to minimize background noise in the detection systems. Furthermore, it needs to be compatible with different detection systems. Immobilising agents include layers of aluminium or gold, hydrophilic polymers, and polyacrylamide gels, or treatment with amines, aldehyde or epoxy.

5000|$|Historically, three [...] "generations" [...] of {{coatings}} {{have been}} developed: diffusion coatings, overlay coatings and thermal barrier coatings. Diffusion coatings, mainly constituted with aluminide or platinum-aluminide, {{is still the}} most common form of surface protection. To further enhance resistance to corrosion and oxidation, MCrAlX-based overlay coatings (M=Ni or Co, X=Y, Hf, Si) are deposited to surface of superalloys. Compared to diffusion coatings, overlay coatings are less dependent on the composition of the substrate, but also more expensive, since they must be carried out by air or vacuum plasma spraying (APS/VPS) or else electron beam <b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> (EB-PVD). Thermal barrier coatings provide by far the best enhancement in working temperature and coating life. It is estimated that modern TBC of thickness 300 μm, if used in conjunction with a hollow component and cooling air, has the potential to lower metal surface temperatures by a few hundred degrees.|$|E

High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS) is the key to very high plasma densities (ionization degree around 0. 5) and thus improved film structures. Current research work also focuses on atmospheric plasma based on dielectric barrier discharges. Such plasma sources are rather simple and can be easily scaled up. Typical applications are cleaning or modification of flat surfaces as well as the treatment of inner surfaces of hollow microparts.

Additionally, the coatings intended for the ILW project were exposed to edge localized mode (ELM) -like thermal loads in the electron beam facility JUDITH.

5000|$|Coating: Coating is {{the process}} step in which a layer is applied on the cavity surface of the optical insert which protects the mould against wear, corrosion, friction, {{sticking}} of glass and chemical reactions with glass. For coating the surface of moulds by <b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> (PVD), metals are evaporated in combination with process-gas-based chemicals. On the tool surface, highly adherent thin coatings are synthesized. Materials for coatings on optical inserts are Platinum-based PVD (mostly iridium-alloyed, standard), diamond-like carbon (not yet commercially available), SiC (CVD) on SiC-ceramics (not yet commercially available, have to be post-machined) or TiAlN (not yet commercially available). To achieve a homogeneous layer thickness, the mould's position has to be changed during coating. To prepare the mould for the coating the surfaces have to be degreased, cleaned (under clean room or near-clean room conditions) and batched. Especially the cathode of the machine has to be cleaned. After this process the workpiece has to be debatched.|$|E
5000|$|Piston {{rings are}} subject to wear as they {{move up and down}} the {{cylinder}} bore due to their own inherent load and due to the gas load acting on the ring. To minimize this, they are made of wear-resistant materials, such as cast iron and steel, and are coated or treated to enhance the wear resistance. Two-stroke port design is critical to ring life. Newer modern motorcycle manufacturers have many single function but serrated ports to retain the ring. Typically, top ring and oil control rings will be coated with chromium, or Nitrided, possibly plasma sprayed [...] or have a PVD (<b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition)</b> ceramic coating. For enhanced scuff resistance and further improved wear, most modern diesel engines have top rings coated with a modified chromium coating known as CKS or GDC, a patent coating from Goetze which has aluminium oxide or diamond particles respectively included in the chrome surface. The lower oil control ring is designed to leave a lubricating oil film, a few micrometres thick on the bore, as the piston descends. Three piece oil rings, i.e. with two rails and one spacer, are used for four-stroke gasoline engines.|$|E
5000|$|His discoveries {{include the}} volume {{mechanism}} for photo-electric emission, sub-threshold defect generation by electron beams for producing semiconductor junctions with application in solar cells. Prof. Hora's first publication about growth of diamond crystals by <b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> became an IBM patent in 1964. His first general formula for nuclear energy gain at laser compression and thermal ignition of fusion {{led to his}} subsequent discovery of volume ignition (later confirmed by John A.

His derivation of the nonlinear (ponderomotive) forces of laser-plasma interaction including dielectric effects in the Maxwellian stress tensor led {{to the prediction of}} ultrahigh acceleration of plasma blocks being confirmed experimentally by Sauerbrey with application to a new laser fusion energy scheme as block ignition of uncompressed fuel resulting in a possible nuclear energy production with less radioactivity than burning coal. He discovered the general mechanism of ponderomotive and relativistic self-focusing. His theory for crossing electron and laser beams within media (Schwarz-Hora effect) led to the discovery of the correspondence principle of electromagnetic interaction and following Nathan Rosen to nonlocality and quantum entangling. Based on the importance of including usually neglected very tiny quantities as the longitudinal field components of laser beams led to the formulation of the nonlinearity principle showing how nonlinear physics is changing from wrong linear physics into correct understanding.|$|E

5000|$|Early works {{considered}} {{the integration of}} luminescent materials as erosion sensors in TBCs. The notion of a [...] "thermal barrier sensor coating" [...] (sensor TBC) for temperature detection was introduced in 1998. Instead of applying a phosphor layer on the surface where the temperature needs to be measured, it was proposed to locally modify {{the composition of the}} TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor as well as a protective thermal barrier. This dual functional material enables surface temperature measurement but also could provide a means to measure temperature within the TBC and at the metal/topcoat interface, hence enabling the manufacturing of an integrated heat flux gauge. First results on yttria-stabilized zirconia co-doped with europia (YSZ:Eu) powders were published in 2000. They also demonstrated sub-surface measurements looking through a 50 μm undoped YSZ layer and detecting the phosphorescence of a thin (10 µm) YSZ:Eu layer (bi-layer system) underneath using the ESAVD technique to produce the coating. The first results on electron beam <b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> of TBCs were published in 2001. The coating tested was a monolayer coating of standard YSZ co-doped with dysprosia (YSZ:Dy). First work on industrial atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sensor coating systems commenced around 2002 and was published in 2005. They demonstrated the capabilities of APS sensor coatings for in-situ two-dimensional temperature measurements in burner rigs using a high speed camera system. Further, temperature measurement capabilities of APS sensor coatings were demonstrated beyond 1400 °C. Results on multilayer sensing TBCs, enabling simultaneous temperature measurements below and {{on the surface of the}} coating, were reported. Such a multilayer coating could also be used as a heat flux gauge in order to monitor the thermal gradient and also to determine the heat flux through the thickness of the TBC under realistic service conditions.|$|E

30|$|In {{the current}} science and technology, the {{designing}} and fabrication of thin-film coatings on flexible substrates have grown worldwide {{into a major}} challenging and novel research area for cutting-edge future-based technologies. These flexible substrates are unique than solid glass substrates due to the following reasons: they are flexible, so they can bend and stick to any curved shape object without altering their basic properties, weigh less, are easy to carry and dimensionally stable, resistant towards moisture and oxygen, and thermally stable, tough and chemically resistant[13]. It is well acknowledged that plasma thin-film deposition methods have been recognised as ‘promising and pioneered’ to grow nearly stoichiometric thin films at low substrate temperatures. Various <b>physical</b> and chemical <b>vapour</b> thin-film <b>deposition</b> techniques have been employed to grow thin films of V 2 O 5, in which activated reactive evaporation (ARE) {{is one of the}} plasma-assisted <b>physical</b> <b>vapour</b> thin-film <b>deposition</b> techniques to grow nearly stoichiometric thin films with better uniformity at relatively lower substrate temperatures with higher deposition rates[14, 15]. In this deposition technique, the reaction occurs predominantly in plasma; as a result, chemical composition of the films can be controlled by changing the ratio of reacting species. Few researchers have reported about the growth of metal oxide thin films on flexible substrates for electrochromic window applications[16]. However, the ‘prominence and necessity of future fenestration technological needs’ divulge the impetus scope to carry out the research towards flexible electrochromic devices with enriched electrochromic properties. Hence, in the present investigation, we deposited V 2 O 5 thin films on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated flexible Kapton substrates (the glass transition temperature of the substrate is 673 K) by home-built activated reactive evaporation technique, studied their microstructural properties and reported a comparative study on optical and electrochromic properties of amorphous and nano-crystalline V 2 O 5 thin films. In parallel, we made an attempt to study electrochemical properties for as-deposited nano-crystalline V 2 O 5 films.|$|R

Either used as classic protective coatings or particle detectors, nanostructured materials require special synthesis methods, from <b>physical</b> or chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition,</b> flame synthesis to plasma processing.
