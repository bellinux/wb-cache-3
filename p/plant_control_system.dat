50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of critical systems: mission critical, business critical, safety critical and security critical. The key difference between a safety critical system and mission critical system, is that safety critical system is a system that, if it fails, may result in serious environmental damage, injury, or loss of life, while mission critical system may result in failure in goal-directed activity. An example of a safety critical system is a chemical manufacturing <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Mission critical system and business critical system are similar terms, but a business critical system fault can influence only a single company or an organization and can partially stop lifetime activity (hours or days). So it {{also can be used}} as a mission critical system in the business. Failure of it will cause very high cost loss for the business. Security critical system may lead to loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss. All these four systems are generalized as critical system.|$|E

The syngas is obtained by heavy refinery residues gasification within a downstream oil plant: this procedure allows obtaining the gaseous mixture to feed the molten carbonate fuel cell unit (MCFC). The proposed approach was developed according to a multi-step procedure, based on the following partially superimposed phases: process development and plant design; primary risk analysis; <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design and secondary risk analysis. In particular, dangerous compounds and critical units were identified, together with related criticai events.

We show how PTIDES can function as a coordination language, orchestrating components that may be designed and specified using different formalisms.

40|$|Utilization of windpower is {{considerably}} increasing {{in many countries}} around of the world. However, it produces an unreliable output due {{to the vagaries of}} the wind profile. To solve the problem, wind energy should be supported by local conventional sources. The requirements concerning the reliability and quality of electric energy supply can be most satisfactorily fulfilled when a windfarm is connected to a large electric power system. Then any electric power fluctuations, resulting either from wind turbulence or power demand variation, provoke system frequency variations. They should be damped by applying an appropriate control system of such a large power system. In this paper, the problem of control of a separate electric power system composed of windpower farm and supported by a gas turbine plant or a combined cycle has been investigated. First, the impact of wind turbulence on gas turbine <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> has been modeled and simulated. This is carried out for different amplitudes and frequencies of wind speed. Next, the structure of gas turbine <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and its parameters have been adapted to limit the power and frequency fluctuations resulting from wind turbulence. Then the design is further developed by considering a combined cycle instead of a single gas turbine.

Chemical Engineers would benefit in the same way from a Computer Aided Design package to assist with generating completed Piping and Instrument Diagrams. Despite the many theoretical methods available in the control science area there is no single and complete available {{solution to the problem of}} synthesising <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> for whole chemical processes and therefore no concrete basis from which to develop a computer program. Design activities rely on a significant experience factor and this element has largely been ignored especially in <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> synthesis. The recent emergence of rule-based programming allows this "experience" dimension to be added to software. Although there is previous work in the literature on expert systems for distillation column <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> synthesis there is very little published on programs for other unit operations or the whole plant problem. In this project the problem of how to set up an expert <b>system</b> for whole <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> synthesis was addressed. As a preliminary step this required that expert <b>systems</b> for <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> synthesis for unit operations be written. The necessary knowledge to do this for distillation columns, heat exchangers and reactors was sourced from the literature and programs developed for each using a shell written in a version of Prolog. These programs were coordinated to work together and provide controllable solutions to whole process control problems using a matrix representation of the relationship between control objectives and manipulated variables developed in structural controllability analysis. This provided the framework for a prototype whole plant program. The operation of all the programs is illustrated using typical examples and their rule bases included in appendices to the thesis. The work demonstrated that, with more extensive rulebases than it was possible to develop in the time available for this project including access to theoretical methods when required, expert systems could provide a useful solution to both unit operation and whole <b>plant</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> synthesis problems...|$|R
