5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|By 1905 the {{previously}} fragmented Buginese and Torajan lands had united into four major areas, {{one of which}} was under Tiku. In July of that year the king of Gowa, a nearby state, began collecting soldiers to fight off the invaders and prevent the remainder of the Torajan lands from conquest. Ma'dika Bombing, a leader from a southern state, approached Tiku for his assistance. A month after the messengers had dispersed, the leaders gathered at Gowa to make a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The result was that the local lords were to stop warring amongst themselves and focus on the Dutch, who had superior strength; these internal conflicts, however, did not completely abate. By the time the meeting adjourned, the Dutch had already begun making advances on Luwu. Tiku, tasked with diverting the Dutch from the indefensible town of Rantepo, began to build his army and work on his defences.|$|E

5|$|Reported {{to be more}} {{aggressive}} than other stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if disturbed and can inflict a painful injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across large portions of this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach seines and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There are a number of small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E

In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during a meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters in New York City that was convened to discuss the Global <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> to Combat Trafficking in Persons, the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E

40|$|To {{be useful}} in the real world, robots {{need to be able}} to move safely in {{unstructured}} environments and achieve their given tasks despite unexpected environmental changes or failures of some of their sensors. The variability of the world makes it impractical to develop very detailed <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> before execution since the world might change before execution begins and thus invalidate the plan. We propose to generate the very detailed <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> needed to control a robot at execution time. This allows to obtain uptodate information about the environment through sensors and to use it in deciding how to achieve the task. Our theory is based on the premise that proper application of knowledge in the integration and utilization of sensors and actuators increases the robustness of execution. In our approach we produce the detailed <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> primitive <b>actions</b> and execute it by using an object-oriented approach, in which primitive components contain domain specific knowledge and knowledg [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Promoting {{physical}} activity and healthy eating habits by structural measures that reach most children in a society is presumably the most sustainable way of preventing development of overweight and obesity in childhood. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to analyse whether policies and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> at the central level in municipalities increased the number of measures that aim to promote {{physical activity}} and healthy eating habits among schoolchildren aged six to 16. Another purpose was to analyse whether demographic and socio-economic characteristics were associated with the level of such measures. Methods Questionnaires were used to collect data from 25 municipalities and 18 town districts in Stockholm County, Sweden. The questions were developed to capture municipal structural work and factors facilitating {{physical activity and}} the development of healthy eating habits for children. Local policy documents and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were gathered. Information regarding municipal demographic and socio-economic characteristics was collected from public statistics. Results Policy documents and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in municipalities and town districts did not seem to influence the number of measures aiming to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits among schoolchildren in Stockholm County. Municipal demographic and socio-economic characteristics were, however, shown to influence the number of measures. In town districts with a high total population size, and in municipalities and town districts with a high proportion of adults with more than 12 years of education, a higher level of health-promoting measures was found. In municipalities with a high annual population growth, the number of measures was lower than in municipalities with a lower annual population growth. Another key finding was the lack of agreement between what was reported in the questionnaires regarding existence and contents of local policies and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and what was actually found when these documents were scrutinized. Conclusion Policy documents and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> aiming to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits among schoolchildren aged six to 16 in municipalities and town districts in Stockholm County did not seem to have an impact on the local level of measures. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the municipalities and town districts were on the other hand associated with local health-promoting measures. </p...|$|R
