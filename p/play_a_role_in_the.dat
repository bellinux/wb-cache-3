5|$|Chromium deficiency, {{involving}} {{a lack of}} Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as glucose tolerance factor is controversial. Some {{studies suggest that the}} biologically active form of chromium (III) in an oligopeptide called low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr), which might <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> insulin signaling pathway.|$|E

5|$|Several {{pathways}} {{by which}} mHTT may cause cell death have been identified. These include: effects on chaperone proteins, which help fold proteins and remove misfolded ones; interactions with caspases, which <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of removing cells; the toxic effects of glutamine on nerve cells; impairment of energy production within cells; and {{effects on the}} expression of genes.|$|E

50|$|DLL1 {{is a human}} homolog of the Notch Delta ligand and is {{a member}} of the delta/serrate/jagged family. It <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{mediating}} cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis. It may <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> cell-to-cell communication.|$|R
5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is detrimental to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. Testing for reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response and breathing. Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision to pronounce brain death.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E

5|$|Genetics may <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{risk that}} a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most {{studies have found that}} having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Genetics <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of COPD. It {{is more common}} among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, {{of which there are}} likely to be many.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that {{the answer would be}} revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By the end of the book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid may be {{involved}} in schizophrenia; however, there has been no research done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia. There are many studies that show that kynurenic acid (KYNA) <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and there has been some research to suggest that 3-hydroxykynurenine (OHK) <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the disease as well. Because quinolinic acid is strongly associated with KYNA and OHK, it may too <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> schizophrenia.|$|R

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|It is {{connected}} to the midbrain of the brainstem by the superior cerebellar peduncles, to the pons by the middle cerebellar peduncles, and to the medulla by the inferior cerebellar peduncles. The cerebellum consists of an inner medulla of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter. The cerebellum's anterior and posterior lobes appear to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements, and the flocculonodular lobe in the maintenance of balance although debate exists as to its cognitive, behavioral and motor functions.|$|E
5|$|Muscarine, {{discovered}} in 1869, was long {{thought to be}} the active hallucinogenic agent in A.muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A.muscaria is too low to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved {{component of the}} innate immune response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity. The complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immune response to viruses.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has found}} a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, {{based on the premise that}} inflammation might <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Second, the longitudes of {{ascending}} nodes {{of the two}} bodies—the points {{where they}} cross the ecliptic—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This {{is known as the}} 1:1 superresonance. All the Jovian planets, particularly Jupiter, <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation of the superresonance.|$|E
