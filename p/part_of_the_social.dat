5|$|Most {{owners of}} the Book of the Dead were evidently <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> elite; they were {{initially}} reserved for the royal family, but later papyri {{are found in the}} tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning {{of the history of the}} Book of the Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.|$|E

Another {{official residence}} is Windsor Castle, the largest occupied castle in the world, which is used principally at weekends, Easter and during Royal Ascot, an annual race meeting that is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> calendar. The Sovereign's official residence in Scotland is the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. The monarch stays at Holyrood for at least one week each year, and when visiting Scotland on state occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{officer corps}} formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> elite in Canada, and {{considered}} {{themselves to be}} {{much closer to the}} prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E

40|$|Substantial cross-national {{differences}} in poverty alleviation are well documented, but theextent to which different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> transfer system {{account for this}} variation is still relatively unexamined. This study analyses <b>the</b> redistributive effects <b>of</b> specific social policy institutions in a comparative perspective. The main question is to what extent non-targeted provisions and means-tested benefits reduce relative economic poverty in different institutional settings. It is shown that <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> non -targeted entitlements {{is more important than}} that of means-tested benefits in explaining {{differences in}} poverty alleviation across countries. The study also presents a new method for estimating <b>the</b> anti-poverty effects <b>of</b> separate <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> transfer system. This method decomposes <b>the</b> anti-poverty effects <b>of</b> a set of social transfers into independent and combined effects, which produces more valid results than prevalent methods used to assess <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> a particular transfer on poverty. The countries included in this study are Canada, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

40|$|About the book]: A {{thorough}} investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four essential <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> entrepreneurship process.

Such a focus allows <b>the</b> debate about <b>social</b> entrepreneurship {{to move beyond}} the general discussion about definitions, emerging general theories and first empirical insights. Instead it singles out here four phenomena that are considered to be both insufficiently researched and critical to <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>social</b> entrepreneurship. ...|$|R
25|$|Indigenous Australian music {{refers to}} the music of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Music forms an {{integral}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples, and has been so for over 60,000 years. Traditional Indigenous music is best characterised by the didgeridoo, the best-known instrument, which is considered by some to be the world's oldest. Archaeological studies of rock art in the Northern Territory suggest people of the Kakadu region were playing the instrument 15,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Hebard {{made her}} way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived at the future capital city {{in the company of}} her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> scene with other young people at the newly {{constructed}} Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if things got out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne telephone pole.|$|E
25|$|The {{athletic}} contests {{for which}} the gymnasium supplied the means of training and competition formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and spiritual life of the Greeks from very early on. The contests took place in honour of heroes and gods, sometimes forming part of a periodic festival or the funeral rites of a deceased chief. The free and active Greek lifestyle (spent {{to a great extent}} in the open air) reinforced the attachment to such sports and after a period of time the contests became a prominent element in Greek culture. The victor in religious athletic contests, though he gained no material prize other than a wreath, was rewarded with the honour and respect of his fellow citizens. Training of competitors for the greater contests was a huge matter of public concern and special buildings were provided by the state for such use, with management entrusted to public officials. A victory in the great religious festivals was counted an honour for the whole state.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous Australian music {{includes}} {{the music of}} Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who are collectively called Indigenous Australians; it incorporates a variety of distinctive traditional music styles practiced by Indigenous Australian peoples, {{as well as a}} range of contemporary musical styles of and fusion with European traditions as interpreted and performed by indigenous Australian artists. Music has formed an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples, down through the millennia of their individual and collective histories to the present day. The traditional forms include many aspects of performance and musical instrumentation unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups. Equal elements of musical tradition are common through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is related to that of adjacent parts of New Guinea and so their music is also related. Music is a vital part of Indigenous Australians' cultural maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The son of {{aspiring}} artisan parents, Adams attended {{elementary school}} and later apprenticed to become a carpenter and then a shoemaker. During this time, he nurtured a passion for music and literature. Adams learned to play piccolo (chosen primarily because the instrument was less expensive than a full-size flute) and joined the St. Thomas Municipal Band in 1906. Simultaneously, he studied music theory and composition late into the nights through correspondence courses with Dr. Hugh A. Clark at the University of Pennsylvania. In June 1910, Adams {{broke away from the}} Municipal Band to form his own ensemble—the Adams Juvenile Band. Adams' band developed rapidly, becoming <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> fabric in the islands' capital city—the port of Charlotte Amalie—by playing for a variety of social and charitable events as well as regular concerts in the city’s bandstand at Emancipation Garden, a location that remembers and celebrates Governor von Scholten proclamation which gave freedom to the slaves in 1848.|$|E

He had also applied to Oxford University, who had turned him down, not {{realising}} his sporting abilities. He made his debut for the university at Fenner's in May 1888, claiming his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket when he bowled four members of CI Thornton's XI, and had another one caught. Despite his wickets, he was relatively expensive, and the visiting side beat Cambridge easily. A week later, Woods improved on his performance against a 'Gentlemen of England' side which was also captained by Thornton, and claimed seven wickets in the first innings and another five in the second innings, top-scoring with the bat for Cambridge in-between, to help the university to a six wicket victory. This match also saw Woods take the only first-class hat-trick of his career.|$|E
