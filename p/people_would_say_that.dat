2500|$|As {{with other}} social movements, {{there is also}} {{conflict}} within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together. [...] Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails [...] "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that {{other members of the}} community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks. [...] Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] This chapter proposes {{tests of}} various notions of {{equality}} of opportunity and applies them to intergenerational income data for the United States and Britain. Agreement is widespread that {{equality of opportunity}} holds in a society if the chances that individuals have to succeed depend only on their own efforts and not on extraneous circumstances that may inhibit or expand those chances. What is contentious, however, is what constitutes 2 ̆ 2 effort 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 circumstances. 2 ̆ 2 Most <b>people,</b> we think, <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the social connections of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s parents would be included among circumstances: equality of opportunity is incomplete if some individuals get ahead because they have well-connected parents. This and other channels through which circumstances affect income opportunities in an intergenerational context are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 then formulates four, increasingly stringent criteria for equality of opportunity. In Section 4, we turn to an empirical implementation of these criteria to test for equality of opportunity in the United States and Britain. The results, presented in Section 5, provide only the weakest of support for equality of opportunity in the United States and no support at all in Britain. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 6...|$|R

This provoking obliquity has certainly increased rather than declined since Hallam's day. Mr. Froude, it is true, whatever may be his shortcomings {{on the side of}} sound moral and political judgment, has admirable gifts in the way of straightforward narration, and Mr. Freeman, when he does not press too hotly after emphasis, and abstains from overloading his account with super-abundance of detail, is usually excellent in the way of direct description.
