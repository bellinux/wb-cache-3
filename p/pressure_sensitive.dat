50|$|Styrene foam {{material}} coated on the down facing side with torque-activated adhesive. Pressure-sensitive inner seals adhere to plastic or glass bottles with normal application torque. <b>Pressures</b> <b>sensitive</b> liners are supplied pressed into closures and {{adhere to the}} bottle finish when the closure is applied. Pressure-sensitive liners stick to the container because one side is coated with pockets of adhesive. When the closure {{is applied to the}} container, the pockets of adhesive rupture between the closure and finish of bottle or jar. The pressure-sensitive liners then stick to the bottle or jar and remain in place when the closure is removed. No extra equipment is required. The closures are supplied with a standard liner as a backing. This material needs a dry land area on the bottle and therefore is suitable only for use with dry products such as vitamins, foods and pharmaceuticals.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2000, {{after the}} game had been {{released}} for Dreamcast and PC, but prior to its PlayStation 2 release, IGN held an online discussion with the developers. Zeschuk said the PlayStation 2 version, titled MDK2: Armageddon would feature the same difficulty tweaks as found in the PC version, as well as slight redesigns within most of the levels, and some gameplay tweaks. He stated [...] "MDK2: Armageddon is an improved version of MDK2, with specific features for the PS2. It's not a completely new game. But it is an improved, customized game." [...] In November, IGN held a second online chat. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently looked at the game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made, combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game."

This hypothesis justifies truncation of such data to test for correlation between blood pressure and salt intake among only the individuals in the higher range of blood pressures observed. No criterion of salt sensitivity is needed. The analysis should succeed if salt intake makes a major contribution to hypertension and would be improved if other putative causes were factored out...|$|R
