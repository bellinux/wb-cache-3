40|$|The {{structure}} of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of various fluorinated disulfides, perfluoroalkylamide thiols, and a mixed alkyl perfluoroalkylamide disulfide on sputtered gold was studied by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM). AFM, performed both in air and in ethanol, revealed the monolayer structure with molecular resolution on the polycrystalline gold substrates. For all partially fluorinated disulfides containing ester groups, a hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant of 5. 8 - 5. 9 Å was found. A mixed alkyl perfluoroalkylamide disulfide formed a hexagonal lattice of a slightly larger lattice constant (6. 1 Å), whereas the lattice observed for fluorinated thiols containing an amide group was either hexagonal (5. 7 - 5. 8 Å) or distorted hexatic (5. 6, 6. 2, 5. 6 Å), depending {{on the length of}} the <b>perfluoroalkane</b> segment and the imaging force. The observed deviation from hexagonal symmetry is attributed to the distorting effect of hydrogen bonding between neighboring amide groups within the monolayer. For short <b>perfluoroalkane</b> segments the distortion is observed at low imaging forces, whereas for long <b>perfluoroalkane</b> segments significantly higher imaging forces are necessary in order to observe the distortion.

50|$|As {{the high}} {{electronegativity}} of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly {{susceptible to the}} fleeting dipoles that {{form the basis of}} the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic and non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension and low heats of vaporization. The low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible (low bulk modulus) and able to dissolve gas relatively well. Smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five <b>perfluoroalkane</b> gases; tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), hexafluoroethane (bp −78.2 °C), octafluoropropane (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C).

40|$|Chapter 1. Introduction. An {{introduction}} to the detection of reactive intermediates by various spectroscopic techniques is given, {{as well as a}} brief {{introduction to}} perfluorinated solvents, which are used throughout the work presented in Chapters 2 to 4. Chapter 2. Time-Resolved Studies of Spin-Forbidden Reactions of Transition Metal Carbonyls with Weak Ligands. The photolysis of a series of first-row transition metal carbonyl compounds which have been previously reported to form 16 -electron coordinatively unsaturated intermediates was examined in a series of perfluorinated solvents using TRMPS (time-resolved multiple probe spectroscopy) and TRIR (time-resolved infrared) spectroscopy. In the case of Fe(CO) 5, CpMn(CO) 3, (MeCp) Mn(CO) 3 and CpV(CO) 4, the rate of reaction of the 16 -electron intermediate with the perfluorinated solvent was found to be slower than that previously reported for weakly coordinating solvents (e. g. alkanes). Addition of cyclopentane, CO 2, Xe and C 2 H 6 to a solution of CpMn(CO) 3 in perfluoro(methylcyclohexane) was shown to change the rate of this spin-forbidden reaction, as well as the (CO) band positions of the resulting 1 CpMn(CO) 2 X (X = solvent or dopant) complex. Other perfluorinated materials (perfluoro(hexanes) and perfluoro(triethylamine)) are also shown to allow formation of such weakly-coordinated alkane and noble gas complexes in room-temperature liquid solution. Chapter 3. Further Time-Resolved Studies of Alkane and Noble Gas Complexes in Room Temperature <b>Perfluoroalkane</b> Solutions. The photochemistry of various model transition metal compounds in <b>perfluoroalkane</b> solutions was examined with TRMPS and TRIR spectroscopy. 266 nm photolysis of CpRe(CO) 3, Cp*Re(CO) 3 and CpRe(CO) 2 (N 2) in perfluoro(methylcyclohexane) solution was found to result in the formation of two distinct dicarbonyl species of the form CpRe(CO) 2 X, the first of which decay completely on the nanosecond timescale to form the second. The rate of formation, rate of decay and (CO) band positions of this second dicarbonyl species were found to be dependent {{on the nature of the}} the solvents or dopants including Xe or cyclopentane present in solution. Similar results were observed for complexes of the form M(CO) 6 (M = Cr, Mo, W). DFT calculations were used in conjunction with spectroscopic studies to attempt to confirm the structure of the initially formed species following photolysis of CpRe(CO) 3 and M(CO) 6 in PFMCH solution. Good agreement was observed between the calculated (CO) band positions of coordinatively unsaturated species and the unknown initially formed CO loss species. Doping of CH 4 or C 2 H 6 into a solution of CpRe(CO) 3 or Cp*Re(CO) 3 resulted in observation of a C-H activated alkyl hydride complex, with the amount of observed C-H activation vaying in the order: CpRe(CO) 3 with ethane < Cp*Re(CO) 3 with ethane < CpRe(CO) 3 with methane < Cp*Re(CO) 3 with methane. Photolysis of CpRh(CO) 2 in <b>perfluoroalkane</b> solvents was shown to lead to formation of a monocarbonyl solvent complex, followed by the dimeric species Cp 2 Rh 2 (CO) 3, as well as another species, very tentatively assigned to a C-F activated oxidative addition product. Addition of Xe to the above solution was shown to slow formation of the dimeric species, with no evidence of C-F activation observed, indicating formation of CpRh(CO) Xe in room temperature solution. Chapter 4. Time-Resolved Spectroscopic Studies of Organometallic Triethylsilane Complexes. TRMPS studies of CpMn(CO) 3, CpRe(CO) 3 and Cp*Re(CO) 3 were undertaken in neat HSiEt 3 solvent. Photolysis of CpMn(CO) 3 resulted in initial formation of 3 CpMn(CO) 2, following by both direct and indirect formation of the Si-H activated speciesin both cases. Photolysis ofW(CO) 6 was found to result in initial formation of the ethyl-boundW(CO) 5 (EtSiHEt 2), which interconverted to form the Si-H-bound speciesW(CO) 5 (H−SiEt 3). Preliminary time-resolved x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic studies are also presented. Photolysis of W(CO) 6 and CpRe(CO) 3 in neat HSiEt 3 was observed to cause subtle changes in the absorption edge compared to ground state XAFS spectra, indicating possible formation of transient species in both cases.

40|$|Chemical Equation Presented) Low {{partition}} coefficients of fluorous components {{have been a}} persistent problem in liquid-liquid separations using <b>perfluoroalkanes</b> as the fluorous phase. Solvent tuning of both the nonfluorous and the fluorous phase dramatically enhances the partitioning of light or polar fluorous molecules into the fluorous liquid phase, while minimally effecting {{partition coefficients}} of nonfluorous molecules. These findings suggest an expanded scope for liquid-based separations in fluorous biphasic catalysis, fluorous-tagged reagents, fluorous-supported oligomer synthesis, and related areas. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} ballistic {{vibrational energy}} transport through optical phonon band in oligomeric chains {{in the presence}} of decoherence. An exact solution is obtained for the excitation density in the space-time representation in the continuous limit and this solution is used to characterize the energy transport time and intensity. Three transport mechanisms are identified such as ballistic, diffusive and directed diffusive regimes, occurring at different distances and time ranges. The crossover between the two diffusive regimes is continuous, while the switch between the ballistic and diffusive mechanisms occurs in discontinuous manner in accord with the recent experimental data on energy transport in <b>perfluoroalkanes.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} DAPPLE {{programme}} {{two large}} scale urban tracer experiments using multiple simultaneous releases of cyclic <b>perfluoroalkanes</b> from fixed location point sources was performed. The receptor concentrations along with relevant meteorological parameters measured are compared with a three screening dispersion models in order to best predict the decay of pollution sources with respect to distance. It is shown here that the simple dispersion models tested here can provide a reasonable upper bound estimate of the maximum concentrations measured with an empirical model derived from field observations and wind tunnel studies providing the best estimate. An indoor receptor was also used to assess indoor concentrations and their pertinence to commonly used evacuation procedures...|$|E
40|$|A {{nationwide}} emission {{estimate of}} perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is required to understand the source&# 8211;receptor relationship of PFASs and to manage major types of WWTPs. In this study, the concentrations of 13 PFASs (8 perfluorocarboxylic acids, 3 <b>perfluoroalkane</b> sulfonates, and 2 intermediates) in wastewater and sludge from 81 WWTPs in South Korea were collected. The emission pathways of PFASs were redefined, and then the national emission of PFASs from WWTPs was rigorously updated. In addition to the direct calculations, Monte Carlo simulations were also {{used to calculate the}} likely range of PFAS emissions. The total (Σ 13 PFAS) emission (wastewater + sludge) calculated from the direct calculation with mean concentrations was 4. 03 ton/y. The emissions of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 1. 19 ton/y) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, 1. 01 ton/y) were dominant. The Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the realistic national emission of Σ 13 PFASs is between 2 ton/y and 20 ton/y. Combined WWTPs treating municipal wastewater from residential and commercial areas were identified as a major emission source, contributing 65 % to the total PFAS emissions. The Han and Nakdong Rivers were the primary contaminated rivers, receiving 89 % of the total PFAS discharge from WWTPs. The results and methodologies in this study can be useful to establish a management policy for PFASs. close...|$|R
40|$|Absolute {{oscillator}} strength spectra in the C 1 s (280 – 340 eV) and F 1 s (680 – 740 eV) {{regions of the}} perfluoro-n-alkanes from C 2 to C 6 and perfluorocycloalkanes from C 3 to C 6 have been determined from inner-shell electron energy loss spectra recorded under electric-dipole scattering conditions. The spectral features are interpreted in terms of spatially localized transitions terminating at orbitals of predominantly σ*(C—F) and σ*(C—C) character. When compared to the spectra of the perfluoro-n-alkanes, both the C 1 s and F 1 s spectra of the perfluorocycloalkanes exhibit additional low-lying bands which are assigned to transitions terminating at σ*(C—C) orbitals which are shifted to low energy by {{the combination of the}} strain of cyclization and the inductive effect of the fluorination. The electron transmission spectra of selected perfluorocycloalkanes (which provide information on their anion states) show as well that the electron affinities of the cyclic systems are substantially lower than those of the corresponding perfluoro-n-alkanes, again {{as a result of a}} low-lying σ* orbital in the cyclic species. Quantum chemical calculations of the alkane and <b>perfluoroalkane</b> ground-state orbital structures support the experimental results. The localized character of the inner-shell excitations, indicated by the constancy of both term values and {{oscillator strength}}s with increasing chain length, contrasts with the more delocalized character of the states accessed in ultraviolet excitation or negative ion formation...|$|R
40|$|A metal-organic {{framework}} (MOF) with one-dimensional {{channels of}} approximately hexagonal cross-section [Ag 2 (O 2 CCF 2 CF 2 CO 2) (TMP) ] 1 : (TMP[*]= 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethylpyrazine) has been synthesized with MeOH filling the channels in its as-synthesized form as [Ag 2 (O 2 CCF 2 CF 2 CO 2) (TMP) ]·n(MeOH) 1 -MEOH: (n[*]=[*] 1. 625 by X-ray crystallography). The {{two types of}} ligand connect columns of Ag(I) centres in an alternating manner, both around the channels and along their length, leading to an alternating arrangement of hydrocarbon (C-H) and fluorocarbon (C-F) groups lining the channel walls, with the former groups projecting further into the channel than the latter. MeOH solvent in the channels can be exchanged {{for a variety of}} arene guests, ranging from xylenes to tetrafluorobenzene, as confirmed by gas chromatography, (1) H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and (13) C cross-polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. Alkane and <b>perfluoroalkane</b> guests, however, do not enter the channels. Although exhibiting some stability under a nitrogen atmosphere, sufficient to enable crystal structure determination, the evacuated MOF 1 : is unstable for periods of more than minutes under ambient conditions or upon heating, whereupon it undergoes an irreversible solid-state transformation to a non-porous polymorph 2 :, which comprises Ag 2 (O 2 CCF 2 CF 2 CO 2) coordination layers that are pillared by TMP ligands. This transformation has been followed in situ by powder X-ray diffraction and shown to proceed via a crystalline intermediate.
