25|$|A {{solution}} lake is a lake {{occupying a}} basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock. In areas underlain by soluble bedrock, its solution by precipitation and <b>percolating</b> <b>water</b> commonly produce cavities. These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that {{form part of}} the local karst topography. Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface, a sinkhole will be filled water as a solution lake. If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone, it is also called a karst lake. Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds. Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water, which are known as underground lakes. Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida.|$|E

The silex, in fact undergoes solution and slow redeposition, until, in ultimate result, the excessively finegrained sand, each particle of which is a skeleton, becomes converted into a dense opaline stone, with only here and there an indication of an organism.|$|E

Had that constitution been other than what it was, the bones would have been dissolved, the layers of sandstone would have fallen together into one mass, and not the slightest indication that the animal had existed would have been discoverable.|$|E
40|$|Different {{analytical}} methods {{were applied to}} analyse the leachates obtained from leach tests on S/S industrial waste containing arsenic and the treated <b>percolate</b> <b>water</b> from a landfill. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) {{was used to determine}} total As and other elements, hydride generation-ICP-MS for the determination of As(III) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for As(III) and As(V). Interferences and matrix effects were studied in detail and corrected for. For the leachates, no corrections were required, for treated <b>percolate</b> <b>water</b> with lower As concentrations, in the case of ICP-MS important corrections were necessary.

40|$|The {{determination}} of arsenic in environmental samples suffers interference by chloride which {{gives rise to}} the polyatomic interference of (ArCl) -Ar- 40 -Cl- 35 on As- 75. Mathematical correction methods based on the ratios (ArCl) -Ar- 40 -Cl- 37 /(ArCl) -Ar- 40 -Cl- 35, (ClO) -Cl- 35 -O- 16 /(ArCl) -Ar- 40 -Cl- 35 or (ClO) -Cl- 37 -O- 16 /(ArCl) -Ar- 40 -Cl- 35, discussed and compared with each other. The method is applied to the {{determination of}} arsenic in treated <b>percolate</b> <b>water</b> from a landfill where arsenic containing waste is landfilled. The results obtained when applying the different equations were in good agreement with each other. The results for the untreated <b>percolate</b> <b>water,</b> which could be diluted far enough to eliminate matrix effects and showed negligible interference from chloride, were in good agreement with results obtained with Capillary Zone Electrophoresis. Hydride generation made it possible to determine As(III) and by difference As(V) in both waters. 99. 7 % of the arsenic present in the <b>percolate</b> <b>water</b> was As(V), which means that during the landfilling, possibly by the infiltration of rainwater, the arsenic is oxidised because the original industrial waste contained 100 % As(III). status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{constituent}} particles of this mud may agglomerate into a dense rock, such as that formed at Oran on the shores of the Mediterranean, which is made up of similar materials. Moreover, in the case of freshwater deposits of this kind it is certain that the action of <b>percolating</b> <b>water</b> may convert the originally soft and friable, fine-grained sandstone into a dense, semi-transparent opaline stone, the silicious organized skeletons being dissolved, and the silex re-deposited in an amorphous state. Whether such a metamorphosis as this occurs in submarine deposits, as well as in those formed in fresh water, does not appear; but there seems no reason to doubt that it may. And hence it may not be hazardous to conclude that very ordinary metamorphic agencies may convert these polar caps into a form of quartzite.|$|E

Undisturbed soil columns (65 cm high x 15 cm diam.) {{were used in}} a greenhouse experiment to study the effect of rainfall and mode of application on leaching pattern of linuron and imidacloprid. Two simulated rainfall amounts (288 mm and 496 mm) distributed over a one month period and two modes of application (sole or combined application of the two pesticides) were studied. Linuron did not leach below 65 cm of the soil columns. Imidacloprid was leached in trace amount below 65 cm soil columns (less than 1, 5 / of applied a. i.).

40|$|A set of indices (LOS), {{based on}} a {{deterministic}} approach and regression analysis {{were used to assess}} intrinsic and specific vulnerability to nitrates in Ferrara Province, in northern Italy. To calibrate the LOS indices, using multiple regression analysis, the simulation results of GLEAMS model for combinations of different soil properties, topography and climatic conditions of a reference fieldcrop were used as “observed values”. Results of model were introduced in a GIS environment to obtain the vulnerability maps. Maps of water and nitrogen losses under the root zone (LOSW-P and LOSN-PN respectively) were used to obtain the map of relative concentration of <b>percolated</b> <b>water</b> (RCPW). Data on individual crops were used to calculate specific crop evapotranspiration rates (ETc) from potential evapotranspiration (PE). ETc values replaced PE values in the indices, to obtain both specific vulnerability map for water and nitrogen losses under the root zone (LOSW-P mod; LOSN-PN mod) and for relative nitrogen concentration of <b>percolated</b> <b>water</b> (RCPW mod). The RCPW mod map shows that concentration of nitrogen losses under the root zone is under water drinking limit of 50 mg/L (WFD; 2006 / 118 /EC) all over the territory with highest concentrations along small areas of the coastal zone, where sandy textured soil are present (coastal dunes) and lowest concentrations where ETc is higher...|$|R

40|$|A set of indices was {{developed}} in order to classify the vulnerability of agricultural land to water and nitrogen losses (LOS), setting {{a basis for the}} integrated water resources management in agricultural systems. To calibrate the indices using multiple regression analysis, the simulation results of GLEAMS model for combinations of different soil properties, topography and climatic conditions of a reference field-crop were used as “observed values”. GLEAMS quantified (i) the annual losses of the <b>percolated</b> <b>water</b> beneath the root zone, (ii) the annual losses of the surface runoff, (iii) the annual losses of the nitrogen leaching beneath the root zone and (iv) the annual losses of nitrogen through the surface runoff, which were used to calibrate the following indices LOSW-P, LOSW-R, LOSN-PN and LOSN-RN, respectively. All the simulations to gain the LOS indices were carried out for the same reference field-crop, the same nitrogen fertilization and the same irrigation practice, in order to obtain the intrinsic vulnerability of agricultural land to water and nitrogen losses. The LOS indices were also combined to derive nitrogen concentrations in the percolated and in the runoff water. Finally, the connection of LOS indices with the groundwater was performed using an additional equation, which determines the minimum transit time of the <b>percolated</b> <b>water</b> to reach the groundwater table...|$|R

A field study was conducted in Connecticut to determine the timing effects of fall fertilization on nitrate N (NO 3 -N) leaching, turf color, shoot density, and root mass of a 90 % Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), 10 % creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) lawn. Treatments consisted of the date of fall fertilization: 15 September, 15 October, 15 November, 15 December, or control which received no fall fertilizer. <b>Percolate</b> <b>water</b> was collected weekly with soil monolith lysimeters. Mean log 10 NO 3 -N concentrations in percolate were higher for fall fertilized treatments than for the control.
