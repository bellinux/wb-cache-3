50|$|The 10-1-1 {{sleeping}} car operated through to Portland, Oregon; cars {{used in this}} service included Balsam Fir, Douglas Fir, Inland Empire, Pinion Pine, Poudre Lake and Silver Spruce. The 6-4-4 {{sleeping car}} operated through to Los Angeles. The 2200-series <b>postal</b> <b>car</b> was added in Denver, Colorado for Cheyenne.|$|E
50|$|The 123 {{series was}} created in 1986 from former KuMoNi 143 baggage cars which had become surplus to requirements. Some units were also {{converted}} from KuMoYuNi 147 <b>postal</b> <b>cars</b> (123-40 series, later 123-5000 series), and from KuMoYa 143 tractor cars (123-600 series).|$|R
25|$|In the United States, RPO cars (also {{known as}} mail <b>cars</b> or <b>postal</b> <b>cars)</b> were {{equipped}} and staffed to handle most back-end postal processing functions. First class mail, {{magazines and newspapers}} were all sorted, cancelled when necessary, and dispatched to post offices in towns along the route. Registered mail was also handled, and the foreman in charge was required to carry a regulation pistol while on duty to discourage theft of the mail.|$|R
5000|$|The Fast Mail was a Southern Railway {{steam train}} that on September 27, 1903, derailed at Stillhouse Trestle in Danville, Virginia. The train {{consisted}} of two <b>postal</b> <b>cars,</b> one express car, and one baggage car. The accident inspired the famous railroad ballad - Wreck of the Old 97. As mentioned in the song, the old 97's locomotive (#1102) did make it to Spencer, North Carolina. It was hauled to the Southern Railway Spencer Shops where it was repaired and placed back into regular service for many years afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|A new depot {{was opened}} at Priestley's Bridge (grid {{reference}} [...] ) during 1899. On 6 March 1900 a tramway postal service was inaugurated, which continued {{until the end}} of tramway operation 40 years later. In latter days the <b>postal</b> <b>car</b> left Bedworth at 8.50pm, showing 'Postal Car' in red letters on the route indicator. The letter-box was fixed to the outside of the rear dash.|$|E
50|$|Concession car 566 was {{originally}} mail car 14 built in 1882. Around 1888 it was rebuilt into excursion car 566. In July 1904 it was renumbered 0566. Then it was switched to work service in 1914. It was rebuilt {{to its original}} appearance as a <b>postal</b> <b>car</b> by the D&SNG. It was then given its old excursion car number of 566 and is now used as a concession car.|$|E
5000|$|The Railway Heritage Museum was {{established}} in October 2003. From Relics {{dating back to the}} inception of railways in the subcontinent by the British to memorabilia depicting the creation of the museum are housed and preserved in this heritage site. The Rail Heritage Museum is housed in three different halls to contain artifacts reflecting history of Railway over a period of more than 150 years including almost 100 years of undivided India. As a part of the museum there is a big yard where cranes, trolleys, saloons, locomotives, coaches and tracks are marshaled impressively, portraying the railway’s march forward through time. The museum houses an impressive blend of artifacts covering the many facets of the railways systems. Mechanical models, signalling systems, communication tools and the evolution of operational protocols are preserved and chronologically displayed in the museum. The museum also displays the social impact and anthropological implications of the railways on the human geography of the multi-racial sub continent. An open yard displays a wide array of relics which have become extinct on the railway lines around the world. The steam and electric locomotives, a German <b>postal</b> <b>car,</b> a saloon car used by the last Indian viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, and another saloon car belonging to the Maharaja of Jodhpur from the Jodhpur railways given as a wedding present to his daughter are a few examples.|$|E
50|$|Rail {{timetables}} {{are integrated}} with the extensive network of postal buses (branded as PostBus, CarPostal, PostAuto, AutoPostale) which serve both plain and high mountain villages. For example, on postal bus line 12.381 the 10:35 from the mountain village of Les Haudères is planned to arrive in the regional city of Sion at 11:20 where a train departs the station (located next to the bus station) at 11:24 for Visp. Indeed, it is a familiar sight to for the <b>postal</b> <b>cars</b> to be already lined up outside the station for the arriving train. From this perspective, the Swiss rail network functions as {{the core of a}} wider public transport network.|$|R
2500|$|After {{working in}} several {{clerical}} positions at local small businesses, Couch saw a newspaper advertisement seeking mail clerks; the pay was $75 per month, {{significantly higher than}} his then salary of $20. Passing the entrance exam in Shreveport, Louisiana, qualified Couch [...] to enter the United States Post Office's Railway Mail Service, for which he would sort mail {{in one of the}} many railway <b>postal</b> <b>cars</b> which criss-crossed the nation. Couch initially worked on a Railway Post Office route on the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway between St. Louis and Texarkana, then a Memphis and Texarkana run over the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, before getting an assignment in Louisiana south of his home town of Magnolia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{day after}} the wreck, Vice-president Finley made a speech in which he said: [...] "The train {{consisted}} of two <b>postal</b> <b>cars,</b> one express and one baggage car for the storage of mail.... Eyewitnesses said the train was approaching the trestle at speeds of 30 to 35 miles an hour." [...] The Southern Railway placed blame for the wreck on engineer Broady, disavowing {{that he had been}} ordered to run as fast as possible to maintain the schedule. The railroad also claimed he descended the grade leading to Stillhouse Trestle at a speed of more than 70 mph. Several eyewitnesses to the wreck, however, stated that the speed was probably around 50 mph. In all likelihood, the railroad was at least partially to blame, as it had a lucrative contract with the U.S. Post Office to haul mail (hence the train's name), and the contract including a penalty clause for each minute the train was late into Spencer. It is probably safe to conclude that the engineers piloting the Fast Mail were always under pressure to stay on time so that the railroad would not be penalized for late mail delivery.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2013, Andreas Heusser {{has devoted}} {{himself to the}} {{exploration}} of nothing in art, philosophy and science. This has developed into the No Show Museum, a museum dedicated to nothing and its various [...] {{throughout the history of}} art. The museum's collection includes around 400 works and documents from over 120 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. The museum also has a mobile presentation space in a converted <b>postal</b> <b>car.</b> From July to October 2015, the No Show Museum was on tour through Europe, staging around 30 exhibitions in 20 different countries, before finally arriving in Italy, as an official participant of the 56th Venice Art Biennale.The museum reproduces the typical structures, mechanisms, rituals and strategies of established art institutions. As a result, the project becomes a model in which we can observe the contextual conditions that are required for the recognition of something (or nothing) as art. Implicit in the project, then, is the question: What is needed for a successful promotion and marketing of art?In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|This was an {{important}} duty and Owney was well-situated for it, as the Albany train station was a key division point on the New York Central railroad system, {{one of the two}} largest railroads in the U.S. at that time. Mail trains from Albany rolled eastward to Boston, south to New York City, and westward to Buffalo, Cleveland, Toledo, Chicago, and points further west. As a contemporary book recounted: [...] "The terrier 'Owney' travels {{from one end of the}} country to the other in the <b>postal</b> <b>cars,</b> tagged through, petted, talked to, looked out for, as a brother, almost. But sometimes, no matter what the attention, he suddenly departs for the south, the east, or the west, and is not seen again for months." [...] In 1893 he was feared dead after having disappeared, but it turned out he was involved in an accident in Canada.As Owney's trips grew longer, the postal clerks at Albany became concerned that the dog be identified, and, if necessary returned to them. They bought a dog collar with a metal tag that read: [...] "Owney, Post Office, Albany, New York". To this collar, the various railway post offices that saw Owney added individual dog tags. The collar and tags made the mixed-breed terrier the unofficial mascot of the U.S. Railway Mail Service, and as shown by the 2011 postage stamp issued in his honor, his identifications became an essential element of his identity.|$|R
30|$|Over {{seven years}} (2006 – 2012), there were 477 {{accidents}} involving various sorts of EVs registered in STRADA. Only one (2012) of these accidents involved a {{battery electric vehicle}} (BEV). Four of the accidents were fatal and 103 caused serious injuries. Many of the EVs involved in these accidents were small vehicles for example, <b>postal</b> service <b>cars,</b> golf carts, and moped-cars, driven at a maximum of 45  km/h. This means that the accidents often happened on cycle paths. In STRADA, {{the only way to}} register how the involved vehicle is powered is to record it as a comment, which is rarely done. The accident descriptions we found made no reference to electrical systems or batteries. The MSB accident database (2002 – 2012) included only four registered accidents involving EVs. Also in this database, electrical cars can only be identified if the rescue services specifically recorded that the accident involved an EV. In neither database were the causes of the recorded accidents linked to electricity.|$|R
50|$|In Switzerland, the postbus {{system is}} known as Postauto in German, <b>Car</b> <b>postal</b> in French and Autopostale in Italian. Although the {{combination}} of mail and passenger transportation had been self-evident in the past, the needs of each diverged {{towards the end of}} the twentieth century, when the conveyance of parcels was progressively separated from public transportation. This was also so on private bus and rail lines. This division became official with the conversion of Swiss PostBus Ltd into an independent subsidiary of the Swiss Post. The company operates 869 bus lines with 2,193 buses in Switzerland, transporting over 140 million passengers annually on its 11,869 km long network.|$|R
25|$|On May 6, 1872, the Watts Street station opened, and on June 17, 1872, the Little West 12th Street station {{opened with}} a passing track. On August 15, 1872 the Morris Street station was opened. On March 19, 1873, the Morris Street station was closed {{in favor of a}} {{terminal}} at the rear of 7 Broadway, where the company offices were located. US mail was carried on regular passenger trains on the front platform of the first car accompanied by a US Post Office guard with a limit of 7 bags. Railway <b>Postal</b> Office <b>cars</b> were not used for this service. The first yard and engine repair shop was located here. On January 21, 1873, the Franklin Street station opened. At the time, running time on the line was 28 minutes. On July 30, 1873, the line was extended to 34th Street on Ninth Avenue. On October 21, 1873, the 21st Street station opened. On November 3, 1873, the Houston Street station opened. On December 13, 1873, a new station opened at 30th Street, which replaced the original terminal at 29th Street. On May 25, 1874, a new and larger Cortlandt Street station replaced the original Dey Street station.|$|R
50|$|Ohmbach, {{which had}} {{originally}} been purely a farming village, was already home in the 19th century to a goodly number of workers, who mostly earned their livelihoods at the nearby coalmines in the Saarland. Beginning in 1888, there were also job opportunities at Isidor Trifuß’s diamond-cutting workshop at the Neumühle (“New Mill”) between Ohmbach and Brücken. Later, such workshops were set up in Ohmbach itself, often small family businesses. After the Second World War, one fourth of the local workforce was for a time employed at the workshops. Thereafter, the bottom {{fell out of the}} diamond-cutting industry in the Brücken area and the great boom is now only a memory. Many of today’s workforce must now commute to jobs. Tourism, too, has some future. In the village itself are the most important shops for local supplies: a ﬂorist’s shop with a <b>postal</b> agency, a <b>car</b> dealership and three inns. Ohmbach is today held to be an attractive residential community with shops, good public utilities and a lively club life.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{experiment}} in distributing mails in so-called [...] "post offices on wheels" [...] {{was made in}} 1862 by William A. Davis between Hannibal and St. Joseph, Missouri. It was intended to expedite the connection at St. Joseph with the overland stage, which had replaced the Pony Express routes to the West a year earlier. The H&StJ furnished a baggage car, altered to Davis' specifications. Similar to a <b>postal</b> route agent's <b>car,</b> it had a table and a 65-pigeon-hole letter case, but no pouch rack. Davis boarded the westbound train at Palmyra, Missouri, with authority to open the sacks and letter packages which were addressed to the St. Joseph DPO, to remove all California letters, and to make up and sort the mail in a manner identical {{to the way the}} St. Joseph DPO would have dispatched it. Davis was paid at the rate of $100.00 per month. The railroad was harassed by guerrillas and by lack of maintenance, resulting in several suspensions and finally abandonment of the experiment. After the Civil War, Railway Post Office (RPO) service was re-established on this line, and it became known as the Chicago & Kansas City RPO.|$|R
