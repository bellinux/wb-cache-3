5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E

25|$|As an NBC affiliate, WCKT/WSVN aired a local {{newscast}} {{in place}} of programs that NBC had aired at noon on weekdays. It also occasionally preempted network shows that aired during the 10 or 11 a.m. timeslot (but ran {{at least one of}} these hours) and preempted an occasional primetime program. While NBC was traditionally far less tolerant of program preemptions than the other major broadcast networks, it did not mind this at first provided that the network was able to get Miami area independent stations to air whatever programs that WSVN chose not to air. In addition, NBC <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not broadcast by WSVN were cleared by WPTV, whose signal provides city-grade coverage of Fort Lauderdale and was available on nearly every cable provider in the area. However, in the early 1980s, WPTV was removed from some Miami area cable systems to make room for new channels due to limited headend channel capacity. Largely due to those preemptions, WCKT/WSVN was one of NBC's weaker affiliates. Though NBC continued to arrange for independent stations to air network <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not shown on WSVN, the network grew increasingly annoyed at having to resort to such an arrangement in what had grown into a major market. NBC eventually decided that it needed to acquire its own station in the growing South Florida market.|$|E

25|$|The Western programming, as well {{as other}} classic {{television}} <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> part of the overnight schedule, were provided by Weigel Broadcasting's MeTV, which mainly airs on digital subchannels in most of the network's markets, though WTVW ran programming recorded from the network's national feed to be aired later in the station's schedule to compensate for current-day syndication rights. Although WTSN-CD became a full MeTV affiliate in November 2011, WTVW continued to air these programs until January 31, 2013 (though the amount of MeTV programming seen on the station was reduced in September 2012), and MeTV continues to list WTVW as carrying a partial schedule.|$|E

The <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> organised, were a speech and prize-giving ceremony, an induction of final-year students of the academy into the Accra Academy old boys' association, a cleaning campaign at Kaneshie Polyclinic, games between old boys and media personnel, a health-screening exercise, a homecoming and float through the principal streets of Accra, a Founders' Day commemoration and oration day, a founders' memorial lecture, an awards night and dinner dance, a night with bleoo musicians and a thanksgiving service that brought the year-long festivities to an end.|$|E
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer down almost out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of the <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E
25|$|The first {{broadcast}} of a VFL game was by 3AR in 1923, {{the year that}} broadcasting officially commenced in Australia. The first commentator was Wallace (Jumbo) Shallard, a former Geelong player {{who went on to}} have a long and respected career in print and broadcast media. The VFL/AFL has been broadcast every year since then by the ABC and (since 1927) by various commercial stations. The saturation period was the early 1960s when seven of the eight extant radio stations (3AR, 3UZ, 3DB, 3KZ, 3AW, 3XY and 3AK) broadcast VFL games each week, as well as broadcasts of Geelong games by local station 3GL. (At this time, the only alternative that radio listeners had to listening to the football on a Saturday afternoon were the classical music and fine arts <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> broadcast by 3LO).|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} decade after the first TV {{licences}} were granted, {{the federal government and}} the ABCB did not act to enforce local content quotas, and such measures were resisted by the commercial sector. As a result, Australian TV was soon dominated by material imported from the United States and (to a far smaller extent) Great Britain. In this period nearly every TV drama screened in Australia came from the USA and the few <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> made locally were almost all produced by the ABC. In other formats, the few locally produced programs made by or for commercial stations were typically low-cost copies of proven American talk/variety or quiz show formats. By the early 1960s at least 80% of all Australian TV content was sourced from the USA and not surprisingly American programs consistently topped the ratings.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{idea was}} to {{implement}} welfare <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as safe working conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women's and child labor. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program. Bismarck's program centred squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity, and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers' government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree.|$|E
25|$|As KTVT gained {{regional}} exposure, {{the station}} became vulnerable in the Dallas–Fort Worth area and underestimated {{the ability of}} UHF competitor KTXA to acquire top-rated syndicated programs. Out {{of the companies that}} owned the market's independents, the group that owned KTXA at the time, Grant Broadcasting, was particularly aggressive in its programming acquisitions by leveraging its independent stations elsewhere around the country for the strongest <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> entering into syndication; as a result, Grant-owned KTXA edged ahead of KTVT in the ratings by the fall of 1984. Not to stay outdone, after Gaylord appointed KSTW general manager Charles L. Edwards as KTVT's executive {{vice president and general manager}} (as well as the group's corporate programming director) in 1984, the station began making its own moves in acquiring stronger first-run and off-network syndicated programming, gaining the rights to series such as The Cosby Show, Night Court and Cheers. The station's ratings improved under the stewardship of Edwards, resulting in KTVT retaking its status as the top-rated independent station in the market by the time of his retirement in 1989.|$|E
