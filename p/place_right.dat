In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third <b>place,</b> <b>right</b> behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Barranca Seca was {{a battle}} of the Second French {{intervention}} in Mexico and took <b>place</b> <b>right</b> after the Battle of Puebla on 18 May 1862. Contrary to the latter it was won by the unified reactionist Mexican-French forces. The battle was preceded by a coup de chef of the reactionist forces, which was heated by the intrigue of the Spanish high command against Almonte and Márquez and French pressure towards the replacement of Zuloaga. After the battle Almonte remained the only contender for the Commander-in-Chief office within the reactionist party and Márquez as acting General; both of them serving French interests.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} Kufa {{was the center}} for the {{opposition}} to Umayyad rule, particularly Ali's supporters and Shias. In 741-42 Abu Muslim made his first contact with Abbasid agents there, and eventually he was introduced to the head of Abbasids, Imam Ibrahim, in Mecca. Around 746, Abu Muslim assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan. Unlike the Alid revolts which were open and straightforward about their demands, the Abbasids along with the Hashimite allies slowly built up an underground resistance movement to Umayyad rule. Secret networks were used to build a power base of support in the eastern Muslim lands to ensure the revolution's success. This buildup not only took <b>place</b> <b>right</b> {{on the heels of the}} Zaydi Revolt in Iraq, but also concurrently with the Berber Revolt in Iberia and Maghreb, the Ibadi rebellion in Yemen and Hijaz, and the Third Fitna in the Levant, with the revolt of al-Harith ibn Surayj in Khurasan and Central Asia occurring concurrently with the revolution itself. The Abbasids spent their preparation time watching as the Umayyad Empire was besieged from within itself in all four cardinal directions, and School of Oriental and African Studies Professor Emeritus G. R. Hawting has asserted that even if the Umayyad rulers had been aware of the Abbasids' preparations, it would not have been possible to mobilize against them.|$|E
25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and leadout man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the leadout man finished in second <b>place</b> <b>right</b> behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime leadout man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish was definitely not giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a procedural error {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages did anything to dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E

500|$|Opponents {{of such a}} move {{surmised that}} the stadium was a [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] {{included}} in the blueprint to bypass planning rules, and that although the consortium described the larger development as enabling {{the construction of the}} stadium, the reverse was the case—Winkelman's consortium, they claimed, had to have a professional team in <b>place</b> <b>right</b> away to justify the ground so the development could get planning permission. David Conn of The Guardian corroborated this assessment. [...] "The whole project was indeed dependent on Asda and IKEA," [...] Conn summarised in a 2012 article, after interviewing Winkelman. [...] "Having seen the opportunity to build a stadium Milton Keynes lacked, and realised Asda did not have a store in the town, Winkelman acquired options to buy the land from its three owners, including the council. Asda would not have been granted planning permission for a huge out-of-town superstore unless it gave the council the benefit of building the stadium. [...] would move up, permission would be granted, then [...] would exercise the option to buy all the land, sell it to Asda and IKEA for very much more, and the difference would be used to build the stadium." [...] Conn retrospectively described this as a [...] "deal of a lifetime".|$|E

Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good <b>place</b> <b>right</b> now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{her next}} cruise, Independence had smooth sailing for about seven days when on 17 April she {{encountered}} the Mexican brigs-of-war Vencedor del Álamo and Libertador off {{the mouth of}} the Brazos River. The initial sighting of the two Mexican brigs was at about 5:30 am. Outgunned and outmanned, Independence fled up Brazos River for protection at the small riverside town of Velasco. The Mexican vessels pursued the Texans; eventually the two brigs came within cannon range several hours later at 9:30 am. Vincedor del Alamo of sixteen 8-pound guns and 140 men, sailed with Libertador of six 12-pound guns and one 18-pounder, crewed by about 100 men. [...] Independence of eight guns total, raised her colors followed by Libertador which then fired the first broadside that had no effect. Shortly afterward Independence fired a broadside with her weather battery of one 9-pound gun, three 6-pound guns, and one pivot gun. For two hours, Independence continued up Brazos River with the Mexican brigs in close pursuit, occasionally stopping to fire on each other. By 11:30 am the Texans had reached Velasco; Captain Wheelwright {{had no choice but to}} fight to the end, apparently not being able to continue up the Brazos River any further. The final engagement took <b>place</b> <b>right</b> in front of the small Texan town and populace, including the Texas Secretary of the Navy Samuel Rhoads Fisher. The Mexicans not being far behind came within range and Captain Wheelwright ordered his men to engage once more. The shots managed to damage the main top-gallant mast of the Libertador. After another broadside in Libertadors direction, two Mexicans lay dead and a few more were wounded aboard the brig-of-war. More shots damaged Libertadors foremast and knocked out one of her 12 pounders. However, these broadsides did not slow the Mexican ships; Libertador approached Independence head on while Vincedor del Alamo maneuvered around to Independences other side. The two brigs quickly came within pistol shots range and both fired a mixture of cannon projectiles. This is when a ball smashed through Independences quarter gallery wall and into the Texan captain, taking off three of his fingers on his right hand. Severely wounded and taken below, command of the schooner passed to Lieutenant John W. Taylor, who finished the last few moments of battle before receiving orders from Wheelwright to surrender. With this action, the battle was over.|$|E
