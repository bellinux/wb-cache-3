5|$|Manchester City {{reached the}} cup final again the {{following}} season, Barnes playing every match {{of the cup}} run. Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3–1, Barnes having {{a hand in the}} second goal.

5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27-yard line. On Tech's first <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six {{yards on}} the first play, then earned a first down at the 30-yard line on an option <b>play.</b> <b>After</b> an {{incomplete}} pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard throw to Still. Tech committed a false-start penalty on third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On the first <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.|$|E

5|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive was a seven-yard run by Stith. This was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Clark, but Alabama was called for pass interference during the <b>play.</b> <b>After</b> the penalty, Virginia Tech had a first down at the Alabama four-yard line. On the first <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the penalty, Stith broke through the Alabama defense for Tech's second touchdown of the quarter. The extra point was good, and with 5:09 remaining in the quarter, Tech extended its lead to 247.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming off}} the bench to record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, he ran for 106 yards and {{registered}} 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.|$|E

5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first <b>play</b> <b>after</b> the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119teams. The Hokies averaged just 296yards per game during the regular season, and during the ACC Championship Game—the last Tech game before the Orange Bowl—had created a season-low 234yards of offense. Starting left guard Nick Marshman was not expected to <b>play</b> <b>after</b> becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to <b>play.</b> <b>After</b> the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring’s omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham drew on his {{religious}} faith to persevere through the loss, believing that God {{had a reason}} for everything to happen.

Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls.|$|E

Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang).
