5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room.

5|$|Under his ownership, the Drawing Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} <b>painted</b> <b>and</b> then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully <b>painted,</b> <b>and</b> while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} {{he would be able to}} interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the only}} places {{physical}} crests are still seen are the chapels of Britain's orders of chivalry: the Order of the Garter's St George's Chapel, the Order of the Thistle's Thistle Chapel, and the Order of the Bath's Henry VII Chapel. Within each chapel are rows of stalls {{for use by}} the knights; above these stalls are placed each knight's sword and crested helm. These are carved out of lime wood and <b>painted</b> <b>and</b> gilded by Ian Brennan, the official sculptor to the royal household.|$|E

5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the <b>painted</b> <b>and</b> gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} catapults resembling windmills, {{that can}} fire rapidly, and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time.

The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue, to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{first port}} of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which Endeavour reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and <b>painted,</b> <b>and</b> fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. While in port, an {{accident}} cost the life of master's mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released. To replace him, Cook shanghaied a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.|$|E

5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly <b>painted,</b> <b>and</b> included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|The triad {{of images}} in the temple are of Jagannatha, personifying Lord Krishna, Balabhadra, His older brother, and Subhadra, His younger sister.

5|$|The wrought-iron fence {{along the}} church {{driveway}} {{was installed in}} April 1895, replacing a picket fence. In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present stained-glass windows were installed, its interior and woodwork were <b>painted,</b> <b>and</b> new lamps were installed for better illumination. The stained-glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark, New Jersey in memory of his father, who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and calcimine for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork. Anton Reymann of Wheeling, West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary's painting and decoration.|$|E
5|$|Women of the emperor's {{family were}} often {{depicted}} dressed as goddesses or divine personifications such as Pax ("Peace"). Portraiture in painting is represented {{primarily by the}} Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with the realistic painting techniques of the Empire. Marble portrait sculpture would have been <b>painted,</b> <b>and</b> while traces of paint have only rarely survived the centuries, the Fayum portraits indicate why ancient literary sources marvelled at how lifelike artistic representations could be.|$|E

Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
