40|$|Alameda Creek {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} streams in the San Francisco Bay Estuary that has the potential to regain a viable steelhead trout population (Oncorhynchus mykiss). While great effort is underway to remove large barriers throughout the watershed, lesser known are the impacts of smaller structures in the lower reaches. The objective of my study was to determine if a decommissioned rubber dam, a check dam, and a temporary sewage <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> impeded movement and/or created conditions that were unfavorable for outmigrating steelhead smolt during low flow periods. For the study I gathered data on temperature, depth, and channel form. The results showed that the rubber dam created inhospitable conditions of < 0. 1 ft depth and water temperature of 20 C in April across a 54 ft flat cement surface. Although the check dam and the sewage <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> were less restrictive for smolt passage, all of the structures created environments that increased the risk of smolt predation. These inhospitable conditions were likely exacerbated by low flows. Gauge data from the past 33 years showed that low flows are common throughout the smolt migration period of April in the lower reach of Alameda Creek; therefore indicating the conditions observed in this study were not uncommon. Overall, the results suggest that modification or complete removal of these structures is the most viable solution to improve smolt migration success during low flow periods...|$|E

30|$|The {{area of the}} 2015 {{eruption}} {{center is}} a location for hot spring production and comprises a complex pipeline system. Among the pipeline system, the largest water <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> under Stream L was found eroded and ruptured after the eruption. Since a temporary but significant decrease in artificial hot spring water {{coming down from the}} production area was observed by workers of the hot spring company at around 11 : 00 on June 29, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the mud flow and/or debris flow eroded Stream L to decrease the water supply at this time. Since the hot spring water coming down from the area completely halted until 15 : 00, the water pipe seems to have been broken until this time. We thus conclude that some liquid effusion process started before 11 : 00 and eroded the streambed significantly until 15 : 00.|$|E

In contrast to the other inactive landslides, the Manaihan landslide responded immediately to heavy rainfall events {{in the last two}} decades. This study aims to map its spatial extent and the dominant surface features; to measure surface displacement using GPS; to investigate subsurface structure with Cone penetration test (CPT) and corings; and to determine the depth of the shear surface by inclinometers. Results show a partial landslide reactivation. Surface velocities range between 20 and 40 cm/year and are strongly dependent on winter rainfall. CPT results give clear boundaries between the landslide mass and the undisturbed bedrock in the head scarp. Distinct shear surfaces have been determined with displacement rates up to 15. 8 mm in 21 days.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to analyze the {{enlargement}} of the district heating line located in Gävle, evaluating the hydraulic facilities and calculating the heat losses with different insulation thicknesses to choose the best insulation thickness for the pipes. To choose the best thickness, different insulation thicknesses have been evaluated calculating the heat losses for each insulation thickness. To manage the heat losses problem, the pipe length has been divided into three stretches, underground pipe, sea pipe and air pipe. These three stretches have different boundary conditions, and each stretch has been calculated separately. The best thermal solution is choosing the insulation of 0. 5 m of thickness, but the best thermal solution {{is not the best}} solution for this project due to the elevated cost of this thickness in one of the stretches of the line. The <b>pipe</b> <b>crossing</b> the seahas to be on the bottom and to keep the pipe on the bottom concrete is going to be added. The quantity of concrete needed depends on the floatability of the pipe and specifically depends on the insulation thickness. The insulation is a porous material and its density is very small, therefore it has a high floatability. The final selection is a multi-thickness insulation, with different insulation thicknesses in the different stretches, 0. 6 m of thickness in the underground and air pipe and 0. 3 m of thickness in the sea pipe. With this configuration the heat losses are quite close to the optimum case. The purpose in the hydraulic study has been quantifying the start pressure in the new line to fulfil the energy demand in the worst point of the line. With 320 kPa at the start of line, the pressure in the worst point is enough to fulfil the nowadays demand, 3 MW, and in the future when this line will be enlarged and the demand increased to 20 MW, the pressure {{at the start of the}} line to ensure the requested pressure of 250 kPa in the worst point should reach more than 380 kPa. Having such pressure is not recommended to avoid the pressure hammer and to build a new pumping station after the sea pipe is recommended...|$|E

Ultrasonic as well as magnetic nondestructive tests (NDT) have been performed in order to characterize the material state of a pipe segment loaded during service with high bending moments. The results were compared to corresponding test resulting obtained from reference material in the "as delivered state". The NDT have been performed prior to Charpy V toughness testing. The pipe segemtn was scanned in the circumferential direction but - depending on the sensor orientation - NDT - data were recorded in both circumferential and axial direction.
