5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired building boom that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this <b>period</b> <b>were</b> Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E

Some of the most popular players from this <b>period</b> <b>were</b> Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the <b>period</b> <b>were</b> ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E

5|$|By the New Kingdom, {{the ancient}} Egyptians had perfected {{the art of}} mummification; the best {{technique}} took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body {{in a mixture of}} salts called natron.

Mummies of the Late <b>Period</b> <b>were</b> also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases.
