5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll <b>process.</b> The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll <b>process</b> explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll <b>process</b> being less expensive than the Hunter <b>process.</b> To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll <b>process,</b> the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this <b>process,</b> the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere.

5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what <b>process</b> philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a <b>process</b> approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for <b>process</b> thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as <b>process</b> philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that <b>process</b> philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E
