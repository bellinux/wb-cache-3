40|$|In {{the general}} {{introductory}} {{part of this}} thesis (Chapters and 2) a review of some pertinent literature related to sleep-waking states and opioid peptides is offered. A global view of the neurochemical mechanisms and theories of functions of sleep, {{as well as the}} physiological and possible clinical consequences of total or selective REM sleep deprivation is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, which is concerned with the role of endogenous opioid peptides, particular attention is paid to the possible modulatory role of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of some behavioural states in physiological and pathological conditions. It is generally known that exogenously administered opiates and opioid peptides can alter sleep pattern and decrease REM sleep. A possible interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system is suggested by the report that the episodic release of plasma humoral endorphins during sleep is associated with the REM sleep phase (Chapter 1, section 1. 1. 7). In addition, the concentrations of opioid peptides in some brain nuclei of the rat which are known to be important in sleep-waking regulation, are highest in the dark (active) phase, during which wakefulness is high and lowest in the light (rest) phase, when the propensity to sleep is at its highest (Chapter section 1. 3. 2). Thus in order to clarify the effect of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of sleep-waking pattern, we studied the effects of phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of enkephalinase A on sleep-waking states (Chapter 3). Several clinical studies suggest that the sleep-waking cycle may modulate the occurence of some types of epileptic phenomena in human subjects (Chapter 1, section 1. 5. 2, iii). In addition, some studies indicate a similarity between enkephalin induced epileptic Therefore, phenomena and we studied <b>petit</b> the <b>mal</b> epilepsy effects of (Chapter 4 discussion). different sleep stages on enkephalin-induced epileptic phenomena using electrophysiological parameters (Chapter 4). These initial studies (Chapters 3 and 4) suggested an interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system. The observation that REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) reduced the pain threshold to noxious electrical stimulation (Chapter 1 section 1. 5. 2 d i) was an indication of the importance of REM sleep in the regulation of nociception. Therefore in Chapters 5 and 6, the experiments were designed to explore a direct effect of REMSD on the analgesic effects of morphine, an enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramdion and cold-water-swim. The profound antagonistic effect of REMSD on opiate/opioid peptide induced analgesia stimulated further interest to investigate the relationship between REMSD and other opiate/opioid peptide modulated behavioural phenomena. Therefore the following opioid modulated behaviours were investigated: akinetic-cataleptic syndrome, spontaneous vertical motor activity, convulsions, (Chapters 7 - 9). (Chapter 10) grooming, wet-dog-shakes and morphine withdrawal symptoms Additional experiments with nitrous oxide were performed since it is known that this anaesthetic agent can stimulate the release of endogenous enkephalins and induce opiate-like withdrawal symptoms (Chapter 2, section 2. 5. 2, iv). Finally, the possible clinical consequences of our findings are described in the relevant chapters...|$|R

This, if it exists, {{is the result of}} a faculty of {{undetermined}} nature, whereby knowledge of remote events may be acquired, not through normal channels of sense. As the Zulus say: 'Isiyezi is a state in which a man becomes slightly insensible. He is awake, but still sees things which he would not see if he were not in a state of ecstasy (nasiyesi).'[1] The Zulu description of isiyezi includes what is technically styled 'dissociation.' No psychologist or pathologist will deny that visions of an hallucinatory sort may occur in dissociated states, say in the <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> of epilepsy. The question, however, is whether any such visions convey actual information not otherwise to be acquired, beyond the reach of chance coincidence to explain.|$|E

Something like le <b>petit</b> <b>mal,</b> in epilepsy, seems to be intended, the patient 'stude as bereft of hir senssis'. {232b} Again, we have the official explanation of the second sight, and that is the spiritualistic explanation. The seer has a fairy 'control'. This mode of accounting for what 'gentle King Jamie' calls 'a sooth dreame, since they see it walking,' inspires the whole theory of Kirk (1691), but he sees no harm either in 'the phairie,' or in the persons whom the fairies control. In Kirk's own time we shall find another minister, Frazer of Tiree, explaining the visions as 'revived impressions of sense' (1705), and rejecting various superstitious hypotheses.|$|E

50|$|May {{was born}} the second of three {{children}} of Robert W. May and Katherine A. Armstrong on May 27, 1928 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was a Presbyterian (who later converted to Catholicism), but May was raised a Catholic by his mother.

When old enough, he entered the seminary and was sent to study philosophy followed by theology at The Catholic University of America. He was tonsured and received the minor orders of porter and acolyte. However, in 1952, because of a serious medical condition (diagnosed as <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> epilepsy), he took some time off from seminary studies to teach in DeAndreis High School in north St. Louis. After teaching for a year, he took his supposed epileptic condition as a sign from God that he should pursue another vocation. (Although he had been told that he had <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> epilepsy, and took medication and suffered seizures at times, he discovered in the late 1970s that the problem was not epilepsy, but was psychological in nature, and he experienced no seizures after 1977). He married Patricia Ann Keck on October 4, 1958. Together they raised seven children and now have many grandchildren. Because of his educational foundation, he found work as a book editor with various publishers from 1954 to 1970, until his teaching career began in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Disorders of {{consciousness}} are medical conditions that inhibit consciousness.

5000|$|The 1981 {{classification}} {{revised the}} 1970 ILAE system devised by Henri Gastaut. A {{significant difference was}} the distinction between simple and complex partial seizures. In the 1970 classification, the distinction was whether the symptoms involved elementary sensory or motor functions (simple) or whether [...] "higher functions" [...] were involved (complex).This was changed to consider whether consciousness was fully retained or not. As a result, studies that group patients according to these classifications are not directly comparable {{from one generation to}} another. The 1970 classification was important for standardising the modern terms for many seizure types. Prior to this, terms such as <b>petit</b> <b>mal,</b> grand mal, Jacksonian, psychomotor and temporal-lobe seizures were used.|$|E

5000|$|History of {{generalized}} epilepsy with absence seizures are {{dated to}} the eighteenth century, however {{the inventor of}} the electroencephalogram (EEG), Hans Berger, recorded the first EEG of an absence seizure in the 1920s, which led the way for the general notion of spike-and-wave electrophysiology. His first recording of a human EEG was made in 1924 using a galvanometer, but his results were very crude and showed small, undefined oscillations. He continued to refine his technique and increase the sensitivity to the galvanometer, in which he accumulated many EEGs of individuals with and without a brain malfunction or disorder. Among those tested were patients with epilepsy, dementia, and brain tumors. [...] Hans Berger published his findings in 1933, however his results did not give a definitive characterization of the general EEG pattern seen during an epileptic seizure. In 1935, F.A. Gibbs, H. Davis, and W.G. Lennox provided a clear description of EEG spike-and-wave patterns during a <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> epileptic seizure.
