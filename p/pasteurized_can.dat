5000|$|Pasteurization {{kills the}} {{botulism}} bacteria, {{but the possibility}} of hardy botulism spores surviving and reactivating once cool remains a concern as with many preserved foods, however processed. For that reason, Baldwin's treatise specifies precise chilling requirements for [...] "cook-chill", so that the botulism spores {{do not have the}} opportunity to grow or propagate. <b>Pasteurized</b> food <b>can</b> then be stored for up to two weeks at around 3 C sealed within the vacuum pack.|$|R
25|$|For some foods, {{health issues}} are {{important}} in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, <b>pasteurized</b> milk <b>can</b> remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.|$|R

40|$|Works on {{research}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties of polysaccharides taken from a sea grass zostera nana and fresh-water grass potamogeton perfoliatus, growing in reservoirs of the Volga river delta and in the territories of the Northern Caspian Sea: zosterat and rdestat ammonium. Their similarity to the traditional pectin from land plants (apple pectin) is shown. The aim of the research was to investigate the possibility of using pectin of higher aquatic plants of the Volga-Caspian basin as a stabilizer in the production of canned food like jam. The technology of jams from lemon has been approved and samples of canned food like jam with addition of zosterat ammonium, rdestat ammonium and apple pectin as stabilizers have been obtained. To determine the organoleptic, physical-chemical and microbiological indices {{of the quality of the}} studied objects the methods of State Standard 8756. 1, State Standard 26313 – 84, State Standard 26669 have been used. The laboratory experiments showed that by organoleptic and physical and chemical indicators jams with addition of zosterat and rdestat ammonium completely correspond to the indicators of the quality required for the premium jams of State Standard, extended to the jam made of mashed fruits and berries with addition or without addition of pectin. The chemical composition of lemon marmalade is represented mainly by simple carbohydrates (42 %) and hydrolyzable polysaccharides (7. 44 – 7. 99 %) and proteins content of which is almost the same in all three kinds of the studied jams – 9. 63 %. Acidity of the made marmalade was 2. 3 – 2. 4 %, which meets the requirements of the above standard. Besides, microbiological indicators of the quality of the studied objects which met the requirements of industrial sterility for the fruit and fruit-berry <b>pasteurized</b> <b>canned</b> products have been defined...|$|R
50|$|The HMBANA Guidelines {{stipulate}} that donors not {{be paid for}} their milk. However, hospitals and recipients are required to cover some of the cost for collection, processing and distribution of milk which may be from $3.00 to $5.00 an ounce. This remains a much lower cost than <b>pasteurized</b> milk <b>can</b> be obtained otherwise. Community fundraising and grants also help milk banks meet expenses. The guidelines ensure {{that no one is}} denied donor milk for lack of ability to pay. For non-hospitalized recipients, the milk bank will often work with the family to obtain coverage for processing fees (Arnold, 1997). However, insurance companies rarely cover donor milk, except under unusual circumstances (Griffith, 2002). In some states, and under some circumstances, Medicaid and WIC will cover the costs of using banked milk (Arnold, 1999, Wight, 2001).|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of investigations, the {{structural}} changes in proteins were established, which {{were associated with the}} preliminary treatment of meat ingredients, a pH level of the system and parameters of thermal treatment. The pasteurization regimes allowed retaining a protein nitrogen proportion up to 94 % by the end of canned food storage duration. Upon sterilization, the losses in protein nitrogen were two times higher. A negative eﬀect of more acidic sauce on preservation of the protein nitrogen fraction in canned foods was established. An accumulation of the peptide nitrogen fraction in the canned foods in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization was two times more intensive. In the sterilized canned foods, the processes of accumulation of the low molecular weight nitrogenous compounds were more intensive, which suggests a depth of destruction of the protein and peptide nitrogen fraction. It was shown that an accumulation of amino-ammonia nitrogen during canned food storage was on average 12. 4 % irrespective of the pH value in the used sauces and the type of thermal treatment. A shiﬅ in the pH value of the canned foods toward the acid side upon pasteurization was noticed. With that, a degree of the shiﬅ in the canned foods in tomato sauce was 2. 5 times higher than the pH value of the canned foods in sour cream sauce. When sterilizing canned foods, another dynamics of the pH values was observed: a pH value declined by 0. 39 units in the canned foods in tomato sauce and grew by 0. 22 units in the canned foods in sour cream sauce. During storage, the tendency of more intense pH decline was revealed for the canned foods in tomato sauce aﬅer pasteurization compared to the canned foods aﬅer sterilization. Another character of the pH value dynamics was found in the canned foods in sour cream sauce: an insigniﬁcant increase (by 0. 7 %) of the pH value in the <b>pasteurized</b> <b>canned</b> foods and a signiﬁcant decrease (by 8. 4 %) in the sterilized canned foods were observed by the end of storage. </p...|$|R

Chocolate milk should be refrigerated like unflavored milk, {{with the exception of}} some ultra high temperature (UHT) <b>pasteurized</b> drinks, which <b>can</b> be stored at room temperature. Chocolate milk was first created by Hans Sloane in Ireland during the late 1700s, and is generally served cold.The nutritional qualities of chocolate milk are the subject of debate: while some studies criticize the high sugar content of chocolate milk, other studies suggest that chocolate milk is nutritionally superior to white milk.|$|R
40|$|THE large {{commercial}} losses {{caused by}} condemnation of spoiled consignments,-L complaints from consumers {{about the quality}} of outwardly sound material, and the identification of a &dquo; <b>pasteurized</b> &dquo; <b>can</b> of ham as the cause of an outbreak of sal-monella food poisoning (Wildman, Nicol & Tee, 1951) have lately aroused considerable interest in Britain in the bacteriology of this product. Consequently, we have tried in this paper to review results obtained, in Britain, from the bacteriological examination of samples representing practically all the major producing countries outside America. Three separate, and rather different, investigations are here reported: (i) A routine examination of good commercial consignments, made to check general suitability for consumption, with particular emphasis on detection of faecal pollution and potential pathogens. (ii) A general investigation, on both sound and spoiled material, of the safety of such ham for human consumption, including a careful search for all potentially pathogenic types of bacteria of intestinal significance. (iii) A more thorough survey on a correspondingly smaller number of samples, from a chiefly ecological view-point, of the numbers and species of micro-organisms present in spoiled material. These groups of observations will be described separately, but they can best be understood if related to the normal flora of hams before canning which we shall first consider briefly...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteriological}} spoilage {{characteristics of}} a <b>canned,</b> <b>pasteurized</b> crab cake mix product stored at various temperatures were investigated. A large number of bacteria, both mesophilic and psychrophilic, survived the pasteurization process. Bacillus and Micrococcus were found to predominate when the product was stored at 30 C (86 F) and 18 C (64 F), whereas Alcaligenes predominated at 2 C (36 F). The product {{was found to be}} free of Escherichia coli. Bacterial counts, trimethylamine nitrogen, volatile reducing substances, and ammonia determinations were evaluated as indices of quality for the product. Close correlation was observed between bacterial counts, volatile reducing substance values, and organoleptic tests when the product was stored at 30 C (86 F). The shelf-life of the product was approximately 6 months at 2 C (36 F), 4 days at 18 C (64 F), and 27 hr at 30 C (86 F) ...|$|R
50|$|The patient {{typically}} {{already has}} a history of atopy and an atopic family history. Eczema, otolaryngeal symptoms of hay fever or asthma will often dominate leading to the food allergy being unsuspected. Often well-cooked, <b>canned,</b> <b>pasteurized,</b> or frozen food offenders cause little to no reaction due to denaturation of the cross-reacting proteins, causing delay and confusion in diagnosis as the symptoms are elicited only to the raw or fully ripened fresh foods. Correct diagnosis of the allergen types involved is critical. OAS sufferers may be allergic to more than just pollen. Oral reactions to food are often mistakenly self-diagnosed by patients as caused by pesticides or other contaminants. Other reactions to food—such as lactose intolerance and intolerances which result from a patient being unable to metabolize naturally occurring chemicals (e.g., salicylates and proteins) in food—need to be distinguished from the systemic symptoms of OAS.|$|R
40|$|Candida apicola and Aspergillus niger strains were {{isolated}} and identified from Deglet-Nour dates, and their loads were determined on the fruit surface. The thermal inactivation of their spores was evaluated between 42 and 70 C. The estimated D values for C. apicola and A. niger were D 50 = 2. 3 ± 0. 4 min and D 50 = 22. 1 ± 2. 1 min, respectively. The zT values obtained were 9. 4 ± 2. 6 and 9. 6 ± 1. 0 C for C. apicola and A. niger, respectively. The experimental survival spores obtained {{on the date}} surface during non-isothermal treatment were compared with the simulated data based on the Bigelow method and on pasteurization value calculations. C. apicola and A. niger spores can be inactivated by relatively low temperatures.

40|$|A {{survey on}} the time-temperature {{conditions}} of pasteurized milk in Greece during transportation to retail, retail storage, and domestic storage and handling was performed. The data {{derived from the}} survey were described with appropriate probability distributions and introduced into a growth model of Listeria monocytogenes in pasteurized milk which was appropriately modified for taking into account strain variability. Based on the above components, a probabilistic model was applied to evaluate the growth of L. monocytogenes during the chill chain of pasteurized milk using a Monte Carlo simulation. The model predicted that, in 44. 8 % of the milk cartons released in the market, the pathogen will grow until the time of consumption. For these products the estimated mean total growth of L. monocytogenes during transportation, retail storage, and domestic storage was 0. 93 log CFU, with 95 th and 99 th percentiles of 2. 68 and 4. 01 log CFU, respectively. Although based on EU regulation 2073 / 2005 pasteurized milk produced in Greece belongs to the category of products that do not allow the growth of L. monocytogenes due to a shelf life (defined by law) of 5 days, the above results show that this shelf life limit cannot prevent L. monocytogenes from growing under the current chill chain conditions. The predicted percentage of milk cartons—initially contaminated with 1 cell/ 1 -liter carton—in which the pathogen exceeds the safety criterion of 100 cells/ml {{at the time of}} consumption was 0. 14 %. The probabilistic model was used for an importance analysis of the chill chain factors, using rank order correlation, while selected intervention and shelf life increase scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that simple interventions, such as excluding the door shelf from the domestic storage of <b>pasteurized</b> milk, <b>can</b> effectively reduce the growth of the pathogen. The door shelf was found to be the warmest position in domestic refrigerators, and it was most frequently used by the consumers for domestic storage of pasteurized milk. Furthermore, the model predicted that a combination of this intervention with a decrease of the mean temperature of domestic refrigerators by 2 °C may allow an extension of pasteurized milk shelf life from 5 to 7 days without affecting the current consumer exposure to L. monocytogenes...|$|R
40|$|When own mother's milk falls short, pasteurized human donor milk is {{recommended}} as alternative feeding for preterm infants. Donor milk has {{to meet the}} highest safety standards, but its processing and storage is expensive. The recommended storage time of pasteurized donor milk is three months. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if the frozen storage time of <b>pasteurized</b> donor milk <b>can</b> be extended beyond 3 months without compromising its safety and quality. For this prospective observational study breast-milk samples of 34 unique women, collected between November 2014 and June 2015, were provided by the Dutch Human Milk Bank. Samples were Holder pasteurized within 3 months after expression and stored at - 20  °C. Analysis of both bacterial growth (by inoculation of milk on a blood and a cysteine-, carbohydrate-, and electrolyte-deficient agar) and fat, crude protein, carbohydrate and energy content of milk (analyzed by infrared spectroscopy) was done monthly during the first six months and every two months thereafter, up to one year post-pasteurization. 30 of 306 (9. 8 %) follow-up samples showed bacterial growth when cultured. None of the samples showed sequential contamination with the same strain up to eight months of frozen storage. No significant decreases in macronutrients and energy content were observed over eight months. Pasteurized human donor milk can be stored safely for eight months at - 20  °C, without compromising its macronutrient and energy content. This longer storage time will reduce disposal of expired donor milk and subsequently reduce cost...|$|R
40|$|Mother’s own milk is {{the ideal}} infant food for optimal {{nutrition}} and growth. When not available, <b>pasteurized</b> donor milk <b>can</b> be administered. Pasteurization has structural and biochemical consequences on term milk digestion 1, 2. Whether similar results would be observed for preterm milk remains unknown and was thus the aim of our study. An in vitro dynamic system was used to simulate digestion. Preterm human milk (n = 5 donors) was digested using preterm infant digestive parameters while for term milk (n = 5 donors), term infant digestive parameters were employed 3, 4. Each type of milk was digested as raw or pasteurized (62. 5 °C, 30 min) in triplicate. Digesta were sampled regularly in the gastric compartment (over 90 or 120 min for preterm or term milk, respectively) and over 180 min in the intestinal compartment. Structural changes were evaluated by confocal microscopy and laser light scattering. Proteolysis was followed by SDS-PAGE submitted to densitometry and by quantitative peptide analysis using tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography. Lipolysis was evaluated by gas chromatography and thin layer chromatography fitted to flame ionisation detector. Lipolysis degree was in overall significantly lower in pasteurized than in raw milk in both preterm and term conditions, but {{the extent of the}} difference was lower for the preterm (- 23 %) than for the term (- 35 %) condition. Gastric proteolysis was somewhat lower in the preterm than in the term milk. The impact of pasteurization on gastric proteolysis differed according to the protein structure with β-casein being hydrolysed significantly slower and lactoferrin being hydrolysed significantly faster in term pasteurized milk compared to term raw milk. This was not statistically significant in preterm milk. Similarly, the peptidome differed between raw and pasteurized milk to a lesser extent in the preterm than in the term condition. In both preterm and term conditions, pasteurization impacted the protein susceptibility to acid aggregation during digestion. These results demonstrate that pasteurization had a lower impact on digestion of preterm milk compared to term milk. Such results have to be confirmed by in vivo studies...|$|R
