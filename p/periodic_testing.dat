25|$|Legionella is a {{parasite}} of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine.

Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and <b>periodic</b> <b>testing</b> in suspect areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{high rate}} of STDs in the pornographic film {{industry}} started to change in 1998 when major pornographic film producers started implementing a regular <b>periodic</b> <b>testing</b> program for pornographic film actors. In the 1980s, there was an outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the pornographic film industry {{and a number of}} deaths of actors and this {{led to the creation of}} the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation (AIM), which helped set up a voluntary standard in the United States pornographic film industry where pornographic film actors are tested for HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea every 30 days, and hepatitis, syphilis and HSV twice a year. AIM claims that this program has reduced the rate of STDs among pornographic film actors to 20% that of the general population. These claims have been criticized by various public health authorities.|$|E
