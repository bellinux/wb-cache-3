5|$|In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union {{experienced}} the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the two superpowers {{to the edge}} of nuclear war and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated rapprochement. After years of dormant or lethargic negotiations, American and British negotiators subsequently forged a strong working relationship and with Soviet negotiators found common ground on test restrictions later in 1962. After years of pursuing a comprehensive ban, Khrushchev was convinced to accept a <b>partial</b> <b>ban,</b> partly due to the efforts of Soviet nuclear scientists, including Kurchatov, Sakharov, and Yulii Borisovich Khariton, who argued that atmospheric testing had severe consequences for human health. Khrushchev had been concerned by a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> due to the greater US experience in underground tests; by 1962, the US had conducted 89 such tests and the Soviet Union just two (the Soviet focus had been on cheaper, larger-yield atmospheric tests). For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities. Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Geneva Conference {{began in the}} fall of 1958, Eisenhower faced renewed {{domestic}} opposition to a comprehensive test ban as Senator Albert Gore Sr. argued in a widely circulated letter that a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> would preferable due to Soviet opposition to strong verification measures.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or <b>partial</b> <b>ban.</b> In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the success}} of Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 federal election, and through the {{successive}} governments of Pierre Trudeau, the federal cabinet commuted all death sentences {{as a matter of}} policy. Hence, the de facto abolition of the death penalty in Canada occurred in 1963. On November 30, 1967, Bill C-168 was passed creating a five-year moratorium {{on the use of the}} death penalty, except for murders of police and corrections officers. On January 26, 1973, after the expiration of the five-year experiment, the Solicitor General of Canada continued the <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> on capital punishment, which would eventually lead to the abolition of capital punishment. On July 14, 1976, Bill C-84 was passed by a narrow margin of 130:124 in a free vote, resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain offences under the National Defence Act. These were removed in 1998.|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} in Moscow {{following}} the agreement, Khrushchev declared that the treaty would not end the arms race and by itself could not [...] "avert the danger of war," [...] and reiterated his proposal of a NATO-Warsaw Pact non-aggression accord. For Khrushchev, the test ban negotiations had long been a means of improving the Soviet Union's global image and reducing strain in relations with the West. There are also some indications that military experts within the Soviet Union saw a test ban {{as a way to}} restrict US development of tactical nuclear weapons, which could have increased US willingness to deploy small nuclear weapons on battlefields while circumventing the Soviet nuclear deterrent. Concern that a comprehensive ban would retard modernization of the Soviet arsenal may have pushed Khrushchev towards a <b>partial</b> <b>ban.</b> Counteracting the move towards a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> was Khrushchev's interest in reducing spending on testing, as underground testing was more expensive than the atmospheric tests the Soviet Union had been conducting; Khrushchev preferred a comprehensive ban as it would have eliminated the cost of testing entirely. Furthermore, there was internal concern about nuclear proliferation, particularly regarding the prospect of France and China crossing the threshold and the possibility of a multilateral NATO nuclear force, which was seen as a step towards West Germany acquiring nuclear weapons (the first Soviet test ban proposal in 1955 was made in the same month than West Germany joined NATO).|$|E
500|$|In Europe, the {{interaction}} of the phenomenon of [...] "dying bees" [...] with imidacloprid has been discussed for quite some time. A study from the [...] "Comité Scientifique et Technique (CST)" [...] {{was at the center of}} discussion, and led to a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> of imidacloprid in France. The imidacloprid pesticide Gaucho was banned in 1999 by the French Minister of Agriculture Jean Glavany, primarily due to concern over potential effects on honey bees. Subsequently, when fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide and in Europe mainly labeled [...] "Regent", was used as a replacement, it was also found to be toxic to bees, and banned partially in France in 2004.|$|E

500|$|On 2 July 1963, Khrushchev {{proposed}} a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> on {{tests in the}} atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, which would avoid the contentious issue of detecting underground tests. Notably, Khrushchev did not link this proposal to a moratorium on underground tests (as had been proposed earlier), but said it should {{be followed by a}} non-aggression pact between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. [...] "A test ban agreement combined with the signing of a non-aggression pact between the two groups of state will create a fresh international climate more favorable for a solution of the major problems of our time, including disarmament," [...] Khrushchev said.|$|E
500|$|Bostonian John Adams, {{known as}} the [...] "Atlas of Independence", was an {{important}} figure in both the struggle for independence {{as well as the}} formation of the new United States. Adams was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing of the Constitution of Massachusetts in 1780 which, in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases, effectively made Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal rights and, as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William Cushing, abolished slavery. David McCullough points out that an equally important feature was its placing {{for the first time the}} courts as a co-equal branch separate from the executive. (The Constitution of Vermont, adopted in 1777, represented the first <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> on slavery. Vermont became a state in 1791 but did not fully ban slavery until 1858 with the Vermont Personal Liberty Law. The Pennsylvania Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 made Pennsylvania the first state to abolish slavery by statute.) Later, Adams was active in early American foreign affairs and succeeded Washington as the second United States President. His son John Quincy Adams, also from Massachusetts, would go on to become the sixth United States President.|$|E
500|$|Progress {{was further}} {{complicated}} in early 1963, {{as a group}} in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded {{in favor of the}} Geneva System. On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and Thomas J. Dodd, introduced a resolution calling for Kennedy to propose another <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> to the Soviet Union involving national monitoring and no on-site inspections. Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to [...] "pursue it with vigor, seeking the widest possible international support" [...] while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban. That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent antinuclear activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, he still was set on achieving a test ban. In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as [...] "the greatest possible danger and hazard." ...|$|E

It was formed in 1983 when divisions, dissipation of meagre resources {{and the lack of}} a credible, united evangelical voice became acutely noticed when certain constraints developed in the country. These constraints included the <b>partial</b> <b>banning</b> of Malay translation of the Bible, the limiting of the number of sites for worship which affected the status of independent churches and the outlawing of public gatherings of five or more people.|$|R
2500|$|To {{reduce the}} {{biological}} {{growth of the}} Polish people, a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> of marriage was introduced; Polish women were allowed to marry only {{at the age of}} 25 and men at the age of 28.

Fishing catches had declined by 91% between [...] 1953 and 1957. The Kumamoto prefectural government issued a <b>partial</b> <b>ban</b> on the sale of fish caught in the heavily polluted Minamata Bay, but not an all-out ban, which would have legally obliged it to compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on 6 August and 12 August, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor Todomu Nakamura to mediate between the two sides, but this committee was stacked heavily in the company's favour. On 29 August, the fishing cooperative agreed to the mediation committee's proposal, stating: [...] "In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept". The company paid the cooperative ¥20 million (US$183,477) and set up a ¥15 million ($137,608) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.|$|E

2500|$|As Health Secretary, Hewitt lobbied {{hard for}} a {{complete}} ban on smoking in public places, which came into force on 1 July 2007. Her predecessor, John Reid had been in favour of limiting the Government's proposed smoking ban as much as possible, and Labour's 2005 election manifesto had included only a limited pledge, proposing to only ban smoking in places where food was served. Even {{though he had been}} moved to Secretary of State for Defence, Reid was the main opponent of her proposals, and a leading figure in the decision of the Cabinet to grant an exemption for private clubs and pubs that did not serve food. However, the exemption in the Cabinet proposals did not find favour with MPs and the Government gave them a free vote on the issue. Hewitt voted with the rebels to defeat the Cabinet's <b>partial</b> <b>ban,</b> which was replaced by the outright ban which she had always wanted. Sir Liam Donaldson described the ban as [...] "a momentous move which would prevent the deaths of both smokers and non-smokers."

40|$|Background: Daily smokers {{are thought}} to strive to {{maintain}} blood nicotine levels above a certain threshold. Workplace smoking bans pose a substantial barrier to nicotine maintenance. Individuals may compensate for time spent in smoking-restricted environments by smoking more before (“anticipatory”) or after work (“make-up” compensation), but {{this has not been}} quantitatively examined. Methods: 124 smokers documented smoking occasions over 3 weeks using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and provided information on nicotine dependence and stringency of workplace smoking policy (full, <b>partial,</b> or no <b>bans).</b> Hierarchical linear modeling examined effects of workplace policy, time of day block, and weekday vs weekend on mean cigarettes per hour (CPH) and simulated nicotine levels based upon EMA smoking data. Nicotine levels were assessed relative to two subject-specific standards of comparison: 1) “optimal maintenance,” levels achieved through evenly-spaced smoking (ΔEvenNL); and 2) “preferred” nicotine levels achieved at comparable times on weekends (%WeekendNL). Moderating effects of dependence, nicotine clearance rate, and home smoking restrictions were examined. Results: Individuals were most likely to change locations to smoke during work hours, regardless of work policy, and frequency of EMA reports of restrictions at work was associated with increased likelihood of changing locations to smoke (OR= 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 08 – 1. 21; p= 0. 0002). Workplace smoking policy, time block, and weekday/weekend interacted to predict CPH (p< 0. 01), and %WeekendNL (policy*time on weekdays, p< 0. 05), such that individuals with <b>partial</b> work <b>bans</b> –but not those with full bans - smoked more and had higher nicotine levels at Night (9 pm – bed) on weekdays compared to weekends. There was little evidence for interference with nicotine maintenance, although individuals with full or <b>partial</b> <b>bans</b> demonstrated more frequent low-nicotine (< 50 %WeekendNL) ‘trough’ events (p= 0. 04). Conclusion: Smokers may largely compensate for exposure to workplace smoking bans by escaping restrictions. However, full bans may suppress smoking even after they are lifted, perhaps by extinguishing stimulus associations or denormalization of smoking, whereas <b>partial</b> <b>bans</b> may not have these effects. This may suggest a stronger role for contextual factors in driving temporal variations in smoking. There was little evidence of true compensatory smoking to maintain nicotine levels in the face of smoking restrictions...|$|R
