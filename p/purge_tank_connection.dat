In order to identify suitable solutions for application in residential solar domestic hot water (SDHW) PV-T systems, a comparative analysis of known overheating prevention and stagnation handling measures was conducted and dynamic simulations were used to support the analysis. While no measure was found to comply with all desirable goals including reliability, implementation and operation costs, integral venting mechanisms were identified as the most promising among the control systems reviewed.

The first scenario consisted in opening valves to connect subsystems: it increased the flow rate at taps of large supply more so than at taps of low supply. This scenario was not recommended because it would quickly drain parts of the water supply. The second scenario consisted in adding connecting pipes between subsystems of high pressure and those of low pressure. It was recommended because it would increase the flow rate of low and medium supply taps. For the third scenario, areas of the camp without easy access to water were defined by using the result of mapping the current system and the population distribution in a Graphical Information System software. (cont.) These new taps were successful in providing water to these areas without significantly affecting the rest of the system. An additional recommendation for increasing the water supply in the camp was found from analyzing tank level: because tanks would not drain {{by the end of the}} distribution period, it was recommended that the period of water supply be increased from 3 hour periods to 4 1 / 2 hours.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 125 - 128) Engineering can {{be described}} as the real world application of theoretical concepts; it is the will of an engineer to form a practical means to accomplish the application of such concepts. This study sought to put engineering application to the test by designing, constructing, and testing an apparatus that would implement a concept envisioned by individuals in industry and ultimately prove its feasibility. Pratt & Whitney, Rocketdyne originated the idea for the concept studied here and much of the problem statement and conditions comes from them. The concept analyzed was the notion of using a specific fluid close to its critical point and, through the use of excess thermal energy, vaporize the fluid to create a distinguishable and maintainable constant pressure vapor flow. This type of flow is commonly used to <b>purge</b> fuel <b>tanks</b> in propulsion systems, and is typically supplied by high pressure helium flowing through a mechanical pressure regulator. The new concept would control the supplied vapor pressure by controlling the temperature of a liquid-vapor mixture. Rocketdyne defines ???excess thermal??? energy as extra heat energy simply being wasted by being expelled to the surroundings, which is not unusual for propulsion systems. The goal of the experiments was to see if this high pressure vapor could purge a secondary fluid at a constant rate, i. e. the flow rates of both fluids and the pressure of the high pressure vapor could be constant over an appropriate time interval. Fundamental thermal-fluids equations were used to design the experimental apparatus. The Bernoulli equation was used to choose orifice sizes that would produce flow rates in a desired range. A first law of thermodynamics analysis of the vaporization process in the working fluid tank was used to estimate the necessary heat transfer rate to produce a steady vapor flow. Heat transfer correlations for boiling heat transfer were used to predict the temperature (and pressure) drop in the tank to produce the necessary heat rate. This study picked up where a previous CSUN student, Levon Gevorkyan, left off in determining appropriate fluids {{that could be used to}} prove this concept. For these experiments, carbon dioxide was chosen for its desirable density ratio at easily producible temperatures, its availability, and its low toxicity. The design of the experimental apparatus involved sizing the physical system, constructing the system, testing the system, and completing post data collection analysis. This study was deemed a success based on the fact that a working fluid was selected and used in a system that showed that steady conditions were created within a certain range of operable flow rates. Only the lowest flow rates tested were capable of producing steady conditions. It is recommended that further testing be completed at lower flow rates to more completely define the relationship between flow rate and accurate pressure control...|$|R

Between the hole and the edge of the pellet, a cut was mechanically filed out with a bridge inside it connecting the superconducting ring. A scheme of the magnetometer is presented. The resonant frequency shift of the <b>tank</b> circuit, the <b>connection</b> of the squid with this circuit, and the squid inductance are evaluated. One of the most interesting fields of the squid-based magnetometer application is biomagnetism, particularly, the human heart magnetocardiogram measuring. The low-temperature squids were used in this area and many interesting and important scientific results have been obtained. The observations have shown that the main noise contribution was not due to the squid but to the Earth's magnetic field variations, industrial inductions, and mainly to the vibrations caused by liquid nitrogen boiling and by vibrations of the box. Further attempts are needed to reduce the magnetic noise inductions. Nevertheless, the estimations promise the maximum signal/noise relation of the high-T(sub c) squid-magnetocardiometer to be not less than 10 : 1 in a bandwidth of 60 Hz. Apparently, such resolution would be enough not only for steady cardiogram reading but even for thin structure investigation at average technique application...|$|R
40|$|Multi-element {{unstructured}} CFD {{has been}} utilized at NASA SSC {{to carry out}} analyses of propellant tank systems in different modes of operation. The three regimes of interest at SSC include (a) tank chill down (b) tank pressurization and (c) runtime propellant draw-down and <b>purge.</b> While <b>tank</b> chill down is an important event that is best addressed with long time-scale heat transfer calculations, CFD can {{play a critical role}} in the tank pressurization and runtime modes of operation. In these situations, problems with contamination of the propellant by inclusion of the pressurant gas from the ullage causes a deterioration of the quality of the propellant delivered to the test article. CFD can be used to help quantify the mixing and propellant degradation. During tank pressurization under some circumstances, rapid mixing of relatively warm pressurant gas with cryogenic propellant can lead to rapid densification of the gas and loss of pressure in the tank. This phenomenon can cause serious problems during testing because of the resulting decrease in propellant flow rate. With proper physical models implemented, CFD can model the coupling between the propellant and pressurant including heat transfer and phase change effects and accurately capture the complex physics in the evolving flowfields. This holds the promise of allowing the specification of operational conditions and procedures that could minimize the undesirable mixing and heat transfer inherent in propellant tank operation. It should be noted that traditional CFD modeling is inadequate for such simulations because the fluids in the tank are in a range of different sub-critical and supercritical states and elaborate phase change and mixing rules have to be developed to accurately model the interaction between the ullage gas and the propellant. We show a typical run-time simulation of a spherical propellant tank, containing RP- 1 in this case, being pressurized with room-temperature nitrogen at 540 R. Nitrogen, shown in blue on the right-hand side of the figures, enters the tank from the diffuser at the top of the figures and impinges on the RP- 1, shown in red, while the propellant is being continuously drained at the rate of 1050 lbs/sec through a pipe at the bottom of the tank. The sequence of frames in Figure 1 shows the resultant velocity fields and mixing between nitrogen and RP- 1 in a cross-section of the tank at different times. A vortex is seen to form in the incoming nitrogen stream that tends to entrain propellant, mixing it with the pressurant gas. The RP- 1 mass fraction contours in Figure 1 are also indicative of the level of mixing and contamination of the propellant. The simulation is used to track the propagation of the pure propellant front as it is drawn toward the exit with the evolution of the mixing processes in the tank. The CFD simulation modeled a total of 10 seconds of run time. As is seen from Figure 1 d, after 5. 65 seconds the propellant front is nearing the drain pipe, especially near the center of the tank. Behind this pure propellant front is a mixed fluid of compromised quality that would require the test to end when it reaches the exit pipe. Such unsteady simulations provide an estimate of the time that a high-quality propellant supply to the test article can be guaranteed at the modeled mass flow rate. In the final paper, we will discuss simulations of the LOX and propellant tanks at NASA SSC being pressurized by an inert ullage. Detailed comparisons will be made between the CFD simulations and lower order models as well as with test data. Conditions leading to cryo collapse in the tank will also be identified...|$|R
