Peristaltic {{transport}} of two fluid model with micropolar fluid {{in the core}} region and Newtonian fluid in the peripheral layer is studied under the assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The linearised equations governing the flow are solved and closed form expressions for <b>pressure</b> <b>rise,</b> <b>time</b> averaged flux and frictional force have been obtained. The effects of various parameters on these flow variables have been studied. It is found that the pressure rise increases with micropolar parameter (m) and central mean radius (η), but decreases with coupling number (N) and viscosity ratio (µ̄).

40|$|The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) {{system has}} been a subject of {{research}} {{in the last few years}} due to its utility in various high power electromagnetic applications. Due to its simplicity in design and fabrication, the Half Impulse Radiating Antenna (HIRA) based UWB system has attracted many researchers. Effectiveness of a UWB system, in terms of the bandwidth of the radiated pulse depends on the duration of the radiated field which is typically of sub nanosecond regime. This duration in turn depends on the closure time of the switch used in the UWB pulsed power source. This paper presents the work carried out on the pressurised gas switch of a 50 kV pulsed power system of a HIRA based UWB system. The aim of the present work is to establish the relationship between the pulser switch breakdown voltage and gas <b>pressure,</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> and gas pressure as well as the dependency of the Pulse Repetition Rate (PRR) on the switch breakdown voltage...|$|E

40|$|Slender {{cylindrical}} members {{form the}} major components {{of many of}} the coastal and offshore structures. These members are frequently subjected to breaking wave impact which often resulted in damages and failure of structures. In order to overcome this intricacy, it is essential to understand the physics of the breaking wave impact on offshore structural members and the resulting induced critical stresses. An experimental investigation has been carried out to measure the effect of breaking wave impact on a slender vertical cylinder. Simultaneous qualitative visual observations and quantitative pressure measurements were made to appreciate the impact induced effect. The induced impact pressure on the cylinder varies with the intensity of wave breaking and the relative location of the cylinder. The impact pressure is maximum when the wave profile reaches its maximum steepness just before the crest destabilization. Impact pressure observed due to a severe plunging wave is about nine times higher than due to spilling.

40|$|Many of {{the coastal}} and {{offshore}} structures consist of slender cylindrical member as the fundamental component. Since the structural damages and failures are catastrophic under wave impact, {{it is essential to}} understand the influence of breaking wave impact on the structural members. Past literature dictates that the magnitude of impact pressures is of the order of ten times more than the non breaking wave induced pressure. The standard codal provisions for the structural design of those members under breaking wave impact are scarce. In the present study, an experimental investigation has been carried out to measure the response of the slender vertical cylinder under breaking waves. Acceleration measurements were made under the incidence of breaking waves of different intensities varying from Plunging to Spilling. Deflections are found out from the measured acceleration. The maximum acceleration observed under severe plunging event is 0. 5 times that of moderate plunging event, the deflection induced by the moderate plunging is two order higher than that of severe plunging. Acceleration is maximum not only above still water level (SWL) but also lies in the impact zone. Hence moderate plunging events with higher impulse and larger <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> is crucial in the design of offshore and coastal structural member under breaking wave impact load...|$|E

A set of measurement was carried out with elderly cardiac surgery patients. The experiments comprised two to five measurements per patient, each including a one-minute follow-up, after which the cuff was slowly inflated over the systolic blood pressure. Systolic pressure errors were defined and correlations with other specific values, like <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time,</b> pulse wave velocity, systolic pressure, augmentation, arm circumference and body mass index were calculated. These indices may be affected by arterial stiffness, a common source of errors in blood pressure measurements. With a value of – 0. 52, the character which correlated best with systolic error {{was found to be}} the peak level of the first derivative of the pressure signal. Also rise time (10 %… 90 %) exhibits a moderate correlation, + 0. 49. On the other hand, pulse wave velocity, body mass index, cardiac output, peripheral and intra-arterial temperature do not seem to correlate with systolic blood pressure error. It is also noteworthy that indices describing the rising edge of the pressure pulse correlated better with systolic pressure error than those describing the falling part.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 797 on 14. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) In {{order to determine}} the effects of aeration on wave impacts, both model scale and field measurement of pressure and aeration were conducted over a period of three years. Aeration quantification techniques deployed in laboratory experiments included fluid impedance measurement which were also used in the field and acoustic methods. The most common form of impact observed was due to hydrostatic pressure variation, referred to as Class I impacts in the text. Apart from this, two distinct impact classifications have been identified. The first of these classifications is referred to as Class 11 impacts in the text and arises due to water wave action. Two discrete categories occur within Class II impacts: compression waves and shock waves. Compression type impacts have long <b>rise</b> <b>times,</b> typically hundreds of milliseconds, and are produced by waves which tend to have much lower impact velocities and present much larger contact angles upon impact. These waves tend to be spilling breakers which may transport much entrained air due to interfacial turbulence. <b>Rise</b> <b>times</b> are a strong function of both void fraction and mean bubble size. Shock waves, with <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> typically less than 20 milliseconds, occur when conditions are such that the local velocity of sound is exceeded. Appropriate conditions for shock waves exist when water impacts on structures with a high velocity and narrow approach angle. Although shock wave generation requires the presence of some air in a wave in order that the local speed of sound might be exceeded, in practice void fractions of less than 20 % are needed. When characterising Class II shock waves there is strong correlation between the bubbly shock wave theory and Taylor's incompressible jet impact theory. The final class of impact is referred to as Class III in the text. Such impacts result from compression and oscillation, or direct collapse of trapped bubbles/air pockets alone. Class III impacts arise when air pockets, trapped as waves break at the wall or at some distance from a structure, collapse and transmit shock waves through the water. Class III impacts may accompany Class I or Class II impacts but it is more likely for the direct collapse of air pockets to accompany Class II shock waves and for the air pocket oscillations to accompany Class II adiabatic compression waves. The resultant impact pressure magnitudes are functions of wave height and velocity for hydrostatic events whilst pressure magnitudes are functions of impact velocity, mean bubble size and void fraction for Class II compression waves. Peak pressure levels for Class II shock waves are dependent upon impact velocity and void fraction. Class II shock waves and Class III bubble impacts generate the highest peak pressures (typically in excess of 30 kPa) whereas Class II compression wave impacts are of smaller magnitude but larger duration. Aeration does affect peak <b>pressures</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> but relationships between impact <b>pressure,</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> and aeration are also dependent upon the impact regime and wave type...|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{to produce}} film-type {{thermoplastic}} composites with good mechanical properties, high-performance reinforcement films are used. In this case, films {{used as a}} matrix are difficult to impregnate into tow due to their high melt viscosity and high molecular weight. To solve the problem, in this paper, three polypropylene (PP) films with different melt viscosities were used separately to produce film-type thermoplastic composites. A film with a low melt viscosity was stacked so that tow was impregnated first and a film with a higher melt viscosity was then stacked to produce the composite. Four different composites were produced by regulating the <b>pressure</b> <b>rising</b> <b>time.</b> The thickness, density, fiber volume fraction (Vf), and void content (Vc) were analyzed to identify the physical properties and compare {{them in terms of}} film stacking types. The thermal properties were identified by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The tensile property, flexural property, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to identify the mechanical properties. For the films with low molecular weight, impregnation could be completed fast but showed low strength. Additionally, the films with high molecular weight completed impregnation slowly but showed high strength. Therefore, appropriate films should be used considering the forming process time and their mechanical properties to produce film-type composites...|$|R

Several arrays of microphones were used, including a 10 m tall tower to measure shock wave directionality {{and the effect}} of height above ground on acoustic level. A sailplane was employed to measure sonic booms above and within the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer, and the sailplane was positioned to intercept the shock waves between the supersonic airplane and the ground sensors.

The sonic boom prediction software PCBoom 4 was employed as a preflight planning tool using preflight weather data. The measured data of shock wave directionality, arrival time, and overpressure gave excellent agreement with the PCBoom 4 -calculated results using the measured aircraft and atmospheric data as inputs.

40|$|AbstractObjectives {{this study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPC) with an increased maximal inflation pressure, a decreased time to maximal pressure and a longer duration of compression would improve venous return compared to a standard IPC device. Methods thirty limbs in 15 volunteers without evidence of venous disease were studied using duplex scanning at rest and during the application of two different IPC devices with different compression parameters. The first device IPC- 1 (SCD 5325, Kendall) has a six-chambered cuff applying 45 mmHg after 12 s, sequentially from ankle to thigh followed by 60 s of non-compression. The second device IPC- 2 (Vena-Assist®, ACI Medical) has a foot, ankle and calf cuff, applies a pressure of 80 mmHg, has a <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 3 s, maintains inflation for 5. 5 s, and has a cycling time of 1 min. Peak venous velocity and acceleration time were measured at rest and during the IPC application. Measurements were obtained in supine position from the common femoral vein 1 cm above the saphenofemoral junction to include the entire venous outflow from the limb. Results peak venous velocity at rest was significantly higher in the right limb than in the left limb (26 ± 7. 2 vs. 22 ± 5. 7 cm/s, p< 0. 01). Peak venous velocity was significantly increased by both IPC devices (p < 0. 0001). IPC- 2 achieved significantly higher peak venous velocity than IPC- 1 (55. 1 ± 17. 8 vs. 37. 4 ± 6. 9 cm/s, p< 0. 0001). Acceleration time was also found to be significantly shorter (370 ± 93. 4 vs. 560 ± 83. 5 ms, p< 0. 0001) in IPC- 2 than in IPC- 1, respectively. Conclusions we have demonstrated that progressive inflation at the foot, ankle and calf, increasing maximal inflation pressure and decreasing time to maximal pressure result in increased venous return. These changes may improve the efficacy of IPC devices in the prevention of deep-venous thrombosis (DVT) formation...|$|E

40|$|The damage {{potential}} of a blast wave is dependent upon both the force it exerts on an object and the duration over which the force is applied. An assessment of this damage potential requires measurement of: (1) the peak static overpressure and (2) the total impulse per unit area of the blast wave. The static overpressure is the transient differential pressure in the air blast relative to the ambient pressure value just before arrival of the pressure shock. Colloquial terms for static overpressure include incident, free-field, and side-on pressure. Accurate measurement of the static overpressure in an air blast is extremely challenging. <b>Pressure</b> <b>rise</b> <b>times</b> can be sub-microsecond, demanding extremely high-frequency response from the measuring pressure transducers and their associated signal conditioning. In addition, concurrent transient temperatures in the 1000 s of degrees F or C, ground shocks and their associated strain waves, intense light, fragment impact, ionized gases, and other undesired environments all attempt to couple into the transducer and its mount, the instrumentation cabling, and other measurement system components. If the influence of these undesired environments is not compensated for or isolated, the signal output from the measurement system can be severely corrupted.

This time interval was measured for three gas mixtures and found to be similar (40 to 60 micro sec) for phi = 1. 0 and 0. 5 but much longer (100 to 120) microsecond for phi = 2. 0. It was suggested that the ignition period would be very useful to the kinetic modeler in judging the agreement between experimental and calculated delay times...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Shock waves were {{elicited}} by transient pressure disturbances, {{which could}} be used to treat musculoskeletal disorders. In present studies, we investigated whether the low-density shock waves (LDSWs), which are able to damage plasma membrane without impairing the vimentin or other organelles, might aug-ment T-cell proliferation as well as IL- 2 expression, and if mitogen activated protein kinase p 38 (p 38 MAPK) might be an underlying mechanism through which the LDSWs enhanced T-cell function. We found that the LDSWs increased activation of p 38 MAPK in Jurkat T cells. The LDSWs alone didn’t result in the T-cell proliferation and IL- 2 expression. However, in combination with other stimuli, LDSWs could augment the T-cell proliferation and IL- 2 expression. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK using SB 203580 reduced the stimulatory effects of the LDSWs, which indicated that the LDSWs enhanced IL- 2 expression through a mechanism that involved p 38 MAPK activation. We concluded that the p 38 MAPK activation {{played a key role in}} the regula-tion of T cell function by the LDSWs.

40|$|Feature {{extraction}} methods {{based on}} the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and multiresolution analysis are used to develop a robust classification algorithm that reliably discriminates between launch and impact artillery and/or mortar events via acoustic signals produced during detonation. Distinct characteristics are found within the acoustic signatures since impact events emphasize concussive and shrapnel effects, while launch events are similar to explosions, designed to expel and propel artillery round from a gun. The ensuing blast waves are readily characterized by variations in the corresponding peak <b>pressure</b> and <b>rise</b> <b>time</b> of the waveform, differences in the ratio of positive pressure amplitude to the negative amplitude, variations in the prominent frequencies associated with the varying blast events and variations in the overall duration of the resulting waveform. Unique attributes can also be identified that depend upon {{the properties of the}} gun tube, projectile speed at the muzzle, and the explosive/concussive properties associated with the events. In this work, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the predominant components and distinct characteristics from the aforementioned acoustic signatures at ranges exceeding 1 km. The resulting time-frequency decomposition of the acoustic transient signals is used to produce a separable feature space representation. Highly reliable classification is achieved wit...|$|R
40|$|Changes of {{arterial}} and venous pressure, and {{cardiac output}} were studied following ligation of inferior vena cava below level of renal vein in dogs. Development of collateral circulation after ligation {{was followed by}} means of venography using Pyraceton. The following results were obtained. 1) Venous <b>pressure</b> <b>rises</b> six <b>times</b> as high as normal immediately after ligation and thereafter begings to decrease. The decrease of pressure is relatively rapid until one or two hours after ligation, and is retarded thereafter. Venous pressure still remaines {{one and a half}} time as high as normal even after 3 months. 2) Arterial pressure decreases about ten mm Hg following ligation of inferior vena cava and cardiac output decreases about 13 per cent, which are not marked in any respect. 3) Collateral circulation develops gradually after ligation and is almost completed three weeks later. Collateral vessels, which run apart from the point of ligation are established three weeks later. Recanalization at the point of ligation are noticeable four weeks later. 4) Vertebral plexus plays a significant role as a collateral circulation through all the course from beginning to the time of recanalization. 5) Moter disturbance of lower extremities and dilatation of veins on the lower abdominal wall are noted as sequelae after ligation. However, these phenomena are temporary and gradually subside...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> and a photo&raphic study of the flames {{emerging}} from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although relief venting may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of <b>pressure</b> <b>rise</b> within the <b>time</b> interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing through the flange gap. In some explosions {{the presence of the}} relief caused acoustic standing waves, and the resultant movement of gas interfered with the combustion wave. Schlieren and direct photographs of the transmitterr explosions have shown that, in vented explosions, transmission through a flange gap need not necessarily occur nearest to the igniting source, and in some cases ignition took place in two locations simultaneously. With ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures the transmissions occurred during the initial stages of the explosion. With hydrogen/ air mixtures the transmission of the explosion occurred when the explosion pressure reached 25 per cent of the peak value. As the location of the explosion transmission through a flange gap is largely unpredictable, the timing of the newly formed flame front outside the vessel with ionisation detectors opposite the igniting source may be inaccurate.

40|$|Daytime hypersomnolence is an {{important}} symptom of the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome and the most compelling reason for treatment. Measuring sleep fragmentation is thus critical in a respiratory sleep study. Sleep fragmentation can be estimated from respiratory events (apnoeas, hypopnoeas, dips in oxygen saturation), EEG arousals, and autonomic changes (heart rate and blood <b>pressure</b> <b>rises).</b> We have compared these different approaches in 40 patients having polysomnography for possible sleep apnoea, {{as well as their}} correlation with subjective sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Score, ESS). Respiratory signals were scored for apnoeas / hypopnoeas (AHI) and dips in arterial oxygen saturation of > 4 % (Dip rate); EEG was scored by the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria for 3 second arousals (ASDA); autonomic measures were heart rate rises of > 10 bpm (HR) and indirect blood <b>pressure</b> <b>rises</b> (pulse transit <b>time,</b> PTT, Clin Sci 1994; 87 : 269). The number of events/hour was used to calculate the correlation between each of these and their correlation with ESS (P 21 for all correlations.

40|$|Flow {{kinematics}} {{of green}} water due to plunging breaking waves interacting with a simplified, three-dimensional model structure {{was investigated in}} laboratory. Two breaking wave conditions were tested: one with waves impinging and breaking on the vertical wall of the model at the still water level {{and the other with}} waves impinging and breaking on the horizontal deck surface. The incoming wave parameters were selected similar to observed wave parameters for the maximum wave height for Hurricane Ivan based on Froude scaling. The Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV) technique was used to measure the flow velocity. Measurements were taken on a vertical plane located {{at the center of the}} deck surface and a horizontal plane located slightly above the deck surface. The evolution of green water flow kinematics in time and space is revealed in the study. The unsteady and non-uniform velocities were found to be quite different between the two wave conditions, even though the incoming waves are nearly identical. It was observed that the maximum velocity appears near the green water wave front and is 1. 44 C with C being the wave phase speed for the deck impingement case and 1. 24 C for wall impingement case. The velocity variations in the present study were compared with that in an earlier study using a two-dimensional model with the same wave condition as in the wall impingement condition. It was found that the magnitudes of the maximum vertical velocity is very different between these two models (1. 7 C in the 3 D model versus 2. 9 C in the 2 D model), whereas the magnitudes of the maximum horizontal velocity on the deck are very similar (1. 2 C in both 3 D and 2 D models). The applicability of dam-break theory on green water velocity prediction for the three-dimensional model was also investigated. It was found that the dam-break theory works very well in terms of predicting the maximum velocity, which is also the front velocity, but not the spatial distribution of the velocity on the deck. Furthermore, pressure measurements were performed at two vertical planes: one at the centre and the other at 0. 05 m away from the centre. Ensemble averaged pressure variations were compared. Two types of pressure variations, impulsive type and non-impulsive type were observed. Impact pressure was successfully related to the <b>pressure</b> <b>rising</b> <b>time.</b> Void fraction was measured for few locations near the model front edge. Predictions of maximum impact pressure based on the measured pressure and flow velocity were investigated linking pressure with kinetic energy. Constant impact coefficient of 1. 3 was found for wall impingement wave. However, for deck impingement wave, it was not possible to find a constant impact coefficient. It was also found that there is a linear relationship between the <b>rising</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient and the impact coefficient...|$|R
