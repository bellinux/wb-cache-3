In this paper, the proposal for demarcation of ecological regions and sub-regions, which are the basis for defining the proposal regions <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> is presented. The borders of ecological regions are transitional or mosaic.

Case-based {{reasoning}} systems routinely {{record the}} results of prior problem-solving, but not the <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> new cases: {{the way in which}} the new cases were derived. This paper proposes the value <b>of</b> tracking <b>provenance</b> information in CBR, especially when timely feedback may not be available.

40|$|Abstract: In many {{application}} {{areas like}} e-science and data-warehousing detailed information {{about the origin of}} data is required. This kind of information {{is often referred to as}} data provenance or data lineage. The <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> a data item includes information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions <b>of</b> <b>provenance.</b> Most <b>of</b> them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give a survey <b>of</b> data <b>provenance</b> models and prototypes, present a general categorization scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the properties of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between different kinds <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> information and could lead to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> in general. Besides the categorization <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> types, it is important to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> information and application domains in our considerations. The analysis of existing approaches will assist us in revealing open research problems in the area <b>of</b> data <b>provenance.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In {{the field}} <b>of</b> Human-Computer Interaction, <b>provenance</b> {{refers to the}} {{complete}} history and genealogy <b>of</b> a document. <b>Provenance</b> {{can be useful in}} identifying related resources, such as different versions of the same document or resources used {{in the creation of a}} new document. Though methods <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> collection and applications for provenance have been studied, no studies have documented the frequency <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> events in typical computer use. We conducted a study of knowledge workers at Intel and used event-logging software to track provenance events as they occurred in the workplace over several weeks. We also interviewed knowledge workers to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> cues for document recall. Our data shows that provenance relationships are quite common, and provenance helps users recall more about their documents and understand the context of their workflows.

40|$|Provenance, {{from the}} French word „provenir ‟ meaning "to come from", {{describes}} the lineage <b>of</b> an entity. <b>Provenance</b> is critical information in eScience to accurately interpret scientific results. Though information provenance {{has been recognized}} as a hard problem in computing science (British Computing Society, 2004), many fundamental research issues in provenance {{have yet to be}} addressed. A common provenance model with well-defined formal semantics to facilitate interoperability <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> metadata from different sources has not been defined. Another important issue is the lack of a systematic study <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query characteristics across multiple applications. A classification or taxonomy <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> queries will not only help to better understand provenance metadata, but will also enable the definition <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators. Finally, while provenance for a user or an application is a specific view over all available provenance metadata, a provenance management system that supports provenance storage as views has not been implemented. In this paper we propose a novel <b>provenance</b> algebra consisting <b>of</b> a common <b>provenance</b> model called provenir, defined in description logic based W 3 C Web Ontology Language (OWL-DL), along with a set <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators derived from the classification <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> queries. We also introduce a practical provenance storage solution using materialized views over a generic relational database system. Our approach takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators and well-defined indices to efficiently process complex provenance queries over very large datasets. To support our claims we present an evaluation of both performance and scalability aspects of our initial implementation. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first provenance management system that supports the complete process from a formal provenance model and query operators to storage and efficient queries over provenance data. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Provenance is {{information}} recording the source, derivation, or history <b>of</b> some information. <b>Provenance</b> tracking {{has been studied}} {{in a variety of}} settings; however, although many design points have been explored, the mathematical or semantic foundations <b>of</b> data <b>provenance</b> have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we argue that dependency analysis techniques familiar from program analysis and program slicing provide a formal foundation for forms <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> that are intended to show how (part of) the output of a query depends on (parts of) its input. We introduce a semantic characterization <b>of</b> such dependency <b>provenance,</b> show that this form <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> is not computable, and provide dynamic and static approximation techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Provenance is {{information}} about entities, activities, and {{people involved in}} producing a piece of data or thing, {{which can be used}} to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. Bundles, defined in [PROV-DM] as sets <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> descriptions, were introduced in PROV as the mechanism by which <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> can be expressed. Bundles, whose validity is established independently of each other [PROV-CONSTRAINTS], are essentially independent of each other, acting as islands <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> descriptions. In applications where provenance is created by multiple parties over time, it is useful for provenance descriptions created by one party to link to provenance descriptions created by another party. Such a mechanism would allow the "stitching" <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> descriptions together. Given that provenance descriptions are expected to be contained in bundles, this would require a capability to link entity descriptions across bundles. To address this requirement, this document introduces a relation Mention allowing an entity description to be linked to another entity description occurring in another bundle...|$|R
