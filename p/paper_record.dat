2500|$|Initial {{results of}} the November {{election}} showed Buchanan leading by less than 350 votes. Due to {{the closeness of the}} race, and a high undervote of 18,000 in Sarasota County, a recount was ordered. Voters in Sarasota County had given more votes to a hospital board than they had to their Congressional representative—with 13% of voters not voting, compared to an average of 2% in neighboring counties. The touch-screen voting machines used provided no <b>paper</b> <b>record.</b> [...] On November 20, 2006, the Florida Department of State certified the {{results of the}} recount, which showed Buchanan winning by 369 votes.|$|E
2500|$|Beckwourth {{improved}} a Native American path {{to create}} {{what became known as}} the Beckwourth Trail through Plumas, Butte, and Yuba counties. In August 1851, he led the first intact wagon train into the burgeoning Gold Rush city of Marysville, California. [...] Beckwourth demanded payment for improving the trail, claiming he had an agreement with the city and its merchants. [...] The city failed to pay him because it had suffered two fires and had extensive property damage. [...] Beckwourth could not sue for damages. The former major had lost not only the town, but the state, and the council claimed there was no <b>paper</b> <b>record.</b> The trail was heavily used through 1855, when people began to shift to the newly constructed railroad for passage.|$|E
50|$|The method {{works by}} {{displaying}} a paper vote record under glass or clear plastic after the voter indicates their vote(s). The voter is instructed {{to verify that}} the <b>paper</b> <b>record</b> correctly indicates their vote. They finalize their vote by pressing a button or pulling a lever, and the <b>paper</b> <b>record</b> is stored. (This is called a voter verified paper audit trail.) At no point can the voter remove the <b>paper</b> <b>record</b> from the voting area. To do so would allow {{for there to be}} a receipt {{that could be used to}} coerce the voter into voting for a candidate or to allow selling of votes.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} voting systems to incorporate voter verified paper audit trail printers were the Avante Vote Trakker and a retrofit to the Sequoia AVC Edge called the VeriVote Printer. [...] Avante's system saw its first trial use in 2002, and in 2003, {{the state of}} Nevada required the use of VVPAT technology statewide and adopted the Sequoia system. It is notable that, in Avante's design, the shield preventing the voter from taking the <b>paper</b> <b>record</b> was an afterthought, while in Sequoia's design, the <b>paper</b> <b>record</b> for successive voters were printed sequentially on a single roll of paper.|$|E

50|$|Up {{until the}} mid-1980s, {{commercial}} sidescan images were produced on paper records. The early paper records were produced with a sweeping plotter that burned the image into a scrolling <b>paper</b> <b>record.</b> Later plotters {{allowed for the}} simultaneous plotting of position and ship motion information onto the <b>paper</b> <b>record.</b> In the late 1980s, commercial systems using the newer, cheaper computer systems developed digital scan-converters that could mimic more cheaply the analog scan converters used by the military systems to produce TV and computer displayed images of the scan, and store them on video tape. Currently data is stored on computer hard drives or solid-state media.|$|E

All future users received questionnaires and a selection of them was interviewed. Before starting the development of the EPR, the attitude of users towards electronic record keeping, their satisfaction with the <b>paper</b> clinical <b>records,</b> their knowledge of computers, and their needs and expectations of computer applications in health care were measured by means of a questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire were supplemented with in-depth interviews. Users had a neutral attitude towards electronic record keeping. They were more positive about data entry of the <b>paper</b> <b>records</b> than data retrieval. During the development phase, but prior to the implementation of the EPR, a second questionnaire measured satisfaction with the <b>paper</b> <b>records.</b> Satisfaction appeared to be related to self-rated computer experience.
