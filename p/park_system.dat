40|$|Abstract — {{searching for}} a parking space in Urban cities cause {{problems}} for drivers, especially during the peak business hours. The vehicle {{searching for a}}vailable spaces at that time creates traffic congestion. Apart from frustration of drivers, vehicles looking for parking burn tons of fuel which result as environmental pollution. The most current <b>parking</b> <b>systems</b> are not fully equipped to overcome parking space problem and cause traffic congestion {{as well as the}} environmental pollution. We have designed and implemented prototype of smart <b>Parking</b> <b>System</b> to eliminate the issues in traditional <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> and convert the <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> into fully functional Smart <b>parking</b> <b>system.</b> This paper proposes an effective method to overcome these problems. We have implemented and designed a prototype of <b>parking</b> <b>system.</b> This prototype is divided into three main category Image processing, Control System, and Windows phone application. Windows phone parking application is being integrated in <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> to track the real time status of parking plaza and to increases the efficiency of this prototype.

Therefore, this article proposes two-tuple linguistic analytic hierarchy process to evaluate assisted <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> so as to avoid information loss during the processes of evaluation integration. The performance evaluation attributes for assisted <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> are established initially. Subsequently, the information entropy theory is proposed to improve the evaluation attribute weight determined by analytic hierarchy process for the influencing factors of the randomness in parking test process. Furthermore, the evaluation attribute measure values of comprehensive performance are calculated and the assisted <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> evaluation results are obtained with ordered weighted averaging operator.

40|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, parking management influences drivers {{search time}} and cost for parking spaces, parking revenue, and traffic congestion. The wide deployment of wireless parking meters with sensing and communications capabilities allows the parking authority {{to monitor the}} state of each parking space in real time and optimize the parking management. In this thesis, we study state-of-the-art parking policies in smart <b>parking</b> <b>systems,</b> and show that the smart <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> needs to be 2 ̆ 2 smarter 2 ̆ 2. Our design goals of the smart <b>parking</b> <b>systems</b> include: (1) simplify the operations of <b>parking</b> <b>systems,</b> (2) improve drivers 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction, (3) increase parking revenue, and (4) alleviate traffic congestion. Through analysis and simulations, we first show that the proposed reservation-based parking policy {{has the potential to}} achieve the above goals. We then model the behavior of both service providers and drivers in smart <b>parking</b> <b>systems,</b> and explore the dynamic pricing scheme to achieve the goals in smart <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> design. Furthermore, we design and implement a prototype of Reservation-based Smart <b>Parking</b> <b>System</b> (RSPS) that allows drivers to effectively find and reserve the vacant parking spaces. With the real time tracking of parking status via various sensing technologies, a smart <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> will dynamically update the parking price according to the physical parking status, and the parking price will affect drivers decision on parking slot selection, therefore, affect the parking status. A smart <b>parking</b> <b>system</b> can be regarded as a full-fledged cyber-physical system (CPS). Through extensive experiment based on real traffic traces and a real-world parking map, the results show that the proposed reservation-based parking policy has the potential to simplify the operations of <b>parking</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as alleviate traffic congestion caused by searching for parking.

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West <b>Park</b> <b>System.</b> Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West <b>Park</b> <b>System</b> parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
