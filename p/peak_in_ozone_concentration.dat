The results {{show that there is}} a close relationship between changes in meteorological conditions and variations <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> over the central Kanto area. In summer, up to 84 % of long-term variations <b>in</b> <b>peak</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> may be accounted for by changes in the seasonally averaged daily maximum temperatures and seasonally averaged wind speeds. The <b>ozone</b> episodes <b>in</b> the Kanto region are dominated by three major patterns, of which Patterns I and II are regular summertime pressure patterns with a 26 % and 16 % frequency of occurrence, respectively. A detailed process analysis of ozone formation under urban heat island (UHI) at two areas in the Kanto region – urban and rural area – indicates that ozone formation is mainly controlled by chemistry, dry deposition, vertical transport, and horizontal transport processes. The groundlevel <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> are enhanced mainly by the vertical mixing of ozone-rich air from aloft, whereas dry deposition process mainly depletes ozone.

Several emission scenarios for the year 2010 were also considered. The model {{results suggest that the}} emission reductions of ozone precursors should have been effective to reduce ozone production between 1985 and 2000 in northern Switzerland. However, observations do not indicate any significant change <b>in</b> surface <b>ozone</b> levels since early 1990 s, except in the region of Zurich where there is a small negative trend. On the other hand, the model predictions match very well the spatial variability of the trends but the calculated trends are around 0. 5 ppb year(- 1) lower than those observed. This difference is similar to the background ozone increase as suggested by the long-term observations at the high Alpine station Jungfraujoch. These results support the hypothesis that the decrease <b>in</b> local <b>ozone</b> production due to emission reductions might have been partly or completely compensated by the simultaneous increase <b>in</b> the background <b>ozone.</b> <b>In</b> 2010, a strict application of the Gothenburg Protocol in Europe would lead to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>peak</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> by about 5 % in Switzerland under the meteorological conditions applied. our calculations also indicated that emission controls only in Switzerland would not be very effective to improve the air quality in the future.

For this study, the University of North Texas Discovery Park campus was chosen as a prospective location for an extensive air quality monitoring station. Sixteen years of ozone and meteorological data for five state-run monitoring sites within a 25 mile radius, including the nearest Denton Airport site, was gathered from TCEQ online database for the month of April for the years 2000 to 2015. The data was analyzed to show a historical, regional perspective of ozone near the proposed site. The maximum <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> measured at the Denton Airport location over the 16 year period was measured at 96 ppb <b>in</b> 2001. Experimental <b>ozone</b> and meteorological measurements were collected at the Discovery Park location from March 26 to April 3 and April 8 to April, 2016 and compared to the Denton Airport monitoring site.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a low polluting alternative transportation fuel that could help improve urban air quality. This paper examines {{the potential impact of}} introducing a hydrogen-based transportation system on urban ambient <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> This paper considers two scenarios, where significant numbers of new hydrogen vehicles are added to a constant number of gasoline vehicles. In our scenarios hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) are introduced in Sacramento, California at market penetrations of 9 % and 20 %. From a life cycle analysis (LCA) perspective, considering all the emissions involved in producing, transporting, and using hydrogen, this research compares three hypothetical natural gas to hydrogen pathways: (1) on-site hydrogen production; (2) central hydrogen production with pipeline delivery; and (3) central hydrogen production with liquid hydrogen truck delivery. Using a regression model, this research shows that the daily maximum temperature correlates well with atmospheric ozone formation. However, increases in initial VOC and NOx concentrations do not necessarily increase the peak <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration,</b> and may even cause it to decrease. It is found that ozone formation is generally limited by NOx in the summer and is mostly limited by VOC in the fall in Sacramento. Of the three hydrogen pathways, the truck delivery pathway contributes the most to ozone precursor emissions. Ozone precursor emissions from the truck pathway at 9 % market penetration can cause additional 3 -h average VOC (or NOx) concentrations up to approximately 0. 05 % (or 1 %) of current pollution levels, and at 20 % market penetration up to approximately 0. 1 % (or 2 %) of current pollution levels. However, all of the hydrogen pathways would result in very small (either negative or positive) changes <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> air quality. <b>In</b> some cases they will result <b>in</b> worse <b>ozone</b> air quality (mostly in July, August, and September), and in some cases they will result <b>in</b> better <b>ozone</b> air quality (mostly in October). The truck pathway tends to cause a much wider fluctuation in degradation or improvement of ozone air quality: percentage changes <b>in</b> <b>peak</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> are approximately − 0. 01 % to 0. 04 % for the assumed 9 % market penetration, and approximately − 0. 03 % to 0. 1 % for the 20 % market penetration. Moreover, the 20 % on-site pathway occasionally results in a decrease of about − 0. 1 % of baseline ozone pollution. Compared to the current ambient pollution level, all three hydrogen pathways are unlikely to cause a serious ozone problem for market penetration levels of HFCVs in the 9 – 20 % range...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{studies of}} stratospheric intrusions in the Alps and northern Apennines, their seasonal variations, and {{their effect on}} <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The results are based on experimental data and on simulations with a Lagrangian tracer model. The model, employing analyzed meteorological data, advects a passive stratospheric ozone tracer through the calculation {{of a large number}} of three-dimensional trajectories. In two case studies, the model is evaluated using a comprehensive set of observation data, consisting of water vapor satellite images, total column ozone measurements, ozone soundings, and measurements of ozone, beryllium 7 and meteorological parameters at three high Alpine sites and at the highest <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> the northern Apennines. During the two episodes considered, stratospheric air was detectable in the whole Alpine area with <b>peak</b> <b>ozone</b> mixing ratios <b>in</b> the 70 - 90 ppb range and even penetrated into some valleys. During one episode, stratospheric air also reached the northern Apennines, which highlights the large extension of the affected region. At the end of this episode, as shown by the model, the air was a mixture of tropospheric air with air originating from three different stratospheric intrusions. For three high Alpine sites, the frequency of stratospheric intrusions and its seasonal variation is derived using ozone, beryllium 7 and humidity measurements. The periods covered by this climatology are 1991 to 1997 for Zugspitze, and 1996 to 1998 for Junfraujoch and Sonnblick. Another short climatology was established from a three-year (1995 - 1997) model simulation. Good agreement between the two approaches is found for Zugspitze and Sonnblick: the simulated ozone tracer mixing ratios are significantly higher on "intrusion days", identified from the observations, than on "non-intrusion days". For Jungfraujoch, the agreement is less good, which could partly be due to the coarser time resolution of the beryllium 7 measurements at this site. The absolute frequency of stratospheric air intrusions as identified from the observations depends critically on the specification of threshold values for ozone, beryllium 7 and humidity, while the relative shape of the annual cycle is rather insensitive to threshold variations. At Zugspitze and Sonnblick, it shows a maximum in October, a secondary maximum in January and February, and a deep summer minimum. For Jungfraujoch, where the frequency of intrusions is higher than at Zugspitze and Sonnblick throughout most of the year, no clear seasonal variation is found. Simulated ozone tracer mixing ratios in the Alps are found to <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> late-winter/early-spring, when <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> are at a maximum in the stratosphere, but are almost at the same level in autumn, due to somewhat higher frequency of stratospheric intrusions in that season.

From two stations at high northern hemisphere (NH) latitudes there has been a significant decline <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> amounts throughout the troposphere since the early 1980 s. At midlatitudes of the NH where data are the most abundant, on the other hand, important regional differences prevail. The two stations in the eastern United States show that changes <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> since the early 1970 s have been relatively small. At the two sites <b>in</b> Europe, however, <b>ozone</b> amounts increased rapidly into the mid 1980 s, but have increased less rapidly (or in some places not at all) since then. Increases at the Japanese ozonesonde station have been largest in the lower troposphere, but have slowed in the recent decade. The tropics are sparsely sampled but do not show significant changes. Small increases are suggeste d at southern hemisphere (SH) midlatitudes by the two surface data records. In Antarctica large declines <b>in</b> the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> are noted <b>in</b> the South Pole data, and like those at high latitudes of the NH, seem to parallel the large decreases in the stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> has {{a complex}} {{distribution}} in mountain areas, but the low spatial density of high elevation monitoring stations has limited {{our understanding of}} ozone behavior. To achieve high spatial density, mobile measurement was carried out using a portable ozone monitor based on a semiconductor sensor. On the elevation gradient of a relatively low hill (273 m above seal level) in Matsuyama, Japan, 66 walking measurements were conducted in the pre-dawn hours of the winter in 2012 and 2013. The <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> {{at the top of}} the hill was positively correlated with the daily maximum concentration on the plain on the previous day. The difference <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> between the top and bottom of the hill was found to increase with increasing vertical temperature difference. The measurement method established in this study provides a low-cost alternative to grasp the distribution of <b>ozone</b> <b>in</b> mountain areas...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimate}} of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{was obtained from}} the difference <b>in</b> the Total <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data between the high Andes and the Pacific Ocean. From 1979 to 1992 the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> apparently increased by 1. 48 ± 0. 40 percent per year or 0. 21 ± 0. 06 Dobson unit per year over South America and the surrounding oceans. An increase in biomass burning in the Southern Hemisphere can account for this trend <b>in</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} described polar semiannual oscillations in zonal wind {{can explain}} midwinter {{weakening of the}} polar winter vortex and the relatively short stratospheric and mesospheric summer easterlies. This explanation implies that stratospheric sudden warmings may be caused or affected by the polar semiannual oscillation. Two potential physical mechanisms (not mutually exclusive) for the oscillation are presented: planetary wave action {{and changes in the}} radiation field. Radiation absorption changes are suggested to result from changes <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> during magnetic storms. Contours of amplitude of both the polar and tropical semiannual wind oscillations are more nearly congruent with geomagnetic than with geographic latitude...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to report a new {{approach}} for measuring the gen-eral equilibrium willingness to pay for large changes in spatially delineated public goods such as air quality. We estimate the parameters of a locational equilibrium model and compute equilibria for alternative scenarios characterizing the avail-ability of public goods within a system of communities. Welfare measures take into consideration the adjustments of households in equilibrium to nonmarginal changes in public goods. The framework is used to analyze willingness to pay for reductions <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> Southern California between 1990 and 1995. 1...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 32 - 35) An {{experiment was}} conducted to determine if nitric acid vapor, (HN 03) is present under typical conditions used <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> generations for human health effects studies. HN 03 may be formed during the production of ozone by electrical discharge. Two sources of feed gas, (tanked purified air and compressed room air), and four <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations,</b> (0, 0. 25, 0. 50, and 0. 75 ppm), were studied. Nitric acid vapor was collected on nylon filters in a sampling train behind Pallflex quartz fiber pre-filters which removed any particulate nitrates or other particles. Small, statistically significant amounts of HN 03 {{were found in the}} test atmospheres, (0. 1 to 2. 4 ppb), during ozone generations. Analysis of the data supports the hypothesis that increased contamination occurs when compressed room air is used instead of purified air for the generations. Increases in HN 03 were found with increases <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The interaction of the type of air and the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> was also significant...|$|R
