25|$|When Capcom {{produced}} the original Street Fighter Alpha in 1995, Guy {{would be one}} of two Final Fight characters {{to be included in the}} game along with the game's second stage boss Sodom. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's <b>Product</b> <b>Planning</b> and Design section, Capcom included Guy in the game because he was extremely popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In this game, Guy's character design was altered slightly, with his jika-tabi replaced by sneakers (a change that was retained when Guy was brought back into the Final Fight series in Final Fight 3), although his fighting style mimics that of his Final Fight counterpart. Guy and Sodom would be joined by Rolento in 1996's Street Fighter Alpha 2 and by Cody in 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, followed by Maki's appearance in the portable versions of Alpha 3. Guy's new design would be used in the second Final Fight sequel for the SNES, Final Fight 3 and along with Cody's Street Fighter Alpha rendition, are also hidden characters in Final Fight One (Final Fight for the Game Boy). In the Alpha games, Guy's Bushin predecessor is revealed to be a man named Zeku, who would appear in Guy's ending in Street Fighter Alpha 2 to test Guy for his successor-ship. Zeku's presence in the game contradicts Final Fight 2, which identifies Genryusai as Guy's sensei, as designers of the Alpha games did not take into account the SNES Final Fight sequels when developing the games. Zeku was mentioned once again in Guy's bio in Street Fighter Alpha 3.|$|E

Ford President Lee Iacocca wanted a 1971 model that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and that would be priced at less than $2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months; the Pinto project was the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history up to that time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. Machine tooling overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged. The attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as [...] "Lee's car." [...] The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.|$|E

It is unclear if the new coupe will wear the SC nameplate or continued on with its concept name LC. However, this new coupe would filled the gap of the discontinued SC430 and finally give Lexus a much needed Nissan GT-R or Acura NSX rival. It has now officially confirmed the LF-LC for production. Lexus International executive vice-president Kazuo Ohara says the LF-LC coupe would be an all-new car, possibly built from a newly developed set of underpinnings, that would take around four years to make it to production.|$|E

[...] Owners expressed concern that duplicating the times achieved in these tests would void their factory warranty. Nissan's chief vehicle engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno has indicated that he has never used the term [...] "launch control", which refers to the act of turning off vehicle dynamic control (VDC) and launching the car at around 4500 rpm. However, Nissan's director of <b>product</b> <b>planning</b> John Wiener stated in an interview with Jay Leno that [...] "we (Nissan) actually offer a 'launch mode'". The GT-R user's manual states that turning off the VDC is only meant for escaping low-traction situations such as mud or snow. Nissan has re-programmed the 2010 model year GT-R to reduce the engine speed at launch to around 3,000-3,500 rpm with VDC enabled, which is meant to improve acceleration times. The new programming was also installed on old 2009 vehicles still in Nissan's inventory, and is available for existing 2009 vehicles.|$|E

By {{the middle of}} 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was {{approved}} and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. Again using subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30 Soarer (Lexus SC300/400), test model pre-production started in December 1992 with 20 models, and official mass production began in April 1993.

40|$|The {{product line}} {{engineering}} paradigm has emerged recently {{to address the}} needs to minimize the development cost and the time to market in this highly competitive global market. Product line development consists of product line asset development and product development using the assets. Product line requirements are essential inputs to product line asset development.

A marketing and <b>product</b> <b>plan,</b> which includes plans on what features are to be packaged in products, how these features will be delivered to customers (e. g., feature binding time), and how the products will evolve in the future, also drives product line asset development; thus this paper explores design issues from the marketing perspective and presents key design drivers that are tightly coupled with the marketing strategy.
