The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|E

40|$|A Sequential Quadratic Programming {{optimization}} algorithm was interfaced to the Engine System Assessment (ESA) model {{to determine the}} optimal combustion chamber geometry to maximize power. Both net power and power per unit displacement were studied, together with packaging, fuel economy and knock limiting constraints. Sensitivity of the optimal solution to changes in constraint parameters was also studied. Changes in the fuel economy and the displacement volume specifications affected the optimal design. It is shown {{that the problem of}} optimizing power is one of maximizing bore without exceeding the <b>package</b> <b>constraint</b> and/or degrading fuel economy. Also, to optimize net power subject to <b>package</b> <b>constraints,</b> the displacement volume should be treated as a variable subject to <b>package</b> <b>constraints</b> and not specified a priori. Two algebraic models are developed first,based on ESA expressions; one for a flat head design and one for a compound valve head design. They are used with monotonicity analysis to determine a partial solution analytically. The analytical results and the numerical results with the ESA program gave identical solutions for the geometric design variables. Absolute values of brake power and specific fuel consumption differed because the algebraic expressions contained incomplete friction models. While the optimal designs concluded from this work may be readily apparent to experienced engine engineers, the readily available sensitivity of the optimal design to changes in constraint parameters is not. Therein lies the utility of the described approach. The {{optimization algorithm}}, the interface, and relevant future work are also described...|$|R

It was an updated version, with a Leica M-mount replacing the Leica screw mount, {{and the ability}} to take the same trigger advance accessory as the Bessa-T. Its quality of fabrication and overall finish was much better than the R, with magnesium alloy replacing the former model's plastic plates and a more substantial cast (as opposed to pressed) metal film rewind lever. The changes resulted in a more solid and marginally larger camera, available in either olive (with chrome detailing) or splatter-textured black paint finishes. The Bessa-R's self-timer was deleted from the R2, possibly due to the <b>packaging</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed on the design by the adoption of thicker metal panels.|$|E

A single node {{in the global}} network contains multiple processors connected by a local network. An important issue in two-level networks is how alternative numbers of processors per node changes the per link traffic in the global network. In {{the case of a}} hypercube global network we consider three communication schemes. We derive system stability conditions for each scheme under very general assumptions. Assuming the packets sent by a processor form a Poisson process, we also derive the worst-case mean end-to-end packet delay for the three schemes. We then use these results to compare alternative numbers of processors per node for the system size of a given multiprocessor.

Despite the prevalence of <b>packaging</b> <b>constraints</b> on choice, economic models of choice {{have been slow to}} deal with their effects on parameter estimates and policy implications.

40|$|Tubular {{hydroforming}} {{is gaining}} {{importance in the}} automotive industry by enabling parts consolidation, weight reduction and performance enhancement. While current automotive applications use almost exclusively mild steel, other advanced steel and aluminum alloys are being discussed {{for use in the}} future. This thesis evaluates the economics of hydroforming three representative materials - mild steel, dual phase 600 steel and aluminum 5754 - using technical cost modeling. Costs are analyzed for the entire hyclroforming value stream, from coiled metal sheets to hydrofonned components, for both geometrically equivalent and functionally equivalent hydroformed components. Design conditions of constant load to failure and constant defection are used to derive functional equivalence. Results show that manufacturing costs are most sensitive to the maximum calibration pressure required for hydroforming. While the costs of processing aluminum components are less than those of functionally equivalent steel components, greater aluminum raw material costs of lead to greater total component costs compared to steel. Substitution of advanced materials is not as cost effective a weight reduction strategy as increasing section diameter and thinning walls of mild steel components, assuming no <b>package</b> <b>constraints.</b> by Bruce A.

40|$|Silicon CMOS Technology {{is now the}} {{preferred}} process for low power wireless communication devices, although currently much noisier and slower than comparable processes such as SiGe Bipolar and GaAs technologies. However, due to ever-reducing gate sizes and correspondingly higher speeds, higher Ft CMOS processes are increasingly competitive, especially in low power wireless systems such as Bluetooth, Wireless USB, Wimax, Zigbee and W-CDMA transceivers. With the current 32 nm gate sized devices, speeds of 100 GHz and beyond are well within the horizon for CMOS technology, but at a reduced operational voltage, even with thicker gate oxides as compensation. This thesis investigates newer techniques, both from a systems {{point of view and}} at a circuit level, to implement an efficient transceiver design that will produce a more sensitive receiver, overcoming the noise disadvantage of using CMOS Silicon. As a starting point, the overall components and available SoC were investigated, together with their architecture. Two novel techniques were developed during this investigation. The first was a high compression point LNA design giving a lower overall systems noise figure for the receiver. The second was an innovative means of matching circuits with low Q components, which enabled the use of smaller inductors and reduced the attenuation loss of the components, the resulting smaller circuit die size leading to smaller and lower cost commercial radio equipment. Both these techniques have had patents filed by the University.

40|$|The {{advances}} in VLSI and packaging technologies {{enable us to}} integrate a whole system on a single chip (SoC) or on a package module. In these systems, analog/RF electronics, digital circuitries, and memories coexist. This new technology brings us new freedom for system integration {{as well as new}} challenges in system design and implementation. To fully utilize the benefits of these new hardware technologies, concurrent design of system, chip, and package is necessary. This research aims to explore the new design space and opportunities for System-on-Package (SoP), with special attention on radio and mixed-signal system applications. Global level system partitioning for SoC and SoP with cost-performance trade-off, concurrent chip and design for high-speed off-chip signaling, global clock distribution, and ultra wideband (UWB) radio module are two fields in this research. Cost-performance driven for mixed-signal system partitioning in early conceptual level design is first addressed in this thesis. We develop a modeling technique to pre-estimate the cost and performance. The performance model evaluates various noise isolation technologies, such as using guard rings, and partitioning the system into several chips. In cost analysis, new factors such as extra chip area and additional process steps due to mixed signal isolation, integration of intellectual property (IP) right module or “virtual components”, yield and technology compatibility for merging logic, memory and analog/RF circuits on a single chip are considered. An efficient computation algorithm, namely COMSI, is developed for cost estimation under various mixed-signal performance constraints. System interconnect topologies have been moving away from multi-point bus architecture and towards high-speed serial links. But low interaction between chip and package design has more and more limited system performance. We address concurrent chip and package design and co-optimization for high-speed off-chip signaling in this part. First we explore the interconnect and <b>package</b> <b>constraints</b> to the circuit and system architecture. Proper equivalent circuit models for package parasitics are set up and then a 3 -dimension electromagnetic (EM) solver is used to extract the parasitic parameters of package. After that, bandwidth and noise of the signal channel are estimated. The optimal off-chip singling is designed according to these <b>packages</b> and interconnection <b>constraints.</b> We also analyzed the global clock distribution using co-design method. We developed a low cost, low power consumption, and low complexity UWB radio module using co-design method and SoP technologies. The module will be used in low data rate and long-range wireless intelligent systems such as radio frequency identification (RFID) or wireless sensors networks (WSN).
