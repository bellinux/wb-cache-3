5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the <b>portable</b> <b>device,</b> which is {{required}} to have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the <b>portable</b> <b>device</b> can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the <b>portable</b> <b>device</b> via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E
5|$|Before the Battery Charging Specification was defined, {{there was}} no {{standardized}} way for the <b>portable</b> <b>device</b> to inquire how much current was available. For example, Apple's iPod and iPhone chargers indicate the available current by voltages on the D− and D+ lines. When D+ = D− = 2.0V, the device may pull up to 500mA. When D+ = 2.0V and D− = 2.8V, the device may pull up to 1A of current. When D+ = 2.8V and D− = 2.0V, the device may pull up to 2A of current.|$|E

25|$|Napster {{music store}} offers a subscription-based {{approach}} to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to Windows Media Audio (WMA) while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews {{his or her}} subscription. Napster also charges users who wish to use the music on their <b>portable</b> <b>device</b> an additional $5 per month. In addition, Napster gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through Napster can be played on players carrying the Microsoft PlaysForSure logo (which, notably, do not include iPods or even Microsoft's own Zune). As of June 2009, Napster is offering DRM free MP3 music, which can be played on iPhones and iPods.|$|E

25|$|In March 1999, Game Art's Japanese {{publisher}} ESP Software showcased a PlayStation {{version of}} Grandia at that year's Tokyo Game Show expo, along with confirmation {{that the game}} would be released in English {{for the first time}} in North America by Sony Computer Entertainment America. Working Designs, which had previously worked with Game Arts on bringing their Lunar games to the region, had expressed interest in publishing the game, but were ultimately unable to secure the rights. New features for the PlayStation version included support for the system's DualShock analog control sticks and vibration function, as well as compatibility with Sony's Japanese-only PocketStation peripheral, which allows players to download game data on a <b>portable</b> <b>device</b> for use in a special mini-game. Although the company had expressed interest in bringing the game to the PlayStation as early as 1998, technical problems originally prevented the title from being ported to the system. Game Arts was later able to release the game with a slight loss in frame rate and a marginal decrease in video effects the following June. The North American version was originally announced by Sony as a summer release during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, but was pushed back to the following October. Grandia was later released for the PlayStation in Europe in 2000 by Ubisoft.|$|E

[...] Designed from the Mega Jet, a portable {{version of the}} home console designed for use on airline flights in Japan, Nomad served to succeed the Game Gear and was the last handheld console released by Sega. In addition to functioning as a <b>portable</b> <b>device,</b> {{it was designed to}} be used with a television set via a video port.

[...] Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. [...] Bird thought {{that it could be}} used by physicians as a <b>portable</b> <b>device.</b> [...] Electrically, the machine worked like a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. [...] It consisted of a number of wooden dowels, each with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc coils.
