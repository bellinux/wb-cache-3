2500|$|However, many {{continue}} {{to argue against}} these legends. For example, archaeologist C.A. Ralegh Radford refused {{to believe in the}} legend and all of the associations, declaring in 1935 that [...] "no concrete evidence whatsoever has yet been found to support the legendary connection of the Castle with King Arthur". Charles Thomas, a specialist in Cornish history, was unable to find solid links, mainly {{due to the fact that}} legends and stories would have been handed down only verbally during this period. Thomas stated in 1993 that [...] "there simply is no independently attested connection in early Cornish folklore locating Arthur, at any age or in any capacity, at Tintagel." [...] Many others disagree, maintaining that the legendary figure would essentially have been an Early Medieval British leader, involved in fighting the migrating Anglo-Saxons who were settling in Britain at that time. [...] A stone was found at Tintagel bearing the inscription <b>PATERN</b> COLI AVI FICIT ARTOGNOU , and it has been claimed by some to provide evidence for a historical Arthur, but most historians reject this view.|$|E
2500|$|Another notable stylistic element are {{the several}} levels of rhetoric, the {{simplest}} of which is [...] "a relatively straightfoward expository style" [...] that is evident of many passages in the cetological chapters, though they are [...] "rarely sustained, and serve chiefly as transitions" [...] between more sophisticated levels. One {{of these is the}} [...] "poetic" [...] level of rhetoric, which Bezanson sees [...] "well exemplified" [...] in Ahab's quarter-deck soliloquy, {{to the point that it}} can be set as blank verse. Set over a metrical <b>patern,</b> the rhythms are [...] "evenly controlled—too evenly perhaps for prose," [...] Bezanson suggests. A third level of rhetoric is the idiomatic, and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form. Examples of this are [...] "the consistently excellent idiom" [...] of Stubb, such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests [...] "the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter". The fourth and final level of rhetoric is the composite, [...] "a magnificent blending" [...] of the first three and possible other elements: ...|$|E

50|$|The Saint, <b>Patern</b> (or Padarn, Paternus) has {{had several}} candidates, {{which have become}} mixed and {{confused}} over the ages.

St. <b>Patern</b> and St. Constantine have thus always been linked, with dedications always being near one another (a Celtic practice when saints are related or work together) (St. Constantine Church at Milton Abbot being the case in point for South Petherwin).|$|E
