40|$|Glass fiber {{is unique}} {{in its ability to}} {{withstand}} atomic oxygen and ultraviolet radiation in-space environments. However, glass fiber is also difficult to terminate by traditional methods without decreasing its strength significantly. Glass fiber products are especially sensitive to bend radius, and do not work very well with traditional 'sewn loop on pin' type connections. As with most composites, getting applied loads from a metallic structure into the webbing without stress concentrations is the key to a successful design. A <b>potted</b> <b>end</b> termination has been shown in some preliminary work to out-perform traditional termination methods. It was proposed to conduct a series of tensile tests on structural webbing or cord to determine the optimum potting geometry, and to then be able to estimate a weight and volume savings over traditional sewn-overa- pin connections. During the course of the investigation into <b>potted</b> <b>end</b> terminations for glass fiber webbing, a new and innovative connection was developed that has lower weight, reduced fabrication time, and superior thermal tolerance over the metallic end terminations that were to be optimized in the original proposal. This end termination essentially transitions the flexible glass fiber webbing into a rigid fiberglass termination, which can be bolted/fastened with traditional method...|$|E

The techniques involved testing specimens with <b>potted</b> <b>ends</b> as well as testing them in a novel clamping fixture; specimen shape, length, gage width, and thickness were the test parameters investigated for both coated and uncoated 0 / 90 deg and +/- 45 deg laminates. It is found that specimen shape {{does not have a}} significant effect on the measured compressive properties. The <b>potting</b> of specimen <b>ends</b> results in slightly higher measured compressive strengths than those obtained with the new clamping fixture.

50|$|The {{end of a}} {{wire rope}} tends to fray readily, and cannot be easily {{connected}} to plant and equipment. There are different ways of securing the ends of wire ropes to prevent fraying. The most common and useful type of end fitting for a wire rope is to turn the end back to form a loop. The loose end is then fixed back on the wire rope. Termination efficiencies vary from about 70% for a Flemish eye alone; to nearly 90% for a Flemish eye and splice; to 100% for <b>potted</b> <b>ends</b> and swagings.|$|R

40|$|In soilless {{agriculture}} and horticulture coir {{is the more}} used substratum to grow plants because it is widely available and more environmentally friendly than sphagnum or peat. In Italy, soilless agriculture concerns an area of about 1, 000 hectares, particularly concentrated in Sicily. The southern coastal belt of this region is the area interested by the most significant experiences {{in the application of}} techniques of soilless cultivation that, recently, has been used also for growing table grapes. Starting from the above consideration we suppose that the features of the coconut fiber underlay an evident transformation and that even after few years of table grape cultivation, such organic material undergone to a transformation that allows for the formation of a proto-organic soil (a proto-Histosol, we supposed). If this is true, we believe that, in this case, to speak about soilless cultivation is for sure misleading for the common people, as we should define this cultivation “on anthropogenic soils” instead. To fit the aims of this survey we used a big greenhouse devoted to soilless cultivation of table grape in a farm in the Southern SicilyWe have considered the enzymatic activity that characterized the coconut fiber after 3 cycles of cultivation of table grapes. We used as a control the coconut fiber that the farmer used to prepare pots for soilless cultivation and coconut fiber of: 6 <b>pots</b> at the <b>end</b> of the first productive cycle 6 <b>pots</b> at the <b>end</b> of the second cycle and 3 <b>pots</b> at the <b>end</b> of the third cycle. On these organic samples we investigated three enzymes, belonging to oxydoreductase (catalase and dehydrogenase) and hydrolase (urease) classes. Statistical analysis of the investigated enzymes was developed using IBM Statistic SPSS v 20 by ANOVA, Tukey test HSD for p 0. 01 and Multivariate Statistical Analysis. Results have shown significant differences in enzymes content and quality among coir tests. The use of the coco fiber, as nutritive substratum under fertigation, has positively influenced the growing and proliferation of soil microbes and thus enzymatic activity.
