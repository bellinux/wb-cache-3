40|$|A commercially {{available}} <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> (EcoCover) was assessed for its persistence {{under field conditions}} {{and its ability to}} control weeds in vegetable crops and establishing trees. Weeds were controlled as effectively by EcoCover in autumn-planted cabbage and lettuce crops as by black polythene mulches. The <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> was beginning to break down by the time the crop was harvested. <b>Paper</b> <b>mulch</b> that was buried decayed much faster than when left on the soil surface. EcoCover was compared with residual herbicides, black weed mat and another <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> (Korromatt) for controlling weeds under trees planted in spring. Both types of <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> were prone to being dislodged by wind at exposed sites, but otherwise provided weed control for about 6 months after being laid.

40|$|Abstract Weed control {{strategies}} for establishing three ground cover species were investigated by planting them in late spring, then assessing eight different control treatments {{during the following}} 14 months. The prostrate woody Coprosma acerosa ‘Taiko ’ established best with black weed mat mulch and EcoCover <b>paper</b> <b>mulch,</b> although bark mulches also gave reasonable establishment rates. The brittle succulent, Sedum mexicanum ‘Acapulco Gold’, also established well with black weed mat and <b>paper</b> <b>mulch,</b> although a sawdust mulch was particularly suitable. The frost-prone Polygonum capitatum, which regrows readily from seed, did best with soil kept bare by hand-hoeing or selective herbicides, although the <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> also rated well. Thus the best weed control strategy varied depending {{on the characteristics of}} the ground cover being established. Other considerations, including relative costs, are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Mulching, as a {{cultivation}} technique, {{has been}} adopted since {{the early twentieth century}} in agriculture for improving various aspects of crop production. However, the use of mulching was boosted by the introduction of plastic mulch, which has been reported as a harmful substance to the farm environment. Therefore, the need for an environmentally benign mulch material is obvious. The present study investigated the effects of paper and biodegradable plastic mulches on the cucumber yield, soil temperature and moisture content (at 10 cm depth), and the control of weed growth in an agricultural field located at the University of Helsinki in Southern Finland. The degradability of mulches was also investigated. The null hypothesis was that all the mulches would have a similar effect on the abovementioned aspects. Four <b>paper</b> <b>mulches,</b> i. e., BP, KB, CK, and OB, accompanied by biodegradable mulch (BIO) and a bare soil (BG) treatment were under investigation. Each of these treatments had 4 replicates, and a randomized complete block design (RCBD) was adopted. Sensors were installed at 10 cm depth in each study plot to measure the soil temperature and moisture content. In addition, the experimental plots were watered by drip irrigation. All the attained data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The results of the study revealed noteworthy positive effects (P< 0. 05) of mulch application on cucumber yields together with soil temperature, early fruiting, and weed growth regulation compared to the un-mulched bare ground, exclusive of soil moisture content. The daytime soil temperature (DST) was higher than at night (NST), indicating a positive association of the mulch effect with plant growth and crop earliness. However, no suggestive improvement in soil moisture was found through mulch application during the study period. Edge degradation was only found for <b>paper</b> <b>mulches</b> during the study period, suggesting their environment friendliness. The CK and KB papers were the most effective and most environmentally positive mulch materials, and could be a suitable choice for Finnish vegetable growers. The findings of this study could assist paper manufacturers in improving the qualities of <b>mulch</b> <b>papers</b> regarding vegetable production. Future research aims at assessing the effects of mulches on the physiology of plants studied under mulched techniques together with the development of cheaper and more environmentally benign mulch materials...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests was {{performed}} in winter 1996 to measure degradation of <b>paper</b> <b>mulches</b> {{with the help of}} physical and mechanical properties. Four types of <b>paper</b> used for <b>mulching,</b> kraft <b>paper</b> gauge 40, 60 and 80 and waxed paper were laid over soil in two growth chambers. They were kept under observation for 27 days under controlled temperature, humidity and light. Mulches were sprayed with water to simulate rain. Tensile and puncture tests were performed on each type of paper every day. Four mechanical properties; stress, strain, energy and tensile energy absorption were calculated from the force-deformation curve obtained by tensile test. Two mechanical properties; displacement and force to break were calculated from the force-deformation curve obtained by puncture test. A special die had to be designed to perform puncture tests. This design eliminated shear loading which otherwise would have been present in normal puncture tests. Results showed that paper - 3 (kraft paper gauge - 80) was best suited for mulching as the mechanical properties were stable through 27 days with negligible fluctuations. Waxed paper required less force to break but was stable through 27 days of experimentation. A three-way factorial model was developed to analyze the results statistically. A SAS program was written to model the results. The fitted model was in very good agreement with the actual values...|$|R

Fumigants were: a) untreated control, b) methyl bromide + chloropicrin (67 / 33 %, respectively) {{at a rate of}} 400 kg ha - 1, c) chloropicrin at 400 kg ha - 1 plus the herbicide pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1, d) 1, 3 -dichlopropene at 325 kg ha - 1 + chloropicrin at 67 kg ha - 1 (83 / 17 %, respectively) plus pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1 and e) metam sodium at 485 kg ha - 1 plus pebulate at 4. 5 kg ha - 1. Mulch types were either black low-density polyethylene film (0. 038 mm thick) or black <b>paper</b> <b>mulch.</b> Results indicated that all fumigants with either mulch type had higher tomato yield and more effective soilborne disease and purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) control than the non-fumigated control. <b>Paper</b> <b>mulch</b> appeared to be a valuable alternative to control purple nutsedge with no fumigants and with low-volatility fumigants, such as metam sodium, whereas plastic mulch might retain high-volatility fumigants, such as methyl bromide, longer, thus increasing efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} constraint in organic production. It can be expensive and time-consuming and severe crop yield losses may be incurred when weeds are not adequately controlled. Research on organic weed management (OWM) in herb and vegetable production is increasing internationally, although in Australia very little {{work has been done}} to assess current OWM knowledge among growers, and to test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of the weed management practices used by organic growers. The effect of hand weeding, tillage, hay mulch, pelletised <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> and an unweeded control treatment on weed growth, crop growth and cost effectiveness were evaluated in several field trials on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales using lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and echinacea (Echinacea purpurea Moench. [L. ]). Weed management in lettuce was cost-effectively achieved using cheaper weeding methods such as tillage. More expensive methods such as hand weeding and hay mulching controlled weeds well, but were less cost effective. For echinacea, cheaper in-crop weeding methods (e. g. tillage, unweeded control) had poor weed suppression and low crop yields, while the more expensive weeding methods, hand weeding and hay mulch, controlled weeds well and were cost effective. <b>Paper</b> <b>mulch</b> controlled weeds very well but, again, had lower yields and was therefore not cost effective.

40|$|Soybean (Glycine max) {{is a high}} water-demand {{crop and}} grown under {{moderate}} temperature in Japan. To protect the crop from hot summer and to utilize rainfall for its cultivation, selection of appropriate mulching material(s) is crucial. For optimum production of the crop, soil moisture and temperature regimes as well as water use efficiency (WUE) of the crop were investigated under straw, grass, paper, plastic and bare soil (control) mulching under rain-fed condition at Gifu university farm in Japan. The mulching treatments, compared to the control, lowered soil temperature by 2  °C at 5  cm depth and 0. 5  °C at 15 and 25  cm depths. The plastic and straw mulching stored the highest quantity of soil moisture at 5 and 15  cm depths; the bare soil stored the lowest quantity. At 25  cm depth, soil-moisture content was the highest under <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> but invariable under the other mulches. Plastic mulching reduced evaporation rate from the soil surface and, consequently, the reduced soil-water consumption (SWC) from the root zone augmented WUE of soybean. The paper mulching, by conserving soil-moisture and reducing soil temperature, provided better crop growth attributes, while the plastic mulching improved WUE of green soybean. Therefore, the plastic mulch performed best in reducing soil-water consumption and increasing WUE, while the <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> was good for soil-moisture conservation and temperature modification that increased soybean yield.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} efficacy of a biodegradable paper/cured vegetable oil mulch with newspaper/straw and bare soil for reducing weed growth and promoting vegetable yields. There {{were no significant differences}} in total tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) or pepper (Capsicum annum) yields between the different mulch types. The coated <b>paper</b> and newspaper/straw <b>mulches</b> were effective in preventing weed growth around the plants while hand weeding was required for the bare soil plots. After 3 months, there was slight degradation (a few cracks, holes) of the coated <b>paper</b> <b>mulches</b> but not enough to allow noticeable weed penetration or detachment of the buried edge. Paper/cured oil mulch rolls appear to be a convenient and effective alternative to laborious hand weeding or spreading of newspaper and straw for vegetable gardening. Key words: Degradable mulch, soybean oil, sustainable agriculture, vegetable production In order to avoid this problem, kraft paper was coated with a resin made from epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and citric acid and then thermally cured (Shogren, 1999; Shogren, 2000). Previous work has shown these compositions to be fully biodegradable in soil but over a longer time span than uncoated paper (several months) (Shogren et al., 2004). The objective of this study was to assess whether <b>mulches</b> made from <b>paper</b> coated with ESO/citric acid resins would serve as effective weed barriers, promote the growth of tomato and pepper plants and sustain good yields when compared to other weed control methods commonly used in a garden or small farm setting...|$|R

40|$|The role {{of organic}} carbon and {{inorganic}} nitrogen for cell synthesis, growth, and metabolism {{is important in}} all living organisms. To provide proper nutrition for earthworms during vermicomposting, carbon and nitrogen must {{be present in the}} substrates at the correct ratio. The usual practice is to arbitrarily add either a rich nitrogenous material, or a rich carbonaceous material to the feed substrate, depending on the situation, to correct for C-to-N imbalance. In addition, the conventional determination of C-to-N ratio is not always based on the proportion of each nutrient that is available for these processes, but on their absolute content in the substrate. More so, dierent earthworm species are impacted dierently by C-to-N ratio and feed mixture type. Therefore, pilot studies are necessary to establish optimal C-to-N ratio for a specific earthworm species and a specific feed mixture.

New degradable {{materials have}} been proven successful for increasing crop productivity; however, their degradation in the field has been hardly addressed. A qualitative scale was {{used in the present study}} to assess the above-soil and in-soil degradation of degradable mulches during the cropping season. Degradation was determined in three biodegradable plastic mulches (Biofilm, BF; Mater-Bi, MB; Bioflex, BFx), two <b>paper</b> sheet <b>mulches</b> (Saikraft, PSA; MimGreen, PMG) and one oxo-degradable plastic mulch (Enviroplast, EvP). Polyethylene (PE) mulch was used as control. Mulches were tested in five Spanish locations (Castilla-La Mancha, La Rioja, Navarra, Aragón and Catalunya), with three crop seasons of processing tomato. Biodegradable plastic mulches BF and MB degraded more and faster above-soil than paper mulches; among biodegradable mulches BF degraded more than MB, and MB more than BFx. The above-soil degradation of the oxo-degradable mulch EvP was highly dependent on location and crop season, and it degraded more than PE. Main environmental factors triggering above-soil degradation were radiation, rainfall and crop cover. In-soil, <b>paper</b> <b>mulches</b> and BF degraded more and faster than MB, whereas BFx and EvP barely degraded. Environmental factors triggering in-soil degradation during the crop season were rainfall and irrigation water. The effect of soil parameters (organic matter, nutrient availability) on degradation during the cropping season was not evidenced. The qualitative scale used proved convenient for determining mulch field degradation. A visual scale for supporting the qualitative evaluation is provided.

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is reported to}} be a major constraint in organic agriculture. Organic growers also report a lack of information about non-chemical weed control. A series of field trials was conducted in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and echinacea (Echinacea purpurea (L.)

The criteria for evaluating the methods were weed growth, crop yield and cost effectiveness.

The first, or preliminary study involved the planting of 2 - 0 Douglas-fir seedlings on southerly aspects, using nine techniques, including a control. The second, or main study involving 2 - 0 Douglas-fir seedlings planted on southerly or westerly aspects, was for the purpose of investigating in greater detail the most promising techniques in the preliminary study. In the pre 1 iinary study, the nine planting techniques were control (planting only); scalping before planting; fertilizer pellet in planting hole; simazine spray over area next to tree; <b>paper</b> sheet <b>mulch</b> over area next to tree; scalping plus fertilizer pellet in planting hole; scalping plus simazine spray on bared area; scalping plus fertilizer pellet in planting hole and simazine spray; scalping plus pulverized fertilizer on bared area, topped with sawdust mulch. There were two sizes of plots, or tree planting spots: one was approximately 18 -inches square; the other was approximately ¼-milacre square. In both sizes of plots each treatment involving 25 plots was replicated twice, bringing the total number of plots to 900. After two growing seasons, observations showed that the large sized plots having the <b>paper</b> sheet <b>mulch</b> gave the best survival, with 38 percent. A statistical analysis of variance showed this was significantly better then all other treatments, except the one employing scalping, pulverized fertilizer and sawdust mulch (54 percent) and was nearly significantly better than the latter. In the main study, located on four adjoining aspects-southeast, south, southwest and west- the <b>paper</b> sheet <b>mulch</b> method of planting was investigated as follows: control (planting only); l 8 -inch paper squares; 27 -inch paper squares; 36 -inch paper squares. Rows of all four treatments (25 plots each) were replicated three times in four blocks on the four aspects, in completely randomized order. Therefore, except for differences in aspect row each row treatment was replicated 12 times. In all, there were 1200 plots. A time and cost study was also conducted. Because of poor stock, much of which was dead at mulching time and much of which did not burst its buds, survival results were {{based on the number of}} mulched and control trees that burst their buds rather than on the number of trees planted. After two growing seasons, best survival resulted from using the 36 -inch squares, with 60 percent, which was followed by 27 -inch squares, with 49 percent, 18 -inch squares, with 33 percent and controls, with 10 percent. A statistical analysis of variance showed differences in percent survival due to sizes of squares to be highly significant (P=. 01), whereas no significant differences were found due to aspects or the interaction of aspects and size of squares. In the time and cost study, it was found that ease of application decreased as size of paper increased and cost increased as size of paper increased. Conclusions were that it would take a square slightly larger than 27 inches to achieve a survival of 50 percent. Also, that by relating the cost of each treatment to the survival achieved under each, the optimum size square would be between 27 and 36 inches, which in the long run is cheaper than control or 18 -inch squares.

This {{is partly due to}} the prohibition of the use of chemical herbicides and to the high cost of labor in Guadeloupe (16. 54 € hours- 1) which reduce farmers’ investment and risk-taking in favor of this crop. Highly variable yields add to the uncertainty of growing yam and variations ranging from 5 to 40 tons ha- 1 have systematically been recorded. Research was carried out to decrease the workforce used in yam cultivation, especially as relates to weeding; and mineral content of the plant focusing on the intake of both fertilizer and organic matter (chemical and organic nutrient management). A new kind of mulch, made of biodegradable Kraft paper was developed, and the costs and efficiency for controlling weeds in three yam cropping systems: Kraft <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> (0. 2 kg m- 2), sugar cane residues of leaves mulch (2 kg m- 2), and no mulch were compared. The cost for installing mulches is around 4 000 € ha- 1 but it reduces the weeding time by 75 % and saves 8 000 € ha- 1. With these mulches, yam does not compete with weeds for water or minerals and the yield is at least equal or higher (up to + 40 %) to that of a culture conducted in normal conditions. On the other hand, we studied the effects of chemical fertilizer and compost on yam yield. It was observed that a mixture of chemical fertilizer and compost was more favorable (yield + 20 %) than separate use of either one. A way to boost the yam sector in Guadeloupe would be to mobilize new mulching techniques, and to provide the nutrients needs of the crop and understand how soil density influences yam yield...|$|E
40|$|New use of mulch is {{proposed}} to improve the soil moisture preservation capacity from a viewpoint of the application of unused materials to agriculture in the Middle East. 	This <b>paper</b> describes the <b>mulch</b> performance of the date-palm, i. e. evaporation control and suppression of soil-temperature rise associated with incoming short-wave radiation through heat and moisture transfer experiments that were conducted using soil columns and date-palm chips.

30|$|Mulch {{has been}} into a common use in crop cultivation, yet {{with a number}} of drawbacks, {{such as the use of}} {{environmentally}} unfriendly synthetic materials that are hard to degrade (transparent plastic, PHP, etc.), apart from their high price that are less affordable for farmers (O’Brine and Thompson 2010; Coolong 2012; Kasirajan and Ngouajio 2012; Miles et al. 2012). However, the use of organic mulch from rice straw, litter, and others are unstable at the time. Accordingly, it is urgent to come up with alternative organic materials from the accessible surrounding environment to be made for organic mulch for the farming field with simple technology. Organic mulch requires modification into more effective and efficient forms in usage by modifying it into sheet forms. Besides, the use of <b>paper</b> as <b>mulch</b> has been developed in some patents such as using cellulose fibers with additional materials, cellulosic pulp with biodegradation-retarding agent and addition of fertilizer to optimize mulch function (Wright 1936; Pratt and Medford 1955; Yoko et al. 1986; Peter. F et al. 2003). Most of these patents still used additional materials that are inorganic and relatively expensive to increase satisfactory mechanical strength.|$|R
40|$|Okra {{was grown}} in field plots of Tifton loamy sand {{naturally}} infested with the nematodes Meloidogyne incognita and Criconemoides ornalus and the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, F. roseum, and Pythium spp. Plots {{were treated with}} various soil pesticides and left exposed or covered with biodegradable <b>paper</b> film <b>mulch</b> under trickle irrigation. Soil was assayed for nematodes and fungi, and plant roots were examined for root-rot and insect damage. Fewer nematodes and fungi generally were recovered from soil treated with DD-MENCS (with and without film mulch) or methyl bromide-chloropicrin (2 : 1) (MBC) and film mulch than from nontreated soil. Funfigation with DD-MENCS or MBC suppressed populations of M. incognita, C. ornatus, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. roseum, and Pythium spp. Ethoprop (alone or combined with other pesticides), sodium azide, and chloroneb were less effective than DD-MENCS and MBC. Plant growth anti yield were greatest when nematodes and pathogenic fungi were controlled. Yield was increased 3 -fold by DD-MENCS + film mulch or MBC + film mulch {{in comparison with the}} average yield of okra produced in Georgia. The root-knot nematode-Fusarium wilt complex was most severe in nonfuntigated soil...|$|R
40|$|Trials were {{established}} at two locations to evaluate weed control provided by mulches and organic herbicides {{alone or in}} combination. Mulch treatments included barley straw, pine wood chips, paper, and no mulch (bare-ground control). Herbicide treatments included three organically certified herbicides: lemon grass oil (14 % v/v), clove oil (8 % v/v), and two rates of acetic acid (10 and 15 % v/v). Other treatments included pelargonic acid (7 % v/v), glyphosate (1. 06 kg ai/ha), and no-herbicide (control). Individual herbicide treatments were applied according to weed pressure and were determined every 7 to 10 days. Herbicide applications were made two and three times in 2009 at Logan and Kaysville, respectively. Treatments were carried out for a second year at both locations with herbicide treatments applied a maximum of four times. A third trial was established in 2010 at Kaysville with four application times. Weed control evaluations were made once a month, and weed population densities were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} end of the season. Weed biomass and percent weed cover were collected at the end of the 2010 season. Mulches each provided significant weed suppression in the first year, but each mulch presented unique challenges over time. For example, <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> effectiveness decreased over time as cracks developed during wet-dry cycles allowing weed seedlings to emerge. Volunteer barley became problematic in straw mulch plots in the first year of each trial, and annual weed seed germination on top of the wood chip mulch became problematic in the second year. The straw mulch consistently provided among the highest weed control and the least end-of-season weed biomass. Glyphosate and pelargonic acid gave near 100 % weed control among all mulch treatments, including the non-mulched plots. Lemon oil and clove oil displayed the same weed control ratings as the no-herbicide treatment in the three mulches (straw, wood chip, and paper), but displayed 41 – 95 % weed control when applied without mulch. While organically certified herbicides generally did not provide sufficient weed control alone, some mulches and organic herbicide combinations provided weed suppression similar to conventional herbicide application...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This thesis {{examines}} the 8 -year growth trend of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (mirb.) Franco), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex laws.), and whiteleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos viscida Parry). Manzanita stands ranging from 1700 /ha to 27000 /ha density were grown among mixed conifers {{of the same}} age, which were planted in 1981 at 250 x 250 cm spacing as 2 - 0 bareroot seedlings. Four years of herb control was provided by herbicides or <b>paper</b> <b>mulch</b> in all spacings. At a density of 13500 /ha of manzanita, plots were grown with no control of herbs, and others were grown with no conifers. Mixed conifers also were grown with no competitors, and some plots, initially free of all vegetation, later supported only annual herbs. Three sites were used in a complete randomized block design with nine treatments as above. All were located on south slopes at low elevation in southwest Oregon, representing the warmest and driest area of the Douglas-fir region. Conifer stem volume and biomass yield were inhibited quantitatively by manzanita competition. As manzanita density increased the yield of conifers decreased in an increasing trend through time. Significant biomass yield decrease (14 percent) was associated with 17 percent brush cover in ponderosa pine. Douglas-fir had high mortality in manzanita at less than 27000 /ha density, while ponderosa pine mortality was minor. Herb competition severely inhibited survival and growth of both manzanita and conifers. Shrub canopy cover reached a maximum by age seven at 27000 manzanita/ha density, but continued to expand at lower densities. Shrub yield was not affected by conifer growth, but intraspecific competition at the high densities of manzanita decreased yield and caused high mortality by the seventh year. Soil moisture was depleted most rapidly in the top 30 cm of soil. When manzanita competition occurred, soil water was depleted more than in pure conifer or pure herb stands. Manzanita used most of the available soil water to below 60 cm {{early in the season}} (May-June). Trees in pure conifer plots grew at the fastest rate, and ended the summer with the highest soil moisture content. Conifers can survive and grow satisfactorily under harsh environments if brush cover is reduced to low densities, and herbs are sprayed in the first two to three years. Ponderosa pine is better suited for reforestation of hot south aspects in the foothill region. Douglas-fir needs higher levels of brush and herb control, and remain vulnerable to intense heat and drought through age eight...|$|E
40|$|A {{shift in}} public demand towards more organic and locally {{produced}} {{fruit and vegetables}} has been occurring across the United States in recent years. A common practice in organic fruit production is the application of organic ground covers to supply nutrients while enhancing other soil properties. A need for research exists in the southern region of the U. S. examining the effects of regionally applicable ground cover and nutrient management on nitrogen availability and the microbial community to provide information to organic farmers in the region. Two studies were conducted to determine how 12 treatment combinations of four ground covers (compost, wood chips, <b>paper</b> <b>mulch,</b> and mow-and-blow) and three organic fertilizers (poultry litter, organic commercial fertilizer, and a no-fertilizer control) applied every year in April from 2006 to 2013 affected soil properties. In the first study, soils from March 2007 and 2013 were analyzed to determine {{the long-term effects of}} the treatment combinations on soil chemical and biological properties at the 0 - 10 and 10 - 30 cm depths. In addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was performed on soil microbial DNA to determine if treatment additions over time had altered the denitrifying community. In the second study, soil biological and chemical properties were measured at the 0 - 10 cm soil depth before (March) and after (May) yearly ground cover applications (April) to determine how nutrient contents and microbial populations responded to additions immediately (May) and long-term (March) and if responses were the same each year or changed through life of the orchard. Organic matter increased through time regardless of ground cover treatment, with compost resulting in the greatest increase from 1. 84 % in 2007 to 5. 29 % in 2013. Soil water content, electrical conductivity, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH 4 +-N), and nitrate-N were all greater in 2013 than in 2007. Microbial species richness (R) was greatest in 2013 in soil receiving compost and wood chips compared to the other ground cover treatments and R in those two ground covers also increased significantly from 2007 to 2013. Shannon-Weaver index of diversity in 2013 progressed from greatest to least in the order of compost ≥ wood chips ≥ paper ≥ mow-and-blow control with diversity in wood chips significantly increasing from among the lowest diversity in 2007 to among the highest diversity in 2013. The second study revealed many treatment differences that were not apparent in the first study when comparing only {{the beginning and end of}} the study. Soil organic carbon (C) and N, microbial biomass C and N, NH 4 +-N, and enzyme activities increased through time, peaked during 2009 - 2011, and declined to levels with relatively few differences between 2007 and 2013 values. Denitrifying communities (nirK) analyzed by DGGE, were a sensitive indicator of treatment effects responding to ground cover treatments in 2007. The trends through time in dissolved nutrients and microbial biomass suggest that the microbial community was not growing continually over time, but shifting in composition and diversity of nirK-containing organisms and possibly other groups facilitating N-cycling...|$|E
30|$|The {{way to go}} {{is the use of}} {{sustainable}} farming practices for sustainable livelihoods, which is termed as ecosystem-based farm management practices (hereafter known as EBFMPs) in this paper. EBFMPs are farm-based practices employed by farmers to conserve soil fertility and improve the general health of agroecosystems for continuous delivery of ecosystem services. These practices can be indigenous farm-based practices adopted by farmers, which are essential in balancing agricultural output and the functional capacity of the agroecosystems in providing continuous services for present and future generations. On the average, the adoption of EBFMPs helps to maintain the fertility of agricultural lands through natural and biological means (Munang et al. 2011; Thiaw et al. 2011). They also balance nutrient requirement of crops resulting in more sustainable and resilient ecosystems (Rezvanfar et al. 2009). Specifically, the EBFMPs that are of interest in this <b>paper</b> include <b>mulching,</b> manure/compost application, crop rotation, efficient drainage systems, inter-cropping with legumes, soil/stone bunding, conservative tillage, and vegetation conservation. These practices are employed in irrigation and have implication on the health of irrigation ecosystems in terms of water flow in the whole irrigation landscape, soil fertility and vegetation. The aforementioned EBFMPs are usually used in combination. For example, an irrigator may employ two or more of these practices simultaneously on the farm within a single season. There might be trade-offs between higher yields and adoption of these EBFMPs in the short term. This is because the focus of the practices is not centred mainly on higher yields but for sustainable production and long-term irrigation ecosystem resilience for livelihoods.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of organic mulches, organic manures {{and renewable energy}} sources on the soil is effective in {{improving the quality of}} soil and increasing crop yield especially in organic farming. This <b>paper</b> discussed organic <b>mulches,</b> organic manures and renewable energy sources for sustainable farming in agro-ecosystem. Organic mulches such as bark products, wood chips, deciduous tree leaves, mint compost, saw dust; organic manures such as urine, poultry manure, bat guano, bone meat, fish meal and some renewable wastes such as biomass waste, plant wastes and human wastes have been identified. Besides controlling weeds, erosions, conserving moisture and sustaining soil productivity by improving physical and biological soil conditions and preventing degradation of the soil, they also serve as soil amendment and natural sources for subsequent crops upon mineralization and also help to attract earthworm. The use of organic mulches, organic manures and renewable energy sources is therefore recommended, considering the high cost of inorganic fertilizer, nutrient run- off and a number of health issues that result from agro chemical residue.

40|$|Mulching is used {{to improve}} the {{condition}} of agricultural soils by covering the soil with different materials, mainly black polyethylene (PE). However, problems derived from its use are how to remove it from the field and, {{in the case of}} it remaining in the soil, the possible effects on it. One possible solution is to use biodegradable plastic (BD) or <b>paper</b> (PP), as <b>mulch,</b> which could present an alternative, reducing nonrecyclable waste and decreasing the environmental pollution associated with it. Determination of mulch residues in the ground is one of the basic requirements to estimate the potential of each material to degrade. This study has the goal of evaluating the residue of several mulch materials over a crop campaign in Central Spain through image analysis. Color images were acquired under similar lighting conditions at the experimental field. Different thresholding methods were applied to binarize the histogram values of the image saturation plane in order to show the best contrast between soil and mulch. Then the percentage of white pixels (i. e., soil area) was used to calculate the mulch deterioration. A comparison of thresholding methods and the different mulch materials based on percentage of bare soil area obtained is shown...|$|R
