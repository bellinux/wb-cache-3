5000|$|Several {{dictionaries}} cite 1988 as {{the first}} time the word himbo was used. By then, the word bimbo, which earlier in the 20th century had been used for both males and females, was being used predominately for females, so himbo, a combination of [...] "him" [...] and [...] "bimbo", was coined to refer specifically to males. The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English cites a 1988 Washington <b>Post</b> <b>description</b> of a [...] "macho himbo who strutted the Croisette wearing a 16 foot python like a stole around his shoulders and neck".|$|E
40|$|The verbal overshadowing effect (VO) (eg, Schooler and Engstler-Schooler, 1990 Cognitive Psychology 22 (1) 36 – 71) {{suggests}} that the fact of generating a verbal description of a previously seen face may impair subsequent performance on a lineup identification task in adults. Previous research has examined whether descriptions also impaired children’s identification abilities but no evidence of VO was found (Memon and Rose, 2002 Psychology, Crime and Law 8 (3), 229 – 242). However, the method {{might not have been}} appropriate to observe this effect as, for instance, a 24 -hour delay between the description and the identification tasks (associated with a release of the VO effect in adults) was used. Hence, in this current experiment, groups of children (7 – 8, 10 – 11, 13 – 14 years old) and adults were presented with a short video and then assigned to a description or a no description condition before the identification task. Participants were also assigned either to a “no delay”, a “ 24 -hour post encoding delay” or a “ 24 -hour <b>post</b> <b>description</b> delay” condition to determine the influence of delay on the VO effect. Results indicated that, compared to the control condition, the description decreased correct identification performance in both children and adults and no release of VO was found with delay.

40|$|School-based speech-language {{therapists}} play {{a significant}} role in terms of education and rehabilitation in the lives of learners with multiple disabilities. Assessment forms a critical part of a speech-language therapist’s <b>post</b> <b>description</b> and is the cornerstone of any type of intervention. The assessment of learners with multiple disabilities poses as a great challenge to speech-language therapists. These challenges include a lack of guidelines, resources, appropriate standardized tests and the heterogeneity of the group of learners labelled as multiply disabled. This research project aimed at describing the methods of assessment that school-based speech-language therapists use when assessing learners with multiple disabilities. Additionally, these methods were compared to international best practice. The first phase of the study consisted of compiling a set of guidelines with the purpose of providing a framework for a proposed set of guidelines for the assessment of learners. These guidelines were based on the principles as recommended by the literature regarding best practice. Because a qualitative approach was adopted for this research project, the second phases consisted of data collection, utilising eight focus groups as well as document reviews. On average, each focus group consisted of two to four participants. The data was then analysed thematically and compared to a checklist. The results indicated that speech-language therapists encountered many obstacles when assessing learners with multiple disabilities. It was evident that the participating speech-language therapists assessed within a multidisciplinary team and that they used formal as well as informal methods of assessment with learners with multiple disabilities. Discrepancies were found between the collected data and the guidelines. The guidelines were then used to propose a way forward for speechlanguage therapists when assessing learners with multiple disabilities in schools in Gauteng...|$|E

40|$|Background: Self-guided, Web-based {{interventions}} for depression show promising results but suffer from high attrition and low user engagement. Online peer support networks {{can be highly}} engaging, but they show mixed results and lack evidence-based content. Objective: Our aim was to introduce and evaluate a novel Web-based, peer-to-peer cognitive reappraisal platform designed to promote evidence-based techniques, with the hypotheses that (1) repeated use of the platform increases reappraisal and reduces depression and (2) that the social, crowdsourced interactions enhance engagement. Methods: Participants aged 18 - 35 were recruited online and {{were randomly assigned to}} the treatment group, “Panoply ” (n= 84), or an active control group, online expressive writing (n= 82). Both are fully automated Web-based platforms. Participants were asked to use their assigned platform for a minimum of 25 minutes per week for 3 weeks. Both platforms involved <b>posting</b> <b>descriptions</b> of stressful thoughts and situations. Participants on the Panoply platform additionally received crowdsourced reappraisal support immediately after submitting a post (median response time= 9 minutes). Panoply participants could also practice reappraising stressful situations submitted by other users. Online questionnaires administered at baseline and 3 weeks assessed depression symptoms, reappraisal, and perseverative thinking.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the development and}} outcomes of an intra-campus partnership that has changed the culture of scholarship and dissemination at a university that values community-engaged and translational research. Translating Research into Practice (TRIP) was established by Chancellor Charles Bantz and Dr. Sandra Petronio in 2003 to identify, celebrate and promote translational research; research that uses generated knowledge to solve problems and make lives better. In addition to sponsoring awards and convening regular translational research showcases, TRIP started a website and invited faculty members to <b>post</b> <b>descriptions</b> of their translational research projects. In the process, these TRIP scholars provided a public-facing, web-based inventory of scholarship relevant to the community. ScholarWorks, an open access, web-based repository for posting faculty and student articles, theses, proceedings, posters and other creations, was launched in 2004 by the Dean of the University Library. As an open access repository, ScholarWorks gave the campus the ability to share research with a broad community of students, educators, health care workers, policy makers, citizens, and readers without worrying about subscription paywalls or limited access to printed materials. Recently, {{it became clear to}} both TRIP and to ScholarWorks that these efforts were complimentary and could be aligned in ways that would increase participation in both programs. In addition, by freely sharing access to the scholarly publications resulting from community-based and translational research projects, the TRIP-ScholarWorks partnership helps to complete the circle of benefits to community, student and research stakeholders. Similar partnerships could be pursued on many campuses...|$|R
