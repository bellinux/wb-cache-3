50|$|In a {{phylogenetic tree}} {{published}} in 1987 by Tim Flannery and his colleagues, Phalanger lullulae {{was believed to}} share the same states with Phalanger intercastellanus {{also known as the}} Eastern common cuscus. A morphological consensus tree shows that the Phalanger lullulae is related to the Mountain cuscus (Phalanger carmelatie), Phalanger interpositus, Stein's cuscus (Phalanger vestitus), and the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis). This phylogenetic tree was created by Tim Flannery and his colleagues in 1987 but was also reanalyzed by Ruedas and Morales in 2005. A partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Ruedas and Morales demonstrated the firstly mentioned relationship between the Phalanger lullulae and Phalanger intercastellanus. The Partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Hamilton and Springer demonstrated that the Phalanger lullulae is most closely related to the Northern common cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis).</b> An ML tree of the nuclear gene BRCA1 created by Raterman and his colleagues shows the Phalanger lullulae's close relationship to the <b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis</b> as well. While these aforementioned phylogenies are more certain, there is another proposed morphological phylogeny by Flannery that demonstrates the uncertainty of the Phalanger lullulae's relationship among the <b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis</b> and <b>Phalanger</b> vestitus.|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} common cuscus (<b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis),</b> {{also known}} as the grey cuscus, is a species of marsupial in the family Phalangeridae native to northern New Guinea and adjacent smaller islands, but is now also found in the Bismarck Archipelago, south-east and central Moluccas, the Solomons and Timor, where it {{is believed to have been}} introduced in prehistoric times. It was formerly considered conspecific with the allopatric P. intercastellanus and P. mimicus.|$|R
40|$|The cuscus, <b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis,</b> was {{probably}} the most important food source in New Ireland from its introduction 20, 000 years ago until the introduction of the pig, Sus scrofa, 3500 years ago. Terrestrial, or land-based, fauna were {{an essential part of the}} prehistoric diet because they provided both protein and fat, which were often difficult to obtain from marine resources alone. P. orientalis was an important prey species because New Ireland had a relatively low range of prey taxa. Prior to 20, 000 B. P., the New Ireland fauna were relatively meager: the potential terrestrial prey taxa for prehistoric hunters included bats, rats, birds, and reptiles. The introduction of the cuscus dramatically increased the number of individual animals and therefore expanded the island-based protein resource available to prehistoric hunters. This paper investigates the nature of the late Pleistocene to Holocene capture of P. orientalis based on data from Buang Merabak, a central New Ireland cave site, and investigates whether prehistoric hunters captured P. orientalis of a particular age and how this changed over time.

40|$|The type-specimen (an {{adult male}} with skeleton), {{collected}} by Beccari {{on one of}} the islands of the Arou-Archipelago and described by Peters and Doria in 1875 (Ann. Mus. Civ. Gen. VII) {{and at the same time}} the only known individual, has been a puzzle to all students of the Phalanger-group. It therefore is of the highest interest that I found in the Lorentz-collection the three above mentioned specimens, prima facie distinct from all hitherto seen individuals of the orientalis-group, but at the same time exactly agreeing with gymnotis Peters et Doria. During the past summer I could study the type in the Genoa Museum, by the loudness of the Director Marquis G. Doria, so that I am absolutely sure of the identification. It hardly can be supposed that specimens of this species once have been brought over from New-Guinea to the Arou-islands, so that the living of this species both in New-Guinea and on the Arou-islands, is another proof for their land-connection in times past. However, notwithstanding there seems to be no doubt about the original locality — the Arou-islands — it is a very remarkable fact, that nobody since 1875 saw another specimen from the named islands, the more strange as before Beccari our traveller Baron von Rosenberg collected specimens, now in the Leyden Museum, of Phalanger maculatus as well as of <b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis</b> on these islands, and Wallace too procured from there specimens, now in the British Museum, belonging to these two species. This may be as it is, it remains however a fact that Peters described the species in such clear terms, that merely lack of material may be an excuse why later authors failed to accept it as a species distinct from <b>Phalanger</b> <b>orientalis.</b> Indeed, extremely striking is the kind of fur and its colour as well as the naked tail, only adorned with a rather small ring of fur round its base; moreover the skull, concave like in orientalis, presents a dentition quite distinct from that of the latter species, especially by the very stout posterior premolar (p 4) in the upper- as well as in the lower jaw, placed by far not so correctly in the molar-row as is the case in all other Phalangerspecies...|$|R

40|$|The Roman town of Herculaneum, {{due to its}} burial by the {{eruption}} of Vesuvius in AD 79, provides the rare opportunity to study the diet of middle and lower class Romans living in an urban context in mid- 1 st century AD Italy. Knowledge concerning Roman diet, prior {{to the growth of}} bioarchaeology in the 1960 s and 1970 s, was derived from the ancient texts and focused primarily on the elite diet. The diets of the poorer classes have often been considered monotonous and unhealthy and consequently, malnutrition {{is believed to have been}} widespread in urban centres. Collaboration between the numerous sub-disciplines of bioarchaeology, including archaeobotany and zooarchaeology, has begun to take place amongst scholars working on the Vesuvian sites and diet is currently being studied using a more holistic approach. The ancient sources act as a secondary resource and it is now the physical food remains that play a crucial role in examining Roman diet and associated topics such as trade, health and nutrition. This thesis investigated the bioarchaeological remains from the Cardo V sewer that ran beneath the shop/apartment complex of Insula <b>Orientalis</b> <b>II</b> in Herculaneum. It is the first large scale study to combine both new and existing bioarchaeological material from Herculaneum in an effort to provide the site with its own bioarchaeological data set, particularly with regards to food and diet. In total, 220 L of soil was examined for carbonized and mineralized seeds, seashells, eggshells and fish bones. 194 taxa were identified, included including 94 botanical, 45 fish, 53 shellfish and two bird taxa. 114 of the 194 taxa can be considered edible foodstuffs. The statements of the ancient authors concerning dietary diversity have been examined in light of these findings and found to be comparable. The material displayed little taphonomic bias when compared to Pompeian bioarchaeological assemblages. The excellent preservation of the material, combined with data from modern food sciences, has allowed for much needed interpretation to take place in the areas of health and nutrition. The variety of cereals, fruits and seafood indicate close connections with the nearby land and sea and consequently, the economic implications of such extensive resource exploitation have been considered. A nutritional analysis of the finds have shown that diets were nutrient dense and healthy, enabling the people of Herculaneum to achieve modern day stature as well as survive and recover from illness. Thus it can no longer be assumed that those of moderate means ate an unhealthy and monotonous diet, that malnutrition was widespread in urban centres, and finally, that descriptions of foodstuffs in the ancient sources apply only to the wealthy.
