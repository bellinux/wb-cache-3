5|$|In 1989, the palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus {{published}} {{a revision of}} indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis. They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species.|$|E

Historically, {{estimates for the}} number of protein genes have varied widely, ranging up to 2,000,000 in the late 1960s, but several researchers <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s that the estimated mutational load from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit of approximately 40,000 for the total number of functional loci (this includes protein-coding and functional non-coding genes).|$|E

Derosier went on to add that in fact, the evidence pointed to evolution. That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent, so Behe should have known, since he quotes Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial flagellum points to evolution or Intelligent Design.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan {{plans to}} use the subway {{extension}} to spur the development of a transit-oriented city centre at Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station. Vaughan Councillor Alan Shefman stated the new city centre will eventually create the density to justify a subway. However, the Sheppard subway shows that while a subway may spur development, that development may not translate into a high subway ridership. As Royson James <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Star, commuter destinations may be scattered throughout the Greater Toronto Area where public transit is inconvenient to use.|$|E
25|$|Rudolf Steiner, who collaborated in a {{complete}} edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work, wrote The Philosophy of Freedom, which focuses {{on the problem of}} free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: freedom of thought and freedom of action. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> introduction. This separation of will from action has a very long history, going back {{at least as far as}} Stoicism and the teachings of Chrysippus (279–206 BCE), who separated external antecedent causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.|$|E

5000|$|Concluding, Williams <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapter how hyperdiffusionists fail to {{recognize}} solid archaeological research methods and/or ignore conflicting data and contextual evidence. They are [...] "tailoring their finds with any similar chronology or in-depth linguistic analysis that fits into their scenarios" [...] (Williams 1991, 255-256).|$|R

500|$|The Itinerarium Burdigalense (333 CE) notes: ‘At {{the foot}} of the {{mountain}} itself, is a place called Sichem. Here is a tomb in which Joseph is laid, in the parcel of ground which Jacob his father gave to him." [...] Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th-century records in his Onomasticon: [...] "Suchem, city of Jacob now deserted. The place is <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suburb of Neapolis. There the tomb of Joseph is pointed out nearby." [...] Jerome, writing of Saint Paula's sojourn in Palestine writes that 'turning off the way (from Jacob's well), she saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs' Jerome himself, together with the Byzantine monk George Syncellus, who had lived many years in Palestine, wrote that all twelve patriarchs, Joseph included, were buried at Sychem.|$|E
500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which {{are relevant to the}} current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{sued the}} BBC. The {{corporation}} vigorously defended its {{action on the}} grounds that the letter was justified criticism of a performer. Wilson questioned the letter writer's competence to pass judgement on his performance: while Wilson conceded that he used the [...] "intrusive H", as a legitimate ornament which his teacher, Jean de Reszke, inserted into several works, and admitted that he had used it at two points in his broadcast performance, neither of these occurrences had been <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> letter. Furthermore, two of the letter's cited examples, [...] "Pilate's Wife" [...] and [...] "purple robe", did not appear in his part of the work at all. During the three-day court case several expert witnesses were called, including Clive Carey who brought as evidence a score annotated by de Reszke. The judge, Lord Hewart, urged the jury to be [...] "extremely liberal": after 45 minutes deliberation, the jury decided against the BBC and the letter writer, and awarded Wilson £2,000 damages. The BBC chose not to appeal and shouldered the entire cost: in an internal memo the BBC Director General, John Reith, observed that in such cases a British jury would tend to favour the individual, rather than a corporation, and that to appeal might appear an unjustified use of the BBC's monetary power.|$|E

2500|$|The nazirite {{is called}} [...] "holy unto the Lord" [...] (Numbers 6:8), {{but at the}} same time must bring a sin-offering (Numbers 6:11) and his sins are {{explicitly}} referred to ("and make atonement for that which he sinned"). This apparent contradiction, <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Babylonian Talmud, led to two divergent views. Samuel and Rabbi Eliezer Hakappar, focusing on the sin-offering of the nazirite, regarded nazirites, as well as anyone who fasted when not obligated to or took any vow whatsoever, as a sinner. A different Rabbi Eliezer argues that the nazirite is indeed holy and the sin referred to in the verse applies only to a nazirite who became ritually defiled.|$|E

[...] In 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit cited Buck v. Bell to protect the constitutional rights of a woman coerced into sterilization without procedural due process.

2500|$|The {{greatest}} literary artists, Hazlitt had <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{essay on}} Godwin, give shape to their creations by infusing them with imagination. As creator of such works as Old Mortality, The Heart of Midlothian, and Ivanhoe, Scott, adhering closely to his sources, restricts his imaginative {{investment in the}} story, hemming himself in by the historical facts. Even so, he manages to bring the past to life. He is the [...] "amanuensis of truth and history" [...] {{by means of a}} rich array of characters and situations. Hazlitt recalls these characters in a rhapsodic passage, described by critic John Kinnaird as [...] "a stunning pageant, two pages in length, of more than forty Scott characters, which he summons individually from his memory, citing for each some quality or act or association which makes them unforgettable." ...|$|E

[...] A gas boom occurred in 1914/1915, and by 1931, several hundred gas wells were producing from the Devonian Huron shale. [...] Production came from shales 1,250 feet thick at depths from 400 to 1,840 feet. [...] Pressures were 3 to 135 psi flowing less than 20,000 cubic feet of gas daily, but was sufficient to furnish light for a house or two, and sometimes heat.

The approach by Harry Kim at one point, to which she suggested that he should disrobe in order to [...] "copulate", was suggested to be because of her curiosity about human mating practices rather than any traditional sense of attraction. The introduction of Seven on the series had subsequent effects on the series , as T'Pol (played by Jolene Blalock) was based on a combination of the Seven character and Leonard Nimoy's original Spock.|$|E
