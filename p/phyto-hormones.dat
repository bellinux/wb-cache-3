40|$|Background: Plant photoreceptors, phytochromes and cryptochromes, {{regulate}} {{many aspects}} of development and growth, such as seed germination, stem elongation, seedling de-etiolation, cotyledon opening, flower induction and circadian rhythms. There are several pieces of evidence of interaction between photoreceptors and <b>phyto-hormones</b> {{in all of these}} physiological processes, but little is known about molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying hormone-photoreceptor crosstalk. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work, we investigated the molecular effects of exogenous <b>phyto-hormones</b> to photoreceptor gene transcripts of tomato wt, as well as transgenic and mutant lines with altered cryptochromes, by monitoring day/night transcript oscillations. GA and auxin alter the diurnal expression level of different photoreceptor genes in tomato, especially in mutants that lack a working form of cryptochrome 1 a: in those mutants the expression of some (IAA) or most (GA) photoreceptor genes is down regulated by these hormones. Conclusions/Significance: Our results highlight the presence of molecular relationships among cryptochrome 1 a protein, hormones, and photoreceptors ’ gene expression in tomato, suggesting that manipulation of cryptochromes could represent a good strategy to understand in greater depth the role of <b>phyto-hormones</b> in the plant photoperceptive mechanism...|$|E
40|$|One {{strategy}} for sessile plants {{to adapt to}} their surrounding environment involves the modulation of their various in-ternal phytohormone signaling and distributions when the plants sense environmental change. There are currently dozens of identified phytohormones in plant cells and they act in concert to regulate plant growth, development, me-tabolism and defense. It has been determined that <b>phyto-hormones</b> often act together to achieve certain physiological functions. Thus, the study of hormone–hormone inter-actions is becoming a competitive research field for de-ciphering the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Among phytohormones, jasmonate and ethylene present a fascinat-ing case of synergism and antagonism. They are commonly recognized as defense hormones that act synergistically.

40|$|Abstract: If Solanum {{species were}} {{recommended}} for treating diabetes {{and another for}} cardiac debilities; then there is need to remove them from narrow genetic-base so that working on their further improvement will be enhanced. This trial was carried out at the National Centre for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, Moor Plantation, Ibadan in tropical rainforest zone, Nigeria. Interspecific crosses were made using five Solanum species; seed were excised from successful crosses and subjected to in-vitro evaluation via embryo-culture of the F 1 generation. Murashige and Skoog (MS) solution used with different treatment combinations indicated significant difference at P= 0. 05 for all desirable parameters evaluated: especially when low <b>phyto-hormone</b> was added (100 - 200 nM); hence we so recommend. Callus formation opened insight to fascinating biosynthetic processes and plant evolution, which will remain invaluable for future investigation. In the face of much controversy and suspicion levied on genetic engineering technology, marker assisted selection and mass production of elite plant varieties through tissue culture may remain the preferred choice for years to come...|$|R
40|$|Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a {{perennial}} crop producing deep roots and thus highly tolerant to {{soil water deficit}} conditions. However, seedling establishment {{in the field is}} very susceptible to prolonged and periodic drought stress. In this study, a “sandwich” system simulating a gradual water deletion process was developed. Switchgrass seedlings were subjected to a 20 -day gradual drought treatment process when soil water tension was increased to 0. 05 MPa (moderate drought stress) and leaf physiological properties had expressed significant alteration. Drought-induced changes in leaf proteomes were identified using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling method followed by nano-scale liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) analysis. Additionally, total leaf proteins were processed using a combinatorial library of peptide ligands to enrich for lower abundance proteins. Both total proteins and those enriched samples were analyzed to increase the coverage of the quantitative proteomics analysis. A total of 7006 leaf proteins were identified, and 257 (4 % of the leaf proteome) expressed a significant difference (p 1. 7) from the non-treated control to drought-treated conditions. These proteins are involved in the regulation of transcription and translation, cell division, cell wall modification, <b>phyto-hormone</b> metabolism and signaling transduction pathways, and metabolic pathways of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids. A scheme of abscisic acid (ABA) -biosynthesis and ABA responsive signal transduction pathway was reconstructed using these drought-induced significant proteins, showing systemic regulation at protein level to deploy the respective mechanism. Results from this study, in addition to revealing molecular responses to drought stress, provide a large number of proteins (candidate genes) that can be employed to improve switchgrass seedling growth and establishment under soil drought conditions (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD 004675) ...|$|R

40|$|According to {{outdated}} paradigms humic substances (HS) {{are considered}} to be refractory or inert that do not directly interact with aquatic organisms. However, they are taken up and induce biotransformation activities and may act as hormone-like substances. In the present study, we tested whether HS can interfere with endocrine regulation in the amphibian Xenopus laevis. In order to exclude contamination with <b>phyto-hormones,</b> which may occur in environmental isolates, the artificial HS 1500 was applied. The in vivo results showed that HS 1500 causes significant estrogenic effects on X. laevis during its larval development and results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed a marked increase of the estrogenic biomarker estrogen receptor mRNA (ER-mRNA). Furthermore, preliminary RT-PCR results showed that the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHbeta-mRNA) is enhanced after exposure to HS 1500, indicating a weak adverse effect on T 3 /T 4 availability. Hence, HS may have estrogenic and anti-thyroidal effects on aquatic animals, and therefore may influence the structure of aquatic communities and they may be considered environmental signaling chemicals.

In this study, we obtained transcriptome data of ‘Hongyang ’ from seven develop-mental stages using Illumina sequencing. We mapped 39 – 54 million reads to the recently sequenced kiwifruit genome and other databases to define gene structure, to analyze alter-native splicing, and to quantify gene transcript abundance at different developmental stages. The transcript profiles throughout red kiwifruit development were constructed and analyzed, {{with a focus on}} the biosynthesis and metabolism of compounds such as <b>phyto-hormones,</b> sugars, starch and L-ascorbic acid, which are indispensable for the development and formation of quality fruit. Candidate genes for these pathways were identified through MapMan and phylogenetic analysis. The transcript levels of genes involved in sucrose and starch metabolism were consistent with the change in soluble sugar and starch content throughout kiwifruit development. The metabolism of L-ascorbic acid was very active, pri-marily through the L-galactose pathway. The genes responsible for the accumulation o...|$|E
40|$|Ageing and {{senescence}} {{in plants}} remain poorly understood. Although meristem totipotency may allow woody perennials to be immortal, relative growth and photosynthetic rates typically decline with age. Trees of ages between 129 and 534 years were selected {{in one of}} the oldest extant populations of Scots pine. Apical branches were propagated by grafting onto homogeneous juvenile rootstock to eliminate the effects of size and environmental variability and isolate those due to age. The hormonal profile of leaves and seeds along with markers of the physiological status of leaves and their pattern of DNA cytosine methylation were measured 15 years after grafting. The percentage of total methylated loci in nuclear DNA increased with increasing meristematic age. However, only very few significant relationships were found between levels of <b>phyto-hormones,</b> pigments or physiological markers either in leaves or seeds and age of the meristem. In addition, shoots grafted from old trees grew as fast as those from younger trees and produced the same number of germinable seeds. Synthesis. We conclude that changes in DNA methylation can occur in old trees. The lack of apparent physiological deterioration in the grafted plants suggests that meristem senescence is not the main factor triggering whole-plant ageing in Scots pine...|$|E
40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana L. is {{considered}} a model plant for many studies as its genomic sequence was completely identified and its mechanisms in genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic regulation are often similar to other plant species. Seedlings of A. thaliana were exposed to cadmium, copper and zinc at two different concentrations, chosen {{on the basis of}} the levels of heavy metals realistically found in contaminated soils. After 7 and 12 days of exposure to metals, applied separately or in different combinations, plant shoots and roots were sampled and analyzed. Microscopic analysis revealed that root morphology was strongly affected by metal exposure, both alone or in combination, if compared to control plants. The different growth patterns observed for shoots and roots were likely due to a different production and proportion of auxins and cytokinins, the two most important classes of <b>phyto-hormones</b> affecting cell expansion and proliferation, respectively. The levels of trans-zeatin, dehydrozeatin and indolacetic acid, as well as the ratio auxins/cytokinins, were different among the plants treated with the metals above, and the perturbation given by cadmium appeared to be significant.

The great paradox is life in earth it that this gas (N 2) is inert and can only be reduced to a form assimilated by plants by different genus of bacteria called diazotrophs. These bacteria interact with other organisms including agricultural crops as the most famous one, the rhizobia of soybean. Another example recently incorporated to the cereal production routine is the application of another bacterium called Azospirillum brasilense described by the research group of Johanna Döberenier in the 80 ’s.

40|$|The rising {{temperatures}} are resulting in heat stress for various agricultural crops {{to limit their}} growth, metabolism, and leading to significant loss of yield potential worldwide. Heat stress adversely affects normal plant growth and development depending on the sensitivity of each crop species. Each crop species has its own range of temperature maxima and minima at different developmental stages beyond which all these processes get inhibited. The reproductive stage is on the whole more sensitive to heat stress, resulting in impaired fertilization to cause abortion of flowers. During seed filling, heat stress retards seed growth by affecting all the biochemical events to reduce seed size. Unfavorable temperature may significantly affect photosynthesis, respiration, water balance, and membrane stability of leaves. To combat heat stress, plants acquire various defense mechanisms for their survival such as maintaining membrane stability, and scavenging reactive oxygen species by generating antioxidants and stress proteins. Thermo-tolerance can be improved by the accumulation of various compounds of low molecular mass known as thermo-protectants as well as <b>phyto-hormones.</b> Exogenous application of these molecules has benefited plants growing under heat stress. Alternatively, transgenic plants over-expressing the enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of these molecules may be raised to increase their endogenous levels to improve heat tolerance. In recent times, various transgenics have been developed with improved thermo-tolerance having potential benefits for inducing heat tolerance in food crops. Updated information about {{of the effects of}} heat stress on various food crops and their responses as well as adaptive mechanisms is reviewed here...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{comparison of}} transcriptional responses of organisms {{is a powerful}} tool in functional genomics. For example, mutants may be characterized by comparing their transcript profiles to those obtained in other experiments querying the effects on gene expression of many experimental factors including treatments, mutations and pathogen infections. Similarly, drugs may be discovered by {{the relationship between the}} transcript profiles effectuated or impacted by a candidate drug and by the target disease. The integration of such data enables systems biology to predict the interplay between experimental factors affecting a biological system. Unfortunately, direct comparisons of gene expression profiles obtained in independent, publicly available microarray experiments are typically compromised by substantial, experiment-specific biases. Here we suggest a novel yet conceptually simple approach for deriving ‘Functional Association(s) by Response Overlap ’ (FARO) between microarray gene expression studies. The transcriptional response is defined by the set of differentially expressed genes independent from the magnitude or direction of the change. This approach overcomes the limited comparability between studies that is typical for methods that rely on correlation in gene expression. We apply FARO to a compendium of 242 diverse Arabidopsis microarray experimental factors, including <b>phyto-hormones,</b> stresses and pathogens, growth conditions/stages, tissue types and mutants. We also use FARO to confirm and further delineate the functions of Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 in disease and stress responses. Furthermore, we find that a large, well-defined set of genes responds in opposing directions to different stress conditions and predict the effects of different stress combinations.

The highest incorporation of tritiated adenosine into polyribosomal RNA during germination {{was found in the}} ribosome fractions from embryos of grain gathered at full ripeness, lower incorporation was in preparations from embryos of milk ripe grain and the lowest in preparations from embryos of wax ripe grain. Different tendencies were observed in respect to the synthesis of ribosomal proteins. The highest incorporation of 14 C-amino acids into ribosomal proteins was found in preparations of ribosome fractions from embryos of milk ripe grain, lower in preparations of embryos from fully ripe grain, the lowest in preparations of embryos from wax ripe grain. ABA (10 - 4 M) completely inhibited the external symptoms of germination of immature embryos, while its inhibition of the synthesis of polyribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins was greater the more mature the embryos that were germinated. The greatest stimulation of precocious germination by exogenous BA and GA 3 was demonstrated in the least mature embryos {{isolated from}} milk ripe grain. Under the influence of both stimulators, an increase of the proportion of polyribosomes in the total ribosome fraction occurred in this sample, as did a rise in the intensity of ribosomal protein synthesis. The incorporation of 3 H-adenosine into polyribosomal RNA, however, was lower than in the control sample.

40|$|The world's brown marine algae, or kelps, {{have a great}} {{potential}} for agricultural use. Over 14 million tonnes of kelp {{are estimated to be}} available for harvesting every year, but only 6. 3 % is harvested, mostly for food products or alginate extraction. The inclusion of kelp in an animal's ration has been found by several researchers to have a beneficial effect on the animal's health and productivity. High concentrations of kelp in an animal's ration, however, can have detrimental effects on the animal's health due to toxic levels of certain inorganic salts. By including a dewatering operation in the production of dried kelp meal, much of the soluble salts present in the kelp will be removed with the filtrate. The filtrate would also be valuable as a source of potassium, trace minerals, and <b>phyto-hormones</b> for crops. Energy costs for dewatering are also much lower than for drying. Because kelp is difficult to dewater using conventional methods, a combined fields technique using electro-osmosis and mechanical pressure was investigated. Electric current and pressure were both found to have a significant positive effect on dewatering. Dewatering resulted in significantly lower ash and available carbohydrate fractions, while having no other significant effect on kelp meal composition. The combined fields dewatering resulted in significant total energy savings over conventional dewatering or drying alone. The combined fields dewatering process was successfully scaled up to a continuous process using a prototype roller press. The press was able to produce a press cake with up to 32 % solids. The continuous process resulted in significantly lower ash content and significantly higher protein. The total energy to produce kelp meal with the roller press was found to be about half of the energy required for drying alone...|$|E
40|$|Ozone (O 3) is {{the main}} {{photochemical}} oxidant that causes leaf damage in many plant species, especially in highly altered environments. When O 3 is incorporated into plants, it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) which interact with the synthesis of several <b>phyto-hormones,</b> such as ethylene (ET), salycilic (SA) and jasmonic (JA) acids. In the present work, the interaction between hormone and redox signaling pathways that regulate the programmed cell death (PCD), has been investigated in three-year-old saplings of Quercus ilex exposed to O 3 stress (200 ppb, 5 h) to verify if the response of this species resembles the biotic defense reactions. At {{the end of the}} fumigation, no O 3 -macroscopic leaf injury was observed. However, by microscopic observation, only the O 3 -treated leaves showed (after Evan’s blue staining) some blue stained areas in both exposure and recovery phases, identifying cell damage and dead cells. The induction and propagation of cell death were due to (i) activation of oxidative burst in form of biphasic productions of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and superoxide radical (O 2 -) firstly peaked after 1 h from the beginning of exposure (respectively + 79 and + 37 %, in comparison to controls) and secondly after 8 h (+ 67 and + 74 %) with higher values of H 2 O 2 after 24 h too (+ 64 %); (ii) hormonal regulation of O 3 -induced lesion formation with a significant production of ET, JA and SA which transiently peaked in the first 2 h (+ 50 % of ET and more than threefold higher of JA and SA in comparison to controls). Moreover, ET showed a second peak after 8 h (+ 94 %) and conserved higher values during the recovery phase till after 24 h (+ 76 %). These results indicate that ROS interact with hormonal signaling pathway regulating the sensitivity of Q. ilex to O 3...|$|E
40|$|Background and Motivation: Hydrological models mainly rely on {{empirical}} {{functions to}} describe rootwater uptake. However, {{in case of}} water limitation due to either scarce or heterogeneously distributedsoil water, plants have developed strategies to adapt. One short-term strategy is the regulation ofstomatal aperture either by plant hydraulics or <b>phyto-hormones.</b> The latter are thought {{to act as a}} kindof sensor for dry soil. It can be assumed that hormones are produced locally in single root segments asfunction of low root water potentials. After being transported with the xylem stream they becomeeffective in stomatal closure. Long-term adaptation strategies are mostly related to changes in carbonallocation within the plant and result in growth adaptations. Both strategies often remain insufficientlyrepresented in hydrological models. Methods: R-SWMS, a mechanistic soil and root water flow model that operates at the scale of a singleroot system was used to conduct a variety of virtual experiments. The model simulates threedimensional water flow through the soil, to, and within the roots. It was extended by a module toaccount for additional hormonal signalling, subsequently testing its influence in virtual split-rootexperiments. In a next step, direct mathematical relationships that link effective soil water potentialand transpiration were derived. Considering the long-term adaptation strategies, the numerical modelwas modified to incorporate measured dynamic root architectures. Results: Measured hormone concentrations in the leaves and some phenomena, like e. g. oscillations instomatal aperture, were reproduced by the model. The direct relationships between soil water potentialand transpiration showed that the stomatal behaviour depends on the underlying control and itsparameterization. Experimental data, visualizing root systems over a 30 day growth period, wereobtained from UFZ Halle, Germany, by CT scans. This dataset showed that plants grown underpermanently limited water supply were considerably smaller with correspondingly less total wateruptake compared to plants with initially unrestricted water resources. In combination with thenumerical model, the flow dynamics in the soil-root system were resolved. The predicted location ofroot water uptake was found to be different from the measured zone of water depletion. Conclusion: The implementation of bio-physical relationships into a mechanistic root soil modelresulted in a powerful tool to identify key processes for plant water use in agricultural environments. This work provided new direct relationships between the effective soil water potential andtranspiration rate in case stomata are controlled by hormones. In combination with an experimentaldataset it gave new insights into water pathways within the soil-plant continuum...|$|E
40|$|Erratic seed {{germination}} {{is one of}} the major challenges affecting tobacco production and adoption of improved varieties. This problem can be attributed to seed dormancy and environmental conditions. After-ripening {{is one of the}} pragmatic approaches used to enhance the germination of freshly harvested tobacco seeds however the process of after-ripening is a slow and there is need to explore other approaches such as imbibition in <b>phyto-hormones</b> (gibberellic acid and benzyl adenine), imbibition in hydrogen peroxide and dry heat treatment. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of after-ripening temperature, dry heat treatment and imbibition solutions on germination performance and Î²- 1. 3 -glucanase expression of two selected new tobacco varieties viz KRK 26 R and T 71. In the first experiment the effect of after-ripening temperature and imbibition solution effect on tobacco {{seed germination}} performance under four different germination environments (20 oC light, 20 oC dark, 30 oC light and 30 oC dark) was evaluated. This first experiment was a 2 x 4 factorial experiment in a completely randomised design with after-ripening temperature at two levels (5 oC and 30 oC) and imbibition solution in four levels (benzyl adenine, distilled water, gibberellic acid and hydrogen peroxide). Freshly harvested seeds were sampled from the two after-ripening temperatures every two weeks for eight weeks and imbibed in the four respective imbibition solutions. In the second experiment the effect of after- ripening temperature and imbibition solution on Î²- 1, 3 -glucanase activity in T 71 and KRK 26 R incubated under 30 oC light and 30 oC dark was determined using the similar design as the first experiment. The enzyme activity of seeds stored for eight weeks at the two respective after ripening temperatures and imbibed in the four solutions was determined using the reducing sugar spectrophotometry method. The objective of the third experiment was to determine the effect of dry heat treatment (DHT) and imbibition solution on tobacco seed germination percentage performance under 30 oC light and 30 oC dark. This third experiment was a 4 x 4 factorial experiment laid out in completely randomised design with DHT done at 37 oC. The DHT had four levels (30 oC after-ripened seed + no DHT, 5 oC after-ripened seed + no DHT, 30 oC after-ripened seed + seven days DHT and 5 oC after-ripened seed + seven days DHT) and imbibition solution had four levels (benzyl adenine, distilled water, gibberellic acid and hydrogen peroxide). In the first experiment after-ripening temperature and imbibition solutions had interaction (P 0. 05). The second experiment showed that Î²- 1, 3 â€“glucanase activity is enhanced by exogenous application of gibberellic acid under both 30 oC light and 30 oC dark. The exposure seeds at 30 oC after-ripening temperature marginally enhanced Î²- 1, 3 â€“glucanase activity under the similar conditions. An interaction was attested between DHT and imbibition solution on germination percentage of seed of the two varieties incubated at 30 oC light and 30 oC dark in the third experiment (P< 0. 05).
