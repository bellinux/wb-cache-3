The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status).

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{characteristics of}} electron beams and trapped particles of large <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> during substorms {{have been studied}} by examining the plasma data of the University of California at San Diego experiment on board the geostationary ATS 6 satellite. Approximating the observed distribution functions by a single Maxwellian or a superposition of two Maxwellians, it has been deduced that the electron distribution function is characterized by two temperatures, approximately 1 and 3 keV. The 3 -keV component is observed at all <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> from 10 to 90 deg. The 1 -keV component initially appears only within the electron beams which are confined to small <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> (approximately 30 deg). With time, this low-temperature component appears at larger <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> (approximately 30 deg). This observation has been interpreted in terms of scattering of the electron beams to large <b>pitch</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{features}} of synchrotron radiation are examined which occur when relativistic particles move at small <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> in a magnetic field. The emission from individual particles is computed. The general properties of the emission from distributions of particles with small <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> is discussed, and the emissivities and degrees of polarization for several specific source models are presented. For sources which mainly contain particles with small <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> the degree of circular polarization will normally be high, whereas, if the magnetic field is somewhat irregular, the degree of linear polarization will be small. If the particle distribution also has a low-energy cutoff, the emissivity will vary linearly with frequency at low frequencies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that {{regenerative}} effect, which causes self-excited chatter vibration, can be suppressed in many cases by utilizing irregular pitch tools. In order to suppress the regenerative effect sufficiently, a suitable combination of irregular <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> needs to be designed. Although the past researches proposed a basic idea to design irregular <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> for the regeneration suppression, they are only applicable to the suppression of single-mode regeneration. The present study proposes a novel design method of irregular pitch cutters, which ensures the simultaneous suppression of multi-mode regenerations. In order to quantify the regenerative effect, a new parameter called as the “Regeneration Factor” is proposed. The effect of <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> designed by the proposed method on chatter suppression is investigated analytically, and its validity is verified...|$|R

The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade <b>pitch</b> <b>angle,</b> thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run.

25|$|Acceleration of auroral charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{anomalous}} cyclotron resonance between relativistic electrons and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) triggered emissions takes place very effectively near the magnetic equator because of the variation of the ambient magnetic field. Efficient precipitations are caused by nonlinear trapping of relativistic electrons by electromagnetic wave potentials formed by EMIC triggered emissions. We derive the necessary conditions of the wave amplitude, kinetic energies, and <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> that must be satisfied for the nonlinear wave trapping. We have conducted test particle simulations {{with a large number}} of relativistic electrons trapped by a parabolic magnetic field near the magnetic equator. In the presence of coherent EMIC-triggered emissions with increasing frequencies, a substantial amount of relativistic electrons is trapped by the wave, and the relativistic electrons at high <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> are guided to lower <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> within a short time scale much less than a second, resulting in rapid precipitation of relativistic electrons or relativistic electron microbursts...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} role of the quasi-linear {{diffusion}} (QLD) in producing X-ray emission by means of ultra-relativistic electrons in AGN magnetospheric flows. We examined two regions: (a) an area close to the black hole and (b) the outer magnetosphere. The synchrotron emission has been studied for ultra-relativistic electrons and was shown that the QLD generates the soft and hard X-rays, close to the black hole and on the light cylinder scales respectively. By considering the cyclotron instability, we show that despite the short synchrotron cooling timescales, the cyclotron modes excite transverse and longitudinal-transversal waves. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the synchrotron reaction force and a force responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic invariant tend to decrease the <b>pitch</b> <b>angles,</b> whereas the diffusion, that pushes back on electrons by means of the aforementioned waves, tends to increase the <b>pitch</b> <b>angles.</b> By examining the quasi-stationary state, we investigate a regime in which these two processes are balanced and a non-vanishing value of <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> is created.
