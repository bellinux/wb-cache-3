40|$|The key {{findings}} of this report are that sesame is a suitable crop for poverty alleviation for smallholders in Benishangul Gumuz and that the smallholder model is competitive versus the large-scale investor model in terms of productivity. Farmers can achieve high profits without significant up-front investments. With minimal expenditure for sesame seeds and some simple equipment for ploughing, weeding and harvesting, farmers can cultivate sesame on a family labor basis. Potential income is higher in the smallholder model than from either communal land management, or from the salaries from large-scale investors. However, this potential is mirrored by the highest risk for farmers to receive the lowest income. Smallholders can mitigate this risk as well as increase their income further through membership of primary production co-operatives that offer higher sales prices and <b>paid-out</b> dividends...|$|E
40|$|In International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Strategic Analyses of the National River Linking Project (NRLP) of India Series 5. Proceedings of the Second National Workshop on Strategic Issues in Indian Irrigation, New Delhi, India, 8 - 9 April 2009. Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI). This paper {{attempts}} {{to identify and}} evolve a method for valuing and estimating the net gains from domestic and industrial water supply from the interbasin transfer schemes contemplated in the National River Link Project (NRLP). An existing interbasin transfer (IBT) scheme, namely Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP) and a proposed IBT scheme namely Polavaram- Vijaywada (PV) Link Canal were chosen for detailed analyses. Secondary data were used for identifying {{the region and the}} populations that benefited from the schemes. Economic gains arising out of water supply to the actual or potentially benefited areas were estimated. The estimation involved assessment of current costs incurred by the people in the area, in terms of both <b>paid-out</b> costs and time spent in fetching water. The saving in time was valued at market wage rates prevalent in the area and <b>paid-out</b> costs were assessed in terms of current market prices, ignoring the administered prices involved. The gains to urban populations were assessed by estimating the reduction in energy costs incurred by municipal authorities in undertaking the supply. Amortized capital costs for putting necessary hardware for distributing water from the IBT schemes as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of running these schemes were netted from the gains to obtain the figures for net economic gains. More indirect benefits such as reduced drudgery or improved educational performance as well as reduced health expenditure were recognized but were all ignored to ensure greater robustness in the estimates. Only net gains to the society were considered and hence gains arising out of creation of industrial estates within the commands were ignored since similar gains could also be obtained by locating these estates elsewhere. The net economic gains are seen to depend on both demographic features of the region and its ecology. Desert-like conditions of the IGNP-benefited areas tend to make the gains from domestic water supply schemes large, while similar gains in the Polavaram-Vijaywada areas are smaller. The net economic gains are of a significant order and would seem to indicate that, at least insofar as the dry areas of the country are concerned, these can perhaps exceed the gains due to increased agricultural production and hence could perhaps justify the creation of the schemes by themselves...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} infl ux {{of foreign}} direct investment into the Czech Republic from the territorial {{point of view and}} partly from the perspective of receiving branches. However, it is primarily focused on impacts of this infl ux, i. e. creation of an institutional sub-sector of foreign controlled companies. They operate mainlyin the sector of non-fi nancial corporations and dominate in sector of fi nancial institutions in the Czech Republic. This analysis is concentrated on the weight of foreign controlled companies on the performance and income characteristics of these two sectors and Czech economy as a whole, as well. Development of output, intermediate consumption and gross value added is used for non-financial foreign controlled companies as the performance characteristics and then profi ts and <b>paid-out</b> wages as the income characteristics. Problem oftaxes paid by these companies to the state budget is mentioned and development of their investment in fixed assets, as well. Financial foreign controlled companies are viewed in terms of their proportion of total assets, loans and deposits, capital and reserves and capital adequacy ratio. Finally, impact of {{foreign direct investment}} on employment and gross value added in branches of economy is analyzed and double-tracking in industry is identified. Conclusion summarizes benefits and negative effects of the foreign controlled companies in the Czech Republic within their existing presence in 1995 – 2009...|$|E
40|$|The {{sum insured}} of insured assets {{is one of}} the basic {{significant}} characteristics of insurance policy quality and is the ceiling amount of insurance benefit {{in the case of an}} insured loss. It {{is one of the}} parameters specified in the policy and affects the premium amount. The sum insured relates to the insured value of the asset. It is the highest possible loss which can occur to an insured loss and it is decisive for determining the sum insured. The policy holder determines the sum insured so that it corresponds to the insured value of the insured asset at the time of insurance policy signing. The policy holder is fully liable for setting the sum insured. The aim of this paper was to analyze the quality of the underwritten insurance according to the determined sum insured. Source data for the paper included critical analysis of literature based on valid Czech legislation and on general terms and conditions of insurance of individual insurance companies. The paper contains an analysis and comparison of types of insured values of assets for insurance needs on the Czech insurance market. An induction method applied to a real-life insurance case was used for explanation of the relationship between the sum insured and <b>paid-out</b> insurance benefit. The paper clarifies the significance and characteristics of the sum insured in the Czech Republic. The conclusion is that viewing insurance only from the angle of the premium amount is completely incorrect. Savings on the premium at the expense of reduction of the sum insured implies a risk of not renewing company operations or a living in a family house in case of an insured loss. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} examines the behavior of long- and short-term capital gains distributions {{after the passage of}} the Tax Reform Act of 1997, which lowered the maximum tax rate on long-term gains. Using a panel of mutual fund data, I examine the ratio of long-term to total gains distributions {{around the time of the}} Act, and find that fund managers appear to tilttheir distributions towards the long-term after 1997. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that managers are tax-sensitive, and the estimates are robust to the inclusion of fund-level fixed effects and other controls. I also examine fund capital gains patterns in a difference-in-differences framework, comparing actively managed to index funds; this technique gives a lower-bound estimate of the increase in the fraction of gains <b>paid-out</b> as long-term after the Act of five percentage points. The second chapter examines equity mutual fund dividend yields. Dividends are highly-taxed for individual investors, but tax-favored for corporate investors. Consequently, I hypothesize that corporate investors may prefer to hold higher-dividend yield funds than non-corporate investors. I use institutional funds as a proxy for corporate, trust, or non-profit shareholders, and find that these funds do have systematically higher dividend yields than their retail counterparts. These results are consistent with the tax clientele hypothesis, and are robust to the inclusion of a number of fund- and industry-level controls. (cont.) Chapter three, co-authored with James Poterba, documents the increasing use of redemption fees throughout the mutual fund industry. These fees are levied against investors who liquidate their positions before a specified time, and are paid back into the fund to compensate existing investors for the negative externalities of redemptions. We find that foreign and sector funds are more likely to impose redemption fees, and that institutional funds are less likely to have fees. Using data from the SEC, we find that the largest funds with redemption fees collected nearly $ 58 million in fees in 2000. We also find that funds with redemption fees appear to have lower turnover and higher returns than their no-fee counterparts, controlling for time, fund objective, and other characteristics. by Stephanie L.

40|$|Reforming {{pensions}} {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} challenges of the century. All OECD countries have to adjust to the ageing of their populations and re-balance retirement income provision to keep it adequate and ensure that the retirement income system is financially sustainable. Demographers have been warning us for some time that ageing is looming and that when it strikes populations and workforces will rapidly age. But many governments preferred to ignore the call for reform and cling to the hope of postponing solutions beyond the next election or claiming that rather painless remedies could be found. Immigration of younger workers, more women in work and higher productivity were put forward in the hope that more painful solutions could be avoided. All of these factors can certainly help to cope with ageing and especially with the financing of pensions but the increases necessary to compensate for ageing are so large that one cannot rely on them alone. Most OECD countries have realised this and have undertaken numerous reforms during past years. But pension reform is a difficult task. It involves long-term policy decisions under uncertain conditions and often the likely impact of these decisions on the well-being of pensioners is not spelt out clearly. More than most other areas, pension reform is a highly sensitive topic. Not only does it lead to heated ideological debates, but it makes people protest in the streets, and even forces governments to retreat from needed reforms. As people working on pension reforms around the world, we at the OECD Secretariat are asked time and again for the “right” solution to the problem. Which country does it the best way, which country is doing the worst job, which systems are the most generous, will it be possible to reform without increasing pensioner poverty, and will countries be able to pay for the promises they are making? There are no simple answers to these questions. National retirement-income systems are complex and pension benefits depend on a wide range of factors. Differences in retirement ages, benefit calculation methods and adjustment of <b>paid-out</b> pensions make it very difficult to compare pension policies across countries. Another problem is that life expectancies at retirement differ from one country to another, which means that some countries will have to pay pensions for a much longer period of retirement than others. As a result national debates are often full of misleading claims regarding the generosity and affordability of other countries’ pension arrangements. International comparisons to date have focussed mostly on the fiscal aspects of the ageing problem. But much less attention has been paid to the social sustainability of pension systems and the impact of reforms on the adequacy and distribution of pensioner incomes. But these aspects are also crucial if countries want to attain the dual objective of promising affordable pensions and preventing a resurgence of pensioner poverty. This report presents the first direct comparison of pension promises across OECD countries. It provides a novel framework to assess the future impact of today’s pension policies, including their economic and social objectives. It takes account of the detailed rules of pension systems but summarises them in measures that are easy to compare. Pension benefits are projected for workers at different levels of earnings, covering all mandatory sources of retirement income for private-sector workers, including minimum pensions, basic and means-tested schemes, earnings-related programmes and defined contribution schemes. Another novelty is the inclusion of the large effects of the personal income tax and social security contributions on living standards in work and in retirement: all indicators are presented gross and net of taxes and contributions. The framework can be used in different ways. As it is flexible to changing assumptions, the impact of policy reforms and economic developments on pension entitlements can be simulated. It can provide answers to questions such as what would happen if a country switched from wage to price indexation of pensions, or changed the benefit accrual rate. It can also inform on the impact of changes in economic growth, interest rates, wage growth or inflation on pensions of future retirees. The OECD will use the framework to monitor pension reforms in member countries by updating this report regularly. This report is the first in a biennial series which will be produced in co-operation with the European Commission. Public opinion on pensions is changing. People are realising that a shrinking number of young workers will have trouble paying for more and more pensioners. Time has come to open a frank debate among all members of society and address the question of how the cost of ageing should be distributed in each society. Our publication aims to contribute to this debate by shedding more light on the social and economic implications of pension reform. ...|$|E
