40|$|Inverse {{modelling}} is {{a useful}} tool for retrieving CH 4 fluxes; however, evaluation of the applied chemical transport model is an important step before using the inverted emissions. For inversions using column data one concern is how well the model represents stratospheric and tropospheric CH 4 when assimilating total column measurements. In this study atmospheric CH 4 from three inverse models is compared to FTS (Fourier transform spectrometry), satellite and in situ measurements. Using the FTS measurements the model biases are separated into stratospheric and tropospheric contributions. When averaged over all FTS sites the model bias amplitudes (absolute model to FTS differences) are 7. 4  ±  5. 1, 6. 7  ±  4. 8, and 8. 1  ±  5. 5  ppb in the tropospheric <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> (the column from the surface to the tropopause) for the models TM 3, TM 5 - 4 DVAR, and LMDz-PYVAR, respectively, and 4. 3  ±  9. 9, 4. 7  ±  9. 9, and 6. 2  ±  11. 2  ppb in the stratospheric <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> (the column from the tropopause {{to the top of the}} atmosphere). The model biases in the tropospheric <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> show a latitudinal gradient for all models; however there are no clear latitudinal dependencies for the model biases in the stratospheric <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> visible except with the LMDz-PYVAR model. Comparing modelled and FTS-measured tropospheric column-averaged mole fractions reveals a similar latitudinal gradient in the model biases but comparison with in situ measured mole fractions in the troposphere does not show a latitudinal gradient, which is attributed to the different longitudinal coverage of FTS and in situ measurements. Similarly, a latitudinal pattern exists in model biases in vertical CH 4 gradients in the troposphere, which indicates that vertical transport of tropospheric CH 4 is not represented correctly in the models...|$|E

The CO spectra were analyzed using an optimal estimation technique that separates the tropospheric and stratospheric/mesospheric components into partial columns. The distribution of CO in the polar winter is such that the gb-FTS retrieved <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> is weighted to the mesosphere. The gb-FTS data are compared with measurements of <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> CO from the Sub-Millimeter Radiometer on board the Odin satellite and shown to be in very good agreement despite the relatively small sample size.

The gb-FTS data indicate that there is a strong seasonal dependence of the CO <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> that is consistent with known winter polar thermospheric descent of CO enriched air. Year-to-year variability is explained in terms of mesospheric wind dynamics, which show 2004 and components of 2002 were affected by earlier than expected breakdown (30 ± 13 d) of the winter polar circulation compared with 2000 to 2003.

The differential slant column densities and vertical column densities from these instruments have been compared following the methods of the UV-visible Working Group of the NDACC (Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change). The instruments are found to partially agree within the required accuracies for both species, although both the vertical and slant column densities are more scattered than required. This might be expected given the spatial and temporal variability of the Arctic stratosphere in spring. The vertical column densities are also compared to integrated total columns from ozonesondes and integrated <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> from the ACE-FTS (ACE-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and ACE-MAESTRO (ACE-Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) instruments on board ACE.

This feature can be used manually to include biological expertise, or automatically, usually by pairwise similarity searches. Multiple local similarities are {{be expected to be}} more adequate, as more biologically relevant. However, even good multiple local similarities can prove incompatible with the ordering of an alignment. Results We use a recently developed algorithm to detect multiple local similarities, which returns subsets of positions in the sequences sharing similar contexts of appearence. In this paper, we describe first how to get, with the help of this method, subsets of positions that could form <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> in an alignment.

They are compared with in situ and lidar observations obtained during a series of aircraft measurement campaigns {{as part of the}} International Polar Year (IPY) POLARCAT activities in spring and summer 2008. Different air masses were sampled during the campaigns including clean air, polluted plumes originating from anthropogenic sources, forest fire plumes from the three northern continents, and stratospheric-influenced air masses. The comparison between IASI O 3 [0 - 8 km], [0 - 12 km] <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> and profiles with collocated aircraft observations is achieved by taking into account the different sensitivity and geometry of the sounding instruments. A detailed analysis is provided and the agreement is discussed in terms of information content and surface properties at the location of the observations. Overall, IASI O 3 profiles are found to be in relatively good agreement in the free troposphere with smoothed in situ and lidar profiles with differences less than 40 % (25 % over the sea for both seasons) and 10 %, respectively. The correlation between IASI O 3 retrieved <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> and the smoothed aircraft <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> is good with DC- 8 in situ data in spring over North American forest fire regions (r = 0. 68), and over Greenland with ATR- 42 lidar measurements in summer (r = 0. 67). Correlations with other data are less significant highlighting the difficulty with which IASI is able to capture O 3 variability in the Arctic upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) with sufficient precision as noted in comparison with the [0 - 12 km] <b>partial</b> <b>columns.</b> However the [0 - 8 km] <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> show good results with IASI which displays a negative bias (maximum of 26 % over snow) compared to columns derived from in situ measurements.

The method employed in the present study is based on minimizing an appropriate cost function (i. e. the weighted differences between the simulated and observed seasonal cycles of CO 2 concentrations). We tried to reduce impacts that the inaccuracy of a vertical mixing in a transport model has on the simulated amplitudes of seasonal cycles of carbon flux by using airborne observations of CO 2 vertical profile aggregated to a <b>partial</b> <b>column.</b> Effect of the vertical mixing on optimized NEP was evaluated by carrying out 2 sets of inverse calculations: one with partial-column concentration data from 15 locations and another with near-surface CO 2 concentration data from the same 15 locations. We found that the values of simulated growing season net flux (GSNF) and net primary productivity (NPP) are affected by the rate of vertical mixing in a transport model used in the optimization. Optimized GSNF and NPP are higher when optimized with <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> data as compared to the case with near-surface data only due to the weak vertical mixing in the transport model used in this study...|$|E

For land monthly averages, we find errors of 1. 9, 0. 7, and 0. 8  ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO 2; for ocean monthly averages, we find errors of 0. 7, 0. 5, and 0. 5  ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO 2. In the southern hemispheric biomass burning season, the new partial columns show similar patterns to MODIS fire maps and MOPITT multispectral CO for both vertical levels, despite a flat ACOS-GOSAT prior, and a CO–CO 2 emission factor comparable to published values. The difference of LMT and U, useful for evaluation of model transport error, has also been validated with a monthly average error of 0. 8 (1. 4)  ppm for ocean (land).

Accurate and precise measurements of methane {{are essential to}} understand quantitatively {{its role in the}} climate system and in global change. Here, we show a cross-validation between three data sets: two from spaceborne instruments and one from a ground-based instrument. All are Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs). We consider the Canadian SCISAT Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) -FTS, a solar occultation infrared spectrometer operating since 2004, and the thermal infrared band of the Japanese Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation (TANSO) -FTS, a nadir/off-nadir scanning FTS instrument operating at solar and terrestrial infrared wavelengths, since 2009. The ground-based instrument is a Bruker 125 HR Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, measuring mid-infrared solar absorption spectra at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) Ridge Laboratory at Eureka, Nunavut (80 ° N, 86 ° W) since 2006. For each pair of instruments, measurements are collocated within 500  km and 24  h. An additional collocation criterion based on potential vorticity values was found not to significantly affect differences between measurements. Profiles are regridded to a common vertical grid for each comparison set. To account for differing vertical resolutions, ACE-FTS measurements are smoothed to the resolution of either PEARL-FTS or TANSO-FTS, and PEARL-FTS measurements are smoothed to the TANSO-FTS resolution. Differences for each pair are examined in terms of profile and partial columns. During the period considered, the number of collocations for each pair is large enough to obtain a good sample size (from several hundred to tens of thousands depending on pair and configuration). Considering full profiles, the degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) are between 0. 2 and 0. 7 for TANSO-FTS and between 1. 5 and 3 for PEARL-FTS, while ACE-FTS has considerably more information (roughly 1  DOFS per altitude level). We take partial columns between roughly 5 and 30  km for the ACE-FTS–PEARL-FTS comparison, and between 5 and 10  km for the other pairs. The DOFS for the partial columns are between 1. 2 and 2 for PEARL-FTS collocated with ACE-FTS, between 0. 1 and 0. 5 for PEARL-FTS collocated with TANSO-FTS or for TANSO-FTS collocated with either other instrument, while ACE-FTS has much higher information content. For all pairs, the <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> differences are within ± 3 [*]×[*] 1022  molecules[*]cm− 2. Expressed as median ± median absolute deviation (expressed in <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> units or as a percentage), these differences are 0. 11  ±  9. 60  [*]×[*] 1020  molecules[*]cm− 2 (0. 012  ±  1. 018  %) for TANSO-FTS–PEARL-FTS, − 2. 6 [*]±[*] 2. 6 [*]×[*] 1021  [*]cm− 2 (− 1. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 6  %) for ACE-FTS–PEARL-FTS, and 7. 4 [*]±[*] 6. 0 [*]×[*] 1020  molecules[*]cm− 2 (0. 78 [*]±[*] 0. 64  %) for TANSO-FTS–ACE-FTS.

To find possible reasons for the CO trends, the global-scale EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model {{has been used in}} a series of sensitivity scenarios. It is shown that the trends are consistent with the combination of a 20 % decrease in the anthropogenic CO emissions seen in Europe and North America during the 1996 - 2006 period and a 20 % increase in the anthropogenic CO emissions in East Asia, during the same time period.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} empirical estimates of ozone loss in the Arctic vortex. They have used satellite and in situ measurements and have principally covered the Arctic winters in the 1990 s. While there is qualitative consistency between the patterns of ozone loss, a quantitative comparison of the published values shows apparent disagreements. In this paper we examine these disagreements in more detail. We choose to concentrate on the five main techniques (Match, Systeme d'Analyse par Observation Zenithale (SAOZ) /REPROBUS, Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), vortex average descent, and the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) ozone tracer approach). Estimates of the ozone losses in three winters (1994 / 1995, 1995 / 1996 and 1996 / 1997) are recalculated so that the same time periods, altitude ranges, and definitions of the Arctic vortex are used. This recalculation reveals a remarkably good agreement between the various estimates. For example, a superficial comparison of results from Match and from MLS indicates a big discrepancy (2. 0 +/- 0. 3 and 0. 85 ppmv, respectively, for air ending at similar to 460 K in March 1995). However, the more precise comparisons presented here reveal good agreement for the individual MLS periods (0. 5 +/- 0. 1 versus 0. 5 ppmv; 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 versus 0. 3 - 0. 4 ppmv; and 0. 16 +/- 0. 09 ppmv versus no significant loss).

Average Degrees of Freedom for Signal (DOFS) over a 0 – 9 km column range {{were found to be}} 4. 97, 3. 11, 0. 91, 1. 10, and 1. 62 for temperature, H 2 O, CH 4, CO, and O 3, respectively, when retrieved on 10 vertical levels. <b>Partial</b> <b>column</b> mean biases (and 1 σ bias) averaged across all flight campaigns were − 0. 4 (± 1. 9) %, − 6. 0 (± 13. 1) %, − 0. 6 (± 2. 1) %, − 3. 0 (± 18. 4) %, and + 4. 7 (± 24. 9) %, respectively, while the typical total a posteriori errors for individually retrieved profiles were 0. 4 %, 9. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 21. 2 %, and 15. 0 %, respectively. Averaging kernels derived for progressively lower altitudes show improving sensitivity to lower atmospheric layers when flying at lower altitudes. Temperature and H 2 O display significant vertically resolved sensitivity throughout the column, whilst trace gases are usefully retrieved only as <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> quantities, with maximal sensitivity for trace gases other than H 2 O within a layer 1 km and 2 km below the aircraft.

40|$|Three {{scientific}} ozone {{products from}} the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) aboard MetOp-A, retrieved in three different research teams (LA, LATMOS/ULB, LISA) with different retrieval schemes, are characterized and validated using ozonesondes measurements. The characteristics of the products are analyzed in terms of retrieval sensitivity, systematic and random errors, and ability to retrieve the natural variability of ozone and focus on different <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> from the lower troposphere up to 30 km. The validation covers the midlatitudes and the tropics and the period from January to December 2008. The products present degrees of freedom (DOF) in the troposphere between 1 and 1. 2 on average in the midlatitudes and between 1 and 1. 4 in the tropics. The DOF are distributed differently on the vertical depending on the profiles and the season: summer leading to a better sensitivity to the lower troposphere, as expected. The error estimates range between 10 and 20 % from the lower tropospheric <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> (0 – 6 km and 0 – 8 km for the midlatitudes and the tropics respectively) to the UTLS <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> (8 – 16 km and 11 – 20 km for the midlatitudes and the tropics respectively) for all the products and are about 5 % in the stratosphere (16 – 30 km) and for the column up to 30 km. The main feature that arises from the comparison with the ozonesondes is a systematic overestimation of ozone in the UTLS (between 10 and 25 %) by the three products in the midlatitudes and the tropics, attributed to the moderate vertical resolution of IASI and possibly to spectroscopic inconsistencies. The ability of the products to reproduce natural variability of tropospheric ozone is fairly good and depends on the considered season and region...|$|R

40|$|Emission of bromine from sea-salt aerosol, frost flowers, ice leads, {{and snow}} {{results in the}} nearly {{complete}} removal of surface ozone during Arctic spring. Regions of enhanced total column BrO observed by satellites have traditionally been associated with these emissions. However, airborne measurements of BrO and O 3 within the convective boundary layer (CBL) during the ARCTAS and ARCPAC field campaigns at times bear little relation to enhanced column BrO. We show that the locations of numerous satellite BrO “hotspots” during Arctic spring are consistent with observations of total column ozone and tropopause height, suggesting a stratospheric origin to these regions of elevated BrO. Tropospheric enhancements of BrO large enough to affect the column abundance are also observed, with important contributions originating from above the CBL. Closure of the budget for total column BrO, albeit with significant uncertainty, is achieved by summing observed tropospheric <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> with calculated stratospheric <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> provided that natural, short-lived biogenic bromocarbons supply between 5 and 10 ppt of bromine to the Arctic lowermost stratosphere.

40|$|The polar {{stratospheric ozone}} loss during the Arctic winters 2004 / 2005 – 2009 / 2010 is {{investigated}} by using high resolution simulations from the chemical transport model Mimosa-Chim and observations from Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), by applying the passive tracer technique. The winter 2004 / 2005 shows the coldest temperatures, highest area of polar stratospheric clouds and strongest chlorine activation in 2004 / 2005 – 2009 / 2010. The ozone loss diagnosed from both simulations and measurements inside the polar vortex at 475 K ranges from 0. 7 ppmv in the warm winter 2005 / 2006 to 1. 5 – 1. 7 ppmv in the cold winter 2004 / 2005. Halogenated (chlorine and bromine) catalytic cycles contribute to 75 – 90 % of the ozone loss at this level. At 675 K the lowest loss of 0. 3 – 0. 5 ppmv is computed in 2008 / 2009, and the highest loss of 1. 3 ppmv is estimated in 2006 / 2007 by the model and in 2004 / 2005 by MLS. Most of the ozone loss (60 – 75 %) at this level results from nitrogen catalytic cycles rather than halogen cycles. At both 475 and 675 K levels the simulated ozone and ozone loss evolution inside the vortex is in reasonably good agreement with the MLS observations. The ozone <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> loss in 350 – 850 K deduced from the model calculations at the MLS sampling locations inside the polar vortex ranges between 43 DU in 2005 / 2006 and 109 DU in 2004 / 2005, while those derived from the MLS observations range between 26 DU and 115 DU for the same winters. The <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> ozone depletion derived in that vertical range is larger than that estimated in 350 – 550 K by 19 ± 7 DU on average, mainly due to NO x chemistry. The column ozone loss estimates from both Mimosa-Chim and MLS in 350 – 850 K are generally in good agreement with those derived from ground-based ultraviolet-visible spectrometer total ozone observations for the respective winters, except in 2010...|$|E

Six different methods, including tracer-tracer correlation, artificial tracer correlation, average vortex profile descent, and passive subtraction with model output from both Lagrangian and Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs), have been employed {{to determine the}} Arctic ozone loss (mixing ratio loss profiles and the <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> ozone losses between 380 and 550  K). For the tracer-tracer, the artificial tracer, and the average vortex profile descent approaches, various tracers have been used. Here, we show that CH 4, N 2 O, HF, and CFC- 12 are suitable tracers for investigating polar stratospheric ozone depletion with ACE-FTS. The ozone loss estimates (in terms of the mixing ratio as well as total column ozone) are generally in good agreement between the different methods and among the different tracers. However, the tracer-tracer correlation method does {{not agree with the}} other estimation methods in March 2005 and using the average vortex profile descent technique typically leads to smaller maximum losses compared to all other methods. The passive subtraction method using output from CTMs generally results in smaller uncertainties and slightly larger losses compared to the techniques that use ACE-FTS measurements only. The ozone loss computed, using both measurements and models, shows the greatest loss during the 2010 / 2011 Arctic winter. For that year, our results show that maximum ozone loss (2. 1 – 2. 7  ppmv) occurred at 460  K. The estimated <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> ozone loss inside the polar vortex (between 380  K and 550  K) is 66 – 103  DU, 61 – 95  DU, 59 – 96  DU, 41 – 89  DU, and 85 – 122  DU for March 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Ozone loss is difficult to diagnose during 2005 / 2006, 2008 / 2009, 2011 / 2012, and 2012 / 2013 because strong polar vortex disturbance or major sudden stratospheric warming events significantly perturbed the polar vortex thereby limiting the number of measurements available for the analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tropospheric carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) was measured through out 2001 using ground-based Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometer at Moshiri (44. 4 °N) and Rikubetsu (43. 5 °N) observatories in northern Japan, which {{are separated by}} 150 km. Seasonal and day-to-day variations of CO are studied using these data, and contributions from various CO sources are evaluated using three-dimensional global chemistry transport model (GEOS-CHEM) calculations. Seasonal maximum and minimum FTIR-derived tropospheric CO amounts occurred in April and September, respectively. The ratio of <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> amounts between the 0 - 4 - and 0 - 12 -km altitude ranges {{is found to be}} slightly greater in early spring. The GEOS-CHEM model calculations generally reproduce these observed features. Further analyses using source-labeled CO model calculations suggest that the observed seasonal variation was caused by a combination of seasonal variations of various source contributions, in addition to a seasonal change in chemical CO loss by OH. A seasonal change in the meteorological fields largely control the changes in various source contributions. The contribution from fossil fuel (FF) combustion in Asia an...|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{the carbon}} {{monoxide}} (CO), ethane (C 2 H 6) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> (from {{the ground to}} 12 km) derived from measurements by ground-based solar Fourier Transform Spectroscopy at Lauder, New Zealand (45 ° S, 170 ° E), and at Arrival Heights, Antarctica (78 ° S, 167 ° E), from 1997 to 2009. Significant negative trends are calculated for all species at both locations, based on the daily-mean observed time series, namely CO (− 0. 94 ± 0. 47 % yr − 1), C 2 H 6 (− 2. 37 ± 1. 18 % yr − 1) and HCN (− 0. 93 ± 0. 47 % yr − 1) at Lauder and CO (− 0. 92 ± 0. 46 % yr − 1), C 2 H 6 (− 2. 82 ± 1. 37 % yr − 1) and HCN (− 1. 41 ± 0. 71 % yr − 1) at Arrival Heights. The uncertainties reflect the 95 % confidence limits. However, the magnitudes of the trends {{are influenced by the}} anomaly associated with the 1997 – 1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation event {{at the beginning of the}} time series reported. We calculate trends for each month from 1997 to 2009 and find negative trends for all months. The largest monthly trends of CO and C 2 H 6 at Lauder, and to a lesser degree at Arrival Heights, occur during austral spring during the Southern Hemisphere tropical and subtropical biomass burning period. For HCN, the largest monthly trends occur in July and August at Lauder and around November at Arrival Heights. The correlations between CO and C 2 H 6 and between CO and HCN at Lauder in September to November, when the biomass burning maximizes, are significantly larger that those in other seasons. A tropospheric chemistry-climate model is used to simulate CO, C 2 H 6, and HCN <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> for the period of 1997 – 2009, using interannually varying biomass burning emissions from GFED 3 and annually periodic but seasonally varying emissions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The model-simulated <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> of these species compare well with the measured <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> and the model accurately reproduces seasonal cycles of all three species at both locations. However, while the model satisfactorily captures both the seasonality and trends in HCN, it is not able to reproduce the negative trends in either C 2 H 6 or CO. A further simulation assuming a 35 % decline of C 2 H 6 and a 26 % decline of CO emissions from the industrial sources from 1997 to 2009 largely captures the observed trends of C 2 H 6 and CO <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> at both locations. Here we attribute trends in HCN exclusively to changes in biomass burning and thereby isolate the influence of anthropogenic emissions as responsible for the long-term decline in CO and C 2 H 6. This analysis shows that biomass burning emissions are the main factors in controlling the interannual and seasonal variations of these species. We also demonstrate contributions of biomass burning emission from different southern tropical and sub-tropical regions to seasonal and interannual variations of CO at Lauder; it shows that long-range transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa and South America have consistently larger year-to-year contributions to the background seasonality of CO at Lauder than those from other regions (e. g. Australia and South-East Asia). However, large interannual anomalies are triggered by variations in biomass burning emissions associated with large-scale El Niño Southern Oscillation and prolonged biomass burning events, e. g. the Australian bush fires...|$|R

This paper presents intercomparisons between ozone and NO 2 measured by the ACE and OSIRIS satellite instruments and by ground-based instruments at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), which is located at Eureka, Canada (80 ° N, 86 ° W) and is operated by the Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC). The ground-based instruments {{included in this study}} are four zenith-sky differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instruments, one Bruker Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and four Brewer spectrophotometers. Ozone total columns measured by the DOAS instruments were retrieved using new Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) guidelines and agree to within 3. 2 %. The DOAS ozone columns agree with the Brewer spectrophotometers with mean relative differences that are smaller than 1. 5 %. This suggests that for these instruments the new NDACC data guidelines were successful in producing a homogenous and accurate ozone dataset at 80 ° N. Satellite 14 – 52 km ozone and 17 – 40 km NO 2 <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> within 500 km of PEARL were calculated for ACE-FTS Version 2. 2 (v 2. 2) plus updates, ACE-FTS v 3. 0, ACE-MAESTRO (Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation) v 1. 2 and OSIRIS SaskMART v 5. 0 x ozone and Optimal Estimation v 3. 0 NO 2 data products. The new ACE-FTS v 3. 0 and the validated ACE-FTS v 2. 2 <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> are nearly identical, with mean relative differences of 0. 0 ± 0. 2 % and − 0. 2 ± 0. 1 % for v 2. 2 minus v 3. 0 ozone and NO 2, respectively. Ozone columns were constructed from 14 – 52 km satellite and 0 – 14 km ozonesonde <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> and compared with the ground-based total column measurements. The satellite-plus-sonde measurements agree with the ground-based ozone total columns with mean relative differences of 0. 1 – 7. 3 %. For NO 2, <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> from 17 km upward were scaled to noon using a photochemical model. Mean relative differences between OSIRIS, ACE-FTS and ground-based NO 2 measurements do not exceed 20 %. ACE-MAESTRO measures more NO 2 than the other instruments, with mean relative differences of 25 – 52 %. Seasonal variation in the differences between NO 2 <b>partial</b> <b>columns</b> is observed, suggesting that there are systematic errors in the measurements and/or the photochemical model corrections. For ozone spring-time measurements, additional coincidence criteria based on stratospheric temperature and the location of the polar vortex were found to improve agreement between some of the instruments. For ACE-FTS v 2. 2 minus Bruker FTIR, the 2007 – 2009 spring-time mean relative difference improved from − 5. 0 ± 0. 4 % to − 3. 1 ± 0. 8 % with the dynamical selection criteria. This was the largest improvement, likely because both instruments measure direct sunlight and therefore have well-characterized lines-of-sight compared with scattered sunlight measurements. For NO 2, the addition of a ± 1 ° latitude coincidence criterion improved spring-time intercomparison results, likely due to the sharp latitudinal gradient of NO 2 during polar sunrise. The differences between satellite and ground-based measurements do not show any obvious trends over the missions, indicating that both the ACE and OSIRIS instruments continue to perform well...|$|R

TIR instruments are conventionally considered to be inadequate for monitoring near-surface composition, because their sensitivity to the lowest part of the atmosphere is limited by the thermal contrast between the ground and the air above it. We demonstrate that IASI is capable of measuring SO 2 (here as a <b>partial</b> <b>column</b> from 0 to 2 [*]km) in Norilsk, thanks to the large temperature inversions and the low humidity in wintertime. We discuss the influence of thermal contrast and of surface humidity on the SO 2 retrieved columns, and estimate the retrieval errors.

The multi-spectrum approach consists of simultaneously combining, during the retrievals, all spectra recorded consecutively {{during the same}} day and with the same resolution. Solar observations analyzed in this study with the SFIT- 2 v 3. 91 fitting algorithm correspond to more than 2900 spectra recorded between January 2000 and December 2007 at high zenith angles, with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer operated at the high-altitude International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch (ISSJ, 46. 5 ° N latitude, 8. 0 ° E longitude, 3580 m altitude), Switzerland. The goal of the retrieval strategy described here is {{to provide information about}} the vertical distribution of carbonyl fluoride. The microwindows used are located in the ν 1 or in the ν 4 COF 2 infrared (IR) absorption bands. Averaging kernel and eigenvector analysis indicates that our FTIR retrieval is sensitive to COF 2 inversion between 17 and 30 km, with the major contribution to the retrieved information always coming from the measurement. Moreover, there was no significant bias between COF 2 <b>partial</b> <b>columns,</b> total columns or VMR profiles retrieved from the two bands.

For each times series, linear trend estimation for the 2000 – 2007 time period as well as a seasonal variation study are also performed and critically discussed.
