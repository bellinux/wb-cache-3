In either case actual fieldwork is most likely to be preceded by a phase of desktop research (reviewing existing data in the form of maps, formal and informal written records, <b>photographs</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings)</b> <b>or</b> in the modern age internet research using search engines, ancestry <b>and</b> birth <b>or</b> property records online.

40|$|With routine Internet use {{in much of}} the world, it {{has become}} {{possible}} to consider designing tools that support collaboration. Whereas network communica-tions links previously required semi-custom solutions for each user community, Internet/Web-based com-munications are capable of reaching a much larger group of people. HabaneroTM was written to facilitate the use of real-time multi-user software tools in education and the sciences. Unlike earlier projects (such as NCSA Tel-net, NCSA Collage, NCSA Mosaic), where different source code was used for each supported hardware platform, the Habanero framework supports multiple hardware platforms by virtue of implementation in the Java programming language from Sun Microsys-tems. Implementation in Java necessitates, with minor exceptions, production of only a single source code. Beyond the obvious economic advantages of a single source code base, Java allows passing instanti-ated objects between hardware platforms. Shared software tools quickly become important as distributed, virtual, ephemeral work teams are used to pool resources. Current collaboration practice fre-quently involves travel, face-to-face meetings, and the use of printed material <b>and</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>or</b> <b>drawings</b> in an attempt to communicate underlying concepts, design rationale, and the range of design options con-sidered. In complex problem domains such as CAD models, numerical visualization displays, and mathe-matical models, this very basic style of communica-tions generally does not provide sufficient expressive power. Further, when attempts are made to actually conduct work in such ways, the resultant amalgam of fax transmissions, overnight shipments, and tele-phone calls significantly burdens the process. If the principal design and analysis tools in use by the sci-entists and engineers could themselves be shared between colleagues, a team member could ver...|$|R

50|$|Sometime {{around the}} year 1000, Kahoʻolawe was settled by Polynesians, and small, {{temporary}} fishing communities were established along the coast. Some inland areas were cultivated. Puu Moiwi, a remnant cinder cone, is {{the location of the}} second-largest basalt quarry in Hawaii, and this was mined for use in stone tools such as koi (adzes). Originally a dry forest environment with intermittent streams, the land changed to an open savanna of grassland and trees when inhabitants cleared vegetation for firewood and agriculture. Hawaiians built stone platforms for religious ceremonies, set rocks upright as shrines for successful fishing trips, <b>and</b> carved petroglyphs, <b>or</b> <b>drawings,</b> into the flat surfaces of rocks. These indicators of an earlier time can still be found on Kahoʻolawe.|$|R
40|$|Many early {{childhood}} educators {{are beginning to}} experiment with and use portfolio assessment. Teachers are also observing young children at play and documenting their play activities for assessment purposes. Close observation of sociodramatic play gives teachers accurate perspectives on young children across the developmental domains of communication and cognition, and the aesthetic, physical, social, and emotional domains. However, insights gained through observation can be lost without some form of documentation. Teacher observations can be documented by means of checklists, rating scales, anecdotal records, <b>photographs,</b> <b>and</b> audio <b>or</b> videotaping. In addition to student work samples of writing, artwork, <b>and</b> individual <b>or</b> group projects, portfolio assessments should include documentation of children's sociodramatic play.

There is one carving of a horse's head <b>and</b> one <b>or</b> two <b>drawings</b> that suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin or tendon round it. But the little horses of that age and region could not have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was used as a led horse.

Despite his short life, he left an amazingly large collection of rich works, characterised by an expressive freedom in his use of colour, confident draughtsmanship and controlled impetuosity.

Some historical atlases try to present the entire history of the world, such as the Historical Atlas of the World, while others are more specialised, for only one time period or location, such as the Historical Atlas of the American West or The Historical Atlas of China.

One of his students was Andy Warhol, then Andrew Warhola, who drew upon his meals at home and made Campbell's Soup Cans. Other notable students include Warhol's friend Philip Pearlstein, illustrator Leonard Kessler, editorial cartoonist Jimmy Margulies, conceptual artist Mel Bochner and Joyce Kozloff, who developed an interest in public art when working on Lepper's Oakland Project in which students {{went out into the}} Oakland neighborhood <b>and</b> made paintings <b>or</b> <b>drawings</b> of the infrastructure, buildings and people. The project was written about in Richard Rappaport's 1989 paper Robert Lepper, Carnegie Tech, and the Oakland Project. The Oakland Project was the first semester of the Individual and Social Analysis course he started in 1947; The Retrospective was the second semester class for the program.|$|R
