5|$|The four-lane iconic skyway {{carries the}} US1/9 {{concurrency}} for most its length. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, US1 and US9 are generally north–south routes. The {{west end of}} the skyway begins as US1/9 roadway ascends and <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> Raymond Boulevard in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood. At Tonnele Circle, US1/9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge and the skyway becomes the four-lane Route139 as it <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> it. While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a cut in Bergen Hill, just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> the New Jersey Turnpike, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on landfilled wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands.|$|E

5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> relatively warm water.|$|E
