40|$|Chloroacetanilide {{herbicides}} are extensively used in {{the control}} of weeds and have widely resulted in nonpoint contamination of groundwater and soil resources. In the attempt to achieve better remediation for herbicide-contaminated resources, we investigated the reductive transformation of <b>propachlor</b> through nucleophilic substitution by dithionite (S 2 O 42 -). Results showed that <b>propachlor</b> underwent rapid dechlorination {{in the presence of}} dithionite. The reaction was of second-order kinetics and strongly influenced by pH and temperature. At pH 7. 0 and temperature 308 K, the rate constant of <b>propachlor</b> dechlorination was estimated at 123. 4 ± 0. 7 M - 1 h - 1. Within the pH range tested (3. 0 - 9. 5), higher pH promoted the ionization of dithionite, resulting in a more active nucleophilic reagent of S 2 O 42 - to enhance the <b>propachlor</b> transformation rate. Similarly, higher reaction temperature overcame the activation barrier of steric hindrance in <b>propachlor</b> structure and accelerated the excitation of dithionite, in which higher rate constants of <b>propachlor</b> reductive dechlorination were obtained. Dechlorination was found to be the first and necessary step of <b>propachlor</b> nucleophilic substitution by dithionite. Sulfur nucleophile substituted compounds, including <b>propachlor</b> dithionite, <b>propachlor</b> ethanesulfonic acid (ESA), and hydroxyl <b>propachlor,</b> were identified as the dechlorination products of <b>propachlor,</b> indicating bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 2) as the mechanism for <b>propachlor</b> transformation initiated by dithionite. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Propachlor</b> (2 -chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide) is an {{acetamide}} herbicide used in preemergence.

Identification of the intermediates of <b>propachlor</b> degradation by this strain and characterization of new metabolites in the degradation of <b>propachlor</b> by a previously reported strain of Pseudomonas (PEM 1) support two different <b>propachlor</b> degradation pathways. Washed-cell suspensions of strain PEM 1 with <b>propachlor</b> accumulated N-isopropylacetanilide, acetanilide, acetamide, and catechol. Pseudomonas strain PEM 1 grew on <b>propachlor</b> with a generation time of 3. 4 h and a Ks of 0. 17 ± 0. 04 mM. Acinetobacter strain BEM 2 grew on <b>propachlor</b> with a generation time of 3. 1 h and a Ks of 0. 3 ± 0. 07 mM.

The rate coefficient for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with <b>propachlor</b> was measured using a conventional relative rate technique. A value of the rate coefficient for the reaction of OH radicals with <b>propachlor,</b> kOH(propachlor) = (1. 5 ± 0. 3) × 10 − 11 cm 3 molecule− 1 s− 1 was determined at 300 ± 5 K and atmospheric pressure.

Concomitant with the inhibition of squash seedling growth and development, <b>propachlor</b> prevented the normal senescence of squash cotyledons. Cell wall expansion and breakdown and the utilization of proteinaceous and lipid reserves in the cotyledons were inhibited by <b>propachlor</b> treatment.

40|$|The {{process of}} in situ {{chemical}} oxidation (ISCO) by persulfate (S(2) O(8) (2 -)) {{can be accelerated}} by metal ion activation, which more effectively degrades subsurface pollutants by enhancing sulfate radical (SO(4) (-)) generation. This study compared the results of <b>propachlor</b> degradation by Cu(2 +) and Fe(2 +) activated persulfate and revealed differing degradation kinetics and mechanisms between {{the two types of}} activation system. The activation of persulfate by Fe(2 +) ions generally resulted in rapid degradation in the early stage, but was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in efficiency due to the rapid depletion of Fe(2 +) by the sulfate radicals generated. In contrast, the Cu(2 +) activated persulfate had a longer lasting degradation effect and a proportionally greater degradation enhancement at elevated Cu(2 +) concentrations. An optimal Fe(2 +) concentration should be sought to activate the persulfate, as a high Fe(2 +) concentration of 2. 5 mM or above, as was used in this study, may inhibit <b>propachlor</b> degradation due to the competitive consumption of sulfate radicals by the excess Fe(2 +) ions. Higher temperatures (55 degrees C compared with 30 degrees C) resulted in enhanced metal activation, particularly with the Cu(2 +) activated system. Furthermore, acidic conditions were found to be more favorable for <b>propachlor</b> degradation by metal activated persulfate. The ecotoxicity of degraded <b>propachlor</b> samples, which was indicated by average well color development (AWCD) for its microbial community activity, was confirmed to be decreased during the degradation processes with these two ions activated persulfate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The photoreduction of organohalides, CCl 4, CBr 4, and CHCl 3 and chloroacetanilides alachlor (2 -chloro- 2 ', 6 '-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide) and <b>propachlor</b> (2 -chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide) by iron(II) protoporphyrin IX chloride (heme) in fluid solution and anchored to a mesoporous nanocrystalline (anatase) TiO 2 thin film immersed in solution is reported. The hemes were reacted with organic halides in the dark. Second-order kinetic rate constants of heme/TiO 2 were quantified and {{were found to be}} larger than the corresponding rate constants for heme in fluid solution. Chapter 3 explains that the synergy effect of heme/TiO 2 is partially due to the negative shifts in the formal reduction potentials of the catalysts upon surface binding. The spectroscopic and redox properties of iron(III) protoporphyrin chloride (hemin) and cobalt(III) meso-tetra(4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin chloride (CoTCP) were quantified in fluid solution and when anchored to mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO 2 thin films. In acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide electrolytes, TiO 2 binding was found to induce a substantial negative shift in the MIII/II formal reduction potentials. In DMSO electrolyte, the CoIII/II and FeIII/II potentials were - 559 and - 727 mV versus ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) and shifted to - 782 and - 1063 mV, respectively, after surface binding. For TiO 2 iii pretreated with aqueous solutions from pH 4 - 9, the CoIII/II potential showed a - 66 mV/pH unit change, while the FeIII/II potential of hemin changed by - 40 mV/pH from pH 1 to 14. Spectroelectrochemical data gave isosbestic, reversible spectral changes in the visible region assigned to MIII/II redox chemistry with iso = 410, 460, 530, 545, 568, and 593 nm for CoTCP/TiO 2 and iso = 408, 441, 500, 576, and 643 nm for hemin/TiO 2. In aqueous solution, the CoTCP reduction potentials were also found to be pH dependent upon surface binding, with CoTCP = - 583 mV and CoTCP/TiO 2 = - 685 mV versus Fc+/Fc at pH 6. For CoTCP/TiO 2, the aqueous pH dependence of the potentials was - 52 mV/pH. In Chapter 4, photodriven multi-electron transfer (MET) processes are described. Hemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) has been anchored to ~ 15 nm TiO 2 nanocrystallites (anatase) in ~ 8 μm thick mesoporous thin films. Band gap excitation of these materials in methanol or aqueous (pH 4 or 8) solutions leads to the reduction of hemin to heme (FeIII FeII) and the production of TiO 2 (e-), heme/TiO 2 (e-). The mechanisms and second-order rate constants for the reduction of bromobenzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and trichloroethylene were quantified. In all cases, the concentration of TiO 2 (e-) was found to decrease to near zero before the hemes were oxidized to hemin. Comparative studies with TiO 2 (e-) that were not functionalized with hemes indicate that organohalide reduction is mediated by the hemes. Reactions of 6 -bromo- 1 -hexene with heme/TiO 2 (e-) demonstrate multi-electron transfer reactivity and show that heme/TiO 2 (e-) nanocrystallites deliver two electrons to RX within 4. 5 μs. In Chapter 5, the reactions of heme/TiO 2 catalysts in aqueous solution, including reaction orders, MET processes, heme mediated mechanisms, and reaction products, were examined. Hemin was found to bind to mesoporous nanocrystalline (anatase) TiO 2 thin films from DMSO solution, Keq = 105 iv M- 1 at 298 K. The reactions of heme/TiO 2 with CCl 4, CHCl 3, <b>propachlor,</b> and trichloroethylene were investigated in methanol, and pH 4 and 8 aqueous solution. The reactions were found to be first-order in heme/TiO 2 and in organohalide. Second-order rate constants measured in aqueous solution increased in the order CCl 4 > <b>propachlor</b> > trichloroethylene > CHCl 3. The FeIII/II formal reduction potentials of heme/TiO 2 were estimated by cyclic voltammetry and found to be – 340 mV at pH 4 and – 600 mV at pH 8 versus Ag/AgCl. Reactions with CCl 4 and CHCl 3 were faster at pH 8 than pH 4 (kobs = 14. 1 ± 0. 7 and 0. 63 ± 0. 03 M- 1 s- 1 at pH 4 vs. k = 69 ± 3 and 1. 33 ± 0. 07 M- 1 s- 1 at pH 8, respectively), which was attributed to the more negative formal FeIII/II reduction potential at higher pH. The rate constants for <b>propachlor</b> reduction were similar at both pHs. Experiments were also performed with excess electrons trapped in TiO 2, TiO 2 (e-), and heme/TiO 2 (e-). The reaction of CCl 4 was 20 times faster with heme/TiO 2 (e-) compared to TiO 2 (e-) alone. In the case of trichloroethylene, no reaction was observed for TiO 2 (e-), but rapid reactivity was observed for heme/TiO 2 (e-), kobs = 1. 0 x 10 - 3 s- 1 suggestive of a multi-electron transfer reaction mechanism. Dechlorinated products of <b>propachlor</b> and CCl 4 were identified by GC/MS analysis. Chapter 6 describes the effects of axial ligand on the reactivity of heme catalysts. The reactivity of heme complexes anchored to nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO 2 thin films, FeII/TiO 2 and bis(pyr) FeII/TiO 2, toward organohalides pollutants was investigated in pH 4 aqueous solution. Pyridine were found to bind to iron center of the porphyrins with binding constants of 9. 3 ± 0. 4 x 10 - 4 M- 2. Spectroscopic data gave isosbestic points at λiso = 392, 456, and 570 nm upon addition of pyridine to FeII/TiO 2. Pyridine axial ligation affected the redox properties of iron porphyrin, the estimated FeIII/II/TiO 2 and (pyr) FeIII/II/TiO 2 formal reduction potentials v were E° = - 900 mV and - 160 mV versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc+/Fc) in pH 4. The reaction rates of FeII/TiO 2 with halomethanes were consistently faster than bis(pyr) FeII/TiO 2 complexes, partly due to the more negative reduction potentials of FeIII/II/TiO 2. Multi electron transfer (MET) reactions of bis(pyr) FeII/TiO 2 (e-) with CCl 4 in MeOH formed no carbene adducts, suggestive of the outer sphere electron transfer mechanism when two pyridine axial ligands were present. The detection of tetrachloroethylene as a product of multi-electron transfer supported two-electron reduction of CCl 4. The linear free energy relationships for the second-order rate constants, k, versus thermodynamics of the reactions, ΔG, indicated the correlation between the reaction rates and the reduction potentials of FeIII/II and organohalides. ...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven polar pesticides, mainly triazines, phenylurea {{herbicides}} and phenoxy acids, {{were determined}} by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation MS-MS with methanol and acetonitrile as the organic modifiers. For most pesticides, detection limits were the same irrespective of the modifier. However, for the phenylurea herbicides, <b>propachlor,</b> carbetamide, triadimefon, triadimenol, triethylcitrate, benzothiazole and metazachlor, the results were much poorer {{in the presence of}} acetonitrile; in several cases, no meaningful results were obtained at all. When carrying out trace enrichment of 100 ml water samples on a 10 x 2 mm I. D. solid-phase extraction precolumn containing a polymeric sorbent, rapid desorption with a small volume of pure organic solvent and the introduction of a T-piece in between the solid-phase extraction precolumn and the analytical column was necessary. Aliquots of 300 μl of acetonitrile were optimal for the complete desorption of all analytes from the sorbent. With methanol as the modifier and when using an identification criterion of three ions, the detection limits for most analytes, in the full-scan mode, were 10 - 100 ng/l. The linearity of the procedure, which was tested at the 0. 1 and 1 μg/l levels, was satisfactory in the positive, but not in the negative ionisation mode. The procedures were used to analyse surface water samples. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

In other studies, technical alachlor {{as well as the}} emulsifiable concentrate formulation of the chemical were used to investigate the effect of several factors on the toxicity of the herbicide. Corn and oats absorbed alachor primarily in a passive way. The uptake of the herbicide in both species was slightly reduced in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. The reduction was somewhat stronger in corn than in oats. A raise in temperature increased the uptake of alachlor only slightly. Q₁₀ values of about 1. 2 were found. The part of the total uptake affected by metabolic inhibitors followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics over the alachlor concentration range of 0. 1 mM to 0. 5 mM. Uptake of alachlor was measured in the presence of an analog, <b>propachlor.</b> <b>Propachlor</b> reduced the uptake of alachlor at a concentra- tion of 0. 3 mM for both chemicals. At a concentration of 0. 03 mM for each herbicide alachlor uptake was less reduced. Total uptake by corn and oats was nearly identical up to a concentration of 0. 1 mM. At higher concentrations alachlor absorption by oats was about twice as high as by corn. This would suggest that selective uptake by the two species could at least partly account for the difference in tolerance towards alachlor. A study was conducted to determine if P, K and Ca levels in oat plants were affected by alachlor treatment. P and Ca content was not affected by the presence of alachlor, but a gradual decrease in K level with increasing herbicide concentrations was observed. Uptake of alachlor through the shoot region exceeded absorption by the roots in the two monocotyledonous species, corn and oats. Two dictos, soybean and cucumber, absorbed higher amounts of the herbicide through the roots. Shoot exposure of corn and cucumber was most damaging to the plant, while root exposure was more damaging to oats and soybean. The effect of alachlor on the growth of oats and cucumber at various levels of sub-irrigation and carrier volume could be explained on the basis of differences in effective absorption regions in the plants. Photoperiod had, in contrast with light intensity, no effect on the activity of the herbicide to corn, cucumber and oats. An increase in light intensity up to 1600 ft-c increased the toxicity of alachlor in corn and cucumber, but not in oats. The activity at 2000 ft-c was only slightly higher than at 60 ft-c, and less than at 660 ft-c. In the case of cucumber, an increase in alachlor concentration had very little effect at 2000 ft-c, in contrast with the other light intensities...|$|E
40|$|N-acetylanthranilate amidase (Amq), a 32. 8 -kDa monomeric amide hydrolase, is {{involved}} in quinaldine degradation by Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus Rü 61 a. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions indicated that Amq is related to carboxylesterases and belongs to the α/β-hydrolase-fold superfamily of enzymes; inactivation of (His 6 -tagged) Amq by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diethyl pyrocarbonate and replacement of conserved residues suggested a catalytic triad consisting of S 155, E 235, and H 266. Amq is most active towards aryl-acetylamides and aryl-acetylesters. Remarkably, its preference for ring-substituted analogues was different for amides and esters. Among the esters tested, phenylacetate was hydrolyzed with highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 208 mM− 1 s− 1), while among the aryl-acetylamides, o-carboxy- or o-nitro-substituted analogues were preferred over p-substituted or unsubstituted compounds. Hydrolysis by His 6 Amq of primary amides, lactams, N-acetylated amino acids, azocoll, tributyrin, and the acylanilide and urethane pesticides <b>propachlor,</b> propham, carbaryl, and isocarb was not observed; propanil was hydrolyzed with 1 % N-acetylanthranilate amidase activity. The catalytic properties of the cysteine-deficient variant His 6 AmqC 22 A/C 63 A markedly differed from those of His 6 Amq. The replacements effected some changes in Kms of the enzyme and increased kcats for most aryl-acetylesters and some aryl-acetylamides by factors of about three to eight while decreasing kcat for the formyl analogue N-formylanthranilate by several orders of magnitude. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the cysteine-to-alanine replacements resulted in significant change of the overall fold, especially an increase in α-helicity of the cysteine-deficient protein. The conformational changes may also affect the active site and {{may account for the}} observed changes in kinetic properties...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the extent}} and nature of sub-lethal effects of herbicides on plant growth. At least one herbicide from each major chemical class of herbicides was evaluated under greenhouse conditions. Oat plants were grown in sand culture to eliminate soil interferences. Herbicides were applied pre-emergence in nutrient solution. No drainage of the herbicide solution was allowed. Plants were grown for two weeks, harvested by separating roots from shoots, and dry weights recorded. Roots were stimulated more often and to a greater degree than were shoots. Herbicides stimulating root growth were: amiben (3 -amino- 2, 5 -dichlorobenzoic acid), barban (4 -chloro- 2 -butynyl n-chlorocarbanilate), bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -uracil), brornoxynil (3, 5 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzonitrile), dalapon (2, 2 -dichloropropionic acid), diuron (3 -(3, 4 -dichloro-phenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea), EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiolcarbamate), MCPA (2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid), MSMA (monosodium methanearsonic acid), <b>propachlor</b> (2 -chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide), simazine (2 - chloro- 4, 6 -bis(ethylamino) -s-triazine), and terbacil (5 -chloro- 3 -tert-butyl- 6 -methyluracil). Herbicides stimulating shoots were barban, dalapon, diuron, and MCPA. Chlorpropham (isopropyl N-(3 -chlorophenyl) carbamate), picloram (4 -amino- 3, 5, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid), and paraquat (1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 4 -bipyridinium) did not produce stimulation of roots or shoots at the dosages tested. Amiben, barban, and bromacil were selected for further laboratory studies. Stimulation of oat seedling respiration occurred at 10 ⁻⁴ ppm amiben at 72 hours and at 10 ⁻³ ppm barban at 48 hours. Other treatments did not increase seedling respiration. Three identical experiments {{were conducted}} using an infra-red gas analyzer to measure CO₂ exchange. Oat plants were treated with four rates of amiben, barban, or bromacil. Total photosynthesis and CO₂ evolved were measured. Bromacil reduced total photosynthesis at all rates. Total photosynthesis and CO₂ evolved were not affected by other treatments. Plants used for the infra-red study were taken to the laboratory to determine ethanol soluble protein, free amino acid, and total available carbohydrate contents of roots and shoots. Ethanol soluble protein content in shoots was increased by 10 ⁻⁵ ppm barban or bromacil. Free amino acids in shoots were increased by all three herbicides at 10 ⁻⁵ ppm of herbicide. Other treatments produced variable results. Total available carbohydrates in roots were reduced by 10 ⁻⁴ and 10 ⁻⁵ ppm barban and by all rates of bromacil...|$|E
40|$|Nearly all rural {{inhabitants}} {{and livestock}} in the Upper Republican Natural Resources District (URNRD) in southwestern Nebraska use ground water {{that can be}} affected by elevated nitrate concentrations. The development of ground-water irrigation in this area has increased the vulnerability of ground water {{to the introduction of}} fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals. In 1998, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Upper Republican Natural Resources District, began a study to characterize the quality of ground water in the Upper Republican Natural Resources District area with respect to physical properties and concentrations of major ions, coliform bacteria, nitrate, and pesticides, and to assess the presence of nitrogen concentrations in the unsaturated zone. At selected well sites, the ground-water characterization also included tritium and nitrogen-isotope analyses to provide information about the approximate age of the ground water and potential sources of nitrogen detected in ground-water samples, respectively. In 1998, ground-water samples were collected from 101 randomly selected domestic-well sites. Of the 101 samples collected, 26 tested positive for total coliform bacteria, exceeding the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of zero colonies. In 1999, ground-water samples were collected from 31 of the 101 well sites, and 16 tested positive for coliform bacteria. Nitrates were detected in ground water from all domestic-well samples and from all but four of the irrigation-well samples collected from 1998 to 2001. Eight percent of the domestic-well samples and 3 percent of the irrigation-well samples had nitrate concentrations exceeding the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency’s MCL for drinking water of 10 milligrams per liter. Areas with nitrate concentrations exceeding 6 milligrams per liter, the URNRD’s ground-water management-plan action level, were found predominantly in north-central Chase, western and south-central Dundy, and south-central Perkins Counties. Generally, these concentrations were detected in samples from wells located in upland areas with permeable soils and a high percentage of cropland. In 1999, 31 of the ground-water samples collected from irrigation wells were analyzed for pesticides, and 14 samples (45 percent) had detectable concentrations of at least one pesticide compound. In 2000, all of the 23 irrigation-well samples analyzed had one or more pesticides present at detectable concentrations. In 2001, 12 of 26 domestic-well samples (46 percent) had detectable concentrations. Although the analytical method used during the study was changed {{to increase the number of}} pesticides included in the analyses, the pesticides detected in the ground-water samples from domestic and irrigation wells were limited to the commonly used herbicide compounds acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, prometon, <b>propachlor,</b> propazine, trifluralin, and the atrazine degradation product deethylatrazine. Of the compounds detected, only atrazine (3. 0 micrograms per liter) and alachlor (2. 0 micrograms per liter) have MCLs established by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. None of the ground-water samples from the URNRD study area had concentrations that exceeded either MCL. Tritium age-dating analyses indicate water from about one-third of the sites entered the ground-water system prior to 1952. Because the increase in agricultural practices occurred during the 1950 s and 1960 s, it can be assumed that this water was not influenced by agricultural practices. Nitrogen-isotope speciation analyses for samples from three irrigation wells indicated that the source of nitrates in the ground water probably is synthetic fertilizer; however, the source at most irrigation wells probably is either naturally occurring or a mixture of water from various anthropogenic sources (such as synthetic fertilizer and animal waste) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{research}} has indicated several soil-applied herbicides are more effective by exposure to emerging shoots than from root uptake. Studies were conducted in the greenhouse and growth chamber to investigate effects of herbicide placement in soil on toxicity to emerging seedlings. In these studies, an inch of treated soil was placed above the seed, below the seed, or both {{above and below the}} seed. The seed was placed {{in the middle of a}} 1 -inch layer of untreated soil. Each soil layer was brought to field capacity separately and the entire container was covered with a plastic bag. The use of this plastic bag avoided the need for irrigation and subsequent herbicide movement. By this method, numerous herbicides were active on oats (Avena sativa) primarily through shoot exposure, with root exposure having little or no effect on foliage growth. These herbicides included EPTC (ethyl N, N-dipropylthiocarbamate), dichlobenil (2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile), trifluralin (α, α, α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine), nitralin (2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl- 4 -[methylsulphonyl] aniline), <b>propachlor</b> (2 -chloro-N-iso-propylacetanilide), DCPA (dimethyl 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorotereph-thalate), and CDEC (2 -chloroallyl diethyl dithiocarbamate). Sindone (isomers of 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4, 6 -diisopropylindanyl ethyl ketone) was more effective on sugar beets (Beta vulgaris) and annual rye-grass (Lolium multiflorum) through shoot exposure than root exposure. Some herbicides are more effective on oats through root exposure. These included bromacil (5 -bromo- 3 -sec-butyl- 6 -methyluracil), R 11913,¹ Nia 11092 (1, 1 -dimethyl- 3 -(3 -[N-tert-butylcarbamyloxy] phenyl) urea), pyrazon (5 -amino- 4 -chloro- 2 -phenyl- 3 [2 H]-pyridazinone), diuron (3 -[3, 4 -dichlorophenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea), and atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropyl-amino-s-triazine). Dicamba (2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid) and 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) were more effective on cucumber through root exposure than through shoot exposure. Some herbicides appear to be taken up differently by different plant species. R 11913 was more effective through shoot exposure on sugar beets and more effective through root exposure on oats. Atrazine proved more effective on oats through root exposure; however, with green foxtail (Setaria viridis) and annual ryegrass, shoot exposure was more important when an untreated buffer layer was present between the seed and the treated zone. The possibility existed that a reduction in transpiration, caused by the plastic bag could affect the mode of uptake. In studies without the use of the plastic bag, atrazine was still more effective on oats through root exposure and more effective on green foxtail through shoot exposure. Irrigation in this study was accomplished through straws extended into each layer to minimize herbicide movement. We noticed that green foxtail produced secondary roots as early as five days after planting or two days after emergence. This indicated that these newly-formed secondary roots, as well as the emerging shoot, could absorb atrazine placed in the shoot region. When the buffer layer was removed and atrazine-treated soil was placed adjacent to the seed, placement immediately below the seed showed the greatest toxicity to both oats and green foxtail. This indicates the variation in sensitivity of plants by exposure to different parts of the seedling. Studies were conducted on varying placement positions of the herbicide as well as concentrations. From these studies, proximity to the seed was a major factor in increasing toxicity to oat seedlings by atrazine and EPTC, and to annual ryegrass seedlings by diuron. Atrazine was also more effective to green foxtail and annual ryegrass seedlings with increased proximity to the seed. A narrow concentrated layer was more effective than a wider dilute layer with diuron, atrazine, and EPTC when placed either above or below the seed. With atrazine and diuron, placement of the dilute wider layer completely around the seed was just as effective as the concentrated layer adjacent to the seed. With EPTC, a concentrated layer adjacent to the seed was more effective than a dilute layer completely around the seed. The effects of a constant temperature regime (24 C) was compared with a temperature regime with a low night temperature (27 C/ 13 C) in relation to uptake of EPTC, expressed by toxic action on oats. The temperature regime with a low night temperature caused a slight increase in toxicity to oats through shoot exposure, as well as through root exposure. However, the increase in uptake of EPTC through root exposure was considerably greater than through shoot exposure. ¹No chemical name available, an experimental herbicide of Stauffer Chemical Company...|$|E
