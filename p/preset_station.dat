40|$|Designing urban {{rail transit}} systems {{is a complex}} problem, which {{involves}} the determination of station locations, track geometry, right-of-way type, and various other system characteristics. The existing studies overlook the complex interactions between railway alignments and station locations in a practical design process. This study proposes a comprehensive methodology that helps transit planners to concurrently optimize station locations and track alignments for an urban rail transit line. The modeling framework resolves the essential trade-off between an economically efficient system with low initial and operation cost and an effective system that provides convenient service for the public. The proposed method accounts for various geometric requirements and real-world design constraints for track alignment and stations plans. This method integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimization with comprehensive evaluation of various important measures of effectiveness based on processing Geographical Information System (GIS) data. The base model designs the track alignment through a sequence of <b>preset</b> <b>stations.</b> Detailed assumptions and formulations are presented for geometri...|$|R
50|$|Bush Radio started {{trading in}} 1932. They worked with BWBF on {{producing}} specially adapted sets {{which included the}} Bakelite-cased DAC10 which was issued in 1950. This set had five top-mounted push-button controls, medium- and long-wave <b>preset</b> <b>stations</b> and was smaller and easier to move than the Magnum sets.BWBF collaborated with Roberts Radio in the early 1950s to produce new models suitable for those whose lack of vision meant they had difficulty using a standard set. The use of transistors to amplify sound instead of vacuum tubes meant that the radio could be much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio and was more shock resistant. This advance in technology, coupled with modifications to mainstream sets that improved usability for visually impaired users, resulted {{in a series of}} sets being produced by Roberts from the early 1950s onwards. The R55 issued in 1954 had a turntable mounted into the base of the set for easy turning and also had top mounted controls. The R303, R600 and R505 incorporated both these features and were manufactured in the trademark red leather, specifically customized for BWBF. The R505 issued in 1974 also had a specially adapted waveband switch.|$|R

50|$|KXEG {{claims to}} be the “first Christian {{broadcaster}} to launch an Alexa Skill.” “Skill” is a fancy word for a <b>station</b> <b>preset</b> for the Amazon Echo smart, voice-activated speaker to access. In other words, Echo owners can address the speaker, “Alexa, enable 1280 The Trumpet Skill,” and it should locate the station’s special IP-delivered stream and acknowledge that the stream is available.|$|R
50|$|Out {{on market}} on 12 December 2006, Nabaztag/tag is an {{improved}} model of Violet's Nabaztag. The new model supports MP3 audio streaming for Internet radio (with <b>preset</b> radio <b>stations</b> and an app allowing to add your own stream {{that does not}} work) and podcasts. This second version Nabaztag has also added a microphone that allows for voice activation {{of some of its}} services. However, despite text on the website claiming that new services will be available soon, the number of working voice activated services remains less than a handful. A final added feature is a built-in RFID reader to detect special-purpose RFID tags (i.e. ISO/IEC 14443 Type B). Nabaztag advertisement is presenting the ability to identify objects (depicted are e.g. keys).|$|R
40|$|DE 20114245 U UPAB: 20020502 NOVELTY - The {{equipment}} comprises {{one or more}} {{base stations}} (21 - 23) with base station identification (ID 1 - 3), each base station located at a preset position. There is a radio signal receiver, with the signal field strength containing the base station identification. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A device indicates {{the position of the}} <b>preset</b> base <b>station</b> according to the base station identification and the radio signal field strength is measured. The distance of the navigation equipment from the base station is computed to obtain information of the equipment position. The computer takes account of important parameters.

They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as CompactFlash. These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the world's highest capacity SanDisk Ultra 200GB Micro SD released in 2015.|$|R

This study proposes a comprehensive methodology that helps transit planners to concurrently optimize station locations and track alignments for an urban rail transit line.

The proposed method accounts for various geometric requirements and real-world design constraints for track alignment and stations plans. This method integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimization with comprehensive evaluation of various important measures of effectiveness based on processing Geographical Information System (GIS) data. The base model designs the track alignment through a sequence of <b>preset</b> <b>stations.</b> Detailed assumptions and formulations are presented for geometric requirements, design constraints, and evaluation criteria. Three extensions of the base model are proposed. The first extension explicitly incorporates vehicle dynamics {{in the design of}} track alignments, with the objective of better balancing the initial construction cost with the operation and user costs recurring throughout the system's life cycle. In the second extension, an integrated optimization model of rail transit station locations and track alignment is formulated for situations in which the locations of major <b>stations</b> are not <b>preset.</b> The concurrent optimization model searches through additional decision variables for station locations and station types, estimate rail transit demand, and incorporates demand and station cost in the evaluation framework. The third extension considers the existing road network when selecting sections of the alignment. Special algorithms are developed to allow the optimized alignment to take advantage of links in an existing network for construction cost reduction, and to account for disturbances of roadway traffic at highway/rail crossings. Numerical results show that these extensions have significantly enhanced the applicability of the proposed optimization methodology in concurrently selecting rail transit station locations and generating track alignment...|$|R
40|$|In this experiment, 13 {{licensed}} drivers performed 20 tasks with {{a prototype}} navigation radio. Subjects completed such tasks as entering a street address, selecting a <b>preset</b> radio <b>station,</b> and tuning to an XM station while “thinking aloud” to identify problems with operating the prototype interface. Overall, subjects identified 64 unique {{problems with the}} interface; 17 specific problems were encountered {{by more than half}} of the subjects. Problems are related to inconsistent music interfaces, limitations to destination entry methods, icons that were not understood, the lack of functional grouping, and similar looking buttons and displays, among others. An important project focus was getting the findings to the developers quickly. Having a scribe to code interactions in real time helped as well as directed observations of test sessions by representatives of the developers. Other researchers are encouraged to use this method to examine automotive interfaces as a complement to traditional usability testing...|$|R
5000|$|Analog <b>station</b> <b>presets</b> {{and digital}} channel maps are {{normally}} deleted {{when a new}} scan is started. On some tuners, digital channel maps can be added-to with an [...] "easy-add" [...] channel scan, which is useful for finding new stations without losing old ones that may be weak or currently off-air, or not aimed-at with an antenna rotator or other set-top TV antenna adjustment. If a station adds a digital subchannel, most digital TV tuners will find it automatically {{as soon as the}} user turns to another channel that is carried by that station, adding it to the channel map.|$|R
