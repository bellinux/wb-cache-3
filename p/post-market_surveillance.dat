40|$|Background: China is {{the most}} populous country in the world, with an annual birth cohort of {{approximately}} 16 million, requiring an average of 500 million vaccine doses administered annually. In China, over 30 domestic and less than 10 overseas vaccine manufacturers supply over 60 licensed vaccine products, representing a growing vaccine market mainly due to recent additions to the national immunization schedule, but data on <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are sparse. Objectives: To compare reporting rates for various categories of AEFI from China with other routine <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> programs internationally. Methods: Systematic review of published studies reporting rates of AEFI by vaccine, category of reaction and age from <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems in English and Chinese languages. Results: Overall AEFI reporting rates (all vaccines, all ages) in Chinese studies were consistent with those from similar international studies elsewhere, but there was substantial heterogeneity in regional reporting rates in China (range 2. 3 - 37. 8 / 100, 000 doses). The highest AEFI reporting rates were for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis whole-cell (DTwP) and acellular (DTaP) vaccines (range 3. 3 - 181. 1 / 100, 000 doses for DTwP; range 3. 5 - 92. 6 / 100, 000 doses for DTaP), with higher median rates for DTwP than DTaP, and higher than expected rates for DTaP vaccine. Similar higher rates for DTwP and DTaP containing vaccines, and relatively lower rates for vaccines against hepatitis B virus, poliovirus, and Japanese encephalitis virus were found in China {{and elsewhere in the}} world. Conclusions: Overall AEFI reporting rates in China were consistent with similar <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems in other countries. Sources of regional heterogeneity in AEFI reporting rates, and their relationships to differing vaccine manufacturers versus differing surveillance practices, require further exploration...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} systems {{that can be}} {{considered}} as partially observable due to their unknown or partially known structures or the nature of their unknown products and/or partially known results. The impacts of the consumption of genetically modified food (GM) are an example of a system that is only partially observable. The safety of genetically modified foods (GM) products has caused much controversy. Absence of sufficient and reliable information prevents neither certain confidence about the harmlessness of product consumption, nor any certain conclusion to merit a ban for fear of harm. The lack of any reliable or conclusive post-market observation and consumption effects information, make it difficult to establish a global protocol for such products. This paper introduces a model for the analysis of partially observable information from the surveillance of post-market consumption of systems such as genetically modified foods (GM) products. This model uses Markov Chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function to estimate the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies. A case study on population health status is used as an illustrative example, which is modeled to demonstrate the impact of policy interventions on simulated data. A cost decision analysis model is also applied to illustrate the impact of policy intervention costs. The model uses a first order Markov chain to estimate the period-over-period change in health status and a Bayesian updating procedure to estimate the population health status based on observations from <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The results show how observation samples can be used to provide information on system changes and improvements.|$|E
40|$|Natural health {{products}} (NHPs) {{are attractive}} {{due to the}} public’s perception that they are natural and safe but there is wide variety of risks associated with these products. <b>Post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{is the key to}} control hazards produced from NHPs. A set of activities are involved in <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> designed to assure the safety, efficacy and quality of products after being launched into the market. Although <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> is an efficient tool to preserve the safety of users from adverse reactions of NHPs but there are various challenges associated with performing <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> specifically for NHPs.

Use of electronic health records (EHRs) for this purpose could reduce costs and improve data quality in clinical studies. Kyoto University Hospital launched an EHR system in January 2005. At the same time, a replicate of that database was established for other purposes. At the Outpatient Oncology Unit of Kyoto University Hospital we developed a data-capture system that includes a cancer clinical database system and a data warehouse for outcomes studies. This system allows us to accumulate data at low cost and apply it to various uses in clinical or outcomes studies. Here we report on the application of this system to the <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance</b> of drugs. Methods: We evaluated the availability of this system and identified problems for future development. With this system investigators can register cases for <b>post-marketing</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and the registered cases are listed on a screen. When CRFs for a particular case are required, data can be extracted from the list and CRFs are produced in PDF format.

Our objective was to determine how commonly medical device manufacturers initiate post-market clinical studies or augment FDA <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> requirements for higher-risk devices that are most often approved via the FDA&# 39;s pre-market approval (PMA) pathway. Methods and results: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 47 manufacturers with operations in California, Minnesota, and Massachusetts who market devices approved via the PMA pathway. Among 22 respondents (response rate = 47 %), nearly all self-reported conducting post-market clinical research studies, commonly between 1 and 5; only 1 respondent reported never conducting post-market clinical research studies. While manufacturers most often engaged in these studies to satisfy FDA requirements, other reasons were reported, including performance monitoring and surveillance and market acceptance initiatives. Risks of conducting and not conducting post-market clinical research studies were described through open-ended response to questions. Conclusion: Medical device manufacturers commonly initiate post-market clinical studies {{at the request of}} the FDA.

40|$|Medical {{devices have}} made a {{significant}} contribution to helping patients enjoy longer lives of higher quality. However, numerous weaknesses in their premarket evaluation and <b>post-market</b> <b>surveillance</b> have sometimes left patients worse off from faulty devices. For example, the Sprint Fidelis implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004. Three years after its approval and subsequent rapid dissemina-tion, this device’s high propensity to fracture was finally recognized; first by independent cardiologists and then the FDA and the manufacturer, which volun-tarily recalled the device. At least several patient deaths have been attributed to this problem [1, 2]. More than 268, 000 pa-tients worldwide have been implanted with this device and have had to choose between risky removal of the defective leads or living with uncertainty of death due to a faulty device.
