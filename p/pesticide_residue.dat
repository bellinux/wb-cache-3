The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
25|$|A {{database}} containing <b>pesticide</b> <b>residue</b> data at the raw {{agricultural commodity}} level is the USDA Pesticide Data Program (PDP). The USDA initiated the PDP in 1991 to test commodities in the U.S food supply for pesticide residues.

25|$|Residue data {{is often}} {{collected}} on raw agricultural commodities {{at the time}} of harvest which is not necessarily representative or the residue levels present {{at the time of}} consumption. The processing and preparation of commodities is subject to increase or decrease the level of residues at the time of consumption. For example, dehydration of a product may increase the concentration of antibiotic residue whereas washing of produce may reduce the concentration of a <b>pesticide</b> <b>residue.</b> Since chemical residue data is often only available at the raw agricultural commodity level and consumption data is often available for foods as consumed, it is necessary to convert between foods as consumed and raw agricultural commodities.

The conservation history of museums in the United States and the Netherlands will be compared, to find out how much conservation methods in both countries overlap, and which pesticides can be expected in Dutch museums. Interviews with Dutch museum personnel are presented as sources of information for pesticide use and troubles in Dutch ethnographic museums.

The ways objects with <b>pesticide</b> <b>residues</b> are handled in the United States and the Netherlands are compared.
