5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food <b>procurement</b> <b>function,</b> or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E

40|$|Internet {{technology}} has been increasingly used to enhance the global competitiveness of various business applications through the widespread electronic commerce (EC) functions. Many Internet-based systems have been designed and developed for supply chain management (SCM) in various areas such as computer, garment, and publishing industries, which mainly center on communication infrastructure, coordination between production and distribution, and <b>procurement</b> <b>functions</b> with security mechanisms. However, EC is not a panacea. On many occasions, participants (including buyers, sellers, and enablers) face various risks and overhead during the deployment of a new technology. In this article, we present the impact of EC on procurement processes in supply chains, highlighting the issues of buyers, sellers, and the transaction processes involved. The procurement processes are classified into preprocurement (sourcing), procurement (quotation, negotiation, order placement, and transaction), and postprocurement (delivery). Moreover, a four-phase migration model of procurement onto the Internet is introduced to illustrate the technical, security, and financial requirements in the deployment process of EC. The migration model not only gives a development guideline of <b>procurement</b> <b>functions,</b> but also provides an evaluation framework of e-procurement. An industrial example is used to illustrate the corresponding evolution {{as a result of}} EC deployment. The paper concludes with a summary of EC impact and future research directions. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

This significant role-based transformation, which is well underway, is best-evidenced by the [...] "CEO-in-Waiting" [...] status that many CFOs now hold. Additionally, many CFOs have made the realization that an operating environment that values cash, profit margins, and risk mitigation is one that plays to the primary skills and capabilities of a procurement organization, and become increasingly involved (directly via oversight or indirectly through improved collaboration) with the <b>procurement</b> <b>function</b> {{according to a recent}} research report that looks at the CFO's relationship with procurement.|$|E
50|$|This trend {{away from}} the daily <b>procurement</b> <b>function</b> (tactical purchasing) {{resulted}} in several changes in the industry. The first was the reduction of personnel. Purchasing departments were now smaller. There {{was no need for}} the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past. Another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment. Both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest financial contribution to the organization. A new term and job title emerged - Strategic sourcing and Sourcing Managers. These professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers, but the entire supply function. In these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations. This value was manifested in lower inventories, less personnel, and getting the end product to the consumer quicker. Purchasing managers' success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional purchasing function - logistics, materials management, distribution, and warehousing. More and more purchasing managers were becoming Supply Chain Managers handling additional functions of their organization's operation. Purchasing managers were not the only ones to become Supply Chain Managers. Logistic managers, material managers, distribution managers, etc. all rose to the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{checking}} {{whether the}} European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Business Excellence Model (BEM) {{can be used}} as a reference framework for designing a multi-objective performance measurement system (PMS) for the <b>procurement</b> <b>function.</b> The <b>procurement</b> <b>function</b> is becoming increasingly relevant in the achievement of strategic and economic objectives. Thus, understanding the level of maturity of the practices implemented and identifying improvement opportunities are crucial. In this regard, it is necessary for companies to design a multi-objective PMS suitable for understanding whether and to what extent the procurement process contributes to the achievement of corporate objectives. This paper tests the validity of the EFQM BEM for the design of such functional PMS, building on the assumption that the overall rationale of this model is consistent with the need to jointly monitor the drivers and the outcomes of the procurement department, through a multi-objective approach. Using a data set that reports data from 118 companies and that is based on an international survey, our empirical analysis shows that the relationships among the constructs of the EFQM BEM hold also in the <b>procurement</b> <b>function</b> and that this model {{can be used as}} a reference framework suitable for measuring and managing the performance of this organisational uni...|$|E
