2500|$|At an {{oversight}} {{hearing before the}} House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine {{was the cause of}} the elevated lead levels. [...] He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. [...] Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as [...] "lead free" [...] under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. [...] Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. [...] He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine {{in a way that would}} increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual <b>pipe</b> <b>flushing</b> caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of biofilms {{in drinking water}} distribution systems (DWDS) is a global concern. Those are responsible for aesthetic problems in drinking water (DW) such as taste, odor and color, and can also be responsible for public health problems when pathogens are biofilm colonizers. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to use effective control strategies. The aim of this work {{was to understand the}} effects of the combination of chemical (sodium hypochlorite NaOCl) and mechanical (<b>pipe</b> <b>flushing)</b> treatments on the removal of single and dual species biofilms of two bacteria isolated from drinking water, Acinectobacter calcoaceticus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Those are common strategies used in DWDS. A rotating cylinder reactor was used {{for the first time as}} DWDS model for biofilm formation and control. The combination of chemical and mechanical treatments was not able to completely remove biofilms from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surface. Chemical treatment did not improve the flushing efficiency of A. calcoaceticus biofilms and increased the recalcitrance of S. maltophilia biofilms to mechanical treatment, even when high shear stress was applied. Nevertheless, NaOCl improved the mechanical removal of dual species biofilm. The dual species biofilm remaining after treatment with NaOCl at 0. 5 mg. l- 1 was 78 %, while after being treated with the NaOCl at the minimum inhibitory concentration 12 % of biofilm remained on PVC surface. The overall results demonstrate that chemical and mechanical treatments commonly used in DWDS are not effective in biofilm control. The colonizer strain strongly influences the biofilm phenotype and its susceptibility to control strategies...|$|E

50|$|Soon after completion, sediment-accumulation {{threatened}} {{the benefits of}} the dam. The Yellow River carries more sediment than any other in the world. During the 18 months after the river was closed, 1.8 billion metric tons of sediment had accumulated in the reservoir. Only 7% of the sediment-load was released downstream and the reservoir lost 17% of its capacity below a 335 m ASL elevation. Navigation and farmland were threatened upstream along with the relocation of an additional one million people. Despite the dam's 12 deep-sluices and alterations in the release of water, silt continued to build in the reservoir, particularly in the back waters. Responding to the potential crisis, a meeting was held in December 1964 with Premier Zhou Enlai. At the meeting, it was decided to reconstruct the dam's outlet works for improved discharges and silt control. The renovation was carried out immediately and in two stages. The first stage included the installation of two tunnels on the dam's left bank at an elevation of 290 m ASL along with converting four penstocks into <b>flushing</b> <b>pipes.</b> The <b>flushing</b> <b>pipes</b> began operating in 1966 and the tunnels in 1967 and 1968.

50|$|A sewer jetter is {{composed}} of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible high-pressure line (called a jetter hose which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken {{a distance from the}} engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of <b>pipes,</b> and <b>flush</b> out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a Sewer Jetter ranges from 1000 psi up to 5000 psi. Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can clear a hole for the larger root cutting nozzle. Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. 5000 psi sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can clear a hole through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the <b>pipe</b> walls, <b>flushing</b> the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber's snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} {{clock frequency}} {{is determined by}} the longest signal propagation delay, setup/hold time, and timing margin. These are becoming less predictable with the increasing design complexity and process miniaturization. The difficult challenge is then to ensure that a device operating at its clock frequency is error-free with quantifiable assurance. Effort at device-level engineering will not suffice for these circuits exhibiting wide process variation and heightened sensitivities to operating condition stress. Logic-level redress of this issue is a necessity and we propose a design-level remedy for this timing-uncertainty problem. The aim of the design and analysis approaches presented in this dissertation is to provide framework, SABRE, wherein an increased operating clock frequency can be achieved. The approach is a combination of analytical modeling, experimental analy- sis, hardware /time-redundancy design, exception handling and recovery techniques. Our proposed design replicates only a necessary part of the original circuit to avoid high hardware overhead as in triple-modular-redundancy (TMR). The timing-critical combinational circuit is path-wise partitioned into two sections. The combinational circuits associated with long paths are laid out without any intrusion except for the fan-out connections from the first section of the circuit to a replicated second section of the combinational circuit. Thus only the second section of the circuit is replicated. The signals fanning out from the first section are latches, and thus are far shorter than the paths spanning the entire combinational circuit. The replicated circuit is timed at a subsequent clock cycle to ascertain relaxed timing paths. This insures that the likelihood of mistiming due to stress or process variation is eliminated. During the subsequent clock cycle, the outcome of the two logically identical, yet time-interleaved, circuit outputs are compared to detect faults. When a fault is detected, the retry sig- nal is triggered and the dynamic frequency-step-down takes place before a <b>pipe</b> <b>flush,</b> and retry is issued. The significant timing overhead associated with the retry is offset by the rarity of the timing violation events. Simulation results on ISCAS Benchmark circuits show that 10 % of clock frequency gain is possible with 10 to 20 % of hardware overhead of replicated timing-critical circuit...|$|R

50|$|Underground {{sprinklers}} function through {{means of}} basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve {{and all of}} the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located {{in the center of the}} valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these <b>pipes</b> and <b>flush</b> to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers.

40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} {{culverts}} {{conducted at the}} St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota, beginning in 1946, included several series of observations on commercial, corrugated metal culvert pipes, The primary purpose of these large-scale tests was to obtain pipe friction and entrance loss coefficients which would be more accurate and dependable than those currently recommended in culvert design literature. A previous paper in this series gives {{a discussion of the}} comparison with the results of parallel studies on concrete culverts. The present paper is confined to a discussion of the corrugated pipe culvert test program and an analysis {{of the results of the}} studies. Two types of corrugated metal culverts were tested, namely, the circular and the pipe arch types. In each case, threee different nominal diameter pipe sections were tested [...] 18 in., 24 in., and 36 in., respectively [...] , making a total of six corrugated metal culverts in the test program. Each pipe was 193 ft long and laid on a slope of 0. 20 per cent. For the pipe arch culverts, the identifying dimensions refer to the diameters of circular pipes having the same length of periphery. For example, the 36 -in. pipe arch and the 36 -in. circular culvert have equal perimeters although their heights, widths, and areas are unequal. Cross sections of the various pipes, with controlling dimensions, appear in Fig. 1.

40|$|The {{majority}} of biomass within water distribution systems {{is in the}} form of attached biofilm. This is known to be central to drinking water quality degradation following treatment yet little understanding of the dynamics of these highly heterogeneous communities exists. This paper presents original information on such dynamics with findings demonstrating patterns of material accumulation, seasonality and influential factors. Rigorous flushing operations repeated over a one-year period on an operational, chlorinated system in the UK are presented. Intensive monitoring and sampling were undertaken including time series turbidity and detailed microbial analysis using 16 S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results show bacterial dynamics were influenced by differences in the supplied water and by the material remaining attached to the <b>pipe</b> wall following <b>flushing.</b> Turbidity, metals and phosphate were the main factors correlated with the distribution of bacteria in the samples. Coupled with the lack of inhibition of biofilm development due to chlorine residual, this suggests that limiting inorganic nutrients, other than organic carbon, might be a viable component in treatment strategies to manage biofilms. The research also showed that repeat flushing exerted beneficial selective pressure, thus also a viable advantageous biofilm management option. This work advances our understanding of microbiological processes in drinking water distribution systems and helps inform strategies to optimise asset performance. IMPORTANCE: This research provides with novel information regarding dynamics of biofilm formation in real drinking water distribution systems made of different materials. This new knowledge on microbiological process in water supply systems can be used to optimise the performance of the distribution network and to guarantee safe and good quality drinking water to consumers...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental exploration of structural and mixing {{characteristics of the}} unforced as well as forced jet in crossflow (JICF). For unforced experiments, variable jet-to-crossflow density ratios (0. 35 ≤S≤ 1. 00) and momentum flux ratios (5 ≤J≤ 41) were explored, for three alternative injectors with a fixed jet Reynolds number (Rej= 1900). For forced jet experiments, an equidensity jet emanating from two alternative flush nozzles (Rej= 1900; Rej= 1500) were explored. The interplay between scalar and velocity fields for the JICF was studied using simultaneous PLIF/stereo PIV measurements in the jet’s centerplane. POD analysis showed a transition from convective to absolutely instability in the upstream shear layer as J was reduced, consistent with hotwire measurements. Local strain rates were extracted from both PLIF and PIV data via the Howarth transformation. Mixing characterization with variable mixing scale lengths was explored via centerplane PLIF images. Mixing associated with stirring as well as molecular mixing could be distinguished, apparent especially in vortical structures for <b>flush</b> <b>pipe</b> injection. Sinusoidal forcing of the convectively unstable JICF demonstrated that relatively low amplitude forcing affected jet structures and mixing, especially close to the fundamental frequency. For the absolutely unstable JICF, a much higher forcing amplitude was required to alter jet characteristics, consistent with lock-in, leading to enhanced molecular mixing. Single-pulse square wave forcing created deeply-penetrating vortical structures for specific stroke ratios (L/D), even for the absolutely unstable JICF. L/D producing the greatest jet spread and penetration decreased with decreasing J, but L/D for optimal molecular mixing corresponded to different values and trends in J. Double-pulse square wave excitation, with two variable pulses within each temporal period, enabled the jet's nearfield vortex rings to interact and collide, with attendant effect on molecular mixing...|$|R
40|$|Waste harvesting, {{which occurs}} mostly but not {{exclusively}} at open waste dumps in Zimbabwe, constitutes {{one of the}} most important survival options for the urban poor. This paper analyses and discusses socio-economic benefits of informal waste harvesters in Victoria Falls town. Victoria Falls town has an estimated population of 31, 000 and is presently the fastest growing urban centre in Zimbabwe. An estimated 8000 tonnes of solid wastes are generated in the town every month. Questionnaires were administered to informal waste harvesters who recover materials mostly from three large open waste dumps. Thirteen dumpsite harvesters, who were available at the time of the survey and willing to participate, were interviewed during the month of October 2002. The questionnaire solicited for information on the character and dynamics of recuperative activities in the town, socio-economic and demographic characteristics of waste harvesters, type of materials recovered and their uses, and income derived from sale of harvested materials and how it is spent. Additional data were obtained from field observations. The study identified two categories of waste harvesters. The first group specialises in the recovery of foodstuffs mainly for household use. The second group comprises informal waste harvesters who specialise in the recovery of building materials such as bricks and river sand and scrap metal primarily for sale. Data provided by dumpsite waste harvesters interviewed show that the mean monthly income from the sale of harvested materials varied from Z$ 7500 (for 23. 1 % of the respondents) to Z$ 22, 500. 5 (for 15. 3 % of the respondents). Using the income they obtain from waste harvesting, most respondents (84. 6 %) indicated that they can now afford to pay school fees for their children in time while 61. 5 % stated that after engaging in resource recovery, they moved from informal settlements to Chinotimba where they now stay to a more decent accommodation with electricity, <b>piped</b> water and <b>flush</b> toilets. Prior to engaging in waste recovery, over a half of the informal waste harvesters indicated that were staying in informal settlements. The findings of this study, in particular the income and expenditure data, demonstrate that by engaging in waste harvesting, some of the urban poor are able to eke out living in an urban environment where economic opportunities are very limited. However, the contribution of informal waste harvesting to urban livelihoods in urban areas of Zimbabwe needs further investigation...|$|R
