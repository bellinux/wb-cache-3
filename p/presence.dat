5|$|In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is {{a sacrament}} that spiritually nourishes Christians and {{strengthens}} their union with Christ. The outward or physical {{action of the}} sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this <b>presence</b> is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real <b>presence</b> is sometimes called mystical real <b>presence</b> or spiritual real <b>presence.</b>|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared <b>presence</b> of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the <b>presence</b> of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the <b>presence</b> of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: <b>presence</b> of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the <b>presence</b> of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E

40|$|Concern over species declines has {{prompted}} researchers to use historical data {{as a basis}} for comparison with present-day information from the same sites to assess changes in presence/absence distributions. A review of the literature revealed that these resurveys typically lasted for 1 or 2 years, and many were based on museum records or other data relying on known historical <b>presences.</b> Using data on nine amphibian species from a set of 32 ponds at the E. S. George Reserve ([*]ESGR[*]) in Michigan, we evaluated the importance of the duration of a resurvey and the type of historical data used ([*]information on historical <b>presences</b> and absences vs. historical <b>presences</b> only[*]). We compared data we collected between 1996 and 2000 with information from the same ponds collected between 1967 and 1974. By systematically degrading the 1996 – 2000 data, we determined that a resurvey lasting 1 year would yield an estimated 45 % {{decline in the number of}} <b>presences,</b> whereas a resurvey lasting 2 years would yield an estimated 28 % decline. In contrast, a 5 -year resurvey would yield an estimated 3 % decline in the number of <b>presences.</b> In addition, when our historical data were limited to known <b>presences</b> in the past, even a 5 -year resurvey yielded an estimated 30 % decline in the number of <b>presences.</b> Our results suggest that estimates of decline and distributional change can be extremely sensitive to the duration of resurvey effort and the type of historical data used. The pattern we found in analyses of ESGR data is echoed in published studies in which multiple-year resurveys tended to yield smaller estimates of decline than single-year resurveys. Based on our findings, we suggest that future resurveys extend for long enough to estimate the value of additional data and that geographic scales of inference be chosen based on the amount and quality of historical information...|$|R
