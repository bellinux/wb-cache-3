40|$|The {{paper offers}} a novel {{justification}} for the non‐obviousness <b>patentability</b> <b>requirement.</b> An innovation involves two stages: research results in a technology blueprint, which development transforms into a profitable activity. An innovator, who is either efficient or inefficient, must rely on outside finance for the development. Only patented technologies are developed. Strengthening the non‐obviousness requirement alleviates adverse selection by discouraging inefficient innovators from doing research, but creates inefficiencies by excluding marginal innovations. We show that it is socially optimal to raise the non‐obviousness requirement so as to exclude bad innovators; we also provide several robustness checks and discuss the policy implication...|$|E
40|$|KSR {{is a big}} {{case because}} it {{addresses}} the only significant <b>patentability</b> <b>requirement</b> that exists under U. S. law. I count four fundamental patentability requirements: statutory subject matter, utility, novelty, and nonobviousness. It is plain that in the United States statutory subject matter is as broad as human experience itself. Utility, a very lenient requirement, is also easily met in most areas of technology. Novelty too is also easily satisfied. So what we are really left with is the fundamental gatekeeper to patentability. Should the Supreme Court raise that standard, it will effectively cede {{a great deal of}} proprietary subject matter into the public domain. So KSR potentially affects every pending patent challenge, every application at the Patent Office, and basically every proceeding everywhere involving patent rights...|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{utility models}} are {{available}} in Austria (Gebrauchsmuster), France ("certificat d'utilité"), Germany ("Gebrauchsmuster"), Italy ("modello di utilità"), Finland ("hyödyllisyysmalli"), Denmark ("brugsmodel"), Russia ("Полезная модель") and Spain (this list is however non-exhaustive).

50|$|A {{utility model}} is an {{intellectual}} property right to protect inventions. This right {{is available in}} a number of national statutes, as described below.

40|$|This explorative paper investigates how {{firms in}} the global data-processing {{industry}} that seek patent protection for their innovations in Europe have coped with the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> of the European Patent Office. Starting from a continuous research spectrum with basic research on the one extreme and development on the other, the main hypothesis is as follows: firms that carry out more basic research are more successful in passing the patent office than firms that focus more on development. Basic research explores more novel and unknown technical paths, while development aims more at modifying and redesigning existing products. Therefore, the results from more basic-oriented research are expected to fulfill the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> relatively more often than the results from development. This hypothesis is tested and largely confirmed for the global data-processing industry (with a sample of 44 firms) in the period 1986 – 1990, using indirect variables for basic research and development...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of pharmaceutical product patents in India and {{other developing countries}} {{is expected to have}} a significant effect on public health and local pharmaceutical industries. This paper draws implications from the historical experience of Japan when it introduced product patents in 1976. In Japan, narrow patents and promotion of cross-licensing were effective tools to keep drug prices in check while ensuring the {{introduction of}} new drugs. While the global pharmaceutical market surrounding India today differs considerably from that of the 1970 's, the Japanese experience offers a policy option that may profitably be considered by India today. The Indian patent system emphasizes the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirement</b> in contrast to the Japanese patent policy which relied on narrow patents and extensive licensing. R&D by local firms and the development of local products may be promoted more effectively under the Japanese model.

40|$|Because it {{must rely}} on {{imperfect}} information, the patent system will inevitably make mistakes. To determine how the system ought to err in cases of uncertainty—and whether a given mistake is worth correcting—scholars have composed a simple picture {{of the consequences of}} error in either direction. On the one hand, erroneous patent awards impose unjustified costs. On the other hand, erroneous patent denials discourage successful inventors and reduce incentives to create in the future. The result is an essentially indeterminate balancing, in which policies of overly liberal awards drive up costs, and policies of overly cautious awards drive down incentives. As this Article will show, this conventional approach to error costs understates the role that accuracy plays in producing the benefits of the patent system. Critically, the incentives to invent created by the patent system depend on the difference between an inventor’s expected returns if she invents and her expected returns if she does not invent. Erroneous patent awards do not simply increase the costs of the patent system but also narrow the expected difference between inventing and not inventing. Undeserved patent rights thus undermine the very incentives the system is intended to create. This Article presents a framework for evaluating the value of accuracy in the patent system. As it turns out, the consequences of an undeserved patent depend significantly on a factor that has not been previously given much attention: whether the unsatisfied <b>patentability</b> <b>requirement</b> is one that seeks to influence a mutually exclusive choice. Some patentability doctrines satisfy this condition, but others do not. The result is that erroneous patent awards may in some ways be more harmful and in other ways less harmful than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|The case of State Street Bank 2 ̆ 6 Trust Co. v.

The author reasons that courts often cited other bars to patentability when denying business methods protection. Furthermore, the author argues that the recent relaxation of the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> of computer related inventions would likely include the business method exception, rendering any change created by State Street Bank meaningless. Finally, the author asserts that claims for Internet business models will still be rejected by the PTO and courts under the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Patent Act...|$|R
40|$|Economic theory views patents as policy {{instruments}} aimed at fostering innovation and diffusion. Three major implications are drawn regarding current policy debates. First, patents {{may not be}} the most effective means of protection for inventors to recover R&D investments when imitation is costly and first mover advantages are important.

Third, the trade-off between the patent {{policy instruments}} of length and breadth could be used to provide sufficient incentives to develop inventions with high social value. Beyond these three implications, economic theory also pleads for a mechanism design approach: an optimal patent system could be based on a menu of different degrees of patent protection where stronger protection would involve higher fees, allowing self-selection by inventors.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of the {{fragmentation}} of intellectual property rights on optimal patent design. The major finding is that when several complementary innovative components must be assembled to operate a new technology, the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> should be stronger than in the case of stand-alone innovation. This reduces the fragmentation of intellectual property, which is socially costly. However, to preserve the incentives to innovate, if a patent is granted the strength of protection should be generally higher than in the stand-alone case.

50|$|Patents are territorial, and {{infringement}} is {{only possible}} {{in a country where}} a patent is in force. For example, if a patent is granted in the United States, then anyone in the United States is prohibited from making, using, selling or importing the patented item, while people in other countries may be free to exploit the patented invention in their country. The scope of protection may vary from country to country, because the patent is examined -or in some countries not substantively examined- by the patent office in each country or region and may be subject to different <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements.

These claims must meet relevant <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements,</b> such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|R

Two decades later, in the 2001 decision of J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v.

40|$|AbstractThe Decree Law {{numbered}} 551 {{and dated}} June 24 1995 on the Protection of Patent Rights (the Decree-Law) aims at protecting the inventions by granting patents. Not all inventions but some which have specific qualifications are patentable. Although the term “invention” is not {{defined by the}} Decree-Law, the <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> are prescribed by the Decree-Law between the articles 5 and 10. According to the Decree-Law, inventions which are novel, applicable in the industry and {{within the scope of}} patentable inventions are patentable. Novelty refers being new and surpassing the State of Art. Being applicable in the industry refers that an invention is produced or used in any field of the industry including agriculture. These are the positive <b>requirements</b> of <b>patentability.</b> Both <b>requirements</b> are essential but not enough for an invention granting a patent protection. The last and the negative <b>requirement</b> of <b>patentability</b> is that inventions as of their natures, should remain outside the scope of non-patentable inventions which are listed in the Art. 6 of the Decree-Law. All requirement are obliged to be met for an invention to be granted a patent protection. However, since the number of patent applications are really low in Turkey, all the competent authorities must make reformatory alterations and take some innovative and incentive measures in this regard, including amending a new Patent Code instead of regulating these issues with a Decree-Law, even though the provisions of this Decree-Law regarding patentability are in conformity with the international legislation and international tendencies...|$|R
40|$|Patent {{indicators}} {{are widely used}} to assess innovative output. Despite the large variety of empirical studies in the field, however, the precise meaning of these indicators and their obvious relation to patent value is still based on assumptions and intuitions. This paper provides the first empirical test of patent indicators as value measures in the structural form. It disentangles the different effects reflected in patent indicators and enhances our understanding why inventions are valuable at all. Using a newly assembled data set on European polymer patents, current assumptions on the innovation incentives set by <b>patentability</b> <b>requirements</b> (novelty, inventive activity) are tested. The estimations are carried out using a custom-tailored two stage discrete choice probit model yet unknown in the literature. The results support the assumptions that novelty and inventive activity enhance a patent’s value. They confirm the importance of backward citations, family size, and forward citations as va lue indicators. However, they expand on and partly break with the respective explanations why patent indicators correlate with profitability...|$|R
