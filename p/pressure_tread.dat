Advantages of the slightly smaller wheel include additional strength, worldwide tire availability, and lighter weight. Some touring bicycles, {{such as the}} Rivendell Atlantis and Surly Long Haul Trucker, offer frames designed for 26-inch (ISO 559) wheels or for 700C wheels, with the frame geometry optimal for the selected wheel size. Specially made touring tires for 26-inch wheels are now widely available, especially in developing countries, where 700C {{may be difficult to}} obtain. Hence, on the mass ride from Paris to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme asked all riders to use 26-inch wheels.Factors that affect rolling resistance include tire air <b>pressure,</b> <b>tread</b> and tire width as well as wheel size.|$|E
50|$|Proper vehicle safety {{requires}} specific {{attention to}} inflation <b>pressure,</b> <b>tread</b> depth, and general {{condition of the}} tires. Over-inflated tires {{run the risk of}} explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid tread wear particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain combinations of cross ply and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal. Vehicle and tire manufacturers provide owners' manuals with instructions on how to check and maintain tires.|$|E

Separating {{the effects}} of {{defoliation}} and dairy cow <b>treading</b> <b>pressure</b> on the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates in pastures. Applied Soil Ecology 46, 209 - 221. Published version available from: [URL] [URL] pasture production requires soils which are fertile, porous, and can support invertebrate populations. Soil invertebrates influence soil processes, supporting soil services (e. g., nutrient and water supply) required in pastoral soils. The hypothesis, that invertebrates would show some consistent responses to pastoral management was tested and used {{in the development of}} a biological indicator. Specifically, this thesis explored the response of soil invertebrates (macrofauna, mesofauna and nematodes) to a diversity of pasture managements (livestock type, stocking rate, fertiliser application, irrigation), collecting soil samples from nine sheep grazed, 17 dairy grazed and 15 ungrazed long term research and commercial pastures. Focus was on the influence of management practices on soil physical condition and potential food resources for the soil food web. Food resources influenced invertebrates, particularly in soils with lower stock live weight loading. Nematodes tended to respond positively to increased pasture production with increases in plant feeding nematodes. The physical disturbance associated with dairy cow treading was pronounced (compared with that of sheep treading) and this had consequences for the invertebrate community. Oribatida were low in abundance in dairy grazed pastures and slow to recover when <b>treading</b> <b>pressures</b> were removed. Some larger, predatory nematodes were sensitive to treading, but recovered when <b>treading</b> <b>pressures</b> were removed. Earthworms are capable of creating their own burrows and were more resistant to stock treading, especially anecic species. The calculated effect of earthworms on nitrogen mineralisation was greater under organic than conventional dairy pasture management. The importance of soil invertebrates in regulating nitrogen supply to plants in a compacted and high nitrogen fertility soil was demonstrated in a constructed mesocosm. The influences of management on food resources and soil physical condition, and their relationships with invertebrates form critical components of a proposed invertebrate threshold indicator. Habitable pore space appeared to be a reliable indicator of invertebrate populations, as food may not always limit populations in pastures. The indicator, based on invertebrates (i. e., Nematode Channel Ratio, Plant Parasitic Index, abundances of earthworm functional groups, Oribatida, nematodes and herbivorous macrofauna) was linked to soil services by establishing thresholds at which soil services might be 'limited' or 'sustained'. Suggestions on how to manipulate invertebrate abundance are made. The proposed indicator may provide land managers with a tool linking invertebrates to soil services required for sustained pasture production...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive {{bonds in}} the {{passenger}} car tyre/road surface contact have a large influence on the contact dynamics for certain tyre/road combinations. The effect is most pronounced for road surfaces with low roughness, so-called smooth surfaces. An experimental setup was designed to study time records of contact forces and sound <b>pressures</b> as tyre <b>tread</b> samples are hastily separated from road surfaces samples. The general character of the separation process on a macroscopic length scale is described, interpreted, and related to theories on smaller scales. A single value (dynamic) adherence force is determined out of the records and it {{is related to the}} initial conditions; magnitude of preload, preload duration, and unloading rate. It was found that the exact contact geometry, on larger scales, yields the details in the contact force record and distribution of sound pressure levels in 1 / 3 -octave bands. A model aiming at describing the observed behaviour must consider a wide range of length scales; a dynamic contact model is proposed that considers the exact contact geometry on larger scales via discretisation and uses statistical properties of the surfaces at lower scales to determine contact criteria at contact points...|$|R

This ability for cars to sense, infer, and act facilitates data-driven improvements in occupant experience and vehicle design. This thesis explores informed individual vehicle improvements and proposes a secure and efficient architecture supporting connected vehicle applications. Applying On-Board Diagnostic and smartphone data, I built {{a suite of}} prognostic applications. Engine coolant temperature data supports inference of oil viscosity and remaining life. A linear SVM using Fourier, Wavelet, and Mel Cepstrum audio features provides 99 % accurate engine misfire detection. PCA-transformed Fourier acceleration features and GPS data inform decision trees attaining 91 % wheel imbalance and 80 % tire <b>pressure</b> and <b>tread</b> depth classification accuracy. These applications demonstrate the ability for local vehicle and peripheral device data to proactively improve individual vehicle reliability and performance. Connectivity facilitates crowdsourced data to further improve current vehicles and future designs. Exploring vehicular connectivity, I consider data timeliness, availability and bandwidth cost {{in the context of}} an efficiency-improving idle time predictor. This predictor uses contextual information to eliminate short idle shutoffs in Automatic Engine Start/Stop systems, minimizing driver annoyance and improving compliance. These applications reveal an opportunity to address excess resource consumption and system insecurity in Connected Vehicles and other constrained devices. I introduce a secure and efficient model-based Internet of Things (IoT) architecture consisting of a "Data Proxy" utilizing a Cloud-run estimator to mirror an object with limited sensor input. The use of digital duplicates abstracts physical from digital objects, allowing the use of a mediating "Cognitive Layer" consisting of firewall and supervisory elements. These "Cognitive" elements apply the system model to monitor system evolution and simulate the impact of commands against known and learned limits. Finally, I propose incorporating this architecture into the CloudThink digital object duplication platform. Proxies maximize data collected per unit cost, while the firewall and supervisory elements will allow increased actuator access and to support generalized Cloud-based prognostics. I discuss how CloudThink's data ownership policies and privacy visualization tools combine with this architecture to address consumer privacy and security concerns, improving consumer acceptance of Connected Vehicles. by Joshua Eric Siegel.

40|$|Susu Dam is an RCC Dam under {{construction}} in Peninsula Malaysia. The dam design {{has been carried out}} by SMEC International in its offices in Kuala Lumpur. The dam is some 90 m tall. The overfall stepped spillway provides for discharges to enter a hydraulic jump stilling basin for energy dissipation, prior to passing through a culvert under a roadway. The spillway was subject to hydraulic model testing at the Utah Water Research Laboratory of Utah State University (USA), at a length scale of 1 : 30. The hydraulic performance of the spillway design was evaluated up to the 4, 700 m 3 /s Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge (almost 1, 000 L/s model scale). The spillway was tested through a number of configurations, prior {{to the development of the}} final arrangement. The purpose of the paper is to describe the modelling detail, and then focus on the flow behaviour at the stair-stepped spillway chute with 2. 4 m high steps, in particular the piezometric pressures and transient <b>pressures</b> on the <b>tread</b> and riser of the steps. The spillway chute converged from ~ 100 m at the crest to 78 m at the bottom at entrance to the stilling basin; the unit discharge entering the stilling basin was ~ 60 m 2 /s for the PMF. Of particular interest was the occurrence of negative pressures on the steps, and the paper will describe the transients for several discharges from the AEP 1 in 1, 000 up to the PMF; the results indicating very low pressures into a cavitation region. The design provides for an aerator across the spillway in order to counter the effects of possible cavitation. Results will be presented with and without the aerator operating. The paper provides useful design information for the hydraulic design of stepped spillways...|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} forces developed between the tire and wet pavement {{have a great}} effect on the safety of vehicles. This paper exposes {{the results of a}} study, which aims at modeling the hydroplaning phenomenon taking into account the load transfer between the rear and the front wheels, the water depth on the road, the skid resistance before total hydroplaning. A part of this work was funded by the PREDIT 3 (IRCAD project). In a first step, a comparison of the main existing tire/road contact models was realized. This work aimed at evaluating the models regarding the hypothesis made (parameters needed, physical properties taken into account or not). This bibliographical study concluded {{on the fact that the}} speed of the vehicle, the tires' characteristics (<b>pressure,</b> contact area, <b>tread</b> depth) the load, the water depth, the road profile and macrotexture were the most important parameters that should be included in a global hydroplaning model. Among these parameters, the water depth seems to be the most difficult to evaluate considering the fact that it deeply depends on the pavement irregularities (roughness and texture), the road geometry and the weather (rainfall intensity). That's why the French Regional Laboratory of Road and Bridges of Lyon proposes in a second step a model, which calculates the water depth by taking into account the geometry and the macrotexture of the road. A device called VANI measures the longitudinal slope, the transversal slope, the radius of curvature and the macrotexture of the road each meter. Thus, a vector is calculated each meter giving the main direction of the water flow. The individual vectors are added in view of determining the line of the water flow all along the road. Thus, it is possible to obtain cartography of the road containing the main water flow lines, the tops and the bottoms where the water is accumulating. The lengths of these lines are then used for the calculus of the water depth depending on the rainfall intensity and the road macrotexture. An experimental validation is realized by using a captor measuring the real water depth on the road. In a third step, this initial water depth is used in a bicycle model, which describes the longitudinal dynamics phenomenon. The load transfer between the front and the rear axles is calculated in straight line taken into account the skid resistance of the road (Longitudinal friction coefficient) and the driver behavior (acceleration, braking). Moreover, the water depth behind the rear tire is calculated by considering the water displacement generated by the front tires. The, the increase of the water thickness just behind the tire due to the flow in the tire tread and the pavement macrotexture is modeled with Navier stokes equations. Finally, this model provides a hydroplaning speed depending both on the infrastructure characteristic (geometry, skid resistance) and the vehicle characteristics (tire, pressure, load), which is used for warning the drivers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{includes}} some basic knowledge {{to be considered}} when discussing {{about the quality of}} work in harvesting wood and how to monitor it. This knowledge may aid to form an appropriate view on mechanised logging, environmental issues and trade of forest products. Many forest owners feel today, that leaving a good quality of work behind is the most important requirement set for logging machinery in the future. It is possible to present to the forest machine and equipment manufacturers some ideas on how to promote and influence the development of logging machines and equipment. This paper is partly based on a literature study, partly on theme interviews. Recent literature on productivity, machine and method studies on logging was examined from the quality of work point of view. Observations supporting an improvement in the quality of work were recorded. The idea was not to find out the level of the quality of work in practice as such, but to assess the relationships between the methods, machines and equipment used in respect to the quality of work. The interviews were conducted from May 22, 2000 to October 2, 2000 in Finland. The data consisted of six persons responsible for logging in a wood procurement district, six representatives of forest machine manufacturers and five logging contractors. A good quality of work in logging is characterised by doing it in an agreed way. Indicators for reaching the goals are evaluated by assessing the damages caused to the remaining trees, the rut formation, the strip road spacing and width, the way the thinning regimes are followed and the choice of trees to be cut. The target level is formed as a joint effect e. g. of efficiency in wood production, of credibility of mechanised operations, of considering the environment and of fluency in trade of forest products. Contributing factors to reach a good quality of work are the organisation of the logging, the forest machine operator as well as the machine and equipment technique. These factors may get a weighting value. However, the final result is a product of these factors, and all of them have to be considered. When looking at the situation today the human influence in logging, especially the role of the operator, is getting more emphasis. On the other hand, in the long run the possibilities to develop appropriate technologies are dominating, especially the use of new technologies. From {{the point of view of}} logging machinery the main factors affecting the work results, are the mobility of the vehicle, how to operate it and the work environment. In this paper, based on the development needs and possibilities, those aspects are looked at. An assessment of the present state is given and presents a basis for a more precise prediction of realistic targets. Based on a literature review and interviews conducted, it is possible to conclude, that there still is great potential to improve the quality of work in logging. Some direct technical improvements could promote the quality of work, but there are even some other actions, which indirectly through the operator would have a positive effect. An improved quality of work is often also improving the productivity in work. Furthermore it makes the organising of the logging operations easier and makes it possible to operate in a more demanding work environment even year around and 24 hours a day. The following is a list of research and development (R&D) needs concerning forest machinery, where inputs would be justified: •	Better visibility (illumination, no dazzling, visibility) •	Analysis of the CTI-system and eventual construction and testing of a test machine •	The properties of tyres (width, diameter, <b>tread,</b> <b>pressure)</b> and their development •	Control of the crane and its development (e. g. the automatic functions) •	The role of a rotating cab on the operator, his productivity and the work result •	Research into the role of levelling (seat, cabin, whole machine) •	Steering of the machine (turning radius, “cutting” of corners) and possibilities to develop a vehicle with frame-steering and turning wheels •	Research into the possibilities to utilise on-board weighing scales •	Lighter machine construction •	The role of tracks and comparison of different tracks •	The role of a balanced boggie and its comparison with a single wheel •	The role of the size of the harvester head on the operation control, work result and productivity •	Possibilities to increase automation •	Possibilities of work rotation and its effect on a normal logging system •	The effect of a harwarder (harvester-forwarder) on the operator’s work 28 p...|$|R
