40|$|An {{actuated}} {{latch pin}} developed {{to meet the}} need for a reusable locking device is described. The unit can function as a pin puller or as a <b>pin</b> <b>pusher</b> latch. Initial prototype testing demonstrated the feasibility of the device with the unit being driven from a 28 V dc supply and using 15 W to drive a 12 mm diameter pin through a stroke of 10 mm with a side load of 100 N in 120 ms. High wear rates with a MOS 2 lubrication on the ballscrew and angular contact bearings have necessitated the reduction in the duty cycle from 1000 cycles in air and vacuum to 100 in air and 1000 in vacuum...|$|E

50|$|Magnetic-coded {{technology}} utilizes multiple {{pairs of}} magnetic pins with opposing poles that are embedded inside keys and plugs. When a correctly matched key is {{inserted into the}} lock, not only are all the mechanical <b>pins</b> <b>pushed</b> into the correct positions, the magnetic pins are also driven to the appropriate level by the magnetic force inside the key.|$|R
25|$|The Predalien shares many {{characteristics}} {{with its}} host, such as long hair-like appendages, mandibles, skin color and similar vocalizations. It is a large, bulky creature, and possesses physical strength {{greater than that}} of human-spawned Aliens. Like human-born Aliens, it is also shown to be stronger than its host species, as evidenced by its ability to <b>pin,</b> <b>push,</b> and knock a Predator away with ease.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>push</b> <b>pin</b> {{was invented}} in 1900 by Edwin Moore and quickly became a success. These pins are also called [...] "thumbtacks". There is also a new <b>push</b> <b>pin</b> called a [...] "paper cricket".|$|R
50|$|Standard {{international}} cartridges {{are closed}} {{by a small}} ball, held inside the ink exit hole by glue or by a very thin layer of plastic. When the cartridge is pressed into the pen, a small <b>pin</b> <b>pushes</b> in the ball, which falls inside the cartridge. The Parker and Lamy cartridges do not have such a ball. They are closed by a piece of plastic, which is broken by a sharp pin when inserted in the pen.|$|R

50|$|For larger {{heat sinks}} and higher preloads, <b>push</b> <b>pins</b> with {{compression}} springs are very effective. The <b>push</b> <b>pins,</b> typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb {{at the end}} that engages {{with a hole in}} the PCB; once installed, the barb retains the pin. The compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. Care is needed in selection of <b>push</b> <b>pin</b> size. Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.|$|R

5000|$|A chain tool {{is a small}} {{mechanical}} device used to [...] "break" [...] a bicycle chain {{in such a way}} that it can be mended with the same tool. A bicycle chain has links and plates that are pinned together; these <b>pins</b> can be <b>pushed</b> out with the chain tool. Because the <b>pins</b> are <b>pushed</b> out gradually with a screw, they can be partially removed or fully removed, depending upon the intention of the user.|$|R

Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the <b>pins</b> <b>pushed</b> into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|R
25|$|The Duplex or Reversible machine derives {{its name}} {{from the fact that it}} prints both sides of the cloth. It {{consists}} really of two ordinary machines so combined that when the cloth passes, fully printed on one side from the first, its plain side is exposed to the rollers of the second, which print an exact duplicate of the first impression upon it in such a way that both printings coincide. A <b>pin</b> <b>pushed</b> through the face of the cloth ought to protrude through the corresponding part of the design printed on the back if the two patterns are in good fit.|$|R

50|$|A pinscreen is a {{white screen}} {{perforated}} with thousands of pins in small holes. Light shines {{from the side of}} the screen causing each pin to cast a shadow. Each pin, being able to slide back and forth through the holes, can cast different shadows. The pins do not move easily, presenting some resistance to movement in order to avoid unintended dislocation and thus image error. The pins' motion resistance depends on the pinscreen calibration. The white screen becomes darker the farther the <b>pins</b> are <b>pushed</b> out, protruding from the surface. The more the <b>pins</b> are <b>pushed</b> in less shadows are cast, the lighter the screen becomes, giving a grayish tone and eventually an all-white screen again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inventor}} Charles Morrill {{introduced a}} saw set with a plunger {{based on his}} patent. [...] This design, as well as improvements added to it, came into prolific use and in the United States are frequently found with woodworking tools. An image of a Morrill design saw set is found at {{the introduction of the}} article. The plunger (also, <b>pin)</b> <b>pushes</b> against the saw tooth when the handles are squeezed together. The other face of the saw tooth rests against an anvil and the whole saw blade is held at the desired angle to the anvil by a stop or rest. On most designs both the anvil and the rest are adjustable.|$|R

50|$|While still a student, he {{produced}} his first commissioned illustration, a pencil drawing {{which appeared in}} the October 1959 issue of Playboy Magazine. After finishing his courses at School of Visual Arts, he was hired by Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast, partners in the groundbreaking <b>Push</b> <b>Pin</b> Studios. A series of his target paintings was the subject of issue 32 (1961) of the studio’s publication, The <b>Push</b> <b>Pin</b> Graphic. He then illustrated “A Bestiary” of famous people, conceived and written by artist Edward Sorel {{which appeared in the}} July 1962 issue of Horizon Magazine.|$|R

50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has spring <b>pins</b> that <b>push</b> up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the spring pins may be too short.|$|R
5000|$|ZIF sockets can be {{used for}} ball grid array chips, {{particularly}} during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a [...] "ZIF socket" [...] in the traditional sense, does a better job by using spring <b>pins</b> to <b>push</b> up underneath the balls.|$|R
5000|$|Display {{board for}} a tablet is an {{interactive}} display board made by attaching an electronic multimedia device to the display board.
