50|$|The {{earliest}} land {{sales in}} the suburb included the Palace Hotel and a Wesleyan Church, both acquired in 1879. In 1886, the borough had a population of approximately 6,000, with approximately 20 new buildings opening each month.

30|$|The control {{variables}} of algorithm 1 are continuous {{with respect to}} time, as such the algorithm approximates optimal control as constant for any given time step. However, each central iteration of Algorithm 2 will trigger optimal values to be updated by the local controller and so the control update rate is dependent only on the central coordinator’s update rate. This brief <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> regular corrections to the optimal control in response to system state changes which are assumed minimal within the update period.|$|R

50|$|Commercial vinegar is {{produced}} either by a fast or a slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods {{are used in}} traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly {{over the course of}} a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods add mother of vinegar (bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced between 20 hours to three days.|$|R
50|$|Huntsman and Barber (1977) {{hypothesized}} that high productivity results from alternating upwelling events and relatively calm periods. Upwelling {{is necessary to}} bring the nutrients to the surface but if the event is sustained {{for a long period}} of time, it is tough for phytoplankton to remain in the euphotic zone. Calm <b>periods</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> stratification to develop, which means that phytoplankton can grow and multiply while held in the shallow mixed layer. In other words, there is a miniature spring bloom during each calm period (Mann & Lazier, 1996).|$|R

40|$|The {{premise of}} this paper is that in mergers the {{manageability}} of acquisitions significantly affects the wealth of shareholders of acquiring firms. Specifically, the relative size of partners as well as the industrial relatedness of the two firms are examined. The test <b>period</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the determination of announcement, interim, and consummation effects of the mergers on shareholder wealth. It is found that acquisitions of relatively large firms from unrelated industries lead to significant declines in the wealth of shareholders of acquiring firms, and that this result is most pronounced when the period is extended beyond the announcement through the effective dates...|$|R
