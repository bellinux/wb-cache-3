25|$|Views was previewed in London, {{before its}} premiere on Beats 1 a day later. It was {{released}} as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on April 29, before being {{made available to}} various other platforms later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also achieved double-platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units {{in the first week}} of its release, as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album. Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He would later plan to release a short film entitled <b>Please</b> <b>Forgive</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Under Casolaro's body, paramedics {{found an}} empty Milwaukee beer can, two white plastic liner-trash bags, {{and a single}} edge razor blade. There was also a half-empty wine bottle nearby. Ridgeway and Vaughan write that nothing {{was placed in the}} bathtub drain to prevent debris from {{draining}} away, and none of the bathwater was saved. Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: [...] "To those who I love the most: <b>Please</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for the worst possible thing I could have done. Most of all I'm sorry to my son. I know deep down inside that God will let me in." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Simeona's {{death in}} 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored {{a book with}} Joe Vitale called Zero Limits {{referring}} to Simeona's Hooponopono teachings. Len makes no {{claim to be a}} kahuna. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Hooponopono is getting to [...] "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity." [...] To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the mantra, [...] "I love you. I'm sorry. <b>Please</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> [...] Thank you." [...] It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility, taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life. The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being. As such, it is similar to the philosophy of solipsism.|$|E

2500|$|Drake {{returned}} to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, {{serving as the}} show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named {{as a member of}} the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop, placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake suffering an ankle injury. During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and Drake had began working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the music video for [...] "Child's Play" [...] was released, depicting Drake and Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics. On September 26, <b>Please</b> <b>Forgive</b> <b>Me</b> was released as an Apple Music exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from Views.|$|E

50|$|Her {{grandson}} Charles XII {{had great}} respect for her. There is a well-known episode from the so-called Gottorp Fury, when Charles XII spent his time drinking and partying with his brother-in-law Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. At one occasion, Charles XII encountered his grandmother {{in a state of}} drunkenness, upon which she gave him a long look and then turned her back to him. He reacted by emptying his cup and saying: “My Gracious Lady Grandmother is <b>pleased</b> to <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> From hereafter I will never more drink wine”, a promise he kept. During the Great Northern War, she represented her absent grandson and received the foreign ambassadors in his place. According to their reports, she treated them with silence or could laugh at them.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{three years in the}} making. It is {{probably}} impossible to thank all who have helped in so many ways – thus if I leave somebody out, <b>please</b> do <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> Firstly, I would like to thank a very dear friend of mine, Rex Mathie, for allowing me to spend time picking his brains while he was so busy and ill. Rex, your Christlike love, warmth and kindness have overwhelmed me. Next, I would like to thank my collegue, Christopher Peppler, for always being there to put me back on track when I went astray. Thirdly, I would like to thank all those pastors and church members who devoted a lot of their precious time by allowing me to interview them. Second to last, I would like to thank Alrah Pitchers for getting me to think carefully about the many issues that are discussed in this thesis. Lastly, I would like to thank my wife and family for supporting me over these arduous three years – you have all been amazing...|$|R
60|$|Amidst these his labors, his Grace will be <b>pleased</b> to <b>forgive</b> <b>me,</b> if my zeal, less enlightened, to be sure, {{than his}} by midnight lamps and studies, has presumed to talk too favorably of this Constitution, {{and even to}} say {{something}} sounding like approbation of that body which has the honor to reckon his Grace {{at the head of}} it, Those who dislike this partiality, or, if his Grace pleases, this flattery of mine, have a comfort at hand. I may be refuted and brought to shame by the most convincing of all refutations, a practical refutation. Every individual peer for himself may show that I was ridiculously wrong; the whole body of those noble persons may refute me for the whole corps. If they please, they are more powerful advocates against themselves than a thousand scribblers like me can be in their favor. If I were even possessed of those powers which his Grace, in order to heighten my offence, is pleased to attribute to me, there would be little difference. The eloquence of Mr. Erskine might save Mr. ***** from the gallows, but no eloquence could save Mr. Jackson from the effects of his own potion.|$|R

40|$|Now, that I am {{approaching}} {{the end of}} my Ph. D. thesis, it {{is a good time to}} look back and conclude a period which is a substantial part of my life. The memory is a (frequency?) selective thing. Good memories stay with you and bad ones tend to fade and/or turn into good ones, considering the experience you gain out of it. My summary must be incomplete- unfortunately- because there are only so many pages to write on and there are so many people I was fortunate to meet and so many experiences to make in a 4 year span of time. <b>Please,</b> anybody <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> whom I don’t give enough reward in these few lines. First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Prof. Gabriel Rebeiz. It was a little bit because of him that I decided at all to pursue a Ph. D. degree. I met him when I did my Diplomarbeit at the University of Michigan in summer 1999 as a visiting student and he asked me then- after getting to know each other for a couple of months- to join his group.
