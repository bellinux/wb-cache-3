2500|$|Because {{contracts}} concern voluntary obligations, {{the courts}} employ {{a number of}} protections to ensure only people who give informed and true consent are legally bound. Before 1875, the common law courts only allowed escape from an agreement and damages if someone was induced to enter an agreement by fraud or was put under <b>physical</b> <b>duress,</b> or suffered {{from a lack of}} legal capacity. The courts of equity, however, were significantly more generous because they allowed [...] "rescission" [...] (i.e. cancellation) of a contract if a person was the victim of any misrepresentation, even an innocent one, and any [...] "undue influence", beyond influence by physical threats. In these situations the victim of the misrepresentation or unconscionable behaviour has the option to avoid the contract. If avoided, the parties are both entitled to have returned whatever property they had already conveyed, so nobody remains unjustly enriched (though this terminology was not used till the 20th century). As the 20th century unfolded, the courts and statute expanded on the range of circumstances in which a person could claim damages for negligent misrepresentation, on top of fraud. As concern over the use of unfair terms grew, there were calls to recognise a positive duty on contracting parties to disclose material facts {{as part of a broader}} duty of [...] "good faith" [...] and some judges attempted to follow the American Uniform Commercial Code by fashioning a broader doctrine of [...] "unconscionable" [...] bargains, procured through inequality of bargaining power. This development was, however, stopped by the House of Lords, so that problems of unfair contract terms continued to be dealt with through targeted legislation. The courts also declare contracts void if they were for an illegal purpose, and refuse to enforce the agreement, or give any legal remedy if doing so would require a person to rely on their illegal act.|$|E

Their use is being driven by the sudden surge of interest in “salivaomics,” a new field in medicine studying saliva’s genetic code, proteome and methabolom. Interestingly, it is not the primary functions of the enzyme and the protein, but the ingenious capture of their secondary ones (maintenance of the acid-alkaline balance and bactericidal / antifungal action) that allows for a swift, precise and pain-free measurement under <b>physical</b> and mental <b>duress.</b> Upon stimulation, sAA and sCgA are almost simultaneously released.

2500|$|Inspired by his 1872 {{journey to}} Lake Ladoga, The Enchanted Wanderer (1873) was an amorphous, loosely {{structured}} piece of work, with several plotlines intertwined – the form Leskov thought the traditional novel {{was destined to}} be superseded by. Decades later scholars praised the story, comparing the character of Ivan Flyagin to that of Ilya Muromets, as symbolizing [...] "the <b>physical</b> and moral <b>duress</b> of the Russian man in times of trouble," [...] but the response of contemporary critics was lukewarm, Nikolay Mikhaylovsky complaining of its general formlessness: [...] "details stringed together like beads, totally interchangeable." [...] While all of Leskov's previous works were severely cut, this {{was the first one to}} be rejected outright; it had to be published in the odd October and November issues of the Russky mir newspaper [...] In December 1873 Leskov took part in Skladchina, the charity anthology aimed at helping victims of famine in Russia.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Frank Fuster - {{the owner}} of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in the Country Walk suburb of Miami, Florida - was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse. He was sentenced to a prison with a minimum length of 165 years. Fuster's victims testified that he led them in Satanic rituals and terrorized them by forcing them to watch him {{mutilate}} birds, a lesson to children who might reveal the abuse. Fuster had been previously convicted for manslaughter and for fondling a 9-year-old child. Testimony from children in the case was elicited by University of Miami child psychologists Laurie and Joseph Braga, who resorted to coercive questioning of the alleged victims when the desired answers were not forthcoming. Fuster's wife recanted her court testimony in an interview with Frontline, saying that she had been kept naked in solitary confinement and subjected to other forms of <b>physical</b> and psychological <b>duress</b> until she had agreed to testify against her husband.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore how Mount Everest climbers {{experienced}} cognitive dissonance in their natural setting. This study also set out to explore the role of self-concept and feelings in Mount Everest climbers' experiences with the phenomenon. Guided by the ethnomethodological (Garfinkel, 1967) school of thought, Aronson's (1968, 1992) self-consistency revision of Festinger's (1957) original cognitive dissonance theory and the Resonance Performance Model (Newburg, Kimiecik, Durand-Bush, & Doell, 2002) were used as conceptual guides. The research methodology included a narrative (Sparkes, 2002) multicase study (Stake, 1995) approach involving multiple in-depth interviews captured on video and participant observation captured by field notes. Six climbers attempting to scale Mount Everest comprised the case studies; five men and one woman. Data were collected over an entire climbing season and one month after the participants returned home from the mountain. Guided by Gergen and Gergen's (1983) strategy for analyzing the structure and content of narratives, data analysis occurred on three levels. First, for each participant the researcher developed a background profile. Second, a narrative case study analysis was performed to explore how the participants experienced cognitive dissonance. The third level of data analysis entailed a cross-case study analysis to explore the patterns of similarity and difference between narratives or themes expressed. Cognitive dissonance was routinely experienced by all six of the participants to socially organize behavior and produce a sense of order from within the Mount Everest culture. That is, whenever the participants interpreted a discrepancy between their behavior and their own standards for competence and morality, which derive from the conventional morals and prevailing values of the society to which they belonged, they experienced feelings of psychological discomfort which lead them to try and reduce or eliminate it through a process of self-justification. Specifically, this process of reducing cognitive dissonance involved the climbers reconstructing the past in such a way that restored their pre-formed notion of self. Through language and reasoning, which were part and parcel with the situated activities of climbing the mountain, the climbers arrived at an interpretation of their day-to-day activities that not only appeared normal, natural, and real, but also felt good to them. The climbers' experiences with cognitive dissonance, which were defined by an ongoing reconstruction of meaning, allowed them to make sense of self-discrepant acts as they strived to achieve not only a sense of cognitive and affective self-consistency but also shared knowledge. The findings in the present study provide support for Aronson's (1968, 1992) self-consistency perspective of cognitive dissonance. More importantly, the study's most notable contribution to the existing body of work on cognitive dissonance is not the empirically based confirmation that Mount Everest climbers do indeed experience dissonance when their self-concept is involved, but an explanation of how the processes underlying the phenomenon are experienced in the minds of these climbers when under extreme <b>physical</b> and psychological <b>duress.</b> Using an ethnomethodological narrative case study approach, this study afforded a unique way of understanding how cognitive dissonance is internalized in the subjective consciousness of climbers...|$|R

5000|$|The Privy Council {{advised that}} Barton could avoid the {{contract}} for being under duress, {{and it did}} not matter that he may have agreed to the deal any way. Lord Cross, Lord Kilbrandon and Sir Garfield Barwick held that <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> {{does not need to be}} the main reason, it must merely be one reason for entering an agreement. Lord Cross said the same rule should apply for duress as in misrepresentation, 'that if Armstrong's threats were 'a' reason for Barton’s executing the deed he is entitled to relief even though he might well have entered into the contract if Armstrong had uttered no threats to induce him to do so...' ...|$|E
5000|$|Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural & Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> simply: [...] "Your {{money or}} your life." [...] In Barton v Armstrong, a {{decision}} of the Privy Council, Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made {{and that it was}} a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff's decision to enter the agreement.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} the work that slaves did had a direct effect on aspects of slaves' lives such as life {{expectancy}} and family formation. An example from an early inventory of African slaves (1569-71) from the plantation of Sergipe do Conde in Bahia shows that he owned nineteen males and one female. These uneven gender-ratios combined with the high mortality rate related to the <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> that working in a mine or on a sugar plantation (for example) could have on a slave's body. The effect was often that many New World slave economies, including Brazil, relied on a constant importation of new slaves to replace those who had died.Despite the changes in the slave population demographic related to the constant importation of slaves through the 1860s, a creole generation in the African population emerged in Brazil. By 1800, Brazil had the largest single population of African and creole slaves in any one colony in America. In 1888 Brazil abolished slavery.|$|E
5000|$|Living as a {{minority}} among the Sunni majority, however, made such a doctrine important to Shiite.Besides, the practice of concealing one's beliefs in dangerous circumstances originates in the Qur'an, which deems blameless those who disguise their beliefs in such cases. The practice of taqiyya in difficult circumstances is considered legitimate by Muslims of various sects. Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse [...] refers {{to the case of}} 'Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> and torture. This practice was emphasized in Shia Islam whereby adherents may conceal their religion when they are under threat, persecution, or compulsion. Taqiyya was developed to protect Shia who were usually in minority and under pressure. In the Shia view, taqiyya is lawful in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby. Shia commentators have argued that taqiyya has precedents from the time of Muhammad, including the story of Ammar ibn Yasir, Such commentators argue that to not avoid certain death is illogical, and that dissimulation is permissible under various circumstances, such as to preserve life, to protect the chastity of women, or avoid destitution.|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} provide novel {{insights into}} the psychophysiological processes that underpin the phenomenological experience of HTW under the constraint of amplified <b>physical</b> <b>duress.</b>|$|E
30|$|Under the {{constraint}} of amplified <b>physical</b> <b>duress,</b> {{findings are}} suggestive of heuristic and rational antecedents in the goal disengagement process. Dynamic changes in physiological and perceptual effects of LMMF and EIMD are hypothesised to underpin the observed alterations in pacing behaviour and performance fatigability during long-distance running. The applied three-dimensional framework {{provides a more}} comprehensive understanding of strain-perception-thinking-action coupling in centrally regulated and goal-directed exercise behaviour.|$|E
30|$|The sheer physicality of {{endurance}} sports, particularly long-distance running, ensures that HTW is tightly coupled to stimulus-driven processes resulting from extreme <b>physical</b> <b>duress.</b> The most popular physiological explanation for HTW is skeletal muscle glycogen depletion and hypoglycaemia [3 – 5]. However, a computational study by Rapoport [6] showed that glycogen storage capacity {{is only a}} performance-limiting factor in runners with low and moderate aerobic capacities, but may not constrain performances of highly trained long-distance runners. An alternative determinant of HTW is exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) caused by muscular exertion of unaccustomed exercise duration and/or intensity, especially when involving muscle lengthening contractions [7]. This notion is supported by length of longest training run predicting the likelihood of HTW [1, 8] and correlations between deterioration in marathon running pace and indirect haematological markers of muscle damage [9].|$|E
40|$|During manned spaceflight, acute {{vestibular}} disturbances often occur, {{leading to}} <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> {{and a loss}} of performance. Vestibular adaptation to the weightless environment follows within two to three days yet the mechanisms responsible for the disturbance and subsequent adaptation are still unknown In order to understand vestibular system function in space and normal earth conditions the basic physiological mechanisms of vestibular information co coding must be determined. Information processing regarding head movement and head position with respect to gravity takes place in the vestibular nuclei neurons that receive signals From the semicircular canals and otolith organs in the vestibular labyrinth. These neurons must synthesize the information into a coded output signal that provides for the head and eye movement reflexes as well as the conscious perception of the body in three-dimensional space The current investigation will for the first time. determine how the vestibular nuclei neurons quantitatively synthesize afferent information from the different linear and angular acceleration receptors in the vestibular labyrinths into an integrated output signal. During the second year of funding, progress on the current project has been focused on the anatomical orientation of semicircular canals and the spatial orientation of the innervating afferent responses. This information is necessary in order to understand how vestibular nuclei neurons process the incoming afferent spatial signals particularly with the convergent otolith afferent signals that are also spatially distributed Since information from the vestibular nuclei is presented to different brain regions associated with differing reflexive and sensory functions {{it is important to understand}} the computational mechanisms used by vestibular neurons to produce the appropriate output signal...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine women's {{role in the}} {{decision}} to perform caesarean section (CS). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. Written questionnaires were completed seven weeks after giving birth by CS. SETTING: An obstetric tertiary referral hospital (Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia), July to December 1996. PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of women who underwent CS over a six-month period. To be eligible, women had to be at least 18 years old, able to complete a questionnaire in English and well enough to consent to study participation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's involvement in decision making, stated preference for CS, and satisfaction with obstetric care. RESULTS: 278 women (76. 4 %) returned questionnaires: 171 women (61. 5 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 55. 8 %- 67. 2 %) reported being involved in {{the decision}} to have a CS. Factors influencing their decision were <b>physical</b> <b>duress</b> and partner's reaction during labour (emergency CS), considerations about recovery, planning for the event and pain (elective CS), and information from the doctor (both groups). Half the women "strongly agreed" that they were satisfied with the decision to have a CS, but 40. 9 % only "agreed" and 4. 7 % were "not sure". About 20 % reported they needed more information on other options, and only 28. 8 % "strongly agreed" that they had been given good information to prepare for the possibility of CS. 27. 9 % of women (95 % CI, 22. 5 %- 33. 2 %) "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they had "insisted on a CS" and 21. 3 % (95 % CI, 16. 4 %- 26. 2 %) that they had told the staff they were "keen to have a CS". Given the option of a vaginal delivery, 37. 8 % of women (95 % CI, 22. 5 %- 55. 2 %) with a breech presentation, and 34 % of women (95 % CI, 21. 2 %- 48. 8 %) who had had a previous CS, chose a CS. CONCLUSIONS: It is of concern that over a third of women felt they had not been involved {{in the decision to}} have a CS; others were very positive about CS, but an appreciable proportion may not have received sufficient information. A broad-based strategy of providing more information to women and their partners could be one way of ensuring appropriate CS rates and should be tested in a randomised controlled trial...|$|E
