5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating their <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> {{direction of}} the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base {{came to be seen}} as a key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E

5|$|Announcing <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed {{plans to}} reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and {{was used to test}} elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo {{for the first time on}} 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} some <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> which would remove the last ferries within the Sotra and Øygarden {{archipelago}}s, {{meaning that the}} entire twin archipelago would have ferry-free access to the mainland, should the Sotra Bridge be built. The plans had been spurred by a large decrease in fishing during the late 1950s, {{and the need for}} increased tax revenue from new industries. The framework for the plan started in 1961 with the creation of an inter-municipal cooperation, which in 1964 resulted in the merger of the municipalities of Hjelme and Herdla to create Øygarden. On 8 May 1962, an inter-municipal road committee was established, which recommended that a limited company be established to finance the bridge. In Bergen, Bro og Tunnelselskapet had similarly built the Puddefjord Bridge and Eidsvåg Tunnel, and the inter-municipal council recommended a similar model. However, they wanted a separate company for Sotra and Øygarden, so extra tolls could be used to help finance road projects on the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|To {{rebuild the}} damaged {{parts of the}} site, the {{relevant}} approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E

25|$|In Middle and Eastern Finland, great {{amounts of}} tar were {{produced}} for export. European nations needed this {{material for the}} maintenance of their fleets.

The people were developing more expectations and <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> and when these were not realized, they were quick to blame witches—according to a belief system the Lutheran church had imported from Germany.|$|E

In October 1991 the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> They managed to resolve their differences by allowing each member to speak about his feelings without interruption from each other.

25|$|From this moment, Martí and the CRP {{were devoted}} to {{secretly}} organizing the anti-Spanish war. Martí's newspaper, Patria, was a key instrument of this campaign, where Martí delineated his final plans for Cuba. Through this medium he argued against the exploitative colonialism of Spain in Cuba, criticized the Home Rule (Autonomista) Party for having aims that fell considerably short of full independence, and warned against U.S. annexationism which he felt could only be prevented by Cuba's successful independence. He specified his <b>plans</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Cuban Republic, a multi-class and multi-racial democratic republic based on universal suffrage, with an egalitarian economic base to develop fully Cuba's productive resources and an equitable distribution of land among citizens, with enlightened and virtuous politicians.|$|E
