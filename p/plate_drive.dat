50|$|The {{reactor core}} {{assembly}} {{is contained in}} an 8-ft (2.44-m)-diameter pressure vessel located {{in a pool of}} water. The top of the pressure vessel is 17 ft (5.18 m) below the pool surface. The control <b>plate</b> <b>drive</b> mechanisms are located in a sub-pile room beneath the pressure vessel. These features provide the necessary shielding for working above the reactor core and greatly facilitate access to the pressure vessel, core, and reflector regions.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrostatic}} drive {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement pumps and motors are used, one revolution of the pump or motor corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that {{is determined by the}} displacement regardless of speed or torque. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the pump or motor. Many different design variations have been used. A swash <b>plate</b> <b>drive</b> employs an axial piston pump and/or motor in which the swash plate angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytic}} model of aluminized explosive products {{based on the}} method of characteristics for planar isentropic flow is proposed herein. The contribution of Al oxidation in the explosion products is investigated analytically. The flow behind the detonation front cannot be treated as isentropic due to the Al oxidation in the products. To solve the nonisentropic flow field of aluminized explosives products analytically, the assumption of local isentropic process is proposed. Based on this assumption, the flow field behind the detonation front of aluminized explosive {{is a function of}} only the reacted aluminum mass fraction in each time range. The metal plate test was conducted with the metal <b>plate</b> <b>driven</b> by RDX/Al/wax (76 / 20 / 4) and RDX/LiF/wax (76 / 20 / 4). The reacted aluminum mass can be obtained indirectly from the experiment results. The reacted aluminum mass was then applied to the {{analytic model}}, and the velocity of metal <b>plate</b> <b>driven</b> by RDX/Al/wax (76 / 20 / 4) and RDX/LiF/wax (76 / 20 / 4) was calculated.

50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash <b>plate</b> <b>drive</b> has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{design analysis}} was conducted on a nutating plate type drive system for a 2500 horsepower helicopter main rotor gear box. A drive system that split the output torque evenly between two nutating plates {{for the purpose of}} reducing the load on each nutating plate was analyzed. Needle bearings were used on the nutating plate pins. The results of the analysis indicate that the required load capacity of the pin bearings and the speed of the nutating plate bearings were beyond the state-of-the-art capacity of rolling-element bearings. The analysis further indicates that the nutating <b>plate</b> <b>drive</b> is less efficient, and results in a higher weight per horsepower than a conventional planetary helicopter transmission with similar design specifications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Microtubule gliding assays, {{in which}} {{molecular}} motors anchored to a <b>plate</b> <b>drive</b> the gliding motion of filaments in a quasi-two-dimensional fluid layer, {{have been shown}} to organize into a variety of large-scale patterns. We derive a fully three-dimensional multiscale coarse-grained model of a gliding assay including the evolution of densities of rigid filaments, bound motors, and free motors, coupled to fluid equations. Our model combines continuum theories of polymeric liquids with the force spreading approach of the immersed boundary method. We use dimensional and asymptotic analysis to derive a reduced two-dimensional model and show that, to leading order, the filaments evolve in a plane, similar to what is experimentally observed. We simulate our model numerically with a GPU-based implementation and observe the same qualitative behavior as in experimental work...|$|E

40|$|This {{technical}} note presents the optimal position and orientation of a piezoelectric patch actuator {{for improving the}} controllability of isotropic plates against vibration. The main focus is on controlling the first five modes either individually or simultaneously. Four rectangular aluminum plates of different aspect ratios and of either simply-supported or cantilevered boundary condition are considered. A formula incorporating results from finite-element analyses is developed to predict the steady-state responses of <b>plates</b> <b>driven</b> by a single piezoelectric patch. Simulation results show that, in general, the controllability of plates is insensitive to patch orientation {{as far as the}} present investigation is concerned. For the simply-supported plates, the optimal patch positions coincide exactly with anti-nodes of the vibration modes being considered. This, however, is only true for specific modes of the cantilevered plates. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Monolithic {{nitrocellulose}} and cellulose (NC-C) composites solidified with starch {{were used}} in a model reactive armour with steel plates. The acceleration ability of the gaseous reaction products of composites was examined {{by the use of}} X-ray technique. The effectiveness of the reactive armour containing NC-C composites in weakening the ability of jet penetration was assessed experimentally {{on the basis of the}} size of holes in the steel plates and effects of the impact of jet particles on a steel plate located under the armour. It has been shown that the size of the holes in the <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> increases and the degree of penetration of the “witness ” plate is reduced with the decrease of the angle of jet impact. The modified Gurney model was applied to simulate the process of driving steel plates in the reactive armor with a layer of NC-C composite.

The multi-physical phenomena of explosive welding, including acceleration of the flyer <b>plate</b> <b>driven</b> by explosive detonation, oblique collision of the flyer and base plates, jetting phenomenon {{and the formation of}} wavy interface can be reproduced in the simulation. The characteristics of explosive welding are analyzed based on the simulation results. The mechanism of wavy interface formation is mainly due to oscillation of the collision point on the bonding surfaces. In addition, the impact velocity and collision angle increase with the increase of the welding parameters, such as explosive thickness and standoff distance, resulting in enlargement of the interfacial waves...|$|R
