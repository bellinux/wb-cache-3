50|$|The Lucayans grew {{root crops}} and hunted, fished and {{gathered}} wild foods. The staple crop of the Lucayans was manioc (cassava). The Spanish {{reported that the}} Tainos also grew sweet potatoes, cocoyams, arrowroot, leren, yampee, peanuts, beans and cucurbits, and the Lucayans probably took most, if not all, of those crops {{with them to the}} Bahamas. Maize was a recent introduction to the Greater Antilles when the Spanish arrived, and was only a minor component of the Taino and, presumably, Lucayan diets.

50|$|The {{garden was}} {{established}} in 1922 by the Sikkim Forest Department. From 1922-1954 the Forest Manager nurtured the garden as his pet project with intense involvement in introduction of plants. His interest in botany, floriculture and horticulture largely helped in his pursuit. Initially established with {{the main purpose of}} growing different fruits like <b>pineapple,</b> <b>guava,</b> varieties of oranges and lychee for the British Political officer and the Palace, the garden developed into a main center for introduction of fruits. The practice of growing fruits continued until 1940, after which the Forest Department introduced ipecacuanha from Zohore in Malaysia. This is used in the production of syrup of ipecac, a powerful emetic. Though cultivation of ipecacuanha was discontinued in 1970, the garden is still famous by the name Ipecac Garden.In 1975, the garden was converted into an orchidarium for growing different types of orchids. The majority of plants and trees that can been seen growing in the garden at present were introduced from 1975 till 1980. In 2008 the garden hosted the International Flori Show, an event promoted by the Government of Sikkim to promote the region as a centre of floriculture.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> (Acca sellowiana [O. Berg] Burret) is a {{fruit with}} export and {{production}} potential in Colombia. However, {{there are few}} reports about its composition concerning physiological behavior throughout the different ripening phases. Intending to confront this situation, a study was proposed in order to evaluate the physicochemical properties and the nutritional composition of <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruits in three different phases of ripening, determined by the weeks elapsed after anthesis, considering it undeveloped for week 17 (W 17), ripe for week 20 (W 20) and overripe from week 21 (W 21). <b>Pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruits were preliminarily characterized, they underwent a bromatological analysis and their content of vitamin A and C content was established. The results showed a significant content of crude fiber and total carbohydrates in the three evaluated phases. There was also {{a decrease in the}} neutral detergent fiber of 38 % between W 17 and W 21. The highest level of vitamin C was reported in W 17 (67. 82 mg ascorbic acid/g dry sample), as well as for vitamin A (12. 65 mg β-carotene/g dry sample). In a physical-chemical characterization, the existence of a particular physiological behavior is possible because of the development in size and mass of the fruit after physiological ripening. Additionally, the calcium and reducing carbohydrate content can be associated with the pulp browning phenomenon. Clearly, <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> is a promising fruit thanks to its nutritional properties, according to the current consumption tendencies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The post-harvest {{quality of}} <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruit is {{determined}} by the storage and prevailing weather conditions during growth and development. This study proposes a model for post-harvest fruit quality according to the storage and weather conditions in the <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> growing region. Physiologically ripe fruit were collected during two harvests from two locations within the Department of Cundinamarca (Colombia) : Tenjo and San Francisco de Sales. The fruits were stored at 18 ± 1 °C (76 ± 5 % relative humidity (RH), over 11 days) and at 5 ± 1 °C (87 ± 5 % RH, over 31 days), and the quality attributes were evaluated every two days. Models of the most significant physio-chemical quality characteristics of the post-harvest fruit were developed by using the Excel® Solver tool for all data obtained in the two crop periods. The results showed that storage and prevailing weather conditions, which differed according to the altitude of the growing site, had considerable impacts on the physio-chemical characteristics of the fruit throughout the post-harvest ripening process...|$|E
40|$|Several {{diseases}} {{have affected}} apple production, among them there is Glomerella leaf spot (GLS) caused by Colletotrichum spp. The first report {{of this disease}} in apple was in plants nearby citrus orchards in São Paulo State, Brazil. The origin of this disease is still not clear, and studies based on the molecular phylogeny could relate the organisms evolutionarily and characterize possible mechanisms of divergent evolution. The amplification of 5. 8 S-ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) of rDNA of 51 pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. isolates from apples, <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> and citrus produced one fragment of approximately 600 bases pairs (bp) for all the isolates analyzed. The amplified fragments were cleaved with restriction enzymes, and fragments from 90 to 500 bp were obtained. The sequencing of this region allowed the generation of a phylogenetic tree, regardless of their hosts, and 5 isolated groups were obtained. From the "in silico" comparison, {{it was possible to}} verify a variation from 93 to 100 % of similarity between the sequences studied and the Genbank data base. The causal agent of GLS is nearly related (clustered) to isolates of <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> and to the citrus isolates used as control. 201...|$|E

40|$|Fruit {{growth is}} stimulated by {{different}} weather conditions. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the influence of weather conditions on the physicochemical properties of <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruit growth. Twenty trees were marked in two production areas located at different altitudes (1, 800 and 2, 580 m. a. s. l.), and measurements were performed every 7 days from 99 and 141 days post-anthesis to harvest at altitudes of 1, 800 and 2, 580 m. a. s. l., respectively. The results indicate that altitude and weather conditions greatly influence the growth and development of <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruit, and these effects are primarily manifested in the physical characteristics of the fruit. The weight and size of the fruit at harvest are directly related to the altitude of the production area. The weather condition that has the greatest impact on total titratable acidity at harvest is cumulative radiation during fruit growth; the highest value of total soluble solids at harvest corresponds to the location with the higher altitude, lower rainfall and relative humidity and higher cumulative radiation during the fruit growth period. The hue angle and pulp firmness at harvest are not influenced by the location or weather conditions at any location and do not determine the fruit quality at harvest time...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruit is {{primarily}} stimulated by temperature but is also influenced by other climactic factors, such as altitude. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a growth model for the <b>pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> fruit as a function of thermal time (GDD, growing-degree day) and altitude (H) of the production area. Twenty trees per farm were marked in two sites in the Cundinamarca department (Colombia) during the 2012 and 2014 seasons. The measurements were performed every seven days after day 96 and 99 post-anthesis until harvest in the sites of Tenjo (2, 580 m. a. s. l.) and San Francisco de Sales (1, 800 m. a. s. l.), respectively. A growth model was produced for weight as a function of fruit length and diameter as well as for the weight of the fruit as a function of GDD and H, with this last measure adjusted to a sigmoidal logistic growth model. The parameters for the regression analysis showed that the models satisfactorily predicted fruit growth for both of the sites, with a high determination coefficient. The cross-validation showed good statistical fit between the predicted and observed models; the intercept was not significantly different than zero, and the slope was statistically equal to one...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pineapple</b> <b>guava</b> (Acca sellowiana) is {{a native}} species from south Brazil and {{northeast}} Uruguay, and due to the unique flavor of its fruits, it is an income-generating alternative to small farmers.
