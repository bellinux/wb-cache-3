25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} and unique part of the improvement of the soil fertility is carbonized biomass (<b>pyrogenic</b> carbon), thought to have been gradually incorporated 4 to 10 thousand years ago. Biochar is capable of decreasing soil acidity and if soaked in nutrient rich liquid can slowly release nutrients, and provide habitat for microbes in soil due to its high porosity surface area.|$|E
25|$|The {{transformation}} of biomass into charcoal produces {{a series of}} charcoal derivatives known as <b>pyrogenic</b> or black carbon, the composition of which varies from lightly charred organic matter, to soot particles rich in graphite formed by recomposition of free radicals. Here, all types of carbonized materials are called charcoal. By convention, charcoal {{is considered to be}} any natural organic matter transformed thermally or by a dehydration reaction with an Oxygen/Carbon (O/C) ratio less than 60 smaller values have been suggested. Because of possible interactions with minerals and organic matter from the soil, {{it is almost impossible to}} identify charcoal with any certainty by determining only the proportion of O/C. The Hydrogen/Carbon percentage or molecular markers such as benzenepolycarboxylic acid, are therefore used as a second level of identification.|$|E
2500|$|Fumed silica {{also known}} as <b>pyrogenic</b> silica is a very fine {{particulate}} or colloidal form of silicon dioxide. [...] It is prepared by burning SiCl4 in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a [...] "smoke" [...] of SiO2.|$|E
50|$|SpeB {{is known}} as streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> {{exotoxin}} B, streptopain and streptococcal cysteine proteinase {{as a result of}} its original misidentification as two separate toxins, and is neither an exotoxin nor <b>pyrogenic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pyrogenic,</b> in streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxin, means [...] "causes fever." [...] Erythrogenic {{refers to}} the typical red rash of scarlet fever. In older literature, these toxins are also {{referred}} to as scarlatina toxins or scarlet fever toxins due to their role as the causative agents of the disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{secretion}} of <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxins by the infecting Streptococcus bacteria. Streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxin A (speA) {{is probably the best}} studied of these toxins. It is carried by the bacteriophage T12 which integrates into the streptococcal genome from where the toxin is transcribed. The phage itself integrates into a serine tRNA gene on the chromosome.|$|E
50|$|SpeB was {{identified}} in 1919 as an ectoenzyme secreted by certain strains of streptococci. It was originally studied as two separate toxins, streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxin B and streptococcal cysteine proteinase, {{until it was}} shown that both proteins were encoded by the speB gene and that the attributed <b>pyrogenic</b> activities were due to contamination by SpeA and SpeC.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{infectious}} thyroiditis (AIT) {{also known}} as suppurative thyroiditis, microbial inflammatory thyroiditis, <b>pyrogenic</b> thyroiditis and bacterial thyroiditis.|$|E
50|$|Crude oil is {{composed}} of more than 17,000 compounds. Among these 17,000 compounds are PAHs, which are considered the most toxic components of oil. PAHs are formed by <b>pyrogenic</b> and petrogenic processes. Petrogenic PAHs are formed by the elevated pressure of organic material. In contrast, <b>pyrogenic</b> PAHs are formed through the incomplete combustion of organic material. Crude oil naturally contains petrogenic PAHs and these PAH levels are increased significantly through the burning of oil which creates <b>pyrogenic</b> PAHs. The level of PAHs found in crude oil differs {{with the type of}} crude oil. For example, crude oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill had PAH concentrations of 1.47%, while PAH concentrations from the North Sea have much lower PAH concentrations of 0.83%.|$|E
5000|$|Streptococcus pyogenes, {{produce a}} <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxin, {{obtained}} by lysogenic conversion, which causes fever and a scarlet-red rash, Scarlet Fever.|$|E
5000|$|Sulfozinum (sulfozin) is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug that causes a <b>pyrogenic</b> reaction (body temperature elevation) [...] and severe pain. Sulfozinum is a 0.37 - 2% sterilized solution of purified elemental sulfur in peach oil or {{olive oil for}} intramuscular injections. The preparation is unstable so it was prepared only in local hospital pharmacies. In the Soviet Union, it {{was used in the}} <b>pyrogenic</b> treatment of syphilitic encephalitis (mostly in pre-antibiotics era), various psychiatric conditions, and alcoholism. Sulfozin was not used in American psychiatry.|$|E
50|$|IFN-α {{acts as a}} <b>pyrogenic</b> factor by {{altering}} the activity of thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus thus causing fever. It does this by binding to opioid receptors and eliciting the release of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2).|$|E
50|$|Erythrogenic toxins, also {{referred}} to as streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxins, are secreted by strains of the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. SpeA and SpeC are superantigens, which induce inflammation by nonspecifically activating T cells and stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. SpeB, the most abundant streptococcal extracellular protein, is a cysteine protease. <b>Pyrogenic</b> exotoxins are implicated as the causative agent of scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. There is no consensus on the exact number of <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxins. Serotypes A-C are the most extensively studied and recognized by all sources, but others note up to thirteen distinct types, categorizing SpeF-M as additional superantigens.Erythrogenic toxins are known to damage the plasma membranes of blood capillaries under the skin and produce a red skin rash (characteristic of scarlet fever). Past studies have shown that multiple variants of erythrogenic toxins may be produced, depending on the strain of S. pyogenes in question. Some strains may not produce a detectable toxin at all. Bacteriophage T12 infection of Streptococcus pyogenes enables the production of Spe A, and increases virulence.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} confused with fumed silica (also known as <b>pyrogenic</b> silica, CAS number 112945-52-5). However, the production process, particle characteristics and fields of application of fumed silica are all {{different from those}} of silica fume.|$|E
50|$|Pigments can be {{classified}} as either natural or synthetic. Natural pigments include various clays, calcium carbonate, mica, silicas, and talcs. Synthetics would include engineered molecules, calcined clays, blanc fixe, precipitated calcium carbonate, and synthetic <b>pyrogenic</b> silicas.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] {{is defined}} as any {{substance}} that can cause a fever. Bacterial pyrogens include endotoxins and exotoxins, although many pyrogens are endogenous to the host. Endotoxins include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules found {{as part of the}} cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, and are released upon bacterial cell lysis. Endotoxins may become <b>pyrogenic</b> when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Although the colon contains Gram-negative bacteria in abundance, they do not cause a <b>pyrogenic</b> effect as the bacteria are not undergoing gross lysis, and the immune system is not exposed to free endotoxin while the colonic wall is intact.|$|E
50|$|This {{disease is}} {{most common in}} {{children}} ages 5-15; males and females are equally affected. By the age of 10 years, 80% of children have acquired protective antibodies against streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxins, preventing development of scarlet fever.|$|E
5000|$|Fumed silica {{also known}} as <b>pyrogenic</b> silica is a very fine {{particulate}} or colloidal form of silicon dioxide. It is prepared by burning SiCl4 in an oxygen-rich hydrogen flame to produce a [...] "smoke" [...] of SiO2.|$|E
50|$|Crude oil {{contamination}} in marine ecosystems {{can lead to}} both <b>pyrogenic</b> and petrogenic PAHs entering these ecosystems. Petrogenic PAHs can enter waterways through oil seeps, major oil spills, creosote and fuel oil runoff from urban areas. <b>Pyrogenic</b> PAH sources consist of diesel soot tire rubber and coal dust. Although there are natural sources of PAHs such as volcanic activity and seepage of coal deposits, anthropogenic sources pose the most significant input of PAHs into the environment. These anthroprogenic sources include residential heating, asphalt production, coal gasification, and petroleum usage. Petrogenic PAH contamination is more common from crude oil spills such as Exxon Valdez, or oil seeps; however, with runoff <b>pyrogenic</b> PAHs can also be prevalent. Although major oil spills such as Exxon Valdez can introduce {{a large amount of}} crude oil to a localized area in a short time span, daily runoff comprises most of the oil pollution to marine ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition can also be a source of PAHs into marine ecosystems. The deposition of PAHs from the atmosphere into a water body is largely influenced by the gas-particle partitioning of the PAH.|$|E
50|$|H. ducreyi is an {{opportunistic}} microorganism that infects {{its host}} {{by way of}} breaks in the skin or epidermis. Inflammation then takes place as the area of infection is inundated with lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. This <b>pyrogenic</b> inflammation causes regional lymphadenitis in the sexually transmitted bacillus chancroid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyrogenic</b> {{flowering}} is the fire-stimulated {{flowering of}} plants in heathland and other fire-prone habitats. It {{is associated with}} species which have transient seed banks, as opposed to canopy or persistent soil seed banks. These species are mostly monocots, {{but it is also}} observed in several species of woody dicots.|$|E
50|$|Volcanic ash has a {{significant}} role in supplying the world’s oceans with iron. Volcanic ash is composed of glass shards, <b>pyrogenic</b> minerals, lithic particles and other forms of ash that release nutrients at different rates depending on structure and the type of reaction caused by contact with water.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the same}} period Westermark used {{localized}} hyperthermia to produce tumor regression in patients. [...] Encouraging results were also reported by Warren when he treated patients with advanced cancer of various types {{with a combination of}} heat, induced with <b>pyrogenic</b> substance, and x-ray therapy. Out of 32 patients, 29 improved for 1 to 6 months.|$|E
50|$|Species grow {{as either}} large shrubs or small trees with spirally {{arranged}} leaves with either entire or serrated margins. They prefer sandy loam soils {{and are a}} <b>pyrogenic</b> flowering species, meaning that they rely on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage of}} favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire.|$|E
50|$|Biochar is {{charcoal}} {{created by}} pyrolysis of biomass waste. The resulting material {{is added to}} a landfill or used as a soil improver to create terra preta. Addition of <b>pyrogenic</b> organic carbon (biochar) is a novel strategy to increase the soil-C stock for the long-term and to mitigate global-warming by offsetting the atmospheric C (up to 9.5 Pg C annually).|$|E
50|$|More {{recent work}} {{has been focused on}} {{identifying}} <b>pyrogenic</b> carbon in soil with an emphasis on biochar soil application and studying the impact of biochar on soil properties. He also founded and led the USDA-ARS Biochar and Pyrolysis Initiative from 2008 - 2010 and has made continued contributions in the characterization of biochar and understanding its role in soil environments.|$|E
50|$|Fumed silica (CAS number 112945-52-5), {{also known}} as <b>pyrogenic</b> silica because it is {{produced}} in a flame, consists of microscopic droplets of amorphous silica fused into branched, chainlike, three-dimensional secondary particles which then agglomerate into tertiary particles. The resulting powder has an extremely low bulk density and high surface area. Its three-dimensional structure results in viscosity-increasing, thixotropic behavior when used as a thickener or reinforcing filler.|$|E
50|$|Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal <b>pyrogenic</b> exotoxins {{constitute}} {{a family of}} biologically and structurally related toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. These toxins share the ability to bind to the major histocompatibility complex proteins of their hosts. A more distant relative of the family is the S. aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin, which shares only {{a low level of}} sequence similarity with this group.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{methods are}} often used to ensure that glass and other lab {{equipment}} are free of <b>pyrogenic</b> material. Heat is applied by baking in a dry heat oven that is designed specifically for the depyrogenation process. Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250°C for 30 min) results in a 3-log reduction of endotoxin levels. Due to the high temperature levels, this method is also not suitable when purifying proteins.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{carbohydrates}} such as mannitol, laminarin, and alginate can {{be extracted}} from laminaria. Mannitol {{is used to}} decrease high pressure in the eyes, and to lower excessive intracranial pressure. Laminarin has two forms, soluble and unsoluble. The soluble form of Laminarin has high antitumor activity, {{can be used in}} the treatment of antibiotic-resistant nosocomal infections, can aid in normalizing enteric metabolisms, helps to improve engymatic processes of the intestine and does not possess antigenic or <b>pyrogenic</b> properties. Laminarin continues to be of active study in today’s medical field.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, it {{was widely}} {{believed}} that microbes produced substances that could injure the mammalian host and that soluble toxins released during infection caused the fever and shock that were commonplace during severe infections. Pfeiffer coined the term endotoxin {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to denote the <b>pyrogenic</b> principle associated with Vibrio cholerae. It was soon realised that endotoxins were expressed by most and perhaps all gram-negative bacteria. The lipopolysaccharide character of enteric endotoxins was elucidated in 1944 by Shear. The molecular character of this material was determined by Luderitz et al. in 1973.|$|E
50|$|TSST-1 is {{a protein}} encoded by the tstH gene, {{which is part}} of the mobile genetic element staphylococcal {{pathogenicity}} island 1. The toxin is produced in the greatest volumes during the post-exponential phase of growth, which is similar among <b>pyrogenic</b> toxin superantigens, also known as PTSAgs. Oxygen is required in order to produce TSST-1, in addition to the presence of animal protein, low levels of glucose, and temperatures between 37-40°C (98.6-104°F). Production is optimal at pH's close to neutral and when magnesium levels are low, and is further amplified by high concentrations of S. aureus, which indicates its importance in establishing infection.|$|E
50|$|Friends {{arranged}} a fake appendectomy in a Copenhagen hospital {{to protect him}} from being arrested by the Gestapo. His stay in hospital was even prolonged with <b>pyrogenic</b> drugs. On the night of April 10/11, 1945, he tried to escape to Sweden by boat, but in vain. The boat was captured either by water police or by the marine coast-guard. Pfeiffer and his comrades were taken to Gestapo-HQ (Dagmar House) and subsequently transferred to Vestre Prison. On April 17, 1945, he was found strangled in his cell. Pfeiffer is buried in Copenhagen’s Vestre Kirkegaard (E / 1 / 3071 1314). His grave is looked after by the German War Graves Commission.|$|E
50|$|The Western Australian {{environment}} was {{a creation of}} the indigenous Noongar, Yamatji, Wangai, Ngaanyatjarra and Kimberley cultures. In particular, firestick farming which through mosaic burning returned important nutrients to the soil, encouraged plant germination of indigenous <b>pyrogenic</b> species, and through accelerating plant growth increased the carrying capacity of the natural environment for indigenous fauna, reshaped the whole of Western Australia over the last 70,000 years. Many of the sites later to develop as European settlements had been Aboriginal meeting-grounds or campsites for a long time. Major roads too were located on Aboriginal trade routes and major hunting trails. These were used by Aboriginal guides and black-trackers who led European explorers to the most important local water supplies.|$|E

50|$|A newly {{coined term}} is ‘synthetic terra preta’. A {{fertilizer}} consisting of materials thought {{to replicate the}} original materials, including crushed clay, blood and bone meal, manure and biochar is of particulate nature and capable of moving down the soil profile and improving soil fertility and carbon in the current soil peds and aggregates over a viable time frame.This mixture provides multiple soil improvements reaching at least the quality of terra mulata. Blood, bone meal and chicken manure are useful for short term organic manure addition.Perhaps {{the most important and}} unique part of the improvement of the soil fertility is carbonized biomass (<b>pyrogenic</b> carbon), thought to have been gradually incorporated 4 to 10 thousand years ago.
