These valves were eminently suggestive of hooded flowers. Hence they changed to a whorl of salvias (2). Each blossom now gyrated rapidly in a vertical plane. Concentrating observation on one rotating flower, it became a 'rotating haze,' as the rapid motion rendered the flower totally indistinct. The 'haze' now shaped itself into a circle of moss with a deep funnel-like cavity. This was suggestive of a bird's nest. It became lined with hair, but the nest was a deep, pointed cavity. A nest was suggestive of eggs. Hence a series appeared (4); the two rows meeting in one at the apex appears to have arisen from the perspective view of the nest. The eggs all disappeared but one (5), which increased in size; the bright point of light now shone with great intensity like a star; then it gradually grew dimmer and dimmer till it disappeared into the usual hazy obscurity into which all [my] visual objects ultimately vanish." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{extraction}} of opium takes {{place during the}} months of February and March. Farmers still use the traditional method where they lance each <b>poppy</b> <b>capsule</b> manually with a special blade like tool, {{a process known as}} lancing. The lancing is done in late afternoon or evenings. The opium latex which oozes out and congeals in the night is scraped and collected manually the next morning. Each <b>poppy</b> <b>capsule</b> is given three to four lancings. All such opium collected is required to be necessarily tendered to the government, at specially set up opium collection centres, in early April. Opium is checked for quality and consistency and weighed at the centres. Prices are paid which are fixed by the Government in slab rates, depending on {{the quality and quantity of}} opium tendered. 90% of payment is made to the cultivators, directly in their bank account through e-payment method. Final payment is made after laboratory testing at opium factory after confirming that no adulterants have been found.

50|$|Poppy straw (also mowed opium straw, crushed <b>poppy</b> <b>capsule,</b> poppy chaff, poppy husk) {{is derived}} from opium poppies (Papaver somniferum) that is {{harvested}} when fully mature and dried by mechanical means, minus the ripe poppy seeds. Opium poppy straw today {{can be one of}} several different things. It is what remains after the poppy seed harvest, that is, the dried stalks, stem and leaves of poppies grown for their seeds. The dried leaves and stalk harvested after the seed pod have been used for traditional opium extraction. The field dried leaves, stalk and seed pod are used in commercial manufacture of morphine or other poppy alkaloid derived drugs, by first processing the material to make poppy straw separating the seeds then making concentrate of poppy straw, where no extraction using traditional methods of latex extraction has been made. The straw was originally considered an agricultural by-product of the mechanised poppy seed harvest, which was primarily grown for its edible and oil-producing seed. This changed in 1927 when János Kabay developed a chemical process to extract morphine from the crushed capsule. Concentrated poppy straw consisting mainly of the crushed capsule without the seeds soon became a valuable source of morphine. Today, concentrate of poppy straw is a major source of many opiates and other alkaloids It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use) and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate poppy plant height and capsule volume with remote sensing using an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). Data were obtained from field measurements and UAS flights over two poppy crops at Cambridge and Cressy in Tasmania. Imagery acquired from the UAS was used to produce dense point clouds using structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view stereopsis (MVS) techniques. Dense point clouds were used to generate a digital surface model (DSM) and orthophoto mosaic. An RGB index was derived from the orthophoto to extract the bare ground spaces. This bare ground space mask was used to filter the points on the ground, and a digital terrain model (DTM) was interpolated from these points. Plant height values were estimated by subtracting the DSM and DTM to generate a Crop Height Model (CHM). UAS-derived plant height (PH) and field measured PH in Cambridge were strongly correlated with R 2 values ranging from 0. 93 to 0. 97 for Transect 1 and Transect 2, respectively, while at Cressy results from a single flight provided R 2 of 0. 97. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered an important step towards crop surface model (CSM) generation from a single UAS flight in situations where a bare ground DTM is unavailable. High correlations were found between UAS-derived PH and <b>poppy</b> <b>capsule</b> volume (CV) at capsule formation stage (R 2 0. 74), with relative error of 19. 62 %. Results illustrate that plant height can be reliably estimated for poppy crops based on a single UAS flight and can be used to predict opium capsule volume at capsule formation stage...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of archaeological artefacts is a well-established method for obtaining {{information on the}} artefacts and their use. In this thesis, the development and application of novel mass spectrometric methods to archaeological problems is presented. Lipids, being the remains of foods cooked and stored in vessels, {{are one of the}} most common classes of molecule analysed, because unglazed vessels can preserve traces of lipids for thousands of years. Analysis is typically carried out by solvent extraction of the lipids followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, this is time-consuming. For large ceramic assemblages, of which generally only a small proportion of extracts contain detectable levels of analytes, a medium-throughput screening technique to identify extracts for further analysis would be a great advantage. In addition, GC-based methods are not ideal for large heat-labile molecules such as intact triacylglycerides (TAGs). These molecules are the undegraded remains of the originally deposited fats and their detection is important because TAG distributions can be used to help identify animal species, and to differentiate between dairy and adipose fats. The first part of this thesis presents the development of a method for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) -MS for archaeological lipid extracts, and its application to samples from two archaeological sites. The aim of this work was to develop a method that was better able to detect TAGs than GC-based methods, and that could be used to analyse many samples in a relatively short time. The second part of this thesis presents the detection of opium alkaloids in a Cypriot base-ring juglet from the Late Bronze Age. Although these vessels have long been associated with opium due to their shape, which resembles an inverted <b>poppy</b> <b>capsule,</b> the work presented here is the first robust chemical demonstration of a link between these vessels and their purported use...|$|E

Morphine content was correlated with capsule mass and total latex mass, but there was no correlation between latex capacity and morphine yield. The most important morphological characteristic in terms of morphine end yield (commercial harvest stage) was capsule mass. The findings of this study demonstrate that although latex yield per plant is a highly heritable morphological characteristic, it may have limited potential for use in a breeding strategy aimed at increasing the morphine yield from capsules...|$|R

40|$|Poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{produces}} sec-ondary metabolites, {{which have}} {{important roles in}} self-defence processes – alkaloids (Szabo et al. 2003). Pothier and Goland (2005) described as major alkaloids contained in poppy morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, narcotine (noscap-ine). <b>Poppy</b> <b>capsules</b> with a high alkaloid content are of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry (Szucs et al. 2002). On the contrary, a mutation-breeding programme using γ-rays and ethyl methane sulphonate was carried out for genetic conversion of narcotic opium poppy into non-narcotic seed poppy (Sharma et al. 1999). Poppy, despite the low Cd concentrations in the soil, reaches the highest Cd concentrations in the seeds (Chizzola 1997). Chizzola et al. (2003), Tlustoš et al. (1997) and Pavlíková et al. (1997) confirmed a high tendency of the poppy to ac-cumulate heavy metals, above all Cd and Pb and also semi-metal arsenic. As Pavlíková et al. (1997) found, spraying of poppy during the growing sea-son by potassium humate resulted in a significant growth of Cd and Zn contents in the plant. The concentration of alkaloids in capsules is affected by many factors. Kadar et al. (2001) reported an increase of alkaloids in capsules {{as the result of}} N fertilisation, while it generally decreased following P fertilisation. Also irregular stress effects change the alkaloid content of poppies. Szabo et al. (2003) observed that drought stress resulted in higher levels of the alkaloids whereas mycotoxin stress did not result in significant differences. As reported by Morimoto et al. (2001), in response to stress, morphine is quickly metabolised to bismorphine consisting of two morphine units.

40|$|Poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is plant {{which is}} in Czech Republic {{cultivated}} and consumed for a long time. Czech Republic was the biggest producer of poppy seeds in the world. It is not true currently but Czech Republic {{is still one of}} the most important producers of poppy. Czech growers produce high quality poppy seeds but they had several problems during last years. For example fluctuation of price of poppy and bad weather condition. Those problems influenced crop. Those complications caused that growers of poppy try to have stable yields for good profit. Yield parameters, such as amount and quality of poppy seeds and volume of alkaloids, are the most important for growers. Amount and quality of poppy seeds are important for food industry and volume of alkaloids for pharmaceutical industry. The parameters are influenced especially by climatic and soil conditions. Growers are not able to influence climatic factors such as intensity and regularity of rainfalls, actual temperature and wind conditions. But they can influence other factors by good agrotechnical interventions. One of the most important parameters for good growth of poppy is volume of elements in soil, especially nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and microelements, boron and zinc. Except that things is very important good soil treatment, suitable technology, right term for sowing and choice of good seeds. For intensive producing of poppy seeds is very important protection against pests, diseases and weed. Like prevention is important good soil treatment and other things such as application of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides and seed dressing by fungicides. This work includes general overview about poppy growing focusing on influence of mineral fertilizers on yields of different variety of poppy.
