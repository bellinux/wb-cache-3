In the United States about 500,000 deaths per year are attributed to smoking-related diseases and a recent study estimated that as much as 1/3 of China's male population will have significantly shortened life-spans due to smoking. Male and female smokers lose an average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively. At least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female current smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman.

Lianas are characteristic of tropical moist deciduous forests (especially seasonal forests), but may be found in temperate rainforests. There are also temperate lianas, for example the members of the Clematis or Vitis (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing arboreal animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds.

Finite kinematics material models with anisotropic features for both bulk and cohesive surfaces are employed to describe the behavior of single-crystal silicon plates undergoing a particular bending test up to failure.

It is the fourth {{in a set of}} reports that present life table data for the United States and each state for the period 1999 – 2001. Methods—The life table functions presented in this report represent the mortality experience of a hypothetical cohort assuming that a particular cause of death is eliminated. The report includes a description of the methodology used to estimate the life table functions shown in four sets of tables.
