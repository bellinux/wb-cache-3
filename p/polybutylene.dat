But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of <b>polybutylene</b> pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E

40|$|Titanium-based {{catalysts}} for poly(alkylene terephthalate) synthesis {{have been}} known for many years. Up to now, organotitanate compounds are used as catalysts on an industrial scale only for the synthesis of <b>poly(butylenes</b> terephthalate) (PBT), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), and related copolyesters; for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), synthesis antimony-based catalysts are preferred. In fact, in this case, titanium is known to cause undesirable discoloration. In this article, a study of PET synthesis using different concentrations of a new titanium dioxide based catalyst (C- 94), commercially available from Acordis Industrial Fibers GmbH, is carried out and compared with the results obtained with titanium tetrabutoxide (TBT) catalyst in the same experimental conditions. The solid-state properties and composition of C- 94 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectroscopy and by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

40|$|Abstract. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), {{produced}} from renewable resources, {{is one of}} the most widely used biodegradable polymers. PLA has high strength and high modulus. However, its brittleness and high cost limit its application. Starch has been used as filler for environmental friendly polymers due to its low cost, biodegradable, and availability as a renewable source. Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is a biodegradable material based on starch. Incorporation of TPS into PLA matrix can reduce material cost and increases its biodegradation rate. However, PLA and TPS form immiscible blend leading to poor mechanical properties of the blend. The compatibility of the blend can be improved by adding compatibilizers. Moreover, in order to improve toughness of the TPS/PLA blend, <b>poly(butylenes</b> adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), is introduced into the blend. In this study, PLA/TPS blends are prepared using an internal mixer and test specimens are molded using a compression molding. TPS is obtained from cassava starch and glycerol at ratio of 70 / 30 wt%. The ratio of TPS/PLA blend is 10 / 90 wt%. Poly(lactic acid) grafted maleic anhydride (PLA-g-MA) is used as a compatibilizer at contents of 3, 5, and 7 phr. PBAT content is 10 wt%.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare PBSU and poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds prepared by electrospinning technique as vascular tissue engineering materials. Both scaffolds were characterized by fiber morphology, pore structure and mechanical properties. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) were seeded on the electrospun PBSU and PLGA scaffolds and cultured for different time periods. Cell adhesion and proliferation on the scaffolds were measured by MTT assay, while SEM was used for observing cell morphology on the scaffolds. The results showed that fiber diameter of the electrospun scaffolds ranged from 300 nm to 800 nm and their porosities were higher than 90 %. The electrospun PBSU scaffolds showed a high tensile strength of 2. 06 ± 0. 11 MPa, whereas the ultimate tensile strength of the electrospun PLGA scaffolds reached 14. 31 ± 5. 24 MPa. Cell adhesion efficacy had no significant difference between PBSU and PLGA scaffolds, but cell proliferation rate on PLGA scaffolds was significantly higher than that on PBSU scaffolds after 7 days of culture.

30|$|Therefore {{researchers}} have been searching for new, alternative materials {{which can be used}} as good substitutes for conventional plastics (Emadian et al. 2016). One of them is production of biobased and biodegradable plastics [BP]. Nowadays, bioplastics constitute about one per cent of the about 300 million tons of plastic produced annually. Production of bioplastics in 2014 reached approximately 2 million tons globally; moreover, it is predicted that in 2019 production will reach almost 8 million tons (Bioplastics 2015). Generally, BP can be divided in two groups, renewable resource-based polymers and petroleum-based polymers (Penkhrue et al. 2015). The first group is derived from renewable resources (Guo et al. 2012) such a biomass of organic waste material or crops (Kershaw 2015), it can be produced by microorganisms or obtained from genetically modified plants (Shah et al. 2008). Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) are renewable source-based polymers. Polycaprolactone (PCL), and <b>poly(butylenes</b> succinate) (PBS) are petroleum based. Despite this fact, they can be degraded by microorganisms s in the natural environment (Koitabashi et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; Penkhrue et al. 2015). In this process, known as biodegradation, compounds commonly occurring in the natural environment (Bhardwaj et al. 2012), such as CO 2, H 2 O, NH 4, N 2, H 2 and biomass are produced. Therefore bioplastics do not negatively affect the natural environment. Biodegradation is the partial or complete hydrolysis of a polymer by microbial activity with the positive influence of photodegradation (Kershaw 2015). However, this process can also be time consuming and often high temperature is required. For example, it has be confirmed that high temperature (60  °C) is the best for PLA degradation (Prema et al. 2013; Sukkhum et al. 2009). Moreover 20  months were required to decomposition of PLA in soil (Urayama et al. 2002) in contrast to the compost, where degradation was lasted 45 – 60  days. Other biodegradable plastics are more susceptible to microbial attack in the natural environment than PLA (Tokiwa and Calabia 2006), required time and temperature are lower. On the other hand, it should be search for microorganisms, which are able to decompose biodegradable plastics at temperatures as low as possible. Due to growing pollution of the world, it is necessary to improve the biodegradation process of bioplastic by reduction of the time or by decreasing the temperature required for an efficient process. Moreover, by finding microorganisms which can assimilate many types of bioplastics it is possible to make the biodegradation process more efficient.|$|R

The XRD data demonstrated that the d-spacing of silica in nanocomposites is greater than 4. 4 nm. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis gives an increases of 2. 1 ℃ at 50 wt % loss temperature for silica reinforced PBT. Crystallization kinetics data at non-isothermal crystallization were carried out with t 1 / 2 of PBT/silica nanocomposites decreased from 4. 04 min to 0. 82 〜 1. 13 min at cooling rate of 5 ℃/min and the Avrami index of PBT/silica is between 3. 3 and 4. 03. Isothermal crystallization studies were also carried out with t 1 / 2 of PBT/silica nanocomposites decreased from 1. 2 min to 0. 26 〜 0. 33 min at crystallization temperature of 200 ℃. The Avrami index of PBT/silica nanocomposites is 2. 58 〜 3. 55 while that for PBT is 2. 24. Polarized Optical Microscopy reveals that the addition of silica in PBT increases the density of nucleating site and decreases the size of crystallites grown in PBT matrix.
