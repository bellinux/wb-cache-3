30|$|The problem {{describing}} {{fluid flow}} in the horizontal pipe with influxes through the porous pipe wall accounts for the energy losses caused by friction, acceleration, flow direction change, and gravity. These values depend on fluid flow regimes (Ouyang et al. 1997). The inflow rate is not constant along the pipe and decays with {{the distance from the}} “hill” (beginning of horizontal section) to the “toe” (end of the horizontal pipe) (Ouyang et al. 1997; Anklam 2005; Cho and Shah 2001). This effect is a well-known problem in the petroleum industry, which reduces the productivity of the well (Cho and Shah 2001). Anklam (2005) proved that pressure in the well increases along the <b>pipe</b> <b>moving</b> from the hill to the toe region, and the influx flow rate decreases in the same direction. Ouyang et al. (1997) experimentally explored pressure losses in the perforated pipe at several cases. Frictional losses were the most valuable at high flow rates inside the long well, whereas, accelerational and directional losses were almost negligible.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{way of dealing}} with the problem of acoustical wave propagation in cylindrically layered media with a specific application in water-filled underground pipes. The problem is studied in two stages: First the pipe is considered to be very stiff in relation to the contained fluid and then the stiffness of the pipe and the soil are taken into account. In both cases the solution process can take into account signals of any form, generated in any point inside the pipe. The simplified method provides the basic understanding on wave propagation and noise generation in the pipe in relation to pipe radius and frequency of excitation. Following the simplified analysis, the beam forming method is discussed and applied {{in order to reduce the}} noise in the <b>pipe.</b> <b>Moving</b> on to the complete analysis of the pipe, the stiffness matrix method is used to take into account the properties of the system. The solution time is proven to be much higher in this case, but the results vary from the simplified case in many real value problems. The results of the two methods are compared in more detail and then a decision making process for the choice of method is developed. This decision process is based on the frequency of the excitation, the properties of the materials and the dimensions of the system. by Antonios Kondis. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of controlling a slide flute: a kind of recorder without finger holes but ended by a piston mechanism to modify {{the length of the}} resonator. From a physical point of view, stopped pipes have not been studied so widely as open <b>pipes,</b> and <b>moving</b> boundary conditions introduce interesting mathematical problems. To control dynamical systems, it is important to elaborate a realistic model, so that control laws can be tested efficiently before they are implemented on real size prototypes. This dynamical model has been elaborated in a previous work and the control law has been validated on a first prototype. The feedback term of this control law used on-line measurements on the system: the length of the piston through an encoder and the blowing pressure through a pressure sensor. But the flute moved too slowly. To improve the precision of the control and the velocity of the piston we have developed a new " mechatronic " prototype in our laboratory which is the object of the present paper...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} to investigate the sporadic motion of cubic and rectangular prism particles {{at the threshold of}} hydraulic conveying in a pipe inclined at various angles. The particle spends periods of time at rest at the invert of the <b>pipe</b> before <b>moving</b> variable distances downstream; the process then repeats. It is shown that successive time periods of rest auto-correlate, meaning that the particles exhibit some memory effect with regard to rest times, although there is a distinct random factor that is presumably due to turbulence. Further, it is statistically shown that the memory is real. The curve of memory factor vs. flow rate transposes up the abscissa as pipe inclination and particle density increases and exhibits a maximum in between total particle stasis and saltation. The physical basis for this memory effect is open to debate, but {{may be due to the}} fact that particles can adopt multiple orientations whilst at rest, some of which are more stable then others. The memory factor is shape dependent...|$|R
30|$|Ground {{movement}} {{induced by}} slope instability {{can be classified}} as shallow or deep-seated depending on the geometry and geotechnical conditions of the slope [7]. The interaction between a buried <b>pipe</b> and a <b>moving</b> slope {{is a function of}} the pipe orientation with respect to the slope. When the pipe axis is normal to the direction of soil movement, the pipe is subjected to lateral forces resulting in bending stresses and shear forces in the pipe wall. When the pipe is parallel to the slope, tensile or compressive stresses are induced in the pipe due to the slope movement. This study focuses on estimating the axial load on a pipe subjected to relative axial soil movement.|$|R

Just as Marriot's eyebrows rose if the cane chair was not empty when he strode in, Jimmy held that he had a right to the hearth-rug, on which he loved to lie prone, his back turned to the company and his eyes on his pipe. The stem was a long cherry-wood, but the bowl was meerschaum, and Jimmy, as he smoked, lay on the alert, as it were, to see the meerschaum coloring. So one may strain his eyes with intent eagerness until he can catch the hour-hand of a watch in action. With tobacco in his pocket Jimmy could refill his <b>pipe</b> without <b>moving,</b> but sometimes he crawled along the hearth-rug to let the fire-light play more exquisitely on his meerschaum bowl.

When he saw a match-box he always extracted a few matches and put them dreamily into his pocket. There were times when, with a sharp blow on Jimmy's person, we could doubtless have had him blazing like a chandelier.|$|R

30|$|The axial soil {{resistance}} {{calculated using}} the closed-form solution (Eq.  1) is plotted in Fig.  5. It {{is clear that}} Eq. (1) significantly underestimates the pullout force. This difference is attributed {{to the increase in}} normal stresses acting on the pipe during the loading process, which is not accounted for in Eq. (1). The increase in normal stresses is generally explained by the dilatant behavior of the dense sand mobilized by the relative displacement between the sand material and the <b>moving</b> <b>pipe</b> [24]. Since K 0 parameter in Eq. (1) controls the average normal stresses on the pipe, a parametric study is performed using DEM to investigate the effect of different soil and pipe parameters on the pullout resistance and to propose a suitable expression for K 0 (K* hereafter). The value of the modified earth pressure coefficient K* is bounded by K 0 and KP (the passive earth pressure coefficient).|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of dilute micro-size inertial particles in turbulent curved pipe flows of different curvature by means of direct numerical simulations with one-way coupled Lagrangian particle tracking. The focus of this work is on {{the first and second}} order moments of the velocity and acceleration of the particulate phase, relevant statistics for any modelling effort, whereas the particle distribution is analysed in a previous companion paper. The aim is to understand the role of the cross-stream secondary motions (Dean vor-tices) on the particle dynamics. We identify the mean Dean vortices associated to the motion of the particles and show that these are moved towards the side-walls and, interestingly, more intense than those of the mean flow. Analysis of the streamwise particle flux reveals a substantial increase due to the secondary motions that brings particles towards the <b>pipe</b> core while <b>moving</b> them towards the outer bend. The in-plane particle flux, most intense in the flow viscous sub-layer along the side walls, increases with particle inertia and pipe cur-vature. The particle reflections at the outer bend, previously observed also in other strongly curved configurations, locally alter the particle axial and wall-normal velocity and increase turbulent kinetic energy...|$|R

40|$|As advance {{rates of}} TBM bored tunnels increase, it is {{essential}} that all aspects of the control of the machine and the tunnel support are able to operate at the desired rate. This paper describes the innovative ways that the basic guidance system has been adapted to cater for the TBM’s that are currently in use used on the Gotthard tunnel where the traditional line of sight throughout the backup gear is continuously obstructed due to the use of a sprayed concrete support facility to the use. The guidance system utilizes features from the well proven system for distance and curved pipejacking applications where the main reference is attached to the <b>moving</b> <b>pipe</b> (tunnel lining). Accurate steering of the tunnelling machine is essential if the segmental lining is to be efficiently installed. The use of ring sequencing software for the determination of the ring type and rotation, significantly aids the rapid placement of the most appropriate ring, which in turn can be monitored for any immediate convergence with the innovative chained inclinometer convergence measurement system. All of this information together with the surface mapping, geotechnical, and surface monitoring data bases can be fully integrated with the monitoring of the machines operating parameters in the Controlled Boring Process software integration package to give the machine operator a complete graphical display of all that is happening around him, to ensure optimum control and speed of safe advance...|$|R
5000|$|On Monday the 12th {{just before}} 8:00 pm, police {{activity}} increased as they {{closed in on}} a house in West Auckland. Police confirmed {{in a press conference}} on the morning of 13 October that the body found the previous evening in a drainpipe in Henderson was that of two-year-old missing toddler Aisling Symes. Police inspector Gary Davey, head of the Aisling inquiry, says the body was removed from the scene at 1am on 13 October. He said the body of Aisling probably lay in the drain within metres of scores of police and searchers for days after she disappeared. The drain, which was a short distance from the house she disappeared from on Monday last week and was two metres below the ground, had been thoroughly searched by officers with special search techniques. Mr Davey says cameras were used to reach 9-10 metres into the drain, but the search proved fruitless. A decision was then made to dig up part of the drain, a digger was called in and it took five hours until Aisling's body was found inside. When police were first called to the Longburn Rd house on Monday last week a police officer searched the pipe three times, Mr Davey said. The manhole cover was ajar about 10 cm and the first police officer looked down the pipe and {{there was no sign of}} a body. [...] "He called out and did not hear anything other than running water," [...] Mr Davey said. The officer then searched towards the stream and 15 minutes later returned to the manhole, climbed about two metres down the larger access <b>pipe</b> after <b>moving</b> the manhole cover back. He shone his torch down the smaller 375mm drain at the bottom and could see nothing. He also called her name but there was no response. [...] "He believed he could see five metres up into the drain and five metres down the drain." [...] The drain was searched for a third time later in the night by search and rescue searchers, Mr Davey said. During the search Aisling's father Alan Symes also climbed down the pipe and looked for his daughter, said Mr Davey. Mr Davey says it is too early to tell how Aisling got into the drain, but police believe no foul play was involved. [...] "I believe it is more likely or not that she was there from the start and I believe it is misadventure," [...] he says.|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of nanoparticles (below 300 nm in diameter) change rapidly after emission from the tail <b>pipe</b> of a <b>moving</b> vehicle {{due to the}} influence of transformation processes. Information on this time scale is important for modelling of nanoparticle dispersion but is unknown because the sampling frequencies of available instruments are unable to capture these rapid processes. In this study, a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (Cambustion Instruments DMS 500), originally designed to measure particle number distributions (PNDs) and concentrations in engine exhaust emissions, was deployed to measure particles in the 5 – 1000 nm size range at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. This article presents results of two separate studies; one, measurements along the roadside in a Cambridge (UK) street canyon and, two, measurements at a fixed position (20 cm above road level), centrally, {{in the wake of a}} single moving diesel-engined car. The aims of the first measurements were to test the suitability and recommend optimum operating conditions of the DMS 500 for ambient measurements. The aim of the second study was to investigate the time scale over which competing influences of dilution and transformation processes (nucleation, condensation and coagulation) affect the PNDs in the wake of a moving car. Results suggested that the effect of transformation processes was nearly complete within about 1 s after emission due to rapid dilution in the vehicle wake. Furthermore, roadside measurements in a street canyon showed that the time for traffic emissions to reach the roadside in calm wind conditions was about 45 6 s. These observations suggest the hypothesis that the effects of transformation processes are generally complete by the time particles are observed at roadside and the total particle numbers can then be assumed as conserved. A corollary of this hypothesis is that complex transformation processes can be ignored when modelling the behaviour of nanoparticles in street canyons once the very nearexhaust processes are complete...|$|R
