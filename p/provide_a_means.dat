5|$|FLCN {{mutations}} are {{detected by}} sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have mutations that are not detectable by current technology, or that mutations in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of and to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of determining other at-risk individuals in a family {{even if they have}} not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers {{for more than}} half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, and to <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> for {{getting to know the}} main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

25|$|In image processing, {{processed}} {{images of}} faces {{can be seen}} as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel. The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix associated with a large set of normalized pictures of faces are called eigenfaces; {{this is an example of}} principal component analysis. They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them. In the facial recognition branch of biometrics, eigenfaces <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes. Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made.|$|E
25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> <b>means</b> for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
