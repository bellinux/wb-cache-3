500|$|On January 23, 2009, Tom <b>Poleman,</b> {{senior vice}} {{president}} of programming for Clear Channel Radio, announced they planned to play an edited version. Sharon Dastur of Z100 added that Spears had recorded {{a new version of the}} song and the new edit would be provided by Jive Records. David Hinckley of the Daily News commented that [...] "Clear Channel, which laid off 9% of its workforce this week, is hardly in the mood to finance an FCC fight right now". Finally, a radio edit titled [...] "If U See Amy" [...] was released to American radio stations (after some stations briefly eliminated those lyrics of the song entirely), which changes the [...] "seek" [...] to [...] "see". The amended version was released in the UK in May. While the song has not officially been renamed or released in Australia, some radio stations, such as those belonging to the Austereo Radio Network, play the censored version, while others continue to play the uncensored. Both the music video and the international radio single remain [...] "If U Seek Amy".|$|E
2500|$|... "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] {{proved to}} be a {{crossover}} hit, charting across several different radio formats; in addition to peaking at number one on the Alternative Songs chart in June and number three on the Rock Songs chart in July, the song broke into the top 40 of the Hot 100 in late July and appeared on the Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 charts. Columbia senior VP of promotion Lee Leipsner said, [...] "It was one of the only alternative bands I remember in a while that you could actually dance to. And the fact that the record has a groove and rhythmic feel to it—not heavy guitar-based at all—gave us a wide opportunity to cross the record." [...] He credits the song's crossover success and push into the top 40 to a June presentation of new music by Tom <b>Poleman</b> of Clear Channel. According to Leipsner, [...] "After we showed our presentation, we had so many Clear Channel major-market programmers come up to us and say, 'The record I want to play besides Adele is Foster the People.'" [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] peaked at number three on the Hot 100, spending eight consecutive weeks at the position. According to Nielsen Soundscan, over 321,000 copies of Torches have been sold in the US. [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] finished 2011 as the sixth-best-selling digital song of the year, with 3.84 million copies sold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw my <b>poleman</b> give up on the {{business}} suddenly, and stretch himself flat on the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks, little sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the landside. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes--the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to. 'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep quiet!' I said in a fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind. I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?' I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat. The bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke, {{there was no time to}} lose, so I just crowded her into the bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.|$|E

50|$|Karl Heinrich Bergius was Lichtenstein's first emissary, {{sent out}} in 1815.

50|$|Prior to his {{appointment}} to President of National Programming Platforms, he was Senior Vice President of Programming for iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel) where his oversight included the New York market WHTZ, WLTW, WKTU, Q104.3, Power 105.1, and WALK-FM. Tom joined Z100 in 1996 from KRBE Houston. Before that, he was employed at WKCI-FM and WAVZ New Haven and WALK Long Island. <b>Poleman</b> {{started as a}} DJ at Cornell University's commercial, student-owned radio station WVBR-FM in Ithaca and served as its program director during his senior year, prior to graduating in 1986.|$|E
50|$|A {{sluggish}} {{start from}} <b>poleman</b> Sergey Sirotkin saw fellow front-row starter Norman Nato {{take the lead}} into Turn 1. Sirotkin was the quicker driver, but Nato managed to soak up the pressure and hang on to first place. Behind them, Jordan King held position in third, while Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, and Alex Lynn staged a fierce battle for fourth position. However, Evans skipped the Nouvelle chicane and gained an advantage, which earned him a 5-second time penalty. The {{first half of the}} race was a clean and calm affair, but the second half was anything but.|$|E
50|$|Dietrich Pallas {{was born}} in Alsace in about 1768, {{received}} his medical qualifications in Paris, and arrived at the Cape in 1791 as surgeon in Comte de Meuron's Swiss Regiment, later being appointed surgeon-major to the Cape Garrison. Pallas went on to open the first apothecary shop in Cape Town and in 1802 employed Pieter Heinrich <b>Poleman</b> as manager. This led to a partnership in 1810 which lasted until Poleman's death in 1839, whereupon the shop in Strand Street was sold to S. H. Scheuble & Co. Pallas, who had become a dotard in his senility, died in 1840.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} held over 40 laps of the Silverstone National circuit. Gary Brabham took the winner spoils for the Bromley Motorsport team, driving their Reynard-Cosworth 88D.

Second place went to championship leader, Andrew Gilbert-Scott in Eddie Jordan Racing’s Reynard-Cosworth 88D, who was only 0.58secs behind. Brabham’s victory moved him to within four points of Gilbert-Scott points leader, with just two rounds to go. Third was <b>poleman,</b> Roland Ratzenberger who completed the podium for the Spirit Motorsport owned by Geoff Mitchell and Tony Searles this Cosworth engined Reynard 88D.|$|E

5000|$|Soon after {{qualifying}} as apothecary, he {{was recruited}} {{to work in}} South Africa by the firm of Pallas & <b>Poleman</b> of Cape Town. Arriving in May 1817, Krebs started collecting, often {{in the company of}} Karl Heinrich Bergius who died at age 28 of pulmonary tuberculosis in January 1818, poverty-stricken and abandoned by his former sponsors and employers. Krebs also got to know and collected in the company of Mund and Maire, Joachim Brehm, von Chamisso, Delalande, and Dr. William Gill, who became a close friend and medical adviser during their stay in the Eastern Cape.|$|E
50|$|In 1824 Lichtenstein {{warned him}} that his {{contract}} for supplying specimens to the Berlin Museum was about to end {{and that they would}} only accept 3 further consignments. Krebs sailed to Cape Town in November 1824 to discuss his future with <b>Poleman.</b> Krebs had thought of starting a pharmacy somewhere in the Cape, and wrote to his brother inviting him to join in the enterprise. Early in 1825 he returned to Algoa Bay, making his way once more to the Baviaans River, where he stayed again on the Boschfontein farm belonging to Field Cornet Cornelius van der Nest, a farm which was also periodically visited by Clemenz Wehdemann.|$|E
5000|$|A format {{change to}} {{contemporary}} hit radio {{took place in}} the early 1980s, led by then-Program Director Kathy Jassy. The station was branded [...] "FM93" [...] and enjoyed commercial success. This continued under then-Program Director and on-air personality (and current iHeartMedia National Prorramming Platforms President) Tom <b>Poleman,</b> as well his successor, Program Director and on-air personality (and current Sirius XM Radio Host and programmer) Jessica Ettinger, the latter two under the leadership of station general manager (and now Coleman Insights President) Warren Kurtzman. But after key personnel graduated from Cornell in the late 1980s, the new format eventually faded in audience appeal, especially with WVBR's traditional 18-34 core.|$|E
50|$|With {{two-thirds of}} the season complete, Lauda led the {{championship}} as the drivers went to the very fast and scenic Österreichring in Austria. This circuit had been modified {{from the year before}} - a chicane had been put in to replace the ultra fast, flat out Voest-Hugel Kurve. Lauda pleased his home fans further by beating Hunt to pole, with Andretti settling for third on the grid. The race started in damp conditions, and <b>poleman</b> Lauda led into the first corner followed by Hunt, but Andretti passed both at one corner soon after. His teammate Nilsson was on a charge and was rapidly up to second, whereas Lauda went backwards.|$|E
50|$|For the Theodore Racing, Wilson’s victory {{more than}} {{compensated}} for the disappointment for team-mate Geoff Lees caused the race to be stopped on the first lap. An over-zealous start for {{the middle of the}} poor 10-car grid saw the Wolf barge Norman Dickson’s Lotus 78, then spin wildly in the pack; Lees continued but suspension failure stranded {{him in the middle of}} the track.Dickson was the other star of the race. The gritty Scotsman passed the Williams FW07s of <b>poleman</b> Emilio de Villota and Eliseo Salazar on the early stages, fighting off the latter in his defence of second spot after de Villota and Guy Edwards effectively eliminated each other after a touch at Hawthorns.|$|E
