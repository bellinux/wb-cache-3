This has been done through experimental investigations in one AP- 3 C Orion and two C- 130 J- 30 Super Hercules aircraft. It is shown, using propeller signature theory, that synchrophasing has significant effects on the average cabin floor vibration and the average cabin sound pressure levels. In the trial aircraft, these effects range between 4 dB and 12 dB at the blade-pass frequency, depending on the flight condition and the aircraft. The effects at individual sensors locations can, however, sometimes exceed 20 dB. It is also shown {{that the effects of}} altitude and airspeed on the optimum synchrophase angles are significant, and that a fixed set of synchrophase angles cannot be optimal for more than a limited range of flight conditions. For example, over the range of altitudes and airspeeds considered in this investigation, a fixed set of angles is shown to produce results that can vary by {{more than half of the}} range from the lowest to the highest predicted average sound pressure level at the blade-pass frequency. Adaptive control of the synchrophase angles using pre-defined look-up tables or active control algorithms are considered, and the latter recommended for their ability to compensate for unknown and variable influencing factors. Two ranking strategies are developed and employed to identify the number and placement of error sensors for an active control system. Significantly, both strategies identify that the predicted average sound pressure levels at the blade-pass frequency in the trial aircraft could be maintained within 2 dB of the optimum across all considered flight conditions using as few as 3 to 6 well-placed microphones. A single-input (master propeller tachometer) multi-output (slave <b>propeller</b> <b>synchrophase</b> angles) feed-forward active control system with multiple error sensors (microphones or accelerometers) is developed using propeller signature theory and the Filtered-x LMS algorithm. Recommendations for further work are also made. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Mechanical Engineering, 201...|$|E

Noise levels often exceed 100 dB, and typical vibration levels can be hazardous to sensitive cargo. This {{noise and vibration}} {{is dominated by the}} propeller blade-pass frequency and its low-order harmonics. It is generally accepted that <b>propeller</b> <b>synchrophasing</b> is a way of minimising this noise and vibration, however synchrophasing has only achieved limited success in practice. It is thought that the reasons for this are twofold: firstly, the synchrophase angles may be poorly optimised, and secondly, the optimal synchrophase angles may be influenced by flight conditions such as airspeed and altitude. This paper outlines an investigation into these effects for the Royal Australian Air Force AP- 3 C Orion and C- 130 J- 30 Hercules aircraft. Comprehensive flight trials to examine and quantify these effects were conducted in November 2006. The C- 130 J- 30 trial also included different cargo configurations. Twenty one microphones and seven accelerometers were used in the AP- 3 C trial, and thirty three microphones, eighteen floor accelerometers and fifteen cargo accelerometers were used in the C- 130 J- 30 trial. Preliminary results are presented for the AP- 3 C trial. These show that the optimum synchrophase angles do change with altitude and airspeed, and compromises must be made to accommodate these effects.

50|$|As a pilot aid to {{manually}} synchronizing the propellers, some {{twins have}} a small gauge called a synchroscope mounted in or by the tachometer(s) with a propeller symbol on a disk that spins. The pilot manually fine tunes the engine r.p.m. so as to stop disk rotation, thereby synchronizing the propellers. This is a useful backup to synchronizing engine r.p.m. using the audible propeller beat. This gauge is also found installed with most <b>propeller</b> synchronizer and <b>synchrophase</b> systems. Some synchrophase systems use a knob for the pilot to control the phase angle.|$|R
