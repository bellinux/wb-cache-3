5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in <b>photocells.</b> Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, <b>photocells,</b> light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electronic}} {{yarn clearer}} became feasible when a suitable <b>photocell</b> {{was found at}} the Instrumentation, Electronics and Automation Exhibition in Olympia on the Standard Telephones & Cables stand. This germanium <b>photocell</b> was only 3 mm in diameter and some 10 mm long and operated on low voltage. Its cost was about £1.50, which {{made it possible to}} design a yarn clearer capable of manufacture within budget and using the signal from the <b>photocell</b> to operate a yarn cutter whenever a small fault was detected in the yarn passing the <b>photocell.</b> Peter Wilson decided to use a cold cathode trigger tube produced by Ericsson Telephones to operate the cutter using a modified electromagnetic relay.|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of <b>photocells.</b> Various types of <b>photocells</b> were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices. By the mid-1930s, selenium <b>photocells</b> controlled assembly lines, elevators and looms. Fire alarms with selenium sensors came into mass production in the UK {{and then in the}} US. Norbert Wiener proposed, and Truman Gray built an optical scanner for inputting and processing data in analog computers. Kurt Kramer introduced a selenium photocell to medical research. In 1940, Glenn Milliken built the first practical selenium-based oximeter to monitor the physical condition of the Royal Air Force pilots. It was a RO where the light source and detector were separated by the ear lobe of the pilot.|$|E
25|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{discovered}} the photoconductivity of selenium. In the early 1900s, {{the studies of}} the external photoeffect in vacuum tubes resulted in the commercial production of photoresistors. In 1918, American and German engineers independently suggested the use of vacuum <b>photocells</b> for reading optical phonograms in the film projectors in cinemas, and Lee de Forest, Western Electric and General Electric produced three competing systems using such <b>photocells.</b> In 1927, the first commercial sound film, The Jazz Singer, was produced in the United States, and by 1930 sound films had replaced silent films.|$|E

These “smart blinds” automatically adjust {{depending on the}} sunlight levels and orientation. On the roof, sensors with hemi-spherical lens acts as <b>photocells,</b> monitoring the intensity of lights. A wind sensor causes the blinds to retract into their housings when the wind exceeds 40mph. Interior controllers on the ceiling are programmed based on the blinds’ orientation towards the sun, building latitude and an astronomical clock that tracks the seasons.|$|E
25|$|Between 1902 and 1907, Arthur Korn invented {{and built}} the first {{successful}} signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect {{that is part of}} selenium <b>photocells.</b> Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still fax pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification. Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{developed}} {{some of the}} first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He later credited himself as being the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. (It should be noted that his electromechanical devices, some with motors moving <b>photocells</b> past lights, bore little resemblance to the all-electronic sequencers of the late sixties.) He began working on a machine he said composed using artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its vast array of knobs, buttons and patch panels is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|The user {{interface}} {{consists of a}} glass plate covered in non-drying opaque black mastic, which constitutes a drawing surface upon which the user makes marks by scratching through the mastic, and therefore allowing light to pass through at that point. In front of the glass plate sits a vertical bank of twenty <b>photocells</b> that send signals to twenty amplifiers and bandpass filters, {{each with its own}} gain adjust control. It is akin to a ten-octave equalizer with two knobs per octave. The ANS is fully polyphonic and will generate all 720 pitches simultaneously if required (a vertical scratch would accomplish this).|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The process works by using <b>photocells</b> to analyze the color change of a redox (oxidation-reduction) reaction. A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the potassium dichromate, reducing the dichromate ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a photocell, which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E
