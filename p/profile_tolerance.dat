40|$|When {{manufacturing}} blades, {{there is}} a need for tolerancing around nominal blade design. Tolerance design is a balance between turbine performance and cost efficiency; a tolerance band that is too wide will result in a large scatter in turbine characteristics, whereas a too narrow tolerance band leads to high manufacturing costs due to high scrap rates of blades not meeting requirements. Determining an optimal manufacturing tolerance is therefore an issue of great importance. The purpose of this thesis was to study the impact of geometric variability within manufacturing tolerances on turbine performance. This Master’s Thesis was conducted at the Department of Rotors at GKN Aerospace in Trollhättan, Sweden. In this thesis, a rational method has been developed to vary blade profiles of both stator and rotor blades within current manufacturing tolerances at GKN Aerospace. Blade profiles are modified using a sinusoidal profile variation, which allows variation of amplitude Ai, period ni, and phase angle 'i, to model manufacturing variations within <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits. The method has been utilised to study the impact of simulated manufacturing tolerances on turbine performance through CFD simulations. Several design cases were produced by variations of the function used to produce sinusoidal profile variations, and evaluated in the project. It was seen that limiting curves for flow function Q were characterised by stator-rotor configurations for minimum-minimum and maximum-maximum <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance,</b> while limiting curves for efficiency where characterised by stator-rotor configurations for minimum-maximum and maximum-minimum profile tolerances. The impact of subsequent design cases for profile variations within manufacturing tolerances fell within these limiting curves. Certain blade design parameters, such as trailing edge thickness and unguided trailing edge, were identified as key parameters with respect to impact on turbine performance...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{understanding}} of gears operating with a perfluoro type space-qualified grease, seven spur gear experiments were performed. Test conditions {{were selected to}} study the influences of torque, lubricant type, and atmosphere. Two testing torques provided nominal pitch-line Hertz stresses greater and lesser than the contact stress limit as recommended by the grease manufacturer. As was expected, all tests resulted in some gear tooth wear. Discoloration of the perfluoro type grease occurred for all tests. Tests in dry nitrogen produced some dark-grey colored perfluoro type grease. Testing in either ambient or dry air produced red debris after short test duration, and for tests of longer duration large amounts of red debris, red grease, and wear were evident. Tests using higher torques produced more debris. The first indications of discoloration occurred more quickly with higher test torques. Total amounts of wear were quite significant, up to four times the <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> for AGMA Class 10 gears...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTolerances for {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} specified using <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> that controls form or combination of size, form, orientation {{and location of}} a feature(s) relative to a true profile. Freeform surfaces are generally inspected by using fixtures on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The combination of fixtures and the CMM enables the establishment of correspondence between points on the machined and nominal surface for tolerance verification. To respond to the market quickly, it has become inevitable to use 3 D scanners that can scan an object rapidly and provide dense unorganized points as an output without maintaining any correspondence with the nominal CAD model. Current state of art uses the shortest distance criterion to establish correspondence and verify the profile tolerances. This results in acceptance of parts {{that ought to be}} rejected and vice versa. A novel, alternative approach is proposed to overcome this deficiency and verify tolerances specified on a free-form surface. The technique establishes the correct one to one correspondence between the machined surface and CAD model using the Medial axis transform (MAT). The MAT of both the nominal surface and the measured points respectively, are discretised to obtain grids. Corresponding points on the two grids are then used to verify the deviation of the machined surface from the nominal surface. Results of preliminary experiments with simulated data are presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Achieving {{inspection}} automation {{is desirable}} in a production line {{in order to}} reduce labour cost and ensure consistent product quality. This paper presents an automated inspection system for a three-dimensional complex surface according to the specification of surface <b>profile</b> <b>tolerancing.</b> A range scanner is used to measure the surface profile of an object and an algorithm is designed to decide upon the acceptability of the part. The pyramidal generalized Hough transform is used to obtain a rough estimate of the object’s pose in the three-dimensional world. This pose estimate is then refined over a linearized optimization process to achieve an optimal solution from which shape acceptability can be determined {{on the basis of a}} statistical interpretation. Experiments showed that the current inspection system is capable of registering objects having arbitrary deformations and that the system is capable of inspecting objects of complex shape...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Measurement {{technology}} {{plays an}} important role in discrete manufacturing industry. Probe-type coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are normally used to capture the geometry of part features. The measured points are then fit to verify a specified geometry by using the least squares method (LSQ). However, it occasionally overestimates the tolerance zone, which leads to the rejection of some good parts. To overcome this drawback, minimum zone approaches defined by the ANSI Y 14. 5 M- 1994 standard have been extensively pursued for zone fitting in coordinate form literature for such basic features as plane, circle, cylinder and sphere. Meanwhile, complex features such as torus have been left to be dealt-with by the use of <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> definition. This may be impractical when accuracy of the whole profile is desired. Hence, the true deviation model of torus is developed and then formulated as a minimax problem. Next, a relatively new and simple population based evolutionary approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is applied by imitating the social behavior of animals to find the minimum tolerance zone torusity. Simulated data with specified torusity zones are used to validate the deviation model. The torusity results are in close agreement with the actual torusity zones and also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PSO when compared to those of the LSQ...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} precision {{inspection system}} has been developed for manufacturing moulds having CAD defined features. The techniques of precision measurement are implemented for CAD/CAI integration for moulds having sculptured surfaces with some basic features, such as, holes, slots and bosses. Features to be inspected are chosen in the CAD environment, and inspection planning is performed for each feature. The sampling-point strategies are: uniform distribution, curvature dependent distribution, or hybrid distribution of the two depending on {{the complexity of the}} sculptured surface. Line and plane features are divided into subintervals, and the measurement points are distributed at random positions in the subinterval. Prime number subintervals are considered for a circle feature, in order to avoid possible periodic distortion of the measurement features. The measurement path planning is performed considering collision avoidance and coordinate matching between the coordinates. The output of the planning is the machine code for a specific CMM having CNC capability. The machine code is downloaded to a specific CMM, and the measurement results are fed back to the computer. A new algorithm, called MINIMAXSURF, is developed to evaluate the form error precisely for sculptured surfaces. The algorithm considers the radius of the touch probe and evaluates the <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> successfully by removing the unavoidable setup errors. The developed measurement {{system has been}} applied to real moulds, demonstrating high performance and accuracy. close 142...|$|E
40|$|Tolerances on line-profiles {{are used}} to control {{cross-sectional}} shapes of parts, even mildly twisted ones such as those on turbine or compressor blades. Such tolerances limit geometric manufacturing variations to a specified two-dimensional tolerance-zone, i. e. an area, the boundaries to which are curves parallel to the true profile. The single <b>profile</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{may be used to}} control position, orientation, and form of the profile. For purposes of automating the assignment of tolerances during design, a math model, called the Tolerance-Map (T-Map), has been produced for most of the tolerance classes that are used by designers. Each T-Map is a hypothetical point-space that represents the geometric variations of a feature in its tolerance-zone. Of the six tolerance classes defined in the ASME/ANSI/ISO Standards, only one attempt has been made at modeling line-profiles [1], and the method used is a kinematic description, based largely on intuition, of the allowable displacements of the middle-sized profile within its tolerance-zone. The result presented is a 4 -D double pyramid having a 3 -D shape for the common base. Allowable small changes in size represent the fourth dimension in the altitude-direction of the pyramids. However, that work is limited to square, rectangular, and right-triangular profile shapes for which the 3 -D transverse sections (called hypersections) of the 4 -D T-Map are all geometrically similar to the base because the boundaries are doubly traced. For more generally shaped profiles, [2] the hypersections are not geometrically similar to the base. The objective {{of this paper is to}} expand the kinematic description of a profile in its tolerance-zone to include the changing constraints that take place as size is incremented or decremented within the allowable tolerance-range. It provides validation of a different method that is described in a companion paper [3]. 1...|$|E

The level of tap wear is determined by optical images and the wear mechanics are classified by scanning images and energy dispersion spectroscopy analysis. The results highlight that the critical part in measured taps is between the last chamfer and the first cylinder teeth and, consequently, the thread profile is under-sized.

40|$|<b>Profile</b> <b>tolerances</b> {{are used}} to control form or {{combinations}} of size, form, orientation and position of free form features (lines or surfaces) usually described by a CAD 2 D or 3 D model. The procedures reported in the standard ISO/TR 5460 do not {{address the problem of}} identifying and separating the size error contribution in profi le error assessment. This issue has become an industrial need in years because complexity and precision requirements of parts functional surfaces are increasing. In order to improve geometric tolerance verification, ISO 14660 and ISO 17450 Standards have been developed, where the “association” operation is introduced. For standard geometries the association operation “is used to fit ideal feature(s) to non-ideal feature(s) according to specific rules which are called criteria” [1]. The associated feature has the same shape of the nominal model and differs from it in size, orientation and position. Following the diffusion of measuring instruments, as mechanical or optical coordinate measuring machines, and their integration with CAD systems, the geometric characterization of a free form profi le is currently obtained by fi tting algorithms that minimize the distance among the measured points and the virtual model. This method doesn’t allow the separation of size errors from geometric errors in profi le error assessment. However this information could be very useful to adjust the manufacturing process, thus increasing the possibility of manufacturing good parts. As an example, it could be possible to correct size errors resulting from wrong tool’s set-up in cutting operation, or from an overestimation or underestimation of material’s shrinkage in extrusion operations, or to regulate the gap in a mechanical system, by mean of correcting errors due to wear phenomena. In this paper a new method for geometric characterization of free-form profi le that allows the separation of size contributions from form, orientation and position errors is presented. The algorithm consist in an iterative process where at every cycle a resizing (offset) of the nominal model and a repositioning (fitting) of the points measures are calculated. The method has been validated with several simulated test-case and the results confirm both the correctness of the proposed approach and its utility in conformity assessment operations...|$|R
