5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for <b>post-doctoral</b> <b>research.</b> He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E

25|$|Jones was {{rejected}} by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology undergraduate course. He stayed on in Edinburgh to do research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of Cepaea, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from the late Bryan Clarke, one of his teachers at Edinburgh and subsequently professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham. After his PhD, Jones also completed <b>post-doctoral</b> <b>research</b> into the genetics of Drosophila at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones' research has been concerned with snails and the light their study can shed on biodiversity and genetics.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, {{the family}} {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, settling into Stanley's family farm at Nethercote, near Winsford in Exmoor. At Nethercote, Johnson gained his first experiences with fox hunting. Stanley was regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Johnson to be raised largely by his mother and au pairs. As a child, Johnson was quiet and studious, although he suffered from severe deafness, resulting in several operations to insert grommets into his ears. He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in high-brow activities from a young age, with high achievement being greatly valued; Johnson's earliest recorded ambition was to be [...] "world king". Having few or no friends other than their siblings, the children became very close. In late 1969 the family relocated to Maida Vale, North London, where Stanley began <b>post-doctoral</b> <b>research</b> at the London School of Economics. In 1970, Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Johnson was schooled at the Winsford Village School, before returning to London to settle in Primrose Hill, there being educated at Primrose Hill Primary School.
