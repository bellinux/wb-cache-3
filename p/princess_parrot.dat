These include the grey falcon, night parrot, <b>princess</b> <b>parrot,</b> striated grasswren, grey honeyeater, mulgara, black-flanked rock-wallaby, greater bilby, marsupial mole and great desert skink.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>princess</b> <b>parrot</b> {{can make}} loud calls. Their life span {{is thought to}} be as long as 30 years. Under the right {{circumstances}} they are able to bond to more than one member of the family. These birds have a short range of mimicking ability yet, some have the ability to [...] "talk". They are a favourite among many aviculturists and pet owners because of their looks and personality.|$|E

60|$|After {{listening}} attentively to {{the whole}} adventure, the Fairy asked for time to consult her books. After due consideration she informed the Prince that {{the object of his}} search was not far distant, but that it was too difficult for him to attempt to enter the enchanted palace where she was, as the King his father had surrounded it with a thick cloud, and that the only expedient she could think of would be to gain possession of the <b>Princess's</b> <b>parrot.</b> This, she added, did not appear impossible, as it often flew about to some distance in the neighbourhood.|$|R
50|$|The {{colourful}} <b>princess</b> <b>parrot</b> (Polytelis alexandrae) is an Australian bird of {{the parrot}} family. Its name {{was given in}} honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who later married the Prince of Wales Edward VII and eventually became the Queen of England. Other names for the species include: Queen Alexandra parrot (or parakeet), Alexandra's parakeet, Princess of Wales parakeet, rose-throated parakeet, and spinifex parrot. Their plumage is mostly green with a pink throat, bluish crown and rump, and bright green shoulders.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "grass parakeet" [...] (or grasskeet) {{refers to}} {{a large number of}} small Australian parakeets native to grasslands such as the Neophema genus and the <b>princess</b> <b>parrot.</b> The Australian rosellas are also parakeets. Many of the smaller, long-tailed species of lories may be {{referred}} to as [...] "lorikeets". The vernacular name ring-necked parakeet (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian ringneck) {{refers to a}} species of the Psittacula genus native to Africa and Asia that is popular as a pet and has become feral in many cities outside its natural range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>princess</b> <b>parrot</b> is a {{medium-sized}} parrot, 34 to 46 cm long and weighing between 110 and 120 g. The plumage is mostly green {{with a pink}} throat, bluish crown, and bright green shoulders. The rump is blue and the tail is long and narrow. The males have longer tail feathers and brighter coloring than females. The male also has a coral-red beak, while the female's is duller and has a greyish crown. Another {{difference is that the}} male has an orange iris, while the female's is much browner. In addition, the male of the species has a longer, projecting extension {{from the end of the}} 3rd primary (flight) feather on each side. This projection is called a 'spatula' or 'spatule' and appears in mature male birds.|$|E
40|$|Avian adenoviruses infect a {{wide variety}} of avian species and consist of three serologically {{distinct}} groups. 1 Group I avian adenoviruses are widely distributed throughout the world and have been associated with inclusion body hepatitis in chickens, pigeons and other species, bronchitis in quail, {{and a number of other}} conditions in chickens and turkeys, including respiratory disease and growth retardation. 1, 2 There is conflicting evidence regarding the primary pathogenicity of adenovirus in many of these conditions. 1 Group II avian adenoviruses are widely distributed throughout the world and are the primary aetiological agents of haemorrhagic enteritis in turkeys, marble spleen disease in pheasants and splenomegaly in chickens. 3 Group III avian adenoviruses are the cause of egg shell defects in chickens (egg drop syndrome). 1 Infection with adenovirus or adenovirus-like organisms has been reported in a number of psittacine species, 1, 4 - 7 and in Australia adenoviruslike particles have been reported in a cockatiel, peach-faced lovebirds and a <b>princess</b> <b>parrot</b> (R Doneley, personal communication). 1, 8 This report describes necrotising enteritis associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies and adenovirus-like particles in captive lorikeets...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} small-scale biological {{surveys conducted}} by a collaboration of biologists and Traditional Owners designed to build scientific knowledge of the biota in remote desert regions of Western Australia. Importantly, while science driven (including systematic survey methods), the project also incorporated Indigenous Ecological Knowledge (IEK). In doing so, it has assisted with cross-generational transfer and preliminary documentation of IEK in this region. Here, we describe {{a case study of}} surveys conducted with the Pila Nguru (Spinifex People) in the Spinifex Native Title Determined Area of the Great Victoria Desert. A total of 185 native plant species were recorded (representing 37 families and 94 genera). Only one individual of a weed species was recorded. Three plant species are new to science; Grevillea ilkurlka ms. Dicrastylis sp. 2 ̆ 7 Ilkurlka 2 ̆ 7 and Gnephosis sp., with the first two of these species of conservation interest. The survey recorded 148 species of vertebrates; 72 birds, 21 mammals (of which six were introduced), 54 reptiles and one frog. Many animal names used by the Spinifex People were documented. The following animals that are of conservation interest were recorded: Itjarri-itjarri (Southern Marsupial Mole, Notoryctes typhlops), Nganamarra (Malleefowl, Leipoa ocellata), Murrtja (Brush-tailed Mulgara, Dasycercus blythi), and <b>Princess</b> <b>Parrot</b> (Polytelis alexandrae). We concur with previous authors that biological surveys, when cross-cultural, can not only build scientific knowledge, but contribute to broader social goals of assisting Aboriginal people with cross-generational transfer and documenting of IEK...|$|E
