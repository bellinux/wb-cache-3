5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, <b>project</b> <b>leader</b> Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and <b>project</b> <b>leader</b> of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E

30|$|The {{decision}} to analyse reflective practices {{was based on}} a serendipitous experience we had whilst interviewing <b>project</b> <b>leaders,</b> when we realised that some <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> apply a research methodology that is analogous to Schön’s model of the reflective practitioner. The behaviour of <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> greatly resembles the implicit or tacit model first proposed by Schön: whilst <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> consciously solve the problem at hand, they subconsciously or unconsciously seem to apply a variant of Schön’s model. In Schön’s view, tacit or implicit knowledge is embedded in practice, and actual practice must be reflected upon to make this implicit knowledge explicit, so that improvements can be made (Fook 2013). This implies that, although practitioners already ‘know’ about their practice, much of this knowledge tends to be implicit rather than explicit.|$|R

30|$|This {{article has}} made a {{contribution}} to the theory in two ways. In the first place, the behaviour of <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> was made explicit with the reflective practitioner model and by doing so that model itself was made explicit as a rigorous research methodology that some <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> apply in practice. In the second place, a relation was made between the reflective practitioner model and the model of organizational learning which resulted in a model to on the one hand enable to explain what <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> are doing, {{and on the other hand}} to provide a framework for learning and improving effective leadership behaviour through making explicit what often remains implicit.|$|R
30|$|While this reflection-in-action {{shown by}} the <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> took place within the action-present, the experimenting and testing they did were also carried out within the action-present.

Before {{implementing}} their solution, the <b>project</b> <b>leaders</b> reflected on the possible effects of the actions {{they were about to}} undertake, which could be seen as ante-action-reflection. The clearest example of this is the presentations given by Alexander and his team, which formed a pre-evaluation of what might be expected from the new design.

5|$|Development {{began in}} early 2014, and {{prompted}} skepticism from both Square Enix staff and its prospective platform managers, {{who were more}} used to the dominant 2D-based mobile games. One of the problems cited by <b>project</b> <b>leader</b> Naoki Hamaguchi was creating realistic facial expressions equivalent to those used in the 2013 film Frozen. For development, the team used the Unity game engine. The development team built {{a relationship with the}} team at Unity Technologies very early in the development of Unity 5 and this allowed them to have their opinions included in the engine. Despite being dependent on the Unity 5 engine, the team also customised the game editor portion themselves. The team needed to take differences between different phone models into account to allow high performance. To help with development and overcome potential difficulties handling the Unity engine, a special development environment and structure was created. The team used physically based rendering to create realistic lighting and environmental effects. The budget was far lower than graphically equivalent console titles, so the team were reluctant to buy in helping tools and had restrictions on staff numbers: one person was working on all the game's backgrounds, while three were in charge of character designs. Using experience from the development of Final Fantasy XIII, the team were able to create high-end graphics within mobile restrictions.|$|E
