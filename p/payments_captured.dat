ATSPECT offers functionality and security guarantees akin to the purchase request, payment authorization, and <b>payment</b> <b>capture</b> phases of SET, the secure electronic transaction standard created by the major credit card firms. In previous work [10, 12, 8], we have developed a method—called the “authentication test ” method—that {{can be used by}} hand to verify cryptographic protocols. We also pointed out that the same ideas can be used to guide the protocol development process, quickly leading to new protocols; proofs of correctness for these protocols then follow from the development process. In [10, 12] we illustrated the point by “reinventing ” preexisting protocols. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use it to create a completely new protocol with highly non-trivial functionality. We call our new protocol ATSPECT, an Authentication Test-based Secure Protocol for Electronic Commerce Transactions.

The Secure Electronic Transaction protocol [15] was a major effort undertaken by a consortium of credit card companies and banks in the mid- 90 s.

40|$|NetCents is a lightweight, {{flexible}} and secure protocol for electronic commerce over the Internet {{that is designed}} to support purchases ranging in value from a fraction of a penny and up. NetCents differs from previous protocols in several respects: NetCents uses (vendor-independent) floating scrips as signed containers of electronic currency, passed from vendor to vendor. This allows NetCents to incorporate decentralized verification of electronic currency at a vendor's server with offline <b>payment</b> <b>capture.</b> Customer trust is not required within this protocol and a probabilistic verification scheme is used to effectively limit vendor fraud. An online arbiter is implemented that will ensure proper delivery of purchased goods and that can settle most customer/vendor disputes. NetCents can be extended to support fully anonymous payments.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} hidden income arising from home ownership has important consequences for poverty measurement as it tends to favour certain low income groups, especially the elderly, and to have a moderating effect on poverty rates in countries with high levels of home ownership. This article explores both methodological and substantive aspects of this issue using data for 14 EU countries drawn from the European Community Household Panel Survey 1996. Methodologically, in the absence of data needed to estimate hidden income from housing directly, it explores the validity of using a housing expenditures approach to take account of the income effects of housing in a poverty measurement context. Substantively, it examines whether poverty measured in this way in the 14 countries in the data set differs in expected directions from poverty as conventionally measured. The substantive effects are found to be modest overall and to conform only partially to expectations. Certain methodological problems raise a question mark over these findings, such as variation across countries in the degree to which mortgage <b>payments</b> <b>capture</b> the cost of house purchase for home owners.

40|$|People have {{increased}} their usage of mobile devices in many aspects of their daily lives, especially within mobile payments. Mobile payments are expected {{to pave the way}} for an emerging cashless society. Merchants are considered those that create the market for other stakeholders by offering mobile payment instruments and services. Thus, it is of importance to avoid the chicken-and-egg scenario, where merchants are reclusive and cautious to adopt mobile payments unless customers’ demands for it, and vice versa. Although Sweden has shown a decrease of cash payments and is considered as successful regarding mobile usage, there has still been a modest adoption of mobile payments from the merchants. The purpose with this thesis is to get a deeper understanding of Swedish merchants’ perspectives regarding mobile payments in order to identify the key mechanisms for an adoption. The study has approached these issues with a qualitative study and formed a theoretical framework consisting of the topics of installed base, network effects, digital platforms, multi-sided markets, lock-in effects, path dependency, barriers to the adoption of mobile <b>payments</b> and <b>capturing</b> value from mobile payments, to examine 14 Swedish merchants.

Among other data, BEEPS collects also infirmation on different corruption activities at the firm-level and firm ownership. We find somehow surprising results that private firms (domestic and foreign owned) are more involved both into infirmal payments as well as state capture activities. Our results also reveal that foreign owned firms that are involved in infirmal payments are likely to benefit from these corruption practices. On the other side, state owned firms are more likely to experience negative effects of involvements in corruption practices on productivity growth.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we exploit the choice allowed by IFRS {{regarding}} {{the presentation of}} interest payments on the cash flow statement to answer two related questions: First, whether the classification choice is explained by firm reporting incentives and second, whether it is value relevant.

Results also suggest that the incentive to meet or beat analyst CFO forecasts decreases, but strong corporate governance increases the probability of including interest payments in CFOA. Based {{on the assumption that the}} decision not to classify interest <b>payments</b> in CFOA <b>captures</b> lower disclosure quality or poor future expected performance, we posit that these firms should also exhibit lower valuations.

40|$|The authors compare egalitarian {{concepts}} of fairness {{in health care}} payments (requiring that payments be linked to ability to pay) and minimum standards approaches (requiring that payments not exceed a prespecified share of prepayment income or not drive households into poverty). They develop indices for both sets of approaches. The authors compare the"agnostic"approach, which does not prespecify exactly how payments should be linked to ability to pay, with a recently proposed approach that requires payments to be proportional to ability to pay. They link the two approaches using results from the income redistribution literature on taxes and deductions, arguing that ability to pay {{can be thought of}} as prepayment income less deductions deemed necessary to ensure that a household reaches a minimum standard of living or food consumption. The authors show how both approaches can be enriched by distinguishing between vertical equity (or redistribution) and horizontal equity, and show how these can be quantified. They develop indices for"catastrophe"that capture the intensity of catastrophe as well as its incidence and also allow the analyst to capture the degree to which catastrophic payments occur disproportionately among poor households. Their measures of the poverty impact of health care <b>payments</b> also <b>capture</b> both intensity and incidence. To illustrate the arguments and methods, the authors use data on out-of-pocket health spending in Vietnam in 1993 and 1998 -an interesting application, since 80 percent of health spending in that country was out-of-pocket in 1998. They find that out-of-pocket payments had a smaller disequalizing effect on income distribution in 1998 than 1993, whether income is measured as prepayment income or as ability to pay (that is, prepayment income less deductions, regardless of how deductions are defined). The underlying cause of the smaller disequalizing effect of out-of-pocket payments differs depending on whether the benchmark distribution is prepayment income or ability to pay. The authors find that the incidence and intensity of catastrophic payments-in terms of both prepayment income and ability to pay-declined between 1993 and 1998, and that both the incidence and the intensity of catastrophe became less concentrated among the poor. They also find that the incidence and intensity of the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments diminished over the period. Finally, they find that the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments is due primarily to poor people becoming even poorer rather than the nonpoor becoming poor and that in Vietnam in 1998 it was not expenses associated with inpatient care that increased poverty but nonhospital expenditures.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of payment cards has dramatically changed {{the ways we}} shop and merchants sell goods and services. Today, payment cards are indispensable in most advanced economies. Amromin and Chakravorti (2009) find that greater usage of debit cards has resulted in lower demand for small-denomination bank notes and coins {{that are used to}} make change in 13 advanced economies. 1 Recent payment surveys also indicate that consumers are using payment cards instead of checks. Some merchants have started to accept only card payments for safety and convenience reasons. For example, American Airlines began accepting only payment cards for in-flight purchases on all its domestic routes on June 1, 2009. Also, many quick service restaurants and coffee shops now accept <b>payment</b> cards to <b>capture</b> greater sales and increase transaction speed. Wider acceptance and usage of payment cards suggest that a growing number of consumers and merchants prefer payment cards to cash and checks. In addition, payment cards may allow access to credit {{that can be used to}} attract consumers without funds. Debit, credit, and prepaid cards are three forms of payment cards. Debit cards allow consumers to access funds at their banks (defined broadly as depository institutions) to pay merchants; these are sometimes referred to as “pay now ” cards because funds are generally debited from the cardholder’s account within a day or two of a purchase. 2 Credit cards allow consumers to access lines of credit at their banks when making payments and can be thought of as “pay later ” cards because consumers pay the balance at a future date. Prepaid cards can be referred to as “pay before ” cards because they allow users to pay merchants with funds transferred in advance to a prepaid account. 3 Greater usage of cards has increased the value of payment network operators...|$|R
40|$|Forests are {{provider}} of many ecosystem services which benefits a wide group of people. But {{the lack of}} markets to <b>capture</b> <b>payments</b> for these services meant that forest owners chose to convert their assets to provide marketable goods for a smaller group. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes was developed specifically to ensure that forest owners can receive payments in return for providing ecosystem services. One such service provided by forests is flood mitigation and valuing this service has always been challenging {{due to the lack}} of suitable data. This study has the unique opportunity to fill in this knowledge gap by using a 20 -year flood data from Malaysia. The purpose of this study is thus to measure the economic benefits derived from flood mitigation services by increasing forest cover by 10 %. The conceptual approach is the Freeman three-stage framework and the main techniques employed are regression analysis and benefits transfer. In the first stage, it was found that the 10 % increase in forest cover leads to a reduction in number of days flooded by 1. 552 days for every flood in West Coast Malaysia. In the second stage, we found that one lesser day of flood decreases the number of evacuees by about 10. 4 % and number of deaths by about 3. 62 %. These two results are combined to show that a 10 % increase in forest cover reduces the number of evacuees and deaths by 16. 1 % and 5. 61 % respectively. Valuation of these benefits is undertaken in the third stage using benefits transfer where it was calculated that the flood mitigation benefits provided by 10 % increase forest cover is about 3. 5 million ringgit over 20 years on West Coast Malaysia. This figure not only provide a good starting point for implementing a PES scheme but is also useful for conducting a cost-benefit analysis of different flood mitigation policies. However, it should be highlighted that this value is an understatement of the actual benefits as there are many other prominent averted damages not included...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesBackground: Pharmaceuticals are {{responsible}} for a substantial {{percentage of the total}} cost of health care and continue to exceed economic growth and inflation. Generic medicines {{play an important role in}} limiting this expenditure, and consequently there is an international drive to implement pro - generic policies particularly in high income countries. One such policy is generic medicine reference pricing (GRP). Generic reference pricing sets a fixed maximum reimbursement amount for clusters of bio - equivalent drugs without placing any restrictions on the manufacturers' price. Numerous studies have been conducted in high income countries to analyse the impact of generic reference pricing; however, the impact of this reference pricing in low - to - middle income countries (LMIC s) is not well established. Objective: This dissertation aims to address this lack of information in LMICs by providing empirical aggregated claims data on the impact of generic reference pricing on price, expenditure, utilisation and out - of - pocket (OOP) p ayments in a sector of South Africa's private health insurance industry. Methods: This time series intervention study of retrospective claim - level secondary data analyses the impact of one of several generic reference pricing models applied by various private medical insurance companies in South Africa. Criteria applied for the selection of referenced categories and sample claims data intend to maximize the data set as well as the analysis period, while minimizing confounders such as medical insurance member variation and specific managed care policies. The impact of the reference price on variables of drug price, drug expenditure, market share and out - of - pock et payment is measured by analysing changes in the originator, 'authorised generic' ('clone') and generic drugs within each cluster. (An 'authorised generic' (AG) is an exact copy of the originator, approved as a brand - name drug under a patent protection but marketed as a generic.) Results: Two referenced priced categories (Desloratadine and Clopidogrel) and a population of approximately 100, 000 were identified as being eligible for inclusion. An authorised generic was launched for Clopidogrel but not for Desloratadine. The implementation of generic reference pricing appears to have had no or minimal impact on the price of the originator and authorised generic - at the end of the study period the price of the originator drugs of the two categories was 268 % and 86 % higher than the reference and the authorised generic of Clopidogrel was 69 % higher than the reference price. Most often the reference price appeared to be based on the price of a generic drug; however once the reference price was set other generics tended to align at or below the reference price. The implementation of generic reference pricing was associated with an overall increase in dispensed volumes and a decrease in expenditure for both categories; both categories' originator market share declined dramatically by volume (to 23 % and 4 %) and value (to 35 % and 9 %). For Clopidogrel the authorised generic took the majority of market share (63 % by volume and 68 % by value); the generics only gained one third of the market, despite lower product prices and minimal co - <b>payments.</b> Desloratadine generics <b>captured</b> 80 % of the market by the end of the study. For both categories there was no notable change in the total drug expenditure paid out - of - pocket across the study period. The percentage of drugs dispensed that had a co - payment decreased dramatically for Desloratadine, but were only seen to decrease marginally for Clopidogrel. Limitations: Due to the small sample and limited reference categories analysed, the findings from this study are not representative of the South African private healthcare sector and cannot be extrapolated to South Africa. In addition, any savings identified should take the expense of non - referenced alternatives into account...|$|R
40|$|Executive SummarySection 1, Project overview:Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) is a {{research}} hub that was established in 2007 under  the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities Program. Its aim is to provide the science and  other knowledge that governments, communities and industries need for the sustainable use and management of Australia’s tropical rivers and estuaries. One of the research activities undertaken by TRaCK is the description {{and analysis of the}} ways in which the components of the socio-economic system interact with each other, and with the environment in the tropical rivers (TR) region. The report presents the results of that research. While some of the research was concerned with the TR region overall, more intensive analysis was conducted for the two focal catchments of the Daly River (NT) and the Mitchell River (Qld). Section 2, Background to the Tropical Rivers Region and to the two focal catchments:The TR region is approximately 15 per cent of Australia’s mainland but it is home to fewer than 2 per cent of all Australians. Most of the TR region is sparsely populated, with two- thirds of the population living in urban centres and larger localities, of which Darwin is the  largest. The population composition is unusual, by comparison with the rest of Australia: with a higher than average Australian male/female ratio, and a younger average age. Almost one-third of the usual residents in the TR region are Indigenous, compared with just two per cent nationally. In terms of the catchment under study, 28 per cent of the Daly River population is Indigenous while 23 per cent of the Mitchell River catchment population is Indigenous. While the average population turnover rate between 2001 and 2006 is about the same as that for Australia overall, it was very hig for Darwin and the Southern Gulf parts of Queensland and lower  along the east coast of the Northern Territory and between the Embley and Coleman River catchments in Queensland. Generally, Non-Indigenous people are much more mobile than rural Indigenous people. Overall land use in the TR region is dominated by conservation and natural environments. In the Daly catchment, for instance, grazing makes up 54 per cent of land use and 39 per cent of the land  remains under what is formally classified as being in “natural condition”: of which 27 per cent is specifically designated as traditional Indigenous use and 5 per cent is set aside for conservation. The remaining land uses are divided among dryland agriculture (5 per cent), intensive uses such as urban, mining or industrial (1 per cent) and irrigated land (1 per cent). In the Mitchell catchment, 95 per cent of land use is directed towards production from unchanged land (i. e. grazing); 3 per cent of the land is in natural condition and almost exclusively under conservation, and land under intensive use (including urban, mining, industrial) is minimal at 0. 03 per cent. Interestingly, there is no natural land solely reserved for Indigenous use in the Mitchell as opposed to the Daly. Across the entire TRaCK region the Government Services sector accounts for 25 per cent of employment. The next most significant sector of employment is Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing  (11. 5 per cent), while Mining, Retail and Construction eachcomprise around 4 per cent. The same  general pattern of employment is true in both the Daly and Mitchell catchments. However, in the Daly catchment, the importance of the Government Services sector is much more noticeable. By comparison to the Mitchell catchment, fewer people are employed in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector (4 per cent in the Daly, as opposed to 15 per cent in the Mitchell). Sections 3 and 4 – Identifying an appropriate modeling technique, and refining the methodological approach:After extensive consultation with stakeholders and other researchers, and a thorough examination of existing models that could be used or adapted, it was decided to build an Input-Output (IO) model for each catchment that would differ from the usual IO model in two ways. Firstly, the household sector in each model was divided into Indigenous and Non- Indigenous households. The Indigenous/Non-Indigenous split allows the impacts of change to be measured for those two groups separately. Secondly, the IO models involved the modeling of water use for individual industries and households. Section 5 – Operationalising the models and populating them with data:Data for Non-Indigenous households were obtained from a mail-out survey in the two focal catchments, while most of the data for the Indigenous households were obtained from during face-to-face interviews. Other data required for this modeling were obtained from the ABS and from an earlier, associated, survey of businesses in Northern Australia. Much of the data  had to be ‘transformed’ prior to use, and where ever possible, data were compared with other related data sources (e. g. the ABS’s household expenditure survey) to test plausibility prior to inclusion in the model. Section 6. 1 – using the models to estimate income, employment and water multipliers:The models were used to estimate Type I and Type II income multipliers (defined in section 4), and also employment and water multipliers. In addition to considering aggregate impacts, the analysis looked at the distributional impacts of change, providing the following insights:• A one-dollar increase in final demand in almost any business sector generates a net increase in   regional income of between $ 1. 60 and $ 2. 40, depending upon the sector. Most of that money (i. e. at   last $ 1. 00) stays within the sector that is initially stimulated, but there are flow-on effects to   other sectors. • In most cases, it is the Finance sector (which, in this model, includes property and business   services), the Retail sector (including both retail and wholesale trade) and Non-Indigenous   households which benefit most from ‘flow-on’ effects. In most cases, these sectors receive   approximately $ 0. 20 each. In stark contrast, Indigenous Households generally receive just a few   cents in flow-on effects; approximately one- half of one per cent of the total regional stimulus,   and just one per cent of the total flow-on effects. • The largest flow-on increase in Indigenous incomes occurs if one stimulates the Government   sector, but even there, the flow-on effect is just $ 0. 05 following a $ 1. 00 initial increase. • When Indigenous incomes are increased exogenously (which could occur, for example, via an   increase in royalty payments or an increase in Centrelink <b>payments),</b> Non-Indigenous people <b>capture</b>   more of the flow-on effects than do Indigenous people. A $ 1 exogenous increase in Indigenous   incomes results in Indigenous people gaining a flow-on benefit of just $ 0. 01 - $ 0. 03, whereas   Non-Indigenous people gain a flow-on increase of $ 0. 18 - $ 0. 26. • Stimuli affect the labour market in a similar manner: economic growth always creates   significantly more jobs for Non-Indigenous householders than Indigenous householders. These   differences are not entirely attributable to differences in population. • Although there is relatively little variation in Type I and Type II income multipliers across   sectors, there are significant differences in employment multipliers. For example, a $ 1 million   expansion of the Accommodation sector creates, in aggregate, more than four times as many new jobs   in the Daly River catchment than an equivalent expansion of the Mining sector. • There are also significant differences in water multipliers across different industries.   Water multipliers in the Agricultural sector are orders of magnitude larger than those in other   sectors, although care must be taken when interpreting data relating to the  Mining and Manufacturing sector: as noted by the NALW taskforce (2009, p 23)   “mining and resource projects are generally excluded from water resource accounting, exact water   use estimates for this industry are not readily available”. Consequently, the estimates presented   here may understate – perhaps grossly – actual figures for the mining sector. • There is a marked difference between the water-use multipliers that have been estimated using   upper and lower-bound water use coefficients. To the extent that water is at least partially   substitutable with other resources (e. g. it is possible to reduce water use and still grow certain   types of plants by, for example, mulching, or applying water at critical phases of a plant’s growth   cycle), these results clearly illustrate the importance of water-saving technologies and research,   particularly in the agricultural sector. Section 6. 2 – using the models to explore various growth scenarios:The models were also used to examine the possible impact of different types of economic growth in the catchments. The models were used to calculate results for one year, and then extrapolated for the next 20 years. The results were as follows: 1. The ‘balanced’ growth scenario (of 1. 5 per cent per annum across all industries) significantly     out-performed all other scenarios for employment and income in the Daly. It was one of the top two     generators of income and employment in the Mitchell (alongside the 5 per cent growth in Agriculture     scenario). Within 20 years, this scenario increased Industry Income and Non-Indigenous Employment     to levels that were close to 1. 6 times greater than in 2006. Indigenous employment outcomes were     more modest – rising to between 1. 4 and 1. 5 times the 2006 levels. This balanced growth scenario     was also associated with moderate increases in consumptive water demand – rising to between 1. 2 and     1. 7 times 2006 levels depending upon whether one used lower or upper bound estimates. 2. In the Mitchell River, growth in the Agricultural sector generated substantial increases in     business/industry incomes and in Non-Indigenous employment. Outcomes for Indigenous people were     much more modest. If growth in Agriculture is achieved using water-efficient techniques (‘mimicked’     here, with the lower-bound water use coefficients), then in 2026, our models predict that     consumptive water demand would be just 1. 6 times greater than 2006 levels; but consumptive water     demand could be more than double 2006 levels in less than a decade if higher water-use coefficients     prevail. 3. Income and employment outcomes associated with the Agricultural scenario were more modest in the     Daly than in the Mitchell, but pressures on consumptive water demand were similar in both     catchments. Outcomes for Indigenous people (incomes and employment) were also very modest in both     regions – rising by less than 10 per cent, in total, over a 20 year period. 4. The tourism scenario delivered the smallest ‘returns’ to income and employment for both     Indigenous and Non-Indigenous households, in both catchments. This is a consequence of the fact     that tourism currently makes a relatively small contribution to these economies (just 3 and 2. 3 per     cent of the Mitchell and Daly River’s Gross Value Added, respectively). Consequently, 5 per cent     growth in tourism represents a very small increase in economic activity (5 per cent of 3 per cent     is not much at all!). 5. The mining scenario delivered marginally better household income and employment outcomes to both     Indigenous and Non-Indigenous households than did the tourism scenario, but the returns were still     quite small. In contrast, the associated increase in industry output/incomes were relatively good     and even out-performed those of the agricultural scenario in the Daly River. The predicted     increases in consumptive water demand were similar for the mining and tourism scenarios. However,     as noted earlier, these simulations may under-estimate (perhaps substantially) the amount of     consumptive water demand associated with the mining sector. Section 7 – Discussion and concluding comments:These results are important to anyone involved in, or interested in, northern economic development. They provide an indication of the downstream benefits from the stimulation of any industry, though not, of course the costs of such stimulation. Whilst the results of our analysis are only directly associated with two focal catchments, many other catchments in the region are socioeconomically ‘similar’. As such, the key messages (if not precise estimates) may be relevant across many northern regions. These key messages are: 1) There is an asymmetric divide between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous economic systems in Northern     Australia. Given the lack of employment and business opportunities, workplace skills, and the other     infrastructure prerequisites for development, local Indigenous people are very unlikely to benefit     from the stimulus of any of the north’s existing industries. This situation is likely to persist     unless, or until, there is structural change. 2) Some industries may be able to generate significant business income and/or incomes for some     householders, but will not necessarily deliver significant localised benefit in terms of, for     example, employment (be it Indigenous or otherwise). Development strategists may thus need to     explicitly acknowledge these tradeoffs and make conscious decisions about what it is they wish to     ‘develop’ (e. g. Regional income or regional employment? Regional income or Australian income?).     Moreover, strategists may need to think about innovative methods of redressing some of the     potential problems arising from such tradeoffs, ensuring that the methods allow for the structural     idiosyncrasies of these small northern economies    (i. e. the asymmetric divide noted above). 3) Water multipliers differ by orders of magnitude depending upon assumptions made about the     numbers of litres of water consumed per dollar output particularly in the Agricultural sector. This     clearly highlights the fact that water-saving technologies are vitally important. 4) Both Agriculture and mining are capable of generating significant income flows. But, unlike     growth in the government, health or educational sectors, growth in theagricultural sector 2     is associated with significant growth in consumptive water demand.     Development strategists may thus also need to explicitly acknowledge some of the     non-monetary impacts of different development options (not all of which will be negative), seeking     to identify ways in which to exploit synergies, redress tradeoffs, and thus capitalise on     opportunities that do not place un-due strain upon the region’s natural resources (water being but     one of many important examples) ...|$|R
