40|$|This study investigates whether foreign {{investment}} enterprises (FIEs) in China alter their corporate reporting behavior {{in response to}} a known schedule of tax-rate increases. The context of this investigation is a tax-incentive scheme that allows firms to pay taxes at a reduced rate for a limited period of time, and then at a higher rate when this period expires. If managers attempt to maximize firm value by minimizing tax costs, then the spread of tax rates in the periods surrounding the rate change may provide a substantial incentive for them to accelerate revenue <b>and</b> <b>defer</b> <b>expenses.</b> Consistent with this hypothesis, the empirical results indicate that firms report significantly higher discretionary current accruals for the years before tax-rate increases.

This study also compares the <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expenses</b> method <b>and</b> the accrual method as the proxy of Earnings Management. This study finds that <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expenses</b> <b>and</b> the accrual measures (using Total Accruals model, Modified Jones Model and Forward Looking Model) have positive and significant impacts on the probability of earnings management to avoid losses.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the relatively rule-based U. S.

Comparisons of accounting standards across different markets and countries are difficult because of the differences in institutional factors and corporate governance issues (Frost and Pownall, 1994; Leuz, 2003). This problem is controlled via the unique feature of dual listing in the current German Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aimed at providing higher quality financial statements has undoubtedly {{been one of}} the most critical changes in the field of accounting in the European Union (EU). However, under the presence of incentives for earnings management, the adoption of high-quality accounting standards may not provide an adequate set of conditions for the improved quality of financial reporting (Ball et al., 2003; Holthausen, 2003, Kothari et al., 2010). The present thesis examines the adoption of IAS 12 : Income Taxes in Greece, which is a country that does not offer the ideal conditions for the {{implementation of}}, quality accounting standards (Li, 2010). The research analysis examines (a) the level of compliance with the disclosure requirements of IAS 12 and the associated factors that affect it, (b) the value relevance of tax components and (c) the likely discretionary use of deferred tax components for earnings management purposes in Greece. The results of the thesis reveal a number of interesting findings. First, the level of conformity to IAS 12 by Greek companies is increasing and seems to be affected by firm characteristics. To be specific, growth, auditing firm (Big 4 vs. non-Big 4) and size are useful in explaining changes in the level of conformity, while leverage and profitability are also useful; however, only for some of the disclosures. Second, tax components seem to be value relevant. Current tax is significant under every research setting examined and has a positive coefficient, while net deferred tax liabilities are significant and have a negative coefficient. On the other hand, the results on <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expenses</b> are mixed and show that they have a negative slope coefficient, yet they are significant for some particular procedures employed for correcting the standard errors. Third, the relation between discretionary accruals <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expenses</b> is further examined. The results show that <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expenses</b> seem to be related to earnings management under some research settings. However, the main finding of the thesis is that even under a severe institutional setting that does not offer ideal circumstances for implementation, the adoption of a new standard that ensures high-quality accounting helps in providing high-quality accounting information to investors, even though under some research settings the presence of incentives may lead to the discretionary use of deferred tax components.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{examine the}} {{usefulness}} of <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense</b> as compared to various accrual measures employed in prior research in detecting earnings management in three settings where earnings management likely occurs. The motivation for using <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense</b> to detect earnings management {{is that there is}} typically more discretion under generally accepted accounting principles than under tax rules, and we assume that managers exploit such discretion to manage income upwards primarily in ways that do not affect current taxable income. Thus, we expect that decisions to manage earnings upwards will generate book-tax differences that increase <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense.</b> Our results provide evidence of the incremental usefulness of <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense</b> in detecting earnings management activities vis-à-vis total accruals and abnormal accruals derived from two versions of the Jones model. <b>Deferred</b> tax <b>expense</b> is generally incrementally useful beyond all three accruals-based measures with regard to detecting earnings management to avoid an earnings decline and with regard to detecting earnings management to avoid a loss. We also find that <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense</b> is significantly more accurate than any of the accrual measures in classifying firm-years as successfully avoiding a loss, whereas no one measure is relatively mor...|$|R

40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has {{undertaken}} research on accounting for income taxes. The IASB {{research suggests that}} a fundamental change from International Accounting Standard 12 : Income Taxes (IAS 12), the balance sheet method, to another method may be considered. Other methods for accounting for deferred tax include the taxes payable method, the comprehensive basis under the income statement method, and the partial basis under the income statement method. This thesis provides evidence on this issue by using non-United States data to examine these deferred tax methods. This thesis examines the research question “are deferred tax methods, relative to the taxes payable method, information relevant?” Information that is ‘information relevant’ has two components: predictability and value relevance (Ohlson, 1995). The predictability of deferred tax methods is measured by its ability to predict future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method. The value relevance of deferred tax methods is measured by its association with share price relative to the taxes payable method. Literature examining deferred taxes predominately uses United States US data and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), and only partially examines deferred tax methods. This thesis {{contributes to the literature}} by examining all three deferred tax line items: deferred tax liabilities, <b>deferred</b> tax assets <b>and</b> <b>deferred</b> tax <b>expense.</b> The data is collected from the financial information for firms listed on the NZ Stock Exchange. Two samples of firms are examined: from 2000 to 2004 (pre IFRS) and 2008 to 2012 (post IFRS). The results show that the comprehensive basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments and is value relevant relative to the taxes payable method. This indicates that it is information relevant. The partial basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method however it is only value relevant for firms in the highest three deciles of mean increases in tax paid over the period. The balance sheet method is not a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the taxes payable method. The balance sheet method is, however, value relevant. The balance sheet method using disaggregated deferred tax is also value relevant relative to the balance sheet method...|$|R

Hence, certain costs which are incurred to acquire insurance contracts should not be recognized as an expense in the accounting period {{in which they are}} incurred but should be capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually amortized over the lifetime of the insurance contracts. Such costs are called <b>Deferred</b> Acquisition <b>Expenses</b> (DAE) <b>and</b> capitalization of DAE results in setting up of an asset called Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC).|$|R
