25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
500|$|Having won the 1980 election, President Reagan {{contacted}} Keating {{about becoming}} U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, where Keating had spent considerable time. When Keating's run-in with the SEC resurfaced in press reports, however, he was dropped from consideration. This dismayed Keating, who subsequently said, [...] "To keep <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> out of positions {{like that because}} of yellow journalism, I don't know what good it does." ...|$|E
500|$|Later {{on during}} the West Coast leg of his 1974 tour, Harrison donated the profits from one concert to the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco. As {{recorded}} in Fong-Torres's article, Harrison then visited the clinic and sang the chorus of [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] to the grateful staff, {{as a way to}} illustrate his point: [...] "Don't thank me... it's something else over us that acts through <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me.</b> I'm just an instrument." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Glabicki of the American band Rusted Root {{acknowledges}} {{this album}} {{as a key}} influence on his own career exploring worldbeat music, saying, [...] "I just kind of got locked into that sound. Peter Gabriel's So kind of gave everyone the go-ahead that this could work in a popular fashion. For <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> who were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it's going to work or not just went away at that point." [...] English musician Steven Wilson said, [...] "People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era", but he cited So as an album that was [...] "really smart".|$|E
500|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to a {{fortified}} police station at Yagur in Israel, where he spent nine months. The Israelis were unwilling to take him to trial based solely on the evidence in documents and witness testimony, so the prisoner was subject to daily interrogations, the transcripts of which totalled over 3,500 pages. The interrogator was Chief Inspector Avner Less of the national police. Using documents provided primarily by Yad Vashem and Nazi hunter Tuviah Friedman, Less was often able to determine when Eichmann was lying or being evasive. When additional information was brought forward that forced Eichmann into admitting what he had done, Eichmann would insist he had not had any authority in the Nazi hierarchy and had only been following orders. Inspector Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realise the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse. His pardon plea, released in 2016, did not contradict this: [...] "There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> forced to serve as mere instruments {{in the hands of the}} leaders", Eichmann wrote. [...] "I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, Watson {{announced}} her involvement with People Tree, a Fair trade fashion brand. Watson {{worked as a}} creative advisor {{for the company to}} create a spring line of clothing, which was released in February 2010; the range featured styles inspired by southern France and London. The collection, described by The Times as [...] "very clever" [...] despite their [...] "quiet hope that [...] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle", was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration, admitted that competition for the range was minimal, but argued that [...] "Fashion {{is a great way to}} empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in"; adding, [...] "I think young <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there." [...] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.|$|E

500|$|For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association {{brought back}} the less {{controversial}} Rich Little. Arianna Huffington reported that Colbert {{told her he had}} specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for [...] "Gutsiest Move". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary", christening it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. Three and a half years after the speech, Frank Rich referenced it again, calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "good for the country", while columnist Dan Savage referred to it as [...] "one of the things that kept <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> sane during the darkest days of the Bush years". The editor of The Realist, Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, [...] "rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now." ...|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexy" [...] marked Paltrow's second guest {{appearance}} on Glee as substitute teacher Holly Holliday. She first appeared {{earlier in the}} second season, in the seventh episode, [...] "The Substitute". The role was devised for her by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, who suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of {{the release of the}} film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Paltrow was signed to Glee for two episodes, with [...] "The Substitute" [...] originally intended to feature a love quadrangle between Holly, Will, Emma and Carl. Her initial arc was, however, reduced to a single episode. Post-broadcast, Murphy said they both hoped she would appear on Glee again in the future, depending on the right storyline. In January 2011, Paltrow confirmed that she would be reprising the role. Murphy stated that she would appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen as a sex education teacher, and would serve as a love interest for Will, though she actually appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen. Stamos also reprised his role as Emma's husband Carl. As of March 2011, he was unsure whether he would return to Glee again, but stated that he might do so to conclude Emma and Carl's storyline, explaining: [...] "I think <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> on there, but they really love Will and Emma together. So I don't know how much longer people can stand Will and Emma not being together." ...|$|E

500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>me.</b> [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The phrase [...] "took me to a Leafs game" [...] {{was used}} as a {{euphemism}} for an attempted male-on-male sexual encounter.
