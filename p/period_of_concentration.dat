40|$|Several {{periods of}} {{increased}} fluvial activity and accelerated runoff / deposition {{have been identified}} during the Holocene in different regions of Europe (Macklin et al, 2006). According to Starkel (2002) the older phases were characterized by an incision of deeper and wider tracks and, since Roman period, especially during the past millennium, tendency had changed to aggradation, braiding and river avulsions. The turn to a more stable fluvial regime caused further incisions {{and the development of}} narrow and smaller meanders. All these fluvial responses can be mainly correlated with the climatic fluctuations (cooler and wetter phases alternating with drier and warmer ones), socio-economic changes (increased anthropic pressure) or both. The last major <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> of extreme meteorological and hydrological events is the Little Ice Age (LIA), which conventionally took place between the 16 th and mid 19 th century (Lamb, 1984). However in Romania the study of LIA and the associate fluvial effects is rather poor. The data regarding hydro-climatological events (weather conditions, floods) in the medieval period (mostly collected by Topor, 1960) is scarce and based on the few local chronicles and diaries of the foreign travelers. However these confirm the increased frequency and magnitude of the rainfalls in the summer (with several important peaks in the 1590 – 1690 interval) as well as the hard winters well documented {{for the rest of the}} continent. Changes in the configuration of the stream network, due to avulsions, can be evaluated based on historical maps only with the first half of the 17 th century and the dating of the fluvial records is still missing. The North-Eastern part of the Lower Danube Plain (Fig. 1) is a large alluvial floodplain where Siret River collects several major tributary streams draining SE Carpathians (Putna, Râmnicu Sărat, Buzău) or the Moldavian Tableland (Bârlad), before joining Danube, near Galaţi. Surprisingly Siret’s floodplain (until the confluence with Buzău) it is larger by a couple of kilometers than Danube’s, despite the anastomosed character of the last one. This can indicate a progressive Holocene shift of the Siret’s river course from the Carpathians to the eastern edge of the floodplain or a transformation from a multi-channel to a single channel pattern. The instability was also specific to main tributaries, as is confirmed by the presence of multiple abandoned sinuous courses and relict meander belts in the area. An important shift of the Siret River’s lower course to a more eastern position during medieval times was briefly discussed, for the first time, by Antonovici (1929) based on couple of historical documents. The few questions we will try to answer to in this study are: When was formed the actual configuration of the river network in the study region? What was the impact of the LIA? How relevant can be the analysis of the historical data in the assessment of the river channel shifts?</p...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{technical}} {{change in}} late industrialised economies {{is the general}} area of this thesis. There {{is a lack of}} research and policy advice on how industry sectors develop active technological learning, particularly in economies based on natural resources and in contexts of poverty and inequality. The thesis is framed by the challenges related to production and economic performance. This thesis compares three natural resource-based industries in Chile - copper mining, fruit growing and salmon farming – focusing on the participation of doctoral graduates, taking a historical perspective. Doctoral graduates represent {{a small fraction of the}} population, but their importance in the advancement of knowledge and technological change is considered strategic. The thesis research questions are: how do doctoral graduates participate in the accumulation of producer capabilities in industry sectors; what factors are important for their participation; and what are the implications for public policy? The thesis adopts the concept Sectoral Learning Systems (SLS) (adapted from Viotti, 2001) and applies the producer capability approach (von Tunzelmann and Wang, 2007; von Tunzelmann, 2009), which is an alternative approach to conventional production theory, to understand the practice of doctoral graduates in relation to technological change. Policy analysis and recommendations are based on the concept of system alignment (von Tunzelmann, 2010), which offers possibilities for governing systems in which agents may have contradictory views and positions. Throughout, the thesis is underpinned by Bourdieu’s (2005) economic anthropological approach. His notions of field, habitus and capital are reinterpreted within the more specific science, technology and innovation studies literature. This thesis constitutes an interdisciplinary endeavour that integrates approaches from different academic traditions such that all are essential for achieving the research findings. In terms of methodology, the thesis draws on a historical study of coevolution of technology and governance for each of the three industries, complemented by in depth individual case studies. Through analytical inference, I locate doctoral graduates in the history of each field. The analysis is illustrated by the case studies of doctoral graduates’ careers. By applying the producer capability approach, I deduce the likely accumulation of scientific capabilities by doctoral graduates in each field. The results of the comparison show that copper mining, fruit growing and salmon farming display similar patterns of development in relation to their respective incorporations into the technological revolutions in each industry field. In all three cases, the state played an important role in the emergence of these industries at the national and international levels. The establishment of these industries was succeeded by periods of high profits, adoption of new technologies and low levels of innovation, followed by intense process innovation and increasing competition, and finally a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> and re-structuring characterized by the development of networks of suppliers and oligopolistic industry structures. Product diversification in the dominant technological paradigm appeared towards the last period. Doctoral graduates emerged as scientific suppliers to the industries, when these industries embarked on the phase of intense process innovation, which increased demand for scientific possibilities supplied by doctoral graduates. The level of demand often was related to industry subsidies, particularly important in the fruit and salmon farming sectors. Doctoral graduates participated in active technological learning in less mature technology contexts, and in systems where the dominant producers had the capabilities for improvement and innovation. Once doctoral graduates had a position as scientific suppliers, they actively maintained and enhanced their participation in the field. Doctoral graduates also participated in shaping the structure of the fields, and in influencing policy. The thesis derives policy recommendations to strengthen active learning, particularly in relation to new product development, based on the understandings and the lessons drawn from history...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the West German press in the 1970 s {{has so far been}} described as a transition from a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> (1954 - 1976) to stabilisation (1976 - 1985). The analysis by Schütz and others has several short-comings: firstly, the argument is implicitly based on a vague empirical definition of pluralism that is understood as the number of daily newspapers with an independent editorial department in a given market. Secondly, the analysis is almost exclusively based on the daily press and ignores the impact of new journals, regional editions, weeklies, and the ‘alternative’ press on the press market of the 1970 s. Finally, the turning points of 1954 and 1976 do not relate to wider changes in circulation figures and other important aspects of press history. This thesis presents a new analysis {{of the history of the}} West German press during the period from the protests of the late 1960 s against ‘opinion monopolies’ to the early 1980 s deregulation of the West German broadcasting market. The introduction, i. e. the first chapter, provides a detailed criticism of the current historiography and explains why the new analysis rests on the following pillars: a new periodization, a broader look at various segments of the press, including dailies and weeklies, a clearer delineation of local, regional, and supra-regional markets, a more precise and critical engagement with the ideas of contemporaries on pluralism, and a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the press and television in the 1970 s. The second chapter engages critically with the current periodisation of press history. The chapter establishes several criteria in order to provide a more accurate picture. These include circulation figures, wider market developments, public debates, laws, and the internal organisation of the press. It analyses the {{development of}} the press from 1945 to the student protests against Axel Springer in 1968. It identifies the fact that the press underwent three phases after 1945, the ‘occupation period’ (1945 - 49), the era ‘between expansion and restauration’ (1949 - 1957), and an era characterised by ‘criticism of the government and debates over the press’ (1957 - 1968 / 69). The chapter concludes that the changes between 1968 and 1969 constitute the starting point of a distinct period in West German press history, the ‘long social-liberal 1970 s’ between 1968 / 69 and 1982. The third chapter analyses two new contemporary concepts of press pluralism that shaped the policy debates of the long 1970 s, namely social pluralism and free-market pluralism. The former was championed by scholars such as Peter Glotz and the governments of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. It envisaged a protection of a socially and politically diverse press and provided the wider framework for new laws and regulations such as the so-called Law on Merger Control in the Press (1976). These market interventions were opposed by the conservatives at the time, who championed the idea of free-market pluralism. The fourth chapter shows how this struggle over the proper role of the democratic press between state and society escalated on the left and right of the political spectrum. The new social movements discussed the idea of a ‘counter public’ existing in opposition to the ‘established’ media. As a result, several hundreds of ‘alternative’ papers were founded in the segment of the weekly, monthly, and irregular press that contributed to a high point of market diversity in the 1970 s. These papers found their counterpart among intellectually elitist journals that portrayed themselves as a conservative ‘counterweight’ to the assumed leftist mass press and pluralisation at the time. The fifth chapter then shows that the debates over press pluralism, new laws and policies, and the developments in the political weekly and monthly press as well as the ‘alternative’ press reshaped the core of the West German press market in the 1970 s, namely the regional and local daily press. Finally, chapter six addresses the existing historiography on the role of the press in the overall media ensemble. It shows that new concepts of press pluralism, the transformation of the press market, its particular role in the regions, and unique press-government relations added to the elevated position of prestige of the press vis-à-vis television and contributed to its role as a partial political lead medium within the ‘new culture of political participation’ emerging towards the end of the decade...|$|E

The samplings were carried out with a mobile laboratory in five locations on the Salentum peninsula situated in the southeastern part of Italy in Puglia. Measurements were taken discontinuously during the period 2002 ? 2004. Some results of PM 2. 5 measurements taken only in 2004 are also presented. Up to now no systematic analyses <b>of</b> aerosol <b>concentration</b> in the Salentum peninsula have been presented in the scientific literature. This study is therefore a useful basis for assessing the local situation and for planning future monitoring and investigations. Measurements were performed using a standard European PM 10 inlet (CEN?EN 12341, 1998) and successive gravimetric detection of aerosol deposited over 24 hours periods on filters. The measurement sites can be considered representative of urban background for all the cases investigated. Results show concentrations in good agreement with lognormal distributions, indicating that the PM 10 fraction is about 69 % of TSP and PM 2. 5 is about 81 % of PM 10, which allows us to evaluate that the fraction of PM 2. 5 is about 56 % <b>of</b> TSP. <b>Concentration</b> levels were correlated with local meteorological parameters, such as wind velocity, wind direction and precipitations.

The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> greatest <b>concentration</b> occurs apparently somewhere in the interval between the 50 th and 65 th day and the native unaltered serum drawn from the mare's jugular vein at this time is capable of exerting clear gonadotropic effects in immature (21 - 26 day old) female rats or mice within a hundred hours following six doses of 0. 005 cc.

Evans, Meyer and Simpson (8) included the hormone from the mare's blood in their comparative study of gonad-stimulating substances from the hypophysis and other * Aided by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and from the Committe...|$|R

The {{infectious}} dose of giardia, however, is very low, with about 2% chance of infection from a single cyst. Also, very few studies have {{addressed the issue of}} transient contamination. According to one researcher, the likely model for the risk of Giardia from wilderness water is pulse contamination, that is, a brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> high cyst <b>concentration</b> from fecal contamination.|$|R

By removing the request of evenly sampled data, the periodogram allows to extend spectral analysis to this kind of data, which usually suffer the "missing data" problem due to instrument vacancies.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{variability}} and seasonality of ozone over the tropics was carried out between the regions spreading from Latitude 300 South to 300 North. The region was divided into twelve zones of 50 latitudes each, that is, Latitude 0 - 50 South, 0 - 50 North, 5 – 100 South and 5 – 100 North etc. Secondary data from satellite for each zone was studied both individually and collectively for the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 1997 to 1999.

They were I - 4 SDs below their expected 50 th percentile for height. The energy and nitrogen intakes were unchanged from 8 mo {{before the beginning of}} the study until its completion. Two consecutive <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> 5 mo each were studied. 0 KG (15 g) was added to the parenteral solution during the first period (OKG+) but not during the second period (0 KG-). Height velocity (HV) increased (P < 0. 05) from a median of 3. 8 cm/y to 6. 45 cm/y (range 1. 8 - 6. 7) during the OKG+) period, and decreased (P < 0. 05) to a median of 3. 65 cm/y in the 0 KG- <b>period.</b> Plasma <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> insulin-like growth factor I (IGF 1), glutamine, and glutamate increased (P < 0. 05) during the OKG+ <b>period.</b> Variations <b>of</b> IGFI <b>concentrations</b> correlated with HV variations (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 005) during both periods.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of complex life {{over the past}} 600 million years was disrupted by at least five mass extinctions, one of which occurred at the close <b>of</b> the Triassic <b>period.</b> The end-Triassic extinction corresponds to a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> high atmospheric-CO 2 concentrations caused by massive volcanism and biomass burning; most extinction scenarios invoke the resulting environmental perturbations in accounting {{for the loss of}} marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Here we reconstruct changes in Tethyan shallow marine ecosystems and ocean redox chemistry from earliest Jurassic (Hettangian) -aged black shales from Germany and Luxemburg. The shales contain increased <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> the biomarker isorenieratane, a fossilized pigment from green sulphur bacteria. The abundance of green sulphur bacteria suggests that the photic zone underwent prolonged <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> high <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulphide. This interval is also marked by the proliferation of green algae, an indicator of anoxia. We conclude that the redox changes in the entire water column reflect sluggish circulation in marginal regions of the Tethys Ocean. We suggest that the resultant repeated poisoning of shallow epicontinental seasg-hotspots of Mesozoic biodiversityg-with hydrogen sulphide may have slowed the recovery of marine ecosystems during the Early Jurassic. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
