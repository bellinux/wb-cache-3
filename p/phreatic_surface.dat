40|$|ABSTRACT. Taku Glacier, Alaska, USA, is {{currently}} in the advance stage of the tidewater glacier cycle. We investigated the near-terminus dynamics by measuring surface velocities, surface elevation changes, ice thickness and ablation. Velocities vary on sub-daily, diurnal, seasonal and interannual timescales. Flowline modeling shows that the modeled surface velocities are sensitive to changes in till yield strength and thus effective basal pressures. The glacier bed deepens in the up-glacier direction and this imposes a minimum subglacial water pressure necessary for water to drain along the bed. In a simple model we impose water-pressure gradients based on <b>phreatic</b> <b>surfaces</b> of constant slopes to simulate the winter– summer transitions. This proves sufficient to explain an observed early-season switch from compressional to block flow. Velocities also vary between years. Changing basal conditions can result in lower horizontal velocities, which decrease the ice supply to the terminus and result in temporary surface lowering. But a decrease in ice flux to the terminus must lead to ice storage further upstream, and that ice mass will eventually reach the terminus. This can explain the observed episodic nature of terminus advance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Reservoir slope {{instability}} is a geological hazard induced by filling a reservoir and is generally {{believed to be}} caused mainly by unfavorable changes in the hydrodynamic condition in the slope during reservoir filling and/or operation. Although many cases of reservoir {{slope instability}} have been reported, very few field instrumentation data exist describing how the hydrodynamic condition changes and relates to landslide reactivation. Taking the opportunity of filling the Three Gorges Reservoir, a monitoring system was implemented to monitor the hydrodynamic and deformation response of a preexisting landslide, the Xietan landslide in Zigui County, Hubei Province, China. The monitoring items included reservoir level, water level in boreholes, pore water pressure, rainfall precipitation and deformation of borehole using inclinometers. The results indicate that there exist two <b>phreatic</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the slope before reservoir filling, the upper one is at around the top surface of the slip band and the lower one is in the bedrock. The less permeable slip band and sliding-disturbed zone constitute the relatively impermeable layer between the two surfaces. The stabilization effect of the reverse seepage during reservoir filling is temporary and limited. Reservoir filling is {{the main cause of}} reactivation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
2500|$|There are two end {{members in}} the {{spectrum}} of types of aquifers; confined and unconfined (with semi-confined being in between). Unconfined aquifers are sometimes also called water table or phreatic aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface.</b> (See Biscayne Aquifer.) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning {{it does not have}} a confining layer (an aquitard or aquiclude) between it and the surface.

This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer.

SHETRAN is calibrated and validated against daily runoff measurements at outlet and internal sections and against <b>phreatic</b> <b>surfaces</b> using a multibasin, multi-location and multi-response approach. Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, volume deviation and coefficient of determination ranged, respectively, from 0. 58 to 0. 76, 0. 59 to 0. 79 and − 9 to 15 %, in the calibration period, and from 0. 54 to 0. 75, 0. 54 to 0. 77 and − 14 to 12 %, in the validation period. Three GCM and two RCM are used for control (1961 – 1990) and scenario (2071 – 2100) periods, under the A 2 SRES emission scenario. Observed bias in the climate models’ projected precipitation and temperature are corrected with three bias correction methods. For the scenario period the climate models project a change in precipitation from + 1. 5 to − 65 % and an increase in temperature from + 2. 7 to + 5. 9 °C. This trend in climate change projection is reflected in the annual runoff that decreases drastically, between 13 and 90 %, in southern Portugal {{by the end of the}} century.

We compared isolates from A. constricta and Prosopis glandulosa and tested {{the hypothesis that the}} rhizobia from a deep-phreatic rooting zone of a Prosopis woodland in the Sonoran Desert of southern California were phenetically distinct from rhizobia from surface soils. Cluster analysis identified four major homogeneous groups. The first phenon contained slow-growing (SG) Prosopis rhizobia from surface and deep-phreatic-soil environments. These isolates grew poorly on most of the media used in the study, probably because of their requirement for a high medium pH. The second group of isolates primarily contained SG Prosopis rhizobia from the deep-phreatic rooting environment and included two fast-growing (FG) Psorothamnus rhizobia. These isolates were nutritionally versatile and grew over a broad pH range. The third major phenon was composed mainly of FG Prosopis rhizobia from surface and dry subsurface soils. While these isolates used a restricted range of carbohydrates (including sucrose) as sole carbon sources, they showed better growth on a range of organic acids as sole carbon sources and amino acids as sole carbon and nitrogen sources than did other isolates in the study. They grew better at 36 °C than at 26 °C. The FG Acacia rhizobia from surface-soil environments formed a final major phenon that was distinct from the Prosopis isolates. They produced very high absorbance readings on all of the carbohydrates tested except sucrose, grew poorly on many of the other substrates tested, and preferred a 36 to a 26 °C incubation temperature. The surface populations of Prosopis rhizobia required a higher pH for growth and, under the conditions used in this study, were less tolerant of low solute potential and high growth temperature than were phreatic-soil isolates.

The primary objective {{of this study is}} to identify and determine through laboratory as well as numerical modeling, the processes involved during the collapse of an ice jam and the formation, development and propagation of the resulting surges and ice run. The research work was carried out in three parts, namely the investigation of the phreatic water levels along an ice jam, the transport of accumulation ice covers, and the characteristics of surges and ice runs caused by the jam release. From this study, five different types of release mechanisms related to the break-up of ice jams were identified. It was evident that the surge characteristics depend primarily on the type of release mechanism and the prevailing initial hydrodynamic conditions prevailing immediately before release. Observations showed that during the collapse of the jam, its thickness profile at the toe of the ice jam undergoes redistribution for a short period of time and subsequently the ice mass moves downstream in a relatively single layer scenario, A two-dimensional two-layer model is formulated for the simulation of an ice jam release event. The model is capable of simulating the <b>phreatic</b> water <b>surface</b> profile along an ice jam, the formation, development and propagation of the surge and ice run after the release and the redistribution of ice jam thickness after release.

Pendant cements show a high variability in δ 18 O, which was impossible to detect by the less precise microdrilling method. The morphology of a given cement can be produced in various environments, and dogtooth cements especially can precipitate in marine phreatic and meteoric phreatic to vadose environments. Marine dogtooth cements and micritic microbially-induced fabrics precipitated directly as low-magnesium calcite in marine waters, as attested by the preservation of their initial δ 18 O and δ 13 C signals. Five discontinuity types are recognized based on high-resolution geochemical analyses and their palaeoenvironmental history can be reconstructed. Two exposure surfaces with non-ferroan pendant or meniscus cements formed in the oxidizing vadose zone. A hardground displays marine fibrous cements and non-ferroan dogtooth cements that formed in a subtidal environment in oxidizing water.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the Netherlands {{consists}} of polder area. Therefore the inhabitants have to rely on the Dutch flood defence system to protect them against floods. A vast network of drainage canals ensures that the seepage water and the precipitation water is transported from the polders toward the outside water. There are several mechanisms which can cause failure of the embankments; one of the mechanisms is macro instability of the inner slope. The stability is mainly determined by the pore pressures inside the dike. They cause a reduction in effective stress which is necessary to stabilize the dike. Precipitation acts as a recharge of the groundwater and causes the pore pressures to rise; the exact influence of precipitation on the pore pressures is however not described in literature. The objective of the study was: to compose a method to assess the probability distribution of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> that includes the effect of precipitation. With a probabilistic computation it is possible to assess how safe the region behind the dike is instead of only knowing if the area is safe enough. The method that is developed is based on finite element computations of multiple precipitation events for dikes consisting of different hydraulic soil characteristics. In the study the probability density function of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> is related to statistical information of precipitation events in the Netherlands. The result from the study is the probability density function of the rise of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> in 11 combinations of soil type and permeability. They show that precipitation can have a significant influence on the pore pressures. Each probability density function contains information on the rise of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> with a probability of exceedance between 0, 5 and 0, 001. The rise of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> ranges between several centimetres in a dike consisting of permeable sand, to full saturation in a dike consisting of medium permeable clay or peat. The most important finding with respect to the current assessment method (Technisch rapport waterspanningen bij dijken) is that precipitation causes non-hydrostatic pore pressures. The current guidelines prescribe hydrostatic pressures, that results in an overestimation of the pore pressures. This means the probability of failure will be lower than expected regarding to governing schematization method. The most important finding respective to the probabilistic method in ‘flood risk of regional flood defences’ is regarding the probability mass of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface.</b> In this thesis report is concluded that the failure due to a high or a low <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> must be regarded separately.

The interface separating the dry and wet regions of the dam is a free boundary (in the hydrology literature called the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface).</b> Dupuit, in 1863, derived the formal approximation that the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> was nearly a parabola. In recent years, mathematicians have obtained existence results. Here, relations are established between the formal approximations and the solutions obtained from the existence proofs. 1...|$|E
40|$|List of hydro-, phreato- and aphreatophytes in the Netherlands Phreatophytes are species (or other taxa) {{which are}} in a certain part of their {{distribution}} area exclusively or mainly limited to the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> (level of the ground water). Species which in their distribution {{are not limited to}} this sphere of influence, are called aphreatophytes. A list (LONDO, 1975) was {{made on the basis of}} field observations for the purpose of ground water management in the Netherlands. The following categories are distinguished: H—Hydrophytes, species with vegetative parts submerged and/or floating on the water surface. W—Species requiring for at least part of the year a (ground) water level above or at the soil surface (in years with a normal water table) for a good development and completion of their life cycle (e. g. germination). F—Species growing exclusively within the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface,</b> which is generally below the soil surface. Species of categories W and F are strictly phreatophytes. f—Species growing mainly or nearly exclusively within the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface,</b> which is generally below the soil surface. The species of this category as well as those of the following categories (f) and a, are not strictly phreatophytes. (f) —Species growing in the greater part of their area in the Netherlands within the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> (which is generally below the soil surface), but also occurring, and often abundantly in certain habitats (especially in areas rich in lime), above this sphere of influence, a—Species which in many habitats in the Netherlands are not limited to the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> (here they are aphreatophytes), but which grow exclusively or mainly within this sphere of influence, locally especially in dunes or other sandy areas. A—Species not bound to the sphere of influence of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> (aphreatophytes). z—Species growing only in salt habitats. Species of salt habitats occurring (sometimes incidentally) also in environments with fresh ground water, are classified in one of the other categories. Underlining in the list of H, W, F, f, (f), and a means that the concerning species are characteristic for the relatively constant (less dynamic), and/or relatively oligotrophic, and/or vulnerable habitats, or that (relatively) rare species of more dynamic and/or eutrophic habitats are concerned. On the basis of a floristic survey of an area, and with the help of this list one can determine the vulnerability with respect to changes in the (ground) water table and changes in the chemical composition of the water...|$|E
40|$|A slope {{stability}} model is derived for an infinite slope subjected to unsaturated infiltration flow above a <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface.</b> Closed form steady state solutions are derived for the matric suction {{and degree of}} saturation profiles. Soil unit weight, consistent with the degree of saturation profile, is also directly calculated and introduced into the analyzes, resulting in closed-form solutions for typical soil parameters and an infinite series solution for arbitrary soil parameters. The solutions are coupled with the infinite {{slope stability}} equations to establish a fully realized safety factor function. In general, consideration of soil suction results in higher factor of safety. The increase in shear strength due to the inclusion of soil suction is analogous to making an addition to the cohesion, which, of course, increases the factor of safety against sliding. However, for cohesive soils, the results show lower safety factors for slip surfaces approaching the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> compared to those produced by common safety factor calculations. The lower factor of safety {{is due to the}} increased soil unit weight considered in the matric suction model but not usually accounted for in practice wherein the soil is treated as dry above the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface.</b> The developed model is verified with a published case study, correctly predicting stability under dry conditions and correctly predicting failure for a particular storm...|$|E
40|$|The shallow flow {{expansion}} {{is used to}} derive equations describing the flow of fluid in an unconfined aquifer. The expansion, which is carried out to second order, is combined with an approximation accounting for {{the influence of the}} capillary fringe to give a model that describes the motion of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> as it is affected by the capillarity of the porous medium. The results are derived for the case of an aquifer in contact with a reservoir, with the fluid in the reservoir undergoing a steady periodic motion. A linearized solution of the second-order theory is shown to agree well with an "exact" numerical solution. It is demonstrated using the Iinearized solution that the porous medium capillarity affects the time- averaged mean square height of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> of the aquifer in the second-order term, but leaves the first- order term unchanged...|$|E
40|$|The {{most famous}} dam of the Netherlands, the Afsluitdijk, {{is in need}} of renovation. Hydraulic {{conditions}} for the year 2050, for some aspects even 2100, must be considered during the renovation of the dam originally constructed 1927 - 1933. A combination of sea level rise due to climate change and a change in the applied statistical methods result in design conditions that are, at some locations, meters higher than those used a century ago. In a mission to retain the required level of safety while keeping expenses at a minimum, several innovative designs are considered; one of which is to allow very large overtopping discharges by making the dam resilient to erosion. However, calculations have shown that the overtopping values can be over 10 litres per second per meter dam, and the effect of this overtopping on the Afsluitdijk is unknown. In Dutch national design guidelines for dikes, schematizations are proposed for the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> in dikes during storm conditions. Wave overtopping is mentioned to have a rising effect on the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface,</b> but clear methods to determine the magnitude of this effect are not prescribed. The guidelines suggest assuming full saturation of the dam in severe overtopping conditions, which has a detrimental effect on the slope stability. Recent studies and large scale infiltration tests on the Afsluitdijk show that only a very limited amount of water infiltrates in the dam and that the assumption of full saturation is much too conservative in case of the Afsluitdijk. In the present study, a finite-element model (Plaxflow) is used to model the <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> in the Afsluitdijk during storm conditions, taking into account the effect of wave overtopping on the phreatic line. Parameters were determined by in-situ and laboratory investigations. To verify the model, calculations were calibrated on standpipe measurements. Wave overtopping is modelled by defining infiltration boundaries based on experiments and sensitivity analyses are conducted. The result of the study is a <b>phreatic</b> <b>surface</b> that can safely be used for the calculation of the slope stability of the levee during predicted storm conditions for the year 2050...|$|E
