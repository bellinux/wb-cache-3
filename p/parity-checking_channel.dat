In this paper we used Joint Network-Channel Coding scheme, for reliable multiple access relay channel. Specifically, JNCC combines irregular low-density <b>parity-check</b> (LDPC) <b>channel</b> coding and random linear network coding through iterative joint decoding, which helps to fully exploit the spatial diversity and redundancy residing in both channel codes and network code through this we have analyse BER,GER,FER,PER {{in order to}} achieve diversity gain.

40|$|Abstract—Multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) {{techniques}} have been actively pursued recently in underwater acoustic com-munications {{to increase the}} data rate over the bandwidth-limited channels. In this communication, we present a MIMO system design, where spatial multiplexing is applied with orthogonal-fre-quency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The proposed receiver works on a block-by-block basis, where null subcarriers are used for Doppler compensation, pilot subcarriers are used for channel estimation, and a MIMO detector consisting of a hybrid use of successive interference cancellation and soft {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) equalization is coupled with low-density <b>parity-check</b> (LDPC) <b>channel</b> decoding for iterative detection on each subcarrier.

30|$|We {{propose a}} block-by-block {{iterative}} receiver for underwater MIMO-OFDM that couples channel estimation with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection and low-density <b>parity-check</b> (LDPC) <b>channel</b> decoding. In particular, the channel estimator {{is based on}} a compressive sensing technique to exploit the channel sparsity, the MIMO detector consists of a hybrid use of successive interference cancellation and soft minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalization, and channel coding uses nonbinary LDPC codes. Various feedback strategies from the channel decoder to the channel estimator are studied, including full feedback of hard or soft symbol decisions, as well as their threshold-controlled versions. We study the receiver performance using numerical simulation and experimental data collected from the RACE 08 and SPACE 08 experiments. We find that iterative receiver processing including sparse channel estimation leads to impressive performance gains. These gains are more pronounced when the number of available pilots to estimate the channel is decreased, for example, when a fixed number of pilots is split between an increasing number of parallel data streams in MIMO transmission. For the various feedback strategies for iterative channel estimation, we observe that soft decision feedback slightly outperforms hard decision feedback.|$|R
40|$|Traditional Wyner-Ziv video coding (WZVC) {{structures}} require either intra (Key) or Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding of frames. Unfortunately, {{keeping the}} video quality approximately constant implies drastic bit-rate fluctuations because consecutive frames {{of different types}} (Key or WZ) present significantly different compression performances. Moreover, certain scenarios severely limit rate fluctuation. This work proposes a WZVC scheme with low bit-rate fluctuations based on a symmetric coding structure. First, this work investigates {{the performance of a}} generic nonasymmetric distributed source coding structure, showing that the low-density <b>parity-check</b> accumulate <b>channel</b> decoding method is best suited. This is used as a basis to design a symmetric WZVC scheme in which every input video frame is divided into four parallel subframes through subsampling, and then the subframes are encoded by using a symmetric method. Compared with the traditional asymmetric WZVC scheme, the proposed scheme can achieve higher bit-rate stability over time, which is a great advantage to guarantee a reliable transmission in many wireless communication application environments in which bit-rate fluctuations are strongly constrained. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed symmetric WZVC scheme in maintaining a steady bit rate and quality, as well as a quality comparison with the traditional WZVC schem...|$|R

40|$|A capacity-achieving {{sequence}} of degree distributions for the erasure channel is, roughly speaking, a {{sequence of}} degree distributions such that graphs sampled uniformly at random satisfying those degree constraints lead to codes that perform arbitrarily close to {{the capacity of the}} erasure channel when decoded with a simple erasure decoder described in the paper.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a practical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated and lowdensity <b>parity-check</b> (LDPC) <b>channel</b> coded two-way relay system employing physical-layer network coding (PLNC), where two terminals A and B desire to exchange information {{with each other}} {{with the help of}} a relay R which can be equipped with multiple receive antennas. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted as the modulation scheme to resolve the synchronization problem in PLNC and doubly selective channels with intercarrier interference (ICI) are considered. The critical process in such a system is the calculation of the network-coded transmit codeword at the relay on basis of the superimposed channel-coded signals of the two terminals. Different from existing works on non-iterative receiver design, we here consider iterative receiver design. We propose two turbo equalization receivers, one is the conventional iterative separate detection and decoding (I-SDD), and the other one is based on a recently developed estimation scheme for PLNC. Gaussian message passing (GMP) and sum-product algorithm (SPA) are used for ICI-aware equalization and channel decoding respectively. We find through numerical simulations that the performance of the I-SDD receiver can catch up with that of the state-of-the-art PLNC-based receiver when more than one receive antennas are used. One promising feature about the I-SDD receiver is that the channel decoding complexity is much lower than that of the PLNC-based receiver.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} address the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal data rate {{increase}} challenge, {{as well as the}} GNSS signal data availability in urban environments issue, this paper proposes a new designed GNSS signal. Code-Shift Keying (CSK) modulation has been chosen as an alternative to current Binary PhaseShift Keying (BPSK) since it allows increased data rates and non-coherent demodulation. In addition, the new CSK-modulated signal is protected by a Low-Density <b>Parity-Check</b> (LDPC) <b>channel</b> code, as in the latest GNSS designed signal, GPS III L 1 C. Firstly, an asymptotic analysis is done via EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) propagation channel, to show that bitinterleaved iterative decoding for a CSK-modulated signal (consisting in adding a soft feedback between the LDPC decoder and the CSK demodulator) can significantly outperform non-iterative decoding. Based on this analysis, an asymptotic optimization is performed in order to design the optimized LDPC channel code profiles, for a CSK-modulated signal, in an AWGN propagation channel and for iterative decoding. From these results, finite length parity-check matrices have been generated thanks to state of the art algorithms such as the Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm, and simulation results are presented. Finally, in an AWGN context, the current GPS L 1 C subframe 2 (used as a benchmark) demodulation performance is compared to the demodulation performance obtained for CSK-modulated signals with 2 bits and 6 bits per CSK symbol, protected by different optimized LDPC channel codes and iteratively decoded. The results show that a CSK-modulated signal iteratively decoded and implementing the LDPC codes optimized in this work, exhibits a decoding gain of 0. 6 dB for 2 bits per CSK symbol and of 1. 2 dB for 6 bits per CSK symbol with respect to the current GPS L 1 C subframe 2 LDPC code. The study has been made in an AWGN propagation channel as a first step, but results are really promising for urban propagation channels...|$|R
