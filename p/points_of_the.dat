5|$|Iowa {{defeated}} Michigan 24–16 after Michigan {{was unable}} to score a touchdown from the three-yard line {{at the end of}} the game. Iowa scored first with a four-yard touchdown run by Marcus Coker. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown catch by Fitzgerald Toussaint, their only <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half; however, the extra point was botched due to a bad snap. In the second quarter, Iowa's Brad Herman caught a one-yard pass from James Vandenberg for a touchdown. Iowa's Mike Meyer then kicked a 42-yard field goal to add to the Hawkeyes' lead. After halftime, Michigan's Brendan Gibbons scored the only <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd quarter with a 32-yard field goal. Iowa then scored its only <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second half when Marcus Coker scored his second touchdown of the day, this time with a 13-yard rush. Michigan responded with a seven-yard touchdown catch by Kevin Koger.|$|E
