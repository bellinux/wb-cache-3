5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with <b>pleasure</b> <b>boating</b> not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between 1727 and 1757 the Tudor house was {{demolished}} {{and replaced by}} a new house in Georgian style. The house had an L-plan, the main wing facing west standing on the footprint of the Tudor house, with a south wing at right-angles to it. The ground floor of the west wing retained the former vaulted undercroft of the west range of the medieval abbey, and contained the kitchens and areas for the storage of wines and beers. The first floor was the piano nobile, containing the main reception rooms. The west front was symmetrical, in three storeys, with a double flight of stairs {{leading up to the}} main entrance. Clearance of the other surviving remnants of the monastic buildings had started but the moated enclosures were still in existence at that time. A drawing dated 1770 shows that by then all these buildings and the moats had been cleared away, and the former fishponds were being used for <b>pleasure</b> <b>boating.</b> Between 1757 and the early 1770s modifications were made to the house, the main one being the addition of a north wing. According to the authors of the Buildings of England series, the architect responsible for this was James Wyatt. Also between 1757 and 1770, the Brooke family built a walled garden at a distance from the house to provide fruit, vegetables and flowers. The family also developed the woodland around the house, creating pathways, a stream-glade and a rock garden. Brick-built wine bins were added to the undercroft, developing it into a wine cellar, and barrel vaulting was added to the former entrance hall to the abbey (which was known as the outer parlour), obscuring its arcade.|$|E

50|$|A vast lake of 16 {{hectares}} can {{indulge in}} the <b>pleasures</b> of <b>boating</b> in summer, {{thanks to the}} pier located on the south bank. In {{the northern part of}} the lake rise two wooded islands, the Île des Tamaris, accessible only by boat, and the Île du Souvenir on which is erected a memorial in the shape of a quadrilateral. Formerly called Île des Cygnes, it has been converted after plans by the Lyon architect Tony Garnier and the 1904 Prix de Rome sculptor Jean-Baptiste Larrivé to honor soldiers killed in combat. The soldiers' names are engraved on the outer sides of walls. An underground corridor provides access to the island, the staircase that leads literally immersed under the lake.|$|R

50|$|Where the new Santry Demesne {{public park}} is {{situated}} {{was once a}} palatial old house and gardens, built in the 18th century. This was once the largest house in north County Dublin and people travelled from far and wide to be received by the owners, the Barry family. Many clues of the house still exist and the park is worth visiting to find the house foundations, front steps, tree avenue and walled garden. A small bend in the Santry River (which forms the boundary of the park today) was widened to create a small pond for the <b>boating</b> <b>pleasure</b> of Georgian ladies and gentlemen who resided at, and visited, the house.|$|R

He often used a soft impressionistic technique reminiscent of Renoir to convey the tranquil nature of the countryside, {{in sharp contrast to}} the flatter, smoother strokes of his urban paintings. In Oarsman in a Top Hat (1877), he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger in the back of a row boat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet's Boating (1874).|$|E
25|$|Though the old trekvaart {{is closed}} for water traffic today, thanks to these early rail developments, {{it is still}} {{possible}} to travel by boat from Amsterdam to Haarlem, via the ringvaart or the North Sea Canal. <b>Pleasure</b> <b>boating</b> in the summer has become an important Haarlem tourist attraction, though {{it is not possible to}} travel all of the old canals as in Amsterdam. The creation of new land in the Haarlemmermeer from 1852 onwards, meant that the city could no longer refresh the water in its canals using the Spaarne river. The increase in industry made the water quality even worse, and in 1859 the Oude Gracht, a city canal, stank so badly in the summer, that it was filled in to create a new street called the Gedempte Oude Gracht.|$|E
500|$|Harvey's land {{purchase}} in Silver Springs {{coincided with a}} desire by the local postmaster to {{change the name of}} the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Harvey chose the name Monte Ne, which supposedly combined the Spanish and Omaha Indian words for mountain water, [...] because it [...] "fit the tongue attractively". Harvey was familiar with European health spas, and wanted to turn Monte Ne into a [...] "watering hole" [...] in the Ozarks. He first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake. The Creek was then channeled to form what Harvey referred to as [...] "the lagoon". Limestone retaining walls were built {{along the banks of the}} creeks and the lake, and along boardwalks and park areas. Monte Ne quickly became a popular spot for <b>pleasure</b> <b>boating,</b> picnics, and other outdoor activities. Many people noted how clear the water was. The Rogers Democrat said that it looked [...] "like pure alcohol".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{sightings}} of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre {{were reported in}} local newspapers.

[...] Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. [...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how <b>pleasure</b> <b>boating</b> could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years". [...] The Manchester Ship Canal Company also announced a £70 million redevelopment scheme for Pomona Docks in Salford, to include a marina, homes, offices and other commercial developments.|$|E
