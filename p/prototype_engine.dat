5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's storage unit, thawing his remains. Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the <b>prototype</b> <b>engine</b> to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
500|$|During the {{transition}} from Versus XIII to XV and the optimization of Luminous Studio for game development, the team created a conceptual environment using a <b>prototype</b> <b>engine</b> environment called [...] "Ebony". After the initial reveal, the team ran into difficulties with the new hardware, prompting them to contact HexaDrive due to their experience with high-spec gaming hardware. To solve the issues faced by XV, the team used a similar development approach to Ubisoft: they created an approximate game system that they could build on and edit in real-time. Graphics and animation were developed first, followed by a cinematics editor and a system to manage events during transitions between cutscenes and gameplay. This latter element was what allowed the developers to create {{what would become the}} game's final version. To help maximize the realism of the characters, their hair was first created by a hairstylist using a mannequin's wig, then rendered into the game using the technology of Luminous Studio. The same technique was used for Agni's Philosophy, the engine's 2012 demo. Character movements were created using motion capture technology: the animators' movements were first captured while they wore special suits, then their actions were adjusted in the team's computer to perfect them and make minor additions like finger movements. These actions were then implemented in the game environment for the intended characters.|$|E

2500|$|The Goshawk was {{developed}} from the Kestrel IV <b>prototype</b> <b>engine,</b> to use evaporative (also known as [...] "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the cooling liquid below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less coolant is needed. However, instead of a radiator to take {{the heat from the}} coolant, a condensor was required to turn the vapour back to liquid. This had to be much larger than a radiator and added drag to the aircraft design.|$|E
2500|$|It was a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{based on}} the earlier Moth biplanes with a stressed plywood covering and the cockpit designed around its test pilot, Hubert Broad, {{to make it as}} streamlined as possible: this resulted in the fuselage sides being sloped outwards to accommodate his shoulders. The Tiger Moth had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail skid. The first aircraft built (registration G-EBQU) first flew from Stag Lane Aerodrome on 24 June 1927 and was fitted with a [...] ADC Cirrus II engine to check its handling characteristics. This was then replaced with Major Halford's <b>prototype</b> <b>engine,</b> by then named the Gipsy. The second example, G-EBRV, was fitted with a Cirrus engine and first flew on 28 July 1927.|$|E
