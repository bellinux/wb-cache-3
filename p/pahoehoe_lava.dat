25|$|The Cardenas Basalt is {{composed}} mainly of thin discontinuous beds of <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>lava</b> flows of olivine-rich basalt. The {{lower part of}} this formation consists of complexly interbedded, thin, and discontinuous beds of basalt, hyaloclastite, and sandstone that form low, talus-covered slopes. The upper unit of the Cardenas Basalt consists of cliff-forming basaltic and andesitic lava flows that are interbedded with beds of breccia, sandstone, and lapillite. No fossils {{have been found in}} the Cardenas Basalt. The Cardenas Basalt was formed by the subaerial eruption of basaltic and andesitic magma in wet coastal environments such as river deltas or tidal flats. Angular unconformities of vastly differing magnitudes separate the Cardenas Basalt from the overlying Nankoweap Formation and Tonto Group.|$|E
500|$|Flows from Hawaiian eruptions are basaltic, and can {{be divided}} into two types by their {{structural}} characteristics. <b>Pahoehoe</b> <b>lava</b> is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be billowy or ropey. They can move as one sheet, by the advancement of [...] "toes," [...] or as a snaking lava column. A'a lava flows are denser and more viscous than pahoehoe, and tend to move slower. Flows can measure [...] thick. A'a flows are so thick that the outside layers cools into a rubble-like mass, insulating the still-hot interior and preventing it from cooling. A'a lava moves in a peculiar way—the front of the flow steepens due to pressure from behind until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. <b>Pahoehoe</b> <b>lava</b> can sometimes become A'a lava due to increasing viscosity or increasing rate of shear, but A'a lava never turns into pahoehoe flow.|$|E
2500|$|A pāhoehoe flow {{typically}} advances as {{a series}} of small lobes and toes that continually break out from a cooled crust. It also forms lava tubes where the minimal heat loss maintains low viscosity. The surface texture of pāhoehoe flows varies widely, displaying all kinds of bizarre shapes often referred to as lava sculpture. With increasing distance from the source, pāhoehoe flows may change into aā flows in response to heat loss and consequent increase in viscosity. <b>Pahoehoe</b> <b>lavas</b> typically have a temperature of [...]|$|R
40|$|The {{solidified}} {{surface of}} a lava flow reflects the viscosity of its molten fraction and the crystal content during flow; crystal-poor basaltic <b>lavas</b> produce <b>pahoehoe</b> fields, whereas crystal-rich ones solidify with aa carapaces. At Mount Etna, volcano aa morphologies are very common, whereas <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>lavas</b> are rare. The latter are locally named “cicirara” due {{to the presence of}} centimeter-sized plagioclase phenocrysts much more abundant than in aa lavas. The phenocryst content of “cicirara” lavas contrasts with the low viscosity generally associated with pahoehoe morphology. Therefore, to reconcile the discrepancy between textural and volcanic observations, we have studied the most primitive <b>pahoehoe</b> “cicirara” <b>lava</b> sampled until now. Two samples at 0. 5 and 1 m {{from the bottom of the}} 2 - m thick lava flow were investigated on the basis of their mineral compositional variations and textural features, i. e., size frequency and crystal size distribution (CSD). Results coupled with rheological models indicate that only large phenocrysts of plagioclase (> 1 mm) and clinopyroxene have grown before eruption. Thermobarometric models and petrological computations based on the composition of plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst cores highlight that only a small amount (10 – 15 vol. %) of crystals equilibrated at 12 km of depth. Cumulative size frequency and CSD data also indicate that plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocryst rims grew heterogeneously and coalesced around their cores at depths < 1 km, before eruption. In this view, the “cicirara” lava was erupted with a low crystalline content that favoured the formation of its pahoehoe surface; however, crystals with a size < 1 mm (~ 75 vol. %) solidified at post-eruptive conditions. Our findings underline that the emplacement of high-viscosity aa or low-viscosity <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>lavas</b> is driven by the degree of undercooling imposed by the volatile exsolution rate in the shallowest portion of the Etnean plumbing system. A slow magma ascent rate promotes significant intratelluric degassing and widespread nucleation; consequently, the viscosity of the suspension significantly increases leading to an aa morphology. In contrast, <b>pahoehoe</b> “cicirara” <b>lavas</b> are associated with a rapid rise to the surface of poorly degassed, undercooled magmas...|$|R

2500|$|In their {{detailed}} study and {{summary of the}} Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases {{to the construction of}} Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into it flanks. First, they recognized a fissure eruption phase of Plinian-subPlinian fissure eruptions that deposited more than [...] of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic lava flows. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest–south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a cone-building phase began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to [...] thick and pyroclastic flows of andesite and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a climatic phase, copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a flank eruption phase during which a major north–south-trending fault offset the two cones developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Doğubeyazıt plain and along the southerly flowing Sarısu River. These lava flows formed black ʻaʻā and <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>lava</b> flows that contain well preserved lava tubes. The radiometric dating of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma. Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.|$|E

40|$|Lava flows can be {{considered}} as hot viscous cores within thinner, solidified crusts. Interaction between crust and core determines a flow's morphological and dynamical evolution. When the lava core dominates, flow advance approaches a steady state. When crusts are the limiting factor, advance is more irregular. These two conditions can be distinguished by a timescale ratio comparing rates of core deformation and crustal formation. Aa and budding <b>pahoehoe</b> <b>lavas</b> are used as examples of core- and crustal-dominated flows, respectively. A simple model describes the transition between pahoehoe and aa flow in terms of lava discharge rate, underlying slope, and either the thickness or velocity of the flow front.

40|$|Observations in the USA, Iceland and Tenerife, Canary Islands {{reveal how}} {{processes}} occurring during basaltic eruptions {{can result in}} complex physical and stratigraphic relationships between lava and proximal tephra fall deposits around vents. Observations illustrate how basaltic lavas can disrupt, dissect (spatially and temporally) and alter sheet-form fall deposits. Complexity arises through synchronous and alternating effusive and explosive activity that results in intercalated lavas and tephra deposits. Tephra deposits can become disrupted into mounds and ridges by lateral and vertical displacement caused by movement (including inflation) of underlying <b>pāhoehoe</b> <b>lavas</b> and clastogenic lavas. Mounds of tephra can be rafted away over distances of 100 s to 1, 000 s m from proximal pyroclastic constructs on top of lava flows. Draping of irregular topography by fall deposits and subsequent partial burial of topographic depressions by later lavas can result in apparent complexity of tephra layers. These processes, deduced from field relationships, have resulted in considerable stratigraphic complexity in the studied proximal regions where fallout was synchronous or alternated with inflation of subjacent lava sheets. These mechanisms may lead to diachronous contact relationships between fall deposits and lava flows. Such complexities may remain cryptic due to textural and geochemical quasi-homogeneity within sequences of interbedded basaltic fall deposits and lavas. The net effect of these processes may be to reduce the usefulness of data collected from proximal fall deposits for reconstructing basaltic eruption dynamics...|$|R
