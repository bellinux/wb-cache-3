5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} six to seven riders from this Giro had <b>presumptive</b> positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the <b>presumptive</b> positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive have not yet been revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have <b>presumptive</b> positives.|$|E
5|$|As {{the eldest}} child of king Alfonso and Eleanor, {{she was the}} heiress <b>presumptive</b> of the throne of Castile for several years, because many of her {{siblings}} who were born after her died shortly after birth or in early infancy, so Berengaria became a greatly desired partner throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|By June 5, 2016, she {{had earned}} enough pledged delegates and {{supportive}} superdelegates {{for the media}} to consider her the <b>presumptive</b> nominee. On June 7, after winning most of {{the states in the}} final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of <b>presumptive</b> nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.|$|E
5|$|Following U.S. Democratic <b>presumptive</b> {{presidential nominee}} Barack Obama's {{selection}} of Biden, the Senator's vice-presidential general election campaign began. During the campaign, {{he used his}} political experience to complement Obama, and debated Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Biden was elected Vice President on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009.|$|E
5|$|For much of Ernest's reign, {{the heir}} <b>presumptive</b> to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha {{was his only}} sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became {{increasingly}} more clear that Ernest would be childless, {{the possibility of a}} personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother's second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest's heir <b>presumptive</b> on 14 December 1861, when his older brother the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII of the United Kingdom) renounced his succession rights.|$|E
5|$|Michael was heir <b>presumptive</b> until 12 August 1904, {{when the}} birth of Tsarevich Alexei to Nicholas and Alexandra {{provided}} an heir apparent. Michael again became second-in-line to the throne, but was named as co-regent for the boy, along with Alexandra, {{in the event of}} Nicholas's death.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1777, Maximilian Joseph, {{the last}} of the junior line of Wittelsbach, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's heir <b>presumptive.</b> Across Bavaria's southern border, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of the heir <b>presumptive,</b> Charles August.|$|E
5|$|The 28 June 1914, {{assassination}} of Austro-Hungarian heir <b>presumptive</b> Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria-Hungary's {{declaration of war}} against Serbia.

5|$|When the Phillies traded Rollins to the Los Angeles Dodgers {{prior to}} the 2015 season, media reports speculated that Galvis and César Hernández were the <b>presumptive</b> nominees to start at shortstop for the {{upcoming}} season, likely seeking {{to bridge the gap}} between Rollins and J.P. Crawford, the top prospect in the Phillies' organization.|$|E
5|$|After having {{consulted}} for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Gingrich encouraged {{his fellow}} Republicans to unify behind Trump, who had by then become the <b>presumptive</b> Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich reportedly figured among Trump's final three choices {{to be his}} running mate; the position ultimately went to Mike Pence, a politician known {{for his role as}} Governor of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Aimery of Lusignan died on 1 April 1205 and a {{few months}} later, his widow (Alice's mother), Isabella I, also died. Isabella I's fourteen-year-old {{daughter}} from her second marriage to Conrad of Montferrat, Maria, ascended the throne with Isabella I's half-brother, John of Ibelin, acting as regent. As the new queen's eldest half-sister, Alice became heir <b>presumptive.</b> She was placed under the guardianship of her maternal grandmother, Maria Komnene, according to historian Bernard Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his birth, his {{paternal}} grandfather Alexander II was still the reigning Emperor of All the Russias. Michael was fourth-in-line to the throne after his father and elder brothers Nicholas and George. After the assassination of his grandfather in 1881, he became third-in-line and, in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, second-in-line. George died in 1899, leaving Michael as heir <b>presumptive.</b>|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{veterans}} who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, {{and who can}} medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems {{on the list of}} <b>presumptive</b> diseases, may receive compensation from the VA. Certain {{veterans who}} served in Korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.|$|E
5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a summons by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy. Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that this union would create a long-lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his <b>presumptive</b> heir.|$|E
5|$|Local Republican Party leaders invited Garfield {{to enter}} {{politics}} upon {{the death of}} Cyrus Prentiss, the <b>presumptive</b> nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot, and was elected, serving until 1861. Garfield's major effort {{in the state senate}} was a bill providing for Ohio's first geological survey to measure its mineral resources, though it failed.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, McCain won {{both the}} {{majority}} of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries, giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination.

5|$|Princess Victoria of Kent is the heiress <b>presumptive</b> to {{the throne}} during {{the last years of}} the reign of her uncle King William IV and is subject to a {{political}} tug of war for influence over her. On the one side is her mother, the Duchess of Kent, along with the comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a regency and giving him and her mother power.|$|E
5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law women were {{excluded}} from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King of Hanover. He was her heir <b>presumptive</b> until she married and had a child.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. Her brother-in-law Stephen was heir <b>presumptive</b> {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as heir <b>presumptive</b> and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly took a different course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education of her daughters, a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E
5|$|The untangling of his {{accounts}} {{dragged on}} until 1819, prolonged by his enemies at the Navy Office {{and his own}} fiscal incapacity. At length a balance of £220,000 was found against him, but by this time his career was hopelessly ruined. He left office as a groom of the bedchamber in 1815, but retained his vice-admiralty sinecures until his death. In 1824, he became heir <b>presumptive</b> to the Earldom of Clarendon but died in 1827 without inheriting it.|$|E
5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated {{that she was not}} running for the presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits as a strong potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing <b>presumptive</b> nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states had voted.|$|E
5|$|After Harrison led Indiana's Republican {{delegation}} at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he {{was considered}} the state's <b>presumptive</b> candidate for the U.S. Senate. He gave speeches in favor of Garfield in Indiana and New York, further raising his profile in the party. However, when the Republicans retook {{the majority in the}} state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate was threatened by Judge Walter Q. Gresham, his intra-party rival, but Harrison was ultimately chosen. After Garfield's election as president in 1880, his administration offered Harrison a cabinet position, but Harrison declined in favor of continuing his service in the US. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{of royal}} blood, his family was {{relatively}} obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards. In 1852, however, George's father was designated the heir <b>presumptive</b> to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark, and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark. George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King of Denmark), Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, James, was thus heir <b>presumptive</b> to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} at Greenwich Palace and was named after both her grandmothers, Elizabeth of York and Elizabeth Howard. She was the second child of Henry VIII of England born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn. At birth, Elizabeth was the heir <b>presumptive</b> to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, Mary, had lost her {{position}} as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, Catherine of Aragon, to marry Anne, {{with the intent to}} sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession. She was baptised on 10 September; Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, the Marquess of Exeter, the Duchess of Norfolk and the Dowager Marchioness of Dorset stood as her godparents.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} in London as the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and she was educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir <b>presumptive.</b> She began to {{undertake}} public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} <b>presumptive</b> {{official}} position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the Battle of Shiloh. On April 7, Johnson was severely {{wounded in the}} thigh and abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir <b>presumptive</b> was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, she {{attended}} the national funeral service for Gerald Ford in the Washington National Cathedral. Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, she sat in the front row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the <b>presumptive</b> Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, {{hoping he}} could claim the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir <b>presumptive,</b> Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the <b>presumptive</b> heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its territorial integrity.|$|E
5|$|Maria Theresa {{replaced}} Maria Josepha as heir <b>presumptive</b> to the Habsburg realms {{the moment}} she was born; Charles VI had issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which had placed his nieces behind his own daughters {{in the line of}} succession. Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the Treaty of Vienna (1731), Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the Ostend Company in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction. In total, Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, United Provinces, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Savoy-Sardinia, Bavaria and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.|$|E
5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir <b>presumptive</b> to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that {{to do so would}} invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.|$|E
5|$|Peace was {{restored}} with {{the mediation of}} Henry I of Jerusalem, who persuaded both Leo and Bohemond to renounce their claims to suzerainty over each other. Leo's occupation of Bagras was confirmed. Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, married Leo's niece and heir <b>presumptive,</b> Alice. Raymond died in early 1197, but his widow {{give birth to a}} posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. The almost sixty-year-old BohemondIII sent Alice and her son to Armenia, showing {{that he did not want}} to acknowledge his infant grandson's right to succeed him in Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Princess Andrew {{returned}} to Great Britain in April 1947 {{to attend the}} November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir <b>presumptive</b> of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On {{the day of the}} wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI. For the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her family {{on the north side of}} Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary. It was decided not to invite Princess Andrew's daughters to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a <b>presumptive</b> diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
