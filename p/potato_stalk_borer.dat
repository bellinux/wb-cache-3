40|$|<b>Stalk</b> <b>borer</b> eggs have hatched {{and many}} larvae {{are now in}} brome or other grasses {{bordering}} corn. Some <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> already may be in corn because they hatched from eggs that were laid on grass or giant ragweed {{out in the field}} last fall, or they moved directly into border row corn instead of the grass when they hatched. Most <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> that hatch in grass stay there until they grow to a size that is too big for the grass stem. Then they migrate in search of larger diameter plants, which often is corn. As of May 31, there were two reports of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> migration in southwest Iowa.

In the past, the common <b>stalk</b> <b>borer,</b> Papaipema nebris, {{has not been a}} major pest of corn in Nebraska. <b>Stalk</b> <b>borer</b> damage in corn commonly is confined to occasional plants in the first few rows near field margins, fence rows, grass terraces and waterways. In addition to attacking corn, this insect attacks over one hundred other species of plants, including ornamentals, broadleaf weeds and grasses.

40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} food crop and {{source of income}} for {{majority}} of the Kenyan population and many sub-Saharan African countries. The increasing Kenyan population demands an increase in maize production if intermittent food deficits have to be averted. Since the introduction of improved maize varieties in mid- 1960, the start of Green Revolution period, maize yields increased drastically up to 1970 s and started declining from 1980 s to-date. The key contributory factors are nutrient mining, sub-optimal input use and insect pest damage. Of the insect pests, <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> is of economic importance. Currently, KARI and CIMMYT are developing maize varieties that are tolerant to <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> damage. In order to evaluate the potential impact of these interventions economics of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control at farm level was evaluated. Surveys complemented with on-farm trials were executed in six major maize growing zones of Kenya. Farmers were randomly selected and a sample-frame established after which a total of 1854 households were randomly selected using random sampling technique. Each household was interviewed using structured questionnaire. Data on method of <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> control and the type insecticides used was collected. Partial budget and economic surplus models were used. The results indicated that very few farmers control <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> in maize despite significant <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> losses of about 15 %. Therefore if Bt maize is introduced in Kenya it is likely to reduce these losses. This will benefit many hungry and poor Kenyans with improved household food supply and on farm incomes, in line with Government policy of food security and poverty eradication.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> (Papaipema nebris (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)) injury, imposed at corn-leaf stages 1 through 7, on visible injury, stalk elongation, and grain yield were {{evaluated}} in a three-year study. Tunneling by <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> in seven-leaf corn {{was confined to}} the lower nine internodes. A fifth-instar <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> that survives to pupation {{would be expected to}} produce a tunnel 15. 8 cm long. Although tunneling shortens internodes at and above the tunnel, yield loss varied by year. A six-class scale was developed to evaluate injury. The average injury rating for a plot declined 0. 332 ± 0. 033 points per leaf stage. In years of adequate rainfall, yields declined linearly as plants were attacked later in development. Injury profiles were developed to describe feeding injury. Plot yield losses seem to be moderated by the ability of uninfested or slightly injured plants to compensate for severe <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> injury. Regression models were developed to predict plot yield and individual plant yield. Models for individual plant yield were combined with injury profiles to predict grain yield as a function of percentage of plants injured and corn development stage. Economic injury levels and economic thresholds were determined and a management program was presented. In a second study, degree-day models were used to time insecticide applications (permethrin) to egg hatch and larval movement. Although applications at egg hatch significantly reduced <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> density in grass terraces by 54 - 85 %, applications timed with movement were more effective in reducing severe damage to corn. Finally, a management model, SBMGMT, was developed to simulate the stalk borer/corn agroecosystem.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesWhite maize is {{the staple}} food of the {{majority}} of the South African population. We examine if smallholder farmers that adopted insect-resistant (Bt) varieties of white maize benefited from planting Bt over the last three seasons. Commercial farmers are known to benefit from planting Bt maize in high <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> or corn borer infestation years, but when planted in locations or years when <b>stalk</b> <b>borers</b> are not a problem, Bt will usually not be profitable because of higher seed costs. In the first two production seasons, small farmers enjoyed higher yields with Bt maize than with conventional hybrid varieties despite lower-than-normal (yet still significant) <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> pressure and less-than-ideal maize production conditions. Yield is expressed according to grain per kilogram of seed planted, as seeding rates per land area differ drastically between small-scale farmers. The value of the yield benefit depended on how the farmer utilized the additional grain, with the highest valued use being home grinding and consumption substituting for more expensive store purchases. In the third season, which was also the fourth consecutive drier-than-usual season, the <b>stalk</b> <b>borer</b> infestation level was very low, and farmers who planted Bt maize had yields similar to farmers who planted conventional hybrids...|$|R

40|$|Maize {{contributes}} substantially to {{food security}} in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is a staple food {{to many of the}} province’s rural and urban inhabitants. Insect pests are one of the factors that hamper its productivity and as a result, deprive farmers of good yields. The adverse effects of insecticides and the high cost associated with them and the cost of transgenic seeds are some of the challenges faced by small-scale farmers in rural areas. Alternative control methods which include the use of indigenous techniques to control pests are now sought. A study to identify and document ethnobiological means used by rural farmers to manage insect pests of maize was conducted in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape Province. A total of 217 participants were interviewed on the matter, using semi-structured but detailed questionnaires. Rural farmers due to their linkage to agriculture activities {{and the fact that they}} are considered as custodians of agricultural indigenous knowledge were selected as respondents. Only maize producing and IsiXhosa speaking people were chosen to contribute. Main focus was on the demography of respondents, crop production activities and insect pest control. Pretesting of the questionnaire in order to assess the appropriateness of questions and comprehension by both farmers and enumerators was done. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Fifty five percent (55 %) of the respondents were females and the highest number of participants was from the Chris Hani District Municipality. Majority of the people were unemployed or pensioners. Most had only attended primary school and the mean age was 59 years. Apart from maize, respondents were cultivating other crops such as cabbage, Swiss chard, <b>potatoes</b> etc. <b>Stalk</b> <b>borers</b> followed by cutworms were the main pests of maize in these areas. Respondents used mainly insecticides, followed by alternative substances, which also included cultural control methods such as planting date manipulation. Few respondents used plants as control agents for insect pests. Some people did not control pests even though they were a problem in their fields. The most used plant was Chenopodium ambrosiodes L, while the most used substance was Madubula (a detergent). The most used insecticide was carbaryl from the carbamite family. Respondents listed different preparation techniques for all the control methods mentioned. These techniques revealed different times of preparation, quantities of ingredients, amounts applied on plants, modes of application and intervals of application. Rural farmers in the study areas used different atypical methods which may play a significant role in pest management today. Some of the products may have a positive influence on agriculture, while some are dangerous to humans and environmental health. Further research which will investigate their potential use in pest control needs to be done...|$|R
