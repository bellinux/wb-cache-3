40|$|The outer circle {{varieties}} of English in Fiji, Samoa and the Cook Island show similarities {{as well as}} differences, among other things due to the Melanesian and Polynesian substrate influence. Another possible source for the unity and diversity of the South <b>Pacific</b> <b>Englishes</b> {{is the fact that}} - due to geographical, political and economic reasons - New Zealand English and Australian English may in some of the islands supersede the former prestigious American and British varieties {{as a model for the}} national standard. To discuss the unity and diversity of the new Englishes in the South Pacific, the focus of this paper will be on aspects of subject-verb agreement. In Fiji English the verb is often used in singular even if the subject is plural (Mugler & Tent 2004 : 782). This may also be of some relevance for the usage of collective nouns, where normally both singular and plural concord marking on verbs is available. The paper will discuss whether preference of singular verb with plural subject or a particular usage of collective nouns is a common trait of all three varieties in question and whetherthe local substrate languages and/or New Zealand English as a model for the national standard have some influence. Data will be provided by a corpus of newspaper articles downloaded from the internet from newspapers representing the three different outer circle varieties. For Fiji English the press section of the ICE-Fiji will also be included. The paper discusses the results as a step towards a general description of the 'South Pacific Englishes' and also considers the suitability of the WWW as a source for such a case-study...|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Shift is a chain {{shift of}} vowel sounds found {{primarily}} in Canadian English, but also possibly {{in some other}} dialects (for example, younger <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>English).</b> It was first described by Clarke, Elms and Youssef in 1995, based on impressionistic analysis.

50|$|Like {{many former}} colonies of Great Britain, {{there are certain}} 'situational varieties' of English present. There is the very formal, 'Proper' English (which would {{resemble}} formal English in Australia or the United Kingdom) as it is known, {{which is to be}} used in government and any other situation deemed formal enough for its use, but it has fallen out of favor due to the popularity of the more laid back varieties and is still spoken only by the older generation that lived through the colonial days. A sort of mid-level English is used in school, church, work and in semi-formal situations and is basically English with localized grammatical innovations and words imported from Hindi and Fijian; it is quickly becoming 'formal English' in Fiji. Last is the very informal Fiji English, or Finglish, which is used among all races with family, friends and often nowadays, in general conversations and in any other situation not deemed formal. Fiji English has been tentatively studied by linguists and has been suggested as a separate dialect from Standard English (as has developed in Australia and New Zealand) but the distinction is not made locally or in the constitution. Moreover, other linguists suggest {{it is part of a}} greater South <b>Pacific</b> <b>English</b> dialect because of the shared development of English within former British colonies and protectorates in the South Pacific....|$|R

50|$|A {{generalized}} Midland speech continues westward until {{becoming a}} somewhat internally diverse Western American English that unites the entire western {{half of the}} country. This Western dialect is mostly unified by a firm cot-caught merger and a conservatively backed pronunciation of the long oh sound in goat, toe, show, etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long oo sound in goose, lose, tune, etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>English</b> and California English, with the Chicano English accent also being a sub-type primarily of the Western accent. In the immediate San Francisco area, some older speakers {{do not have the}} normal Western cot-caught merger.|$|R

50|$|Western American English (also {{known as}} Western U.S. English {{or in the}} U.S., simply, Western) is a variety of American English that largely unites the entire western half of the United States as a single dialect region, {{including}} the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. It also generally encompasses Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, some of whose speakers are classified additionally under <b>Pacific</b> Northwest <b>English.</b> The West was the last area in the United States to be reached during the gradual westward expansion of English-speaking settlement and its history shows considerable mixing of the linguistic patterns of other regions. As the settlement populations are relatively young when compared with other regions, the American West is a dialect region in formation.|$|R
40|$|Sociolinguistic {{research}} that acknowledges {{the importance of}} viewing language as a human problem attempts to reconcile the facts of linguistic variation with those of social identity and inequality (Hymes, 1973). To date, this question has not been of primary concern to creolists, partly because of their deeper interest in language universals and the linguistic nature of pidginization and creolization. Neglect of sociolinguistic phenomena in creole communities has also resulted from the relative independence of pidgin/creole studies and the sociolinguistic and social psychological study of language attitudes in multiethnic settings (e. g., Milroy, 1982; Ryan and Giles [eds. ], 1982). However, recent research (by, e. g., Le Page, 1980; Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985; Rickford 1985) has bridged these areas through systematic study {{of the relationship between}} linguistic variation in creoletypically, decreolizing-communities and the social evaluation of language by different groups of speakers in these communities. In this paper I present a case study of Hawai'i which examines this relationship in a <b>Pacific</b> <b>English</b> creole continuum and, more specifically, calls attention to its dynamic nature. I begin with a historical sketch (for fuller accounts, see Bickerton and Odo, 1976; Carr, 1972; Day, 1987; Reinecke 1935 / 1969; Sato, 1985) and a description of sociolinguistic variation in Hawai'i. I then review recent public controversies surrounding the role of Hawai'i Creole English (HCE) which have revealed competing sociolinguistic trends in the Islands: (1) a continued adherence to stereotypical attitudes toward Hawai'i Creole English (HCE) and standard (US mainland) English (SE) by some segments of the community, and (2) a growing militancy in other segments of the community concerning the legitimacy of HCE use in institutional contexts. Finally, I tum {{to the question of how}} these trends may influence linguistic variation and the course of sociolinguistic change in Hawai'i's post-creole continuum...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore the {{distribution}} and use of Chinook Jargon (CJ) lexicalitems in the Pacific Northwest.

Content analysis of the collected data {{in reference to the}} most frequently encountered CJ term (skookum) revealed that current usage fell primarily into three broad categories: commercial, geographic, and daily use.
