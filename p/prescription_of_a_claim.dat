40|$|Introduction: The {{isolation}} of multi-drug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) pathogens has progressively increased worldwide {{and has been}} associated with important delays in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased mortality rates. Patient’s stratification for MDRGN infections to optimize the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate empiric antimicrobial regimen is crucial. Areas covered: This article covers MDRGN epidemiology, with a specific focus on risk factors for harbouring infections sustained by extended-spectrum-Beta-lactamase (ESBL), carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriacae (CRE), MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MDR Acinetobacter baumanii. Moreover, we will propose an algorithm for the choice of empiric treatment when a MDRGN infection is suspected. Expert commentary: Although in clinical practice, a patient’s stratification represents a challenge, whenever a MDRGN pathogen is suspected broad-spectrum, combination empiric treatment should be promptly started, looking for a balance between the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate empiric treatment and the risk of resistance selection...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Depression is {{a common}} {{disorder}} with <b>a</b> high chance <b>of</b> recurrence. To prevent recurrence {{it is possible to}} prescribe a maintenance treatment with antidepressants to the patients who have a depression in remission. Multiple guidelines do not give clear guidelines regarding the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> maintenance treatment to these patients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the influence of the characteristics of the general practitioner on the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maintenance treatment to patients who have a depression in remission. Methods: For this study we used the data of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We selected <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> patients who were recruited from general practices. General practitioners and patients filled in a questionnaire. Patients repeated the questionnaire after 2 and 4 years. By using MLwiN, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression tests were performed. The analyses were performed at the three different moments of measurement and longitudinal. Variables with a p-value < 0. 20 at the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. Results: The bivariate analysis gives just one significant value (p< 0. 05) at the baseline measurement, namely the UBOS dimension competence. This means that there are more <b>prescriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maintenance treatment when the general practitioner feels competent in his work. There were more variables with a p-value < 0. 20 in the bivariate analysis. The multivariate analysis does not give other significant values. Conclusion: The study shows no clear explanatory characteristics of general practitioners in the <b>prescription</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maintenance therapy with antidepressants to patients who have a depression in remission. It is possible that the degree of feeling competent in work is the only explanatory factor. ...|$|R
