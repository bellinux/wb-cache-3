5|$|For example, {{in early}} 2008, the postal code G0N 3M0 (covering Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier, Fossambault-sur-le-Lac and Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec) was {{urbanized}} to postal codes beginning with G3N to remove ambiguities and confusions caused by similar street names. Unique among province-wide districts, New Brunswick (<b>postal</b> <b>district</b> E) is completely urbanized, its rural codes having been phased out.|$|E

5|$|When complete, the Monadnock was {{the largest}} office {{building}} in the world, with 1,200 rooms and an occupancy of over 6,000. The Chicago Daily Tribune commented that the population of most Illinois towns in 1896 would fit comfortably in the building. It was a <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> unto itself, with four full-time carriers delivering mail six times a day, six days a week. It was the first building in Chicago wired for electricity, {{and one of the}} first to be fire-proofed, with hollow fire clay tiles lining the structure so that the metal frame would be protected even if the facing brick were to be destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Before postal codes as {{described}} here were used, large cities were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually numbered from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with London <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> numbers, for example. Ireland still uses <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> numbers in Dublin. In New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch were divided into postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and have now become redundant {{as a result of}} a new postcode system being introduced.|$|E

50|$|Historically, these subdivisions {{have been}} based on <b>postal</b> <b>districts,</b> {{especially}} during the colonial era. When local elections necessitated the setting up of electoral districts, however, it began to supplement <b>postal</b> <b>districts</b> as an alternative form of local governance, since each electoral district is headed by a member of parliament who represents and speaks for the respective electorates.|$|R
25|$|While it {{was absorbed}} into the larger {{suburban}} area of Dublin (including becoming the <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> Dublin 24 in the 1980s), Tallaght has developed a distinctive identity, arising largely from its rapid growth during recent decades, and now has a thriving local arts, cultural, sports, and economic outlook.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, {{the area}} was {{subdivided}} as the Mt Flora Estates, but initial development was largely limited to holiday shacks. After World War II, the area developed rapidly, and in 1954, the <b>Postal</b> <b>District</b> of Watermans Bay was approved. By 1961, {{nearly all of the}} existing suburb had been built and settled.|$|E
25|$|At the {{watering}} place of Kingstown, Trollope met Rose Heseltine, {{the daughter of}} a Rotherham bank manager. They became engaged when he had been in Ireland for a year; because of Trollope's debts and her lack of a fortune, they were unable to marry until 1844. Soon after their marriage, Trollope transferred to another <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> in the south of Ireland, and the family moved to Clonmel.|$|E

50|$|Postcodes were {{introduced}} in the Isle of Man in 1993, with the island becoming the IM postcode area.

25|$|Neither Upper Clapton nor {{the wider}} Clapton area {{have ever been}} an {{administrative}} unit and consequently their extent has never been formally determined.

25|$|The boho look, which owed {{much to the}} hippie {{styles that}} {{developed}} in the middle to late 1960s, became especially popular after Sienna Miller's appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2004, although some of its features were apparent from photographs of her taken in October 2003 and of others living in or around the <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> of W10 (North Kensington), an area of London associated with bohemian culture since the mid-1950s.|$|E
25|$|From 1894 Walthamstow was {{an urban}} {{district}} and from 1929 a municipal borough in Essex. In 1931 {{the population of}} the borough, covering an area of , peaked at 132,972. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area merged with that of the Municipal Borough of Chingford and the Municipal Borough of Leyton to form the London Borough of Waltham Forest in Greater London. Other places in east London formerly of the county of Essex, such as Ilford and Romford were placed into London Boroughs along with Walthamstow. None of the <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> names or codes was changed at this time (e.g. Ilford remained Ilford, Essex, and Walthamstow remained London E17).|$|E

25|$|Major changes {{occurred}} in the 1960s and 1970s. The main access to the area from Perth was via Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Beach Road, a road which roughly corresponded to Karrinyup Road but included modern-day North Beach Drive and Osborne Place. Hertha Road (now Civic Place and Telford Crescent) was the main road in the area, and {{the site of the}} present-day footbridge was the municipal rubbish tip until the early 1970s. The Osborne Park hospital was opened on 4 April 1962 and the civic centre and council chambers were opened in 1966, along with houses in the George Street area near the civic centre. The <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> was approved and gazetted in April 1976, and over the next eight years, most of the suburb was subdivided and built.|$|E
500|$|Owing to Quebec's and Ontario's large populations, {{those two}} provinces are sub-divided into three and five postal districts respectively, {{and each has}} at least one urban area so populous that it has a {{dedicated}} <b>postal</b> <b>district</b> ("H" [...] for the Montréal region, and [...] "M" [...] for Toronto). On the other hand, the low populations in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories (NWT) mean that even after Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories and became its own territory in 1999, they continue to share a <b>postal</b> <b>district.</b>|$|E
500|$|Middlesex (abbreviated Middx) was {{a former}} postal county. This was an element of postal {{addressing}} in routine use until 1996, intended to avoid confusion between post towns, and no longer required for the routing of the mail.

Addresses in this area included [...] "LONDON" [...] but did not include a county. In 1965 Royal Mail retained the postal county because it would have been too costly to amend addresses throughout Greater London.
