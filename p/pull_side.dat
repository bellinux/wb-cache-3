The {{study has been}} conducted by taking landless (group I) and landed (group II) respondents. The Garatte ranking {{of the causes of}} migration has revealed that of the ten push factors and ten pull factors (both economic and non-economic), lack of continuous employment at place of origin is at the first rank with mean score of 77 and 78 per cent for group I and group II, respectively, followed by low wages at place of origin and economic condition of the family. On the <b>pull</b> <b>side</b> also, economic reasons, viz. availability of job at destination has achieved the first rank with mean score of 75 for group I and 74 for group II, followed by hope of getting a job and higher wages. In the case of non-economic reasons, surplus labour availability at places of origin has received maximum scoring on the push side and skill development on the <b>pull</b> <b>side.</b> The study has concluded that though both economic and non-economic reasons are responsible for migration of agricultural labourers, economic reasons are stronger. Not only that, push forces of migration have been identified more strong than pull forces in catalyzing migration. The study has given some policy implications also for consideration of policymakers in Indian agriculture.

40|$|Background: Undercarboxylated Osteocalcin (ucOC) may {{contribute}} to the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Undercarboxylated osteocalcin is special protein secreted by bone as an endocrine regulation of energy metabolism and glucose. It {{plays an important role in}} insulin secretion and sensitivity. The aim of this study was to survey the effect of eight weeks resistance training on serum levels of ucOC, adiponectin and insulin sensitivity in obese women. Methods: This quasi-experimental study performed on twenty obese women (BMI> 30) in Amol City Sport clubs, Iran, in May 2014. Samples randomly divided into two groups: a control group and an experimental group.  The experimental group consisted of eight weeks of resistance training, three times a week in six stations (including the movements of the leg press, bench press, triceps, biceps, abdominal motion, <b>pull</b> <b>side</b> and half scott) and with an intensity of 55 % to 75 % of one repetition maximum. Blood samples were collected after 12 - 14 hours, fast and before it and also after eight weeks (48 hours after the last training session). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to confirm that data was normally distributed. The obtained data was analyzed using paired-sample t-test, independent t-tests and one-way ANOVA at the significance level of P< 0. 05. Results: The results showed that resistance training had no significant effect on serum ucOC (P= 0. 094) levels and insulin sensitivity (P= 0. 178) in obesity. However, the experimental group after resistance training showed significantly higher adiponectin level than the upper limit of normal range (P= 0. 003). There was no relationship between adiponectin and ucOC. Conclusion: Resistance exercise can increase levels of serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) and adiponectin in obese women. It can be said that this type of activity could possibly be effective in glucose hemeostasis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the factors that {{influence}} an entrepreneur's decision to stay or move out of a neighbourhood. In general, new and relatively small firms tend to have a strong connection to their local environment and hardly ever move across large distances. In the Netherlands, 75 % of all moving firms even stays within the same municipality, to business parks or to other neighbourhoods (RPB, 2007). Aspects of the building (e. g. size) are the most likely reason to move, but does the neighbourhood itself matter as well? We look to what extent neighbourhood aspects influence or have influenced the decision to stay or move, both on the push and the <b>pull</b> <b>side.</b> These aspects {{may be related to the}} local physical environment or the safety situation, but also to the local social community. There is recent evidence that localized firm support network contacts contribute positively to firm success (Sleutjes & Schutjens, 2009). Local personal and professional relationships may tie firms to their local environment. If certain neighbourhood characteristics or localized networks turn out to be pull or push factors for entrepreneurs, this might interest policy makers aiming at stimulating the neighbourhood economy by attracting and retaining entrepreneurs within certain urban neighbourhoods. Basically, three questions will be answered in this paper: 1. To what extent do social and physical neighbourhood characteristics play a role in a firm's decision to stay or move? 2. How do localized firm support networks influence a firm's decision to stay put within a certain neighbourhood or not? 3. To what extent do moving firms keep in touch with local network contacts from their former neighbourhood? We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews among 40 entrepreneurs from five similar Dutch neighbourhoods. The sample is equally divided between firms that stayed and firms that recently moved out of the neighbourhood (20 / 20). The survey provides detailed information on the characteristics and the performance of firms, as well as network contacts, neighbourhood attachment, location choice, and the valuation of location aspects. We make use of qualitative methods in order to analyze our data...|$|E
40|$|Migrations have {{recently}} returned {{as a major}} challenge to the developed nation-states of the West, particularly in Europe. The dramatic increase of migratory flows {{is caused by a}} complex conjunction of push and pull factors: the demise of the Soviet empire and of communist multinational states, and an escalation of third-world misery and tribal warfare, are among the major push factors; on the <b>pull</b> <b>side,</b> the world has become a smaller and traversable place, as electronic images and cultural icons of first-world riches reach far into the non-Western hinterlands, transnational corporations set up dependencies in Asia and Africa, and airline tickets are casier to get, thus lowering the barriers for trying one's luck in the headquarters of a globalized world. A characteristic of such push-pull migrations is the breakdown of neat categorization: economic migrations, which have become synonymous with "immigration", can no longer be easily distinguished from ethnic homeland migrations, in which whole categories of people are forced to move because of violent regime changes, war, or conquest.
