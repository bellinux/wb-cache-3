50|$|As odds {{bets are}} paid at true odds, in {{contrast}} with the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> which is always even money, taking odds on a minimum <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet lessens the house advantage compared with betting the same total amount on the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> only. A maximum odds bet on a minimum <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet often gives the lowest house edge available in any game in the casino. However, the odds bet cannot be made independently, so the house retains an edge on the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet itself.|$|E

5000|$|Once a <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet is made, it {{is always}} working and cannot be turned [...] "Off", taken down or reduced unless it wins or loses. A player may {{increase}} any corresponding odds (up to the table limit) behind the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> at any time after a point is established. Players may only bet the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> on the come out roll when no point has been established, unless the casino allows put betting where the player can bet <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> or increase an existing <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> bet whenever desired and may take odds immediately if the point is already on.|$|E
5000|$|In all {{the above}} scenarios, {{whenever}} the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins, the Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> loses, and vice versa, with one exception: on the come-out roll, {{a roll of}} 12 will cause <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> bets to lose, but Don't Pass bets are pushed (or [...] "barred"), neither winning nor losing. (The same applies to [...] "Come" [...] and [...] "Don't Come" [...] bets, discussed below.) ...|$|E
5000|$|If the dealer's button is [...] "On", {{the table}} is in the point round where casinos will allow odds behind an {{existing}} <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> to be bet. Some casino do not allow new <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bets while a point has been established. Some casinos will place the bet straddling the outer border of the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> so as to indicate that {{it is to be}} paid the same odds as a place bet, instead of just even money. Other casinos will take the bet on the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> after a point has been established, known as put betting, which is a disadvantage to the player (since the seven is the most common roll and likely to happen before the [...] "point").|$|E

5000|$|When {{offered the}} dice to shoot, a player may pass the dice {{to the next}} player without fear of {{offending}} anyone; however, at least one player must always be a [...] "shooter" [...] betting on either the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> or don't <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> for the game to continue.|$|E
50|$|The shooter is {{required}} to make either a <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet or a Don't Pass bet {{if he wants to}} shoot. On the come out roll each player may only make one bet on the Pass or Don't Pass, but may bet both if desired. The <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> and Don't Pass bet is optional for any player not shooting. In rare cases, some casinos require all players to make a minimum <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> or Don't Pass bet (if they want to make any other bet), whether they are currently shooting or not.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the game}} of craps, a dice roll of 7 on the come-out {{constitutes}} a “natural” and the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins immediately. However, if the shooter (dice thrower) rolls a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the come-out roll, that number becomes his “point”. Now, the shooter must repeat his point before he throws a seven. If he repeats his point, the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins. If he rolls a seven, {{not only does the}} <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> lose, the shooter loses control of the dice. This is called a “seven-out”.|$|E
5000|$|If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 {{is thrown}} on the come-out roll (i.e., if a point is established), most casinos allow <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> players to take odds by placing {{up to some}} {{predetermined}} multiple of the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet, behind the <b>pass</b> <b>line.</b> This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, or 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point. Unlike the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet itself, the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> odds bet can be turned [...] "Off" [...] (not working), removed or reduced anytime before it loses. In Las Vegas, generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $1 on odds if the table minimum is low such as is $5, $10 or $15. If the player requests the pass odds be not working ("Off") and the shooter sevens-out or hits the point, the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet will be lost or doubled and the pass odds returned.|$|E

5000|$|.....The Tennessee <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as significant to CDOT because of its potential to carry both passengers andfreight, and because it is the only existing trans-mountain alternative in Colorado to theMoffat Tunnel line, which often runs near capacity. The Tennessee <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> may beable to be used as an alternate route as trans-mountain rail demand grows due toincreased development on the Western Slope or if the Moffat Tunnel were damaged orclosed for any reason. Such an event would {{have a significant impact on}} Colorado,particularly on the Western Slope, since the railroads would be forced to move freightthrough Wyoming. The Royal Gorge Route Railroad currently offers scenic, tourist railtrips on 12 miles of the Tennessee <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> west of Cañon City. No freight has beenshipped on the Tennessee <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> since 1997, but in relatively recent (2011)conversations with the UP, there was no indication that UP would abandon this line in thenear future. There have been no changes since." ...|$|E

5000|$|... 11 {{is a point}} number {{instead of}} a natural. Rolling an 11 still pays [...] "Yo" [...] center-table bets, but the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> does not {{automatically}} win (and the Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> doesn't automatically lose) when 11 is rolled on the come-out. Making the point pays 3:1 on Pass/Come odds bets (1:3 on Don't Pass/Come odds); all line bets are still even money. This substantially reduces {{the odds of a}} natural (from 8/36 to 6/36) and of making the point in general (since you're adding a 3:1 dog to the mix). All other things equal, the house edge on the <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> and Come bets for this play variation jumps dramatically to 9.75%.|$|E
5000|$|A put bet is a bet {{which allows}} players to {{increase}} {{or make a}} <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> bet after a point has been established (after come-out roll). Players may make a put bet on the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> and take odds immediately or increase odds behind if a player decides to add money to an already existing <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> bet. Put betting also allows players to increase an existing come bet for additional odds after a come point has been established or make a new come bet and take odds immediately behind if desired without a come bet point being established. If increased or added put bets on the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> and Come cannot be turned [...] "Off", removed or reduced, but odds bet behind can be turned [...] "Off", removed or reduced. The odds bet is generally required to be the table minimum. Player cannot put bet the Don't Pass or Don't Come. Put betting may give a larger house edge over place betting unless the casino offers high odds.|$|E
5000|$|The dealer flips {{a button}} to the [...] "On" [...] side and moves {{it to the}} point number {{signifying}} {{the second phase of}} the round. If the shooter [...] "hits" [...] the point value again (any value of the dice that sum to the point will do; the shooter doesn't have to exactly repeat the exact combination of the come-out roll) before rolling a seven, the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins and a new round starts. If the shooter rolls any seven before repeating the point number (a [...] "seven-out"), the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> loses, the Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins, and the dice pass clockwise to the next new shooter for the next round. Once a point has been established any multi-roll bet (including Pass and/or Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> bets and odds) are unaffected by the 2, 3, 11 or 12, the only numbers which affect the round are the established point, any specific bet on a number, or any 7. Any single roll bet is always affected (win or lose) by the outcome of any roll.|$|E
