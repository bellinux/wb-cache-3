2500|$|A runner {{extending}} {{from behind the}} share {{to the rear of}} the <b>plough</b> <b>controls</b> the direction of the plough, because it is held against the bottom land-side corner of the new furrow being formed. The holding force is the weight of the sod, as it is raised and rotated, on the curved surface of the mouldboard. Because of this runner, the mouldboard plough is harder to turn around than the scratch plough, and its introduction brought about a change in the shape of fields– from mostly square fields into longer rectangular [...] "strips" [...] (hence the introduction of the furlong).|$|E

50|$|Apparently, sound {{management}} recommendations may antagonize {{specific diseases}} {{as in the}} case of tan spot. Tan spot has been controlled largely by cultural practices, such as rotation with non-host crops and removal or burial of stubble (Rees and Platz, 1992). Bockus and Claassen (1992) observed that rotation to sorghum was as effective as <b>ploughing</b> for <b>control</b> of tan spot, and under certain conditions, crop rotations as short as one year controlled tan spot. In South Asia, recent work by Hobbs and Giri (1997) indicates that minimum tillage may be the best way to reduce turnaround time from rice to wheat and thus permit the planting of wheat more timely. Since this probably increases inoculum of tan spot, it highlights the need for integration of disciplines to determine how best to achieve attainable yields.|$|R

Weed density of DS treatments was significantly lower when compared with mouldboard <b>plough</b> (MP, <b>control)</b> although no clear effects on annual weeds were given by the precrop oats neither {{by the amount of}} crop residues (0, 4, 6 t ha- 1) nor the sowing density of autumnal sown oats (0, 600, 1200, 1800 seeds m-) simulating hail-shattered grains. No significant differences in grain yield but lower costs of labour and fuel were determined for DS compared with MP.

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{experiment was}} established to examine the crop yield and the weed infestation, focussed on Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), as effect of different intensity of primary tillage (mouldboard plough deep or shallow, double-layer plough, chisel plough) in combination with or without stubble tillage. The most effective ways to keep the infestation of C. arvense at a low level were deep mouldboard ploughing {{and the use of}} a double-layer plough. After the experiment had run seven years, the thistle biomass was < 2 g DM m- 2 in these treatments, compared to 23 – 26 g DM m- 2 in the treatments with chisel ploughing or shallow ploughing. In all treatments, stubble tillage in addition to primary tillage significantly reduced the thistle biomass by 30 – 80 %. A high density of lucerne/grass re-growth occurred in the chisel plough treatment. The soil seed bank of thistles ranged between 220 (deep plough) and 6, 400 seeds m- 2 (chisel plough) in the sixth year of the experiment. Stubble tillage is essential if the chisel plough or shallow ploughing is used for conservation tillage in organic farming.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a single deep {{ploughing}} to 35 and 50 cm depth on subsequent crop yields on sandy soil was investigated {{in a series of}} 5 - 6 year experiments on 14 Swedish sites. Root depth was restricted to the topsoil on all sites prior to treatments, and the sand type was coarse (0. 6 - 2. 0 mm) on 1 site, medium (0. 2 - 0. 6 mm) on 7 sites and fine (0. 06 - 0. 2 mm) on the remaining 6 sites (Table 1). The {{effect of a}}n additional 30 kg N/ha fertilizer was investigated as a secondary treatment. Ploughing to 35 cm depth improved yields relative to the normal <b>ploughed</b> <b>control</b> by on average 4 % (Table 6). However, this positive effect was greatest in years 1 - 3 and had disappeared within 5 years. Ploughing to 50 cm depth had on the whole no or a somewhat negative effect compared to normal ploughing (Table 7). Positive results were obtained on the coarser sands, and on all sands in dry years. In wet years, however, there were indications of aeration problems in the ploughed-in topsoil on fine sands. Root studies showed that rooting depth was on average 5 - 15 cm greater on soil which had been ploughed to 50 cm. Where positive effects were obtained, they were obviously due to increased water availability to the crop. The negative effects observed were probably due to aeration problems on fine sands and more particularly to soil recompaction during secondary tillage after the deep ploughing treatment. The reduction in organic matter content of the topsoil due to its mixing with the subsoil was likely to have increased the sensitivity to compaction of these sandy soils. The application of an extra 30 kg N/ha improved yields by 6 - 7 % at all 3 ploughing depths investigated. Thus there was no additional advantage in fertilizing deep-ploughed plots despite the fact that nutrient availability was somewhat lower on these (Table 4). There was a difference between crops in their response to deep ploughing. Oats showed a positive yield response of 12 %, while potatoes showed a negative yield response of 10 % (Fig. 3). The effect of incorporating 500 m 3 /ha raw bark into the topsoil after ploughing to 50 cm was investigated on one site (Vinberga). After an initial year of very low yield, this treatment gave a large positive effects on yield, presumably as a result of improved soil structure. It was concluded from this series of experiments that deep ploughing was not an economically justifiable soil improvement treatment, since better and more consistent results could be obtained by fertilizing combined with normal ploughing. In very dry areas or on coarse sands water availability could be improved more reliably by irrigating than by deep ploughing...|$|R
50|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve soil aeration and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. It is also an effective method of weed <b>control.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> depth in Britain varies between 5-6 inches in some limestone regions to up to 18 inches in deep stoneless silt land. Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16 inches are common. Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), harrows (to level the surface of ploughed land), rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some new}} research {{findings in the}} investigation of single grit grinding in terms of surface creation. The investigation demonstrated that rubbing-ploughing-cutting hypothesis of grinding material removal mechanism is valid in both experiments and simulations. A finite element model (FEM) was developed to simulate the material deformation during the grit interacts with the workpiece. It was found that the cutting mechanism is the more effective {{in the first half of}} the scratch where the grit penetrates the workpiece. The ploughing is a prominent mechanism in the second half of the scratch where the grit is climbing up along the scratch path and uplifting the material at the front and the sides of it. This observation is very important to provide a greater insight into the difference between up-cut and down-cut grinding material removal mechanisms. Multi passes scratch simulations were performed to demonstrate the influence of ploughing on the ground surface formation. Moreover, by analysing the effects of grinding conditions, the shape of cutting edges and friction in grinding zone on the grinding surface formation, some useful relations between grinding performance and controllable parameters have been identified. It has demonstrated that ploughing has significant influences on ground surface formation and concluded that the influence of grit shape, friction and grinding kinetic condition should be considered together for the <b>ploughing</b> behaviour <b>control,</b> which could provide a good guidance for the improvement of grinding efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} on an organic dairy farm in Manawatu, New Zealand, to determine how well perennial weeds are controlled during pasture renewal. Changes in weed populations were monitored following three different non-chemical methods of regrassing. Regrassing by planting pasture 4 weeks after ploughing the old pasture (“grass-to-grass”) was compared for spring and autumn cultivation. The third method involved ploughing in spring, growing turnips over summer then regrassing in autumn. All three techniques caused signiicant increases in broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens) populations. Although both these species regrew from vegetative organs, it was the establishment of new seedlings following cultivation that appeared to increase populations most. This build-up of dock seedlings occurred more when using a crop than just grass-to-grass systems. A 2 -week fallow after <b>ploughing</b> gave better <b>control</b> of perennial weeds than having no fallow, but a 4 -week fallow gave little further improvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} focused on soil factors {{influencing}} species richness and diversity after disturbance of the substrate followed by abandonment. Two types of disturbances in the past were considered: the removal of trees and shrubs with the resulting major destruction of soils, and deep <b>ploughing.</b> As a <b>control</b> meadows not covered by any management schemes for 50 years were studied. The topsoil stripping resulted in decrease of potassium, nitrogen and organic carbon contents, while deep ploughing caused less radical effects. Simultaneously, disturbances of the soil delayed the course of succession, and brought increase in species. The most species-rich are ploughed meadows. No differences in terms of species diversity, domination and evenness between the forms of disturbances were identified. However, there were groups of species indicative for soil disturbances. Analysis {{of the relationships between}} vegetation differentiation and the properties of soil suggests that available phosphorus may affect species richness and diversity in mountain meadows...|$|R
40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled winch tractor on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a winch tractor, a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the winch drum on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the winch drum. The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its winch drum the <b>plough</b> is <b>controlled</b> by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the winch tractor permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the soil in the arable layer is controlled by tillage, soil biota activities and weathering, whereas the structure below this layer is mainly {{the result of the}} activities of soil biota. Organic farmers tend to minimise the depth of the main tillage operation to encourage soil biota to create a soil structure with continuous biopores and a well crumbled topsoil. The best main tillage operation for preventive weed control, especially important in organic farming, is mouldboard ploughing. The shallow ploughing experiments described in this paper were conducted to ascertain the minimum ploughing depth for an ecologically accountable, sustainable tillage system with good weed control, good land qualities (in terms of workable days, aeration and soil moisture conditions) and finally with good yields. The "ecoplough" used for shallow ploughing was developed by Rumptstad Industries to meet the requirements of relatively shallow ploughing with good soil inversion for weed <b>control.</b> The <b>plough</b> has seven or eight bottoms for ploughing depths of 0. 12 – 0. 20 m, a working width of 2. 1 m and a working speed of 1. 7 m s- 1. Its width is such that the tractor with wide low-pressure tyres runs on top of the land. After using the plough for 6 years on Luvisols (> 200 gkg- 1 200 g kg- 1 < 2 m), shallow ploughing seems to be the best reduced tillage system. It has several advantages. The main factor determining the minimum <b>ploughing</b> depth is <b>control</b> of weeds, especially of perennials...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of lakebed sediment erodibility {{were made on}} three sites in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, using the benthic flume Sea Carousel. Three methods of estimating the surface erosion threshold (&tgr;c(0)) from a Carousel time series were evaluated: the first method fits measures of bed strength to eroded depth (the failure envelope) and evaluates threshold as the surface intercept; the second method regresses mean erosion rate (Em) with bed shear stress and solves for the floc erosion rate (Ef) to derive the threshold for Em = Ef = 1 × 10 - 5 kg m- 2 s- 1; the third method extrapolates a regression of suspended sediment concentration (S) and fluid transmitted bed shear stress (&tgr; 0) to ambient concentrations. The first field site was undisturbed (C) and acted as a control; the second (W) was disturbed through ploughing and water injection as part of lakebed treatment, whereas the third site (OIP) was disturbed and injected with an oxidant used for remediation of contaminated sediment. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the three different methods of deriving erosion threshold; (2) to compare the physical behaviour of lacustrine sediments with their marine estuarine counterparts; and (3) {{to examine the effects}} of ploughing and chemical treatment of contaminated sediment on bed stability. Five deployments of Sea Carousel were carried out at the control site. Mean erosion thresholds for the three methods were: &tgr;c(0) = 0 · 5 (± 0 · 06), 0 · 27 (± 0 · 01) and 0 · 34 (± 0 · 03) Pa respectively. Method 1 overpredicted bed strength as it was insensitive to effects in the surface 1 - 2 mm, and the fit of the failure envelope was also highly subjective. Method 2 exhibited a wide scatter in the data (low correlation coefficients), and definition of the baseline erosion rate (Ef) is largely arbitrary in the literature. Method 3 yielded stable (high correlation coefficients), reproducible and objective results and is thus recommended for evaluation of the erosion threshold. The results of this method correlated well with sediment bulk density and followed the same trend as marine counterparts from widely varying sites. Mass settling rates, expressed as a decay constant, k, of S(t), were strongly related to the maximum turbidity at the onset of settling (Smax) and were also in continuity with marine counterparts. Thus, it appears that differences in salinity had little effect on mass settling rates in the examples presented, and that biological activity dominated any effects normally attributable to changes in salinity. Bedload transport of eroded aggregates (2 - 4 mm in diameter) took place by rolling below a mean tangential flow velocity (Uy) of 0 · 32 ms- 1 and by saltation at higher velocities. Mass transport as bedload was a maximum at Uy = 0 · 4 ms- 1, although bedload never exceeded 1 % of the suspended load. The proportion of material moving as bedload was greatest at the onset of erosion but decreased as flow competence increased. Given the low bulk density and strength of the lakebed sediment, the presence of a bedload component is notable. Bedload transport over eroding cohesive substrates should be greater in estuaries, where both sediment density and strength are usually higher. Significant differences between the <b>ploughed</b> and <b>control</b> sites were apparent in both the erosion rate and the friction coefficient (&phgr;), and suggest that bed recovery after disruption is rapid (< 24 h). &tgr;c(0) increased linearly with time after ploughing and recovered to the control mean value within 3 days. The friction coefficient was reduced to zero by ploughing (diagnostic of fluidization), but increased linearly with time, regaining control values within 6 days. No long-term reduction in bed strength due to remediation was apparent...|$|R
