2500|$|The buzzing {{sound of}} the V-1's <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> was likened by some to [...] "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the {{sound of the}} {{propulsion}} unit spluttering and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though the silence was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive). [...] At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August {{a million and a half}} people had left London and the rate of work production was affected. By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken and people started returning to London.|$|E

50|$|Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomey (Russian: Влади́мир Никола́евич Челоме́й; Ukrainian: Володимир Миколайович Челомей; 30 June 1914 - 8 December 1984) was a Soviet {{mechanics}} scientist, aviation {{and missile}} engineer. He invented {{the very first}} Soviet <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> and {{was responsible for the}} development of the world's first anti-ship cruise missiles and ICBM complexes like the UR-100, UR-200, UR-500 and UR-700.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> are {{uncommon}} aircraft powerplants. However, the Argus As 014 used {{to power}} the V-1 flying bomb and Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg was a notable exception.In this <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> three air nozzles in the front section were connected to an external high-pressure air source, butane from an external supply was used for starting, ignition was accomplished by a spark plug located behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit.|$|R
5|$|The five {{aircraft}} {{modified by}} the factory {{were given the}} Klimov RD-45 engine, the Soviet unlicensed copy of the Nene engine, and all six aircraft were used by the VVS for aircrew familiarization and training. The aircraft completed were later relegated to test duties. One aircraft was used for drone tests and another, redesignated as the Tu-12LL, mounted various <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> on a pylon above the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{other engines}} can benefit far {{more from the}} use of water injection. Typical <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> have {{extremely}} poor fuel efficiency, specific fuel consumption, and thrust. Water injection has been proven to use the waste heat that causes a <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> to glow red hot and convert it into thrust. It cools the engine, it pulls more air in, and it reduces pollution. Water injection and other means of boost may be able to transform the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> from a noisy, inefficient tube to a cleaner burning and powerful enough engine that may be of use in lightweight aircraft.|$|R

50|$|A Pulse Ejector Thrust Augmentor or PETA is a {{proprietary}} <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> developed by Boeing.The Boeing PETA design embeds the pulse jet inside a thrust augmenting duct which entrains surrounding {{air into the}} exhaust stream. This entrained air improves thrust and cools the pulse jet. Boeing may use the PETA in its Light Aerial Multi-purpose Vehicle (LAMV) Future Combat System.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{operation}} of the PDE {{is similar to that}} of the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> In the pulse jet, air is mixed with fuel to create a flammable mixture that is then ignited in an open chamber. The resulting combustion greatly increases the pressure of the mixture to approximately 100 atmospheres (10 MPa), which then expands through a nozzle for thrust.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine's</b> {{ability to}} be almost {{instantly}} throttled, with spoolup/spooldown time from minimum to max thrust and vice versa of around of 1-1,5 seconds, and startup and shutdown times of less than five seconds, would be advantageous in a {{vertical take-off and landing}} (VTOL) aircraft, where quick response to control input is, at the very least, useful. *The ability to provide upward thrust and thus decouple vertical and axial movement of the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Reports of the German V-1 {{flying bomb}} attacks on London {{prompted}} Stalin {{to initiate a}} programme to develop a Soviet equivalent, commencing in June 1944. Vladimir Chelomey, {{who had been working}} on <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> was assigned to the project in October 1944 and given control of OKB-52. The programme was assisted by the partial recovery of a V-1 by Soviet forces at the Blizna test range in Poland. The initial V-1 copy was called 10Kh and later Izdeliye 10 ("Article 10"). Serial production was scheduled to commence in March 1945 with 100 per month, increasing to 450 per month later that year.|$|R
5000|$|Control-Line {{airplanes}} {{usually have}} a power plant of [...] to , although engines can be as large as [...]90, or may have electric power. Two-stroke glow engines are most common, but almost any form of model engine has been used, including <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> and turbojets. Control-line models tend to have very high power-to-weight ratios compared to R/C models or full-scale aircraft. The size of the engines and the models are significantly limited by the maximum line length of 70 ft used for competition, although very long lines (as much as 150 feet) have been used on rare occasions.|$|R
50|$|The Lenoir {{cycle is}} an {{idealized}} thermodynamic cycle {{often used to}} model a <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> It {{is based on the}} operation of an engine patented by Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir in 1860. This engine is often thought of as the first commercially produced internal combustion engine. The absence of any compression process in the design leads to lower thermal efficiency than the more well known Otto cycle and Diesel cycle.|$|E
50|$|This {{plane is}} one of the {{products}} of the latter part of 1944, when the High Command of the Luftwaffe saw that there was a dire need to put up a strong defense against the devastating allied bombing raids.Thus aircraft manufacturers Heinkel, Junkers and Blohm & Voss were asked by the Luftwaffe in November to come up with light fighter designs using a strict minimum of materials that would be fitted with one Argus As 014 <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> per unit.|$|E
50|$|Nazi Germany {{supplied}} the Japanese {{with a great}} deal of technical data, including details of the Argus As 014 <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> It remains debatable whether that technical data included examples of the V1, let alone the Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg). It is noted that wartime U.S. intelligence reports stated that the Japanese knew of the V-1 by October 1943, and one report stated that Japan received one example in November 1944. The reports also suggested that the Japanese were very interested in the V-1 air-launching techniques as used by the Germans.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> use {{independent}} {{intake and}} exhaust pipes. A physically simpler design combines the {{intake and exhaust}} aperture. This is possible due to the oscillating behaviour of a pulse engine. One aperture can act as exhaust pipe during the high-pressure phase of the work cycle and as intake during the aspiration phase.This engine design is less efficient in this primitive form due to its lack of a resonant pipe and thus a lack of reflected compressing and sucking acoustic waves. However it works fairly well with a simple instrument such as jam jar with a pierced lid and fuel inside, hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|The Ramblin' Wreck Parade is {{a parade}} of classic cars and {{engineering}} oddities held before every homecoming football game. There are three classes of vehicles, which participate in the competition. The first class is known simply as classic cars and these are vehicles over a certain age limit (currently 25 years). The second class is known as fixed bodies and these vehicles are normal cars, which have only been cosmetically modified retaining their original drive train. These are often themed, but are distinctly different from floats and are prohibited from being [...] "pseudo-wrecks displaying pomps". The third class is the contraption category and these vehicles feature drive trains completely fabricated by students ranging from pendulum propulsion to <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b> Vehicles must feature an [...] "indirect" [...] drive system and are judged both on creativity and effective operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> get {{extremely}} hot once started, and use very volatile fuels like gasoline or methyl-ethyl-ketone (as contrasted {{to relatively}} benign, although flammable, glow engine fuel). Contact {{of any type}} with the tailpipe of the engine is certain to result in severe burns, as the engine reaches red-hot temperatures in seconds. The airplane itself needs some sort of insulation to prevent catching fire on the ground before forward motion provides cooling air, and fully enclosed engines can set the airplane on fire after landing. The airplane should be launched {{as soon as possible}} after the engine starts to prevent heat buildup. The spark unit used for starting can also deliver a substantial electrical shock. A fire extinguisher should be at hand at all times when operating the engine. The engine is exceptionally loud when operating and should be operated with hearing protection to prevent damage.|$|R
