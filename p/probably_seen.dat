5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Russian research team led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of bismuth-209 and lead-208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 and manganese-55 respectively. Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, {{and the other with}} an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the isotope bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter dubnium-257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life (dubnium-257 has a one-second half-life); however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive {{discovery of}} bohrium at Darmstadt in 1981. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) concluded that while dubnium-258 was <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.|$|E
25|$|Noel Odell {{believed}} {{that he had seen}} Mallory and Irvine ascend the Second Step, but eventually changed his story to say it was the First Step. Towards the end of his life, however, he reaffirmed his original view. Recent observations taken from Odell's vantage point by other climbers suggest that Odell would have <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> the men at the Second Step as he had initially reported.|$|E

You have <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> a {{photograph}} of the banner hung at the MCG, that tribute to him from his Australian fans. People still talk of his hundred in Melbourne on his first tour, and his highest first-class score, 307 at Adelaide. Six times he toured, being good enough at 20 and good enough at 40.|$|E

25|$|The {{types of}} homes that {{were built in}} that time and area, usually one story rubble masonry with heavy flat roofs that were often already damaged, were not {{resistant}} to even {{a small amount of}} shaking. Public structures like bridges and walls fared better, as they were usually constructed with higher standards. The heavy damage in certain areas occurred for various reasons. Some cities were built on steep hillsides overlooking the plains (done for security reasons), while other sites were located on unstable soil where landslides had occurred previously. These conditions made assessing the intensity of the earthquake difficult, but Ambraseys settled on a maximum value of VII–VIII (Very strong–Damaging) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale for the event. That scale was used primarily in Europe and the Soviet Union up until the 1990s. A higher loss of life was <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> {{as a result of the}} earthquake occurring on a winter evening, as most people were likely in their homes preparing dinner.|$|E

There has been very little research on the species since [...] then, so knowledge of its ecology and cultivation potential is limited. It is placed in Banksia ser. Cyrtostylis, alongside its close relative, the well-known and widely cultivated B.media (southern plains banksia).|$|E
500|$|The first {{determined}} {{search for}} New South Greenland {{came during the}} Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911–13, under Wilhelm Filchner. The expedition's ship, Deutschland, became trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at Vahsel Bay. Her subsequent north-westerly drift had, by mid-, brought her to a position just [...] east of Morrell's recorded sighting. Filchner left the ship on [...] and, with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks, sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrell's land. Daylight was limited {{to two or three}} hours a day, and temperatures fell to −31°F (−35°C), [...] making travel difficult. [...] They found no signs of land; a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of [...] before the line snapped. The depth confirmed that there was no land in the vicinity, and Filchner concluded that [...] Morrell had <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> a mirage.|$|E

500|$|Henry was the {{youngest}} of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, [...] "short, stocky and barrel-chested," [...] with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister, Adela, well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to {{become a member of the}} clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} was made {{available}} {{in its entirety}} on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at 12:01a.m. PT. Prior {{to the release of}} season 1, three reviewers, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal, and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers. Stanley notes that the show [...] "is <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> best one episode at a time. It's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast, but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderous—a romp slowed down to a dirge". Smith also notes that due to its [...] "relentless theme", [...] "House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged", deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a [...] "bag of M's". However, Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying [...] "So, on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and you simply cannot stop watching, then, yes, you may power-binge your way through all 13 hours at once". Upon viewing the four episode season 2 preview Time James Poniewozik says [...] "I could easily see powering through the season in a free weekend, precisely because no individual episode needs much time to sink in". Stanley also felt the second season was [...] "binge-worthy" [...] upon viewing the preview. However, Ellen Gray of Philly.com supports not binge-watching the season, as she believes it does not serve it well.|$|E
500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E

500|$|While {{casting the}} [...] "freighter folk"– the {{nickname}} that Losts executive producers/writers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use {{to refer to}} Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank– fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. [...] After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO's The Sopranos in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him, although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell". [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom. [...] Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead. [...] Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social." [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of Keith Richards, specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. [...] Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". [...] According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". [...] They also commended his [...] "intense eyes" [...] and stated that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. [...] Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role. [...] The writer-producers have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E

2500|$|When Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson, {{a former}} {{teammate}} of Paige, Paige {{realized that it}} was for the best that Paige himself was not the first black player in major league baseball. Robinson started in the minors, and had a major league team started him in its minor league affiliate, Paige would have <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> this as an insult. Paige eventually realized that by integrating baseball in the minor leagues first with Robinson, the white major league players got the chance to [...] "get used to" [...] the idea of playing alongside black players. Understanding that, Paige said in his autobiography that, [...] "Signing Jackie like they did still hurt me deep down. I'd been the guy who'd started all that big talk about letting us in the big time. I’d been the one who'd opened up the major league parks to colored teams. I'd been the one who the white boys wanted to go barnstorming against." [...] Paige, and all other black players, knew that quibbling about the choice of the first black player in the major leagues would do nothing productive, so, despite his inner feelings, Paige said of Robinson, [...] "He's the greatest colored player I've ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} between the decorative and the fine arts has essentially arisen from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is {{for the most part}} meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works– or even all works– include those in decorative media. [...] For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using geometric and plant forms, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The {{distinction between}} decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for this period must be viewed as a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be seen as decorative. The term [...] "ars sacra" [...] ("sacred arts") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art done in metal, ivory, textiles, and other high-value materials but not for rarer secular works from that period.|$|E
2500|$|... you ask who Mr. Millard is {{and what}} reason lies in his {{prejudice}} against Missions in general.

You have <b>probably</b> <b>seen</b> his articles {{in some of the}} magazines of America – Scribners or Cosmopolitan. These reporters come through Japan where there is a strong prejudice against Christianity, especially in newspaper circles, and then they stop a few days among the clubs in Shanghai where they are filled with all the yarns about missionaries. I have known of three or four who have admitted that they came north with prejudices against missionaries and that they vanished on acquaintance with our Peking and Tung Chou people. Chamberlain of the Sun was one of these and I think it was he who rebuked another reporter for his tirade against missions by saying [...] "That is the way I felt, too, when I first came but I have changed my mind since I have known the missionaries." [...] We have received copies of a five-column interview with Mr. Ament in the Kobe Herald. He had been terribly slandered by the Kobe Chronicle, whose Editor has announced his purpose to do all the harm to the cause of Christianity that he can, so that we are glad to see an explanation in the same city. We expect Mr. Ament to do much good in setting these things right in the public mind.
