The First Fleet, arriving in 1788, brought with it few carpenters and a meagre supply of poor-quality tools. Nails and other ironmongery were scarce. The colonists were forced to build shelters using whatever skills they possessed, from whatever natural materials they could find. They tried the traditional British wattle and daub (or 'dab') method: posts were set in the ground; thin branches were woven and set between these posts, and clay or mud was plastered over the weave to make a solid wall. Wattle and daub walls were easily destroyed by the drenching rains of Australia's severe summer storms, and for a time, walls of timber slabs took their place. These were soon replaced by brick structures; the Sydney Cove landscape was almost denuded of useful timber. [...] When settlement moved beyond Sydney Cove, an abundance of suitable forest timber became available.

40|$|A relic {{density of}} Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) {{remaining}} from the Big Bang constitutes a promising {{solution to the}} Dark Matter problem. It is possible for such WIMPs to be trapped by and accumulate in gravitational potentials of massive dense objects such as the Sun. A perfect WIMP candidate appears in certain supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics, where the lightest supersymmetric particle is a neutralino which can be stable, massive and weakly interacting. The neutralinos may annihilate pair-wise and in these interactions neutrinos with energies ranging up to the neutralino mass can be indirectly produced. Hence, a possible population of dark matter neutralinos trapped in the Sun can give rise to an observable neutrino flux.

40|$|Finite element (FE) {{simulations}} {{are widely}} used in automotive design processes to model the forming behavior of sheet metals. Comprehensive material characterization {{and the availability of}} suitable constitutive models are prerequisites for accurate modeling of these forming operations. In the current research, monotonic tension, compression and large strain compression-tension-compression (CTC) and tension-compression-tension (TCT) experiments have been performed to characterize the mechanical behavior of AZ 31 B and ZEK 100 magnesium sheets at room temperature. A digital image correlation system is used to measure the surface strains during monotonic tension and compression testing. The data is later processed to calculate the evolution of r-values with plastic deformation. Texture measurements of the annealed materials and fractography of deformed specimens under monotonic tension and compression are also performed. The results of mechanical testing are discussed in light of the crystallographic texture and deformation mechanisms such as slip, twinning and untwinning. It is observed that annealed AZ 31 B sheet has a strong basal texture where the majority of crystallographic c-axes are aligned in the sheet normal (ND) direction whereas the annealed ZEK 100 sheet exhibits a comparatively weak basal texture, with significant basal <b>pole</b> spreading in <b>sheet</b> transverse direction (TD). The AZ 31 B sheet specimens exhibit higher in-plane flow stresses and lower ductility as compared to ZEK 100 sheet specimens. The tension-compression yield asymmetry is found to be more pronounced in AZ 31 B sheet as compared to ZEK 100 sheet. In addition to this, the ZEK 100 sheet specimens exhibit a strong in-plane orientation dependency of flow stress when subjected to uniaxial tension. Furthermore, a significantly greater evolution of plastic anisotropy (r-values) is observed for AZ 31 B sheet specimens as compared to ZEK 100 sheet specimens. Moreover, the unusual S-shaped hardening behavior is observed during reverse tension following previous compression portions of CTC and TCT flow curves of AZ 31 B and ZEK 100 sheets. A constitutive model is proposed to capture the evolving asymmetric/anisotropic hardening response of magnesium alloys considering both monotonic and reverse loading paths. The hardening behaviour of magnesium alloys is classified into three deformation modes (i. e. Monotonic Loading [ML], Reverse Compression [RT], and Reverse Tension [RT]). A multi-yield surface modeling approach is used where a CPB 06 type anisotropic yield surface is assigned to each deformation mode. For each deformation mode, the yielding criterion is modified to capture the evolution of subsequent yield loci with accumulated plastic deformation. A strain rate independent elasto-plastic formulation is used to implement the proposed constitutive model as a UMAT in LS-DYNA. The predictions of the model are compared against the experimental monotonic and cyclic (CTC and TCT) flow stresses of AZ 31 B and ZEK 100 sheets along different test directions. An excellent agreement is found between the simulated and experimental results. 1 yea...|$|R
