500|$|Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben {{began his}} {{argument}} for the United States by noting that information revealed to the world (i.e. movement on a public road) is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. Dreeben cited United States v. Knotts as an example where police were allowed to use a device known as a [...] "beeper" [...] that allows the tracking of a car from a short distance away. Chief Justice Roberts distinguished the current case from Knotts, saying that using a beeper still took [...] "a lot of work" [...] whereas a GPS device allows the police to [...] "sit back in the station ... and <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> whenever they {{want to find out}} where the car is." ...|$|E
500|$|Invincible carried eight BL [...] Mk X guns in four twin turrets. For {{evaluation}} purposes {{these were}} electrically driven BIX and BX turrets, two each built by Vickers and Armstrongs. They {{proved to be}} a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at the cost of £151,200. The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of , the Royal Navy's chief gunnery school, described their operation in the following manner: [...] "When the order was given to train the turret, elevate or run a gun in or out, it was only necessary to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> or move a switch, but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret." ...|$|E

Invincibles electrically driven turrets proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at the enormous cost of £151,200. The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of , the Royal Navy's gunnery school described their operation thusly: [...] "When the order was given to train the turret, elevate or run a gun in or out, it was only necessary to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button,</b> or move a switch, but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret." ...|$|E

[...] Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies.

[...] Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done.|$|E

Some countries have [...] "intelligent" [...] pedestrian signals, where the pedestrian must <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> in order to assert his intention to cross. The traffic signal will use that information to schedule itself, that is, when no pedestrians are present the signal will never pointlessly cause vehicle traffic to stop. [...] In some countries, approaching traffic is monitored by radar or by electromagnetic sensors buried in the road surface, and the pedestrian crossing lights are set to red if a speed infringement is detected. [...] This {{has the effect of}} enforcing the local speed limit without the necessity of issuing speeding citations, etc. [...] See Speed Limits below.|$|E

[...] "You're telling an {{engineer}} when to <b>push</b> <b>a</b> <b>button</b> {{to produce a}} laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E
