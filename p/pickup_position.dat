50|$|To {{celebrate}} the 50th {{anniversary of the}} Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument's history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era thumb rest and bridge <b>pickup</b> <b>positioning,</b> modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods.|$|R

For the tone generator, programmable parameters include decay time, release time, overtone level, overtone frequency, and overtone decay. For the electronic pickup, programmable parameters include <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> {{in relation to the}} tone generator (such as a tine).|$|E
50|$|Like the two-pickup guitar, these Esquires had a routed cavity in {{the neck}} <b>pickup</b> <b>position.</b> Thus, with the {{purchase}} of a neck pickup and replacement or modification of the pickguard, players could upgrade their instrument to a guitar identical to the Telecaster in every respect except for the model decal. Bruce Springsteen, for example, has long played an Esquire modified in this way. Springsteen has claimed that the guitar he is pictured with on the Born To Run album cover is, in fact, a hybrid of two guitars, a Telecaster body and Esquire neck. However, it is a first-generation Esquire with two pickup routs. The Esquires had Esquire pickguards to cover the neck pickup hole. His guitar has a neck pickup installed, but not connected.|$|E
50|$|Tape and reel feeder is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used feeder design. Tape-on-reel feeders are loaded with a reel, which is placed onto a reel-reception. The peel-off carriage pulls the reel tape forward until the next component is in the pick-up position. When the sensor indicates that the component is at the <b>pickup</b> <b>position,</b> a holder moves down and locks-down the tape.Tape feeders are most suitable for placing large quantities of identical small components. Tape feeders {{come in a variety of}} sizes and can be used for Small-outline integrated circuits (SOICs) and plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCCs).The main disadvantage of the tape format is the inability to recycle the empty tapes. Especially in the case of small chip devices, the tape waste material weighs several times more than the packaged components. Moreover, there is additional cost for placing small inexpensive components in tape.|$|E

50|$|The Grabber {{featured}} a bolt-on 34+1/2 in neck similar to Fender basses and shared a similar body shape with the Ripper. The Grabber {{also had a}} V-shaped headstock like the Gibson Flying V guitar. A distinctive feature of the Grabber was its adjustable pickup, which could be positioned by the player to simulate a neck or bridge <b>pickup</b> <b>position,</b> or in between, to provide further tonal variation. The pickup was brighter than the traditional Gibson style humbuckers. The Grabber had one volume and tone control each, and a removable bridge cover. The Grabber was originally built with a thin, maple body, but it was changed to alder in 1975. 1975 was a peak year for Grabber sales, with 2,637 units sold, due largely to its high-profile use by Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. The Grabber was available in wine red, ebony, natural, walnut and white finishes. It was discontinued in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{explosion}} of the popularity of rock music in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including the Japanese manufacturers Yamaha, Teisco and Guyatone. First introduced in 1960, the Fender Jazz Bass was known as the Deluxe Bass and was meant to accompany the Jazzmaster guitar. The Jazz Bass (often referred to as a [...] "J-bass") featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass' split coil <b>pickup</b> <b>position.</b> The earliest production basses had a 'stacked' volume and tone control for each pickup. This was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single, passive tone control. The Jazz Bass' neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass — 1+1/2 in versus 1+3/4 in — allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.|$|E
5000|$|The Dean MKH, is a 24-3/4 inch scale ML {{body with}} a {{mahogany}} neck and {{body with a}} plain maple top, the neck on this guitar has had a completely original carve away made where the neck and body meets. (Matt Heafy and the Dean Woodshop guys cut back {{a lot on the}} heel of the neck to get the most amount of playability without hurting the tone of the guitar) This guitar also has a new feature for the ML series by adding two more frets to the neck, making it a twenty-four fret fretboard, instead of the original 22 fret fretboards on the MLs and most Dean Guitars for that matter. The fretboard is an ebony fretboard with twenty-four frets as just stated, and at the twelfth fret it has the Trivium [...] "circle" [...] which is part of their logos and there are no other marks on the fret board.(Meaning there are no other dots or inlays on the fretboard) The strap peg which on most ML's is on the notch above the neck of the guitar, but for comfort and convenience it has been moved to back of the guitar, and the other strap peg is still in its original position on the top tail of the body. And not a new feature to this body style but surely a good feature is that the input jack is not {{on the front of the}} body on the second tail by the control nobs, but it is now on the top tail right above the strap peg for the fact that the input jack would sometimes break because the amp cable would hit up against something, and in turn, would break the input jack. Another thing is that there is only one control nob and it is the master volume because Matt says that he always has the tone nobs all the way on the pickups anyway, and it’s in the middle nob position so when the whammy bar is used it does not get in the way, and the toggle switch that controls which pickup is selected is in its traditional position on the front tail of the guitar. And to help ensure the sound that Matt Heafy wanted he had his custom USA Dean Matt Heafy “MKH86” installed in the bridge <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> and a USA “Nostalgia” in the neck <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> (Matt Heafy and Dean designed the custom USA Dean Matt Heafy “MKH86” when they were making the guitar) The bridge consists of an Original Locking Floyd Rose Tremolo System, and to help with keeping the strings in tune when the tremolo or whammy bar is used he had Grover tuners and a locking nut installed. And for Matt's personal preference he has had lead weights put in his guitar to make the guitar much heavier, and the production model will not weigh as much. (In an interview Matt stated that he likes heavy guitars, because it gives him something with substance to play and beat on) And the last thing is that Matt Heafy's signature is on the truss rod cover. And now this guitar comes in a white and red Japanese Rising Sun graphic that continues onto the head stock with a white and red Trivium [...] "T" [...] that is part of their logo.|$|E

30|$|The {{spectrum}} in Figure 3 b {{shows the}} first harmonics up to 8 kHz for an A ♯ 2 tone and is quite {{representative of the}} spectral profile {{for many of the}} Clavinet tones. The second partial always has a magnitude more than 3 dB higher than the first, and often (as in the figure) the third is higher than the second. The spectral envelope of Clavinet tones shows several peaks and notches due to the superposition of several effects including partial beating (which generates time-varying peaks and notches), the <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> (which applies a comb pattern, later discussed in Section 2.3. 5), and amplifier and filter frequency responses (discussed in Section 2.3. 6). Figure 3 b reveals a comb-like pattern given by the <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> at approximately 544 Hz and multiple frequencies.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} pickup model {{includes a}} comb effect {{dependent on the}} <b>pickup</b> <b>position,</b> the magnetic field distance nonlinearity, and the emulation of the pickup selector switches. The traveling waves reflected at the string termination are transduced by the pickups, thus creating a comb characteristic in frequency. This effect can be emulated by a comb filter with negative gain (ideally − 1 for a stiff string) and a delay equal to the time needed for the wave to propagate from the <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> to the string termination and back [26]. As discussed in Section 2.3. 5, string dispersion also affects {{the position of the}} comb notches. In [48], the amount of dispersion is shown to be equal to the string inharmonicity itself. A duplicate of the dispersion filter used in the string model could be added to the comb feedforward path to obtain this secondary effect. However, to achieve a trade-off between computational efficiency and sound quality, the duplicate filter has not been implemented as it would increase the computational cost by 25 %.|$|E

50|$|The {{end of each}} string {{farthest}} from the pick-ups passes through a weave of yarn. When the key is released, the yarn damps the vibration of the string. Each string is tuned by a machine-head positioned along {{the front of the}} harp. This harp mechanism is completely different from the other Hohner electric piano keyboard products, the Cembalet and Pianet, which use the principle of plectra or sticky pads plucking metal reeds that do not require user tuning. Most clavinets have two sets of <b>pickups,</b> <b>positioned</b> above and below the strings. The Clavinet has pickup selector switches, and a guitar-level output that connects to an amplifier. Early clavinet models featured single-coil pickups. The D6 introduced a six-core pickup design.|$|R
30|$|The pulse signals seen in Clavinet tones have {{a smooth}} {{triangular}} shape {{and represent the}} pickup output from the tangent hitting the string. Most of the recorded tones exhibit a similar pulse {{at the beginning of}} the tone, hence making this a good approximation for the string excitation produced by the tangent in most cases. Because the signal extracted from the pickups is the time derivative of the string displacement at the <b>pickup</b> <b>position,</b> when using its approximation as an excitation, it must be ensured that the wave variables in the digital waveguide are also time-differentiated approximations of the displacement of the Clavinet string. This allows differentiation to be avoided when emulating the effect of pickups if these are linear devices. With nonlinear pickups (as it is the case), integration must be performed before the nonlinear stage.|$|E
40|$|The linear tone {{generation}} process {{of an electric}} guitar can be divided in four subsystems: Plectrum filter, plucking position filter, <b>pickup</b> <b>position</b> filter, pickup transfer filter. Nonlinear effects such as bouncing require additional systems. Cascading these subsystems yields a general system that models the guitars transfer characteristic from string velocity to output voltage. 1. Plectrum filter Systems theory claims that plucking a string produces a force step function: The plucking force jumps abruptly from F to zero, corresponding to a 1 /f-spectrum. In reality the plucking force decays gradually, {{which leads to a}} "rounded step". As it may take several milliseconds before the plectrum (or finger nail) has finally left the string, a lowpass filtering of the 1 /fspectrum occurs. Bouncing effects between string and plectrum may add comb filtering, so in total an efficient tone affection is possible simply by modifying the plectrums motion. From which emanates the expression “It's the finger, not the gear”. However, the plectrum filter is not the only subsystem in the tone producing process...|$|E

40|$|A part of {{the beam}} losses at {{transition}} crossing of high intensity beams in the CERN PS {{have been attributed to}} an excursion of the closed orbit.
