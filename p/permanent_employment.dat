He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College with the hope of earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up <b>permanent</b> <b>employment</b> at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{convalescence}} in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he {{found that he was}} in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of Discovery. With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the Terra Nova for the second Discovery relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentinean corvette Uruguay, which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Nordenskiöld. In search of more <b>permanent</b> <b>employment,</b> Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy, via the back-door route of the Supplementary List, but despite the sponsorship of Markham and {{of the president of the}} Royal Society, he was not successful. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the Royal Magazine, but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11 January 1904. On 9 April 1904 he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward.|$|E

30|$|The {{reasoning}} developed {{so far is}} very abstract. I {{would like}} {{to return to the}} main topic of this article, namely, weak signals, moving from an empirical example. In a newspaper article published in 2015, Luca Ricolfi [58] commented some news spread by the Italian Government on a supposed economic recovery. On the basis of data concerning employment in the first 2  months of 2015, the Italian Government spoke of clear signals of an upturn in economy. An evidence was that in the first 2  months of 2014, the amount of <b>permanent</b> <b>employments</b> had been 112, 000 unities per month, whereas in the first 2  months of the next year it was 152, 000 unities per month, which implies a 35  % increase. Thus, the Italian Government spoke of an “extraordinary acceleration” (“formidabile accelerazione”) of employment {{at the beginning of the}} new year. Ricolfi noted that, if compared with further data, these figures could have a different meaning. In the first 3  months of 2014, the amount of <b>permanent</b> <b>employments</b> had been 147, 000 unities per month. Compared with this average, the already mentioned average of 152, 000 unities per month in the subsequent year (with exclusion of data referring to March; at that time they were not yet available) clearly was substantially less ‘extraordinary’ than it appeared. Moreover, Ricolfi pointed out that the amount 152, 000 was nearly the same average of two ‘horrible’ years, 2011 and 2012. Last but not least, the Italian sociologist regretted that along with data concerning employment, the Italian Government did not communicate data concerning ‘cancellations’, that is, ceased employment relationships during the same period, thus making a calculus of employment balance impossible.|$|R

During the late 1580s he may have worked again for the Gonzagas in Mantua, but if so, the dates are not known. For most of the remainder of his life he worked in Argenta as maestro di cappella and music teacher, but since Argenta was a relative backwater compared to Ferrara, Venice, and the other cities in the region, Belli's fame never attained that of many of his contemporaries. Belli remained connected with Ferrara until his death, {{as a member of the}} Accademia degli Intrepidi; however after Ferrara was annexed by the Papal States in 1597, the music scene there declined, and its avant-garde character was extinguished.

It not only secured control of the Aegean Sea and the loyalty of her allies, but also safeguarded the trade routes and the grain shipments from the Black Sea, which fed the city's burgeoning population. In addition, as it provided <b>permanent</b> <b>employment</b> for the city's poorer citizens, the fleet {{played an important role in}} maintaining and promoting the radical Athenian form of democracy.

30|$|The varying {{labour market}} {{development}} in Germany {{during the last}} two decades was accompanied by an altered composition of employment (Keller and Seifert 2011; Schmid 2011).

Certain types of nonstandard work such as part-time employment, fixed-term contracts, and agency work grew over time.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the labour}} market effects of fixed-term contracts (FTCs) in West Germany by microeconometric methods using individual and establishment level data. In {{the first part}} of the study the role of FTCs in firms’ labour demand is analysed. An econometric investigation of the firms’ reasons for using FTCs focussing on the identification of the link between dismissal protection for permanent contract workers and the firms’ use of FTCs is presented. Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of the role of FTCs in worker and job flows at the firm level is provided. The second part of the study evaluates the short-run effects of being employed on an FTC on working conditions and wages using a large cross-sectional dataset of employees. The final part of the study analyses whether taking up an FTC increases the (<b>permanent</b> contract) <b>employment</b> opportunities in the long-run (stepping stone effect) and whether FTCs affect job finding behaviour of unemployed job searchers. Firstly, an econometric unemployment duration analysis distinguishing between both types of contracts as destination states is performed.

40|$|There {{are several}} issues that science communicators aim to address today: Presentation of the {{concepts}} of science in popular culture and public sphere, communicating complicated scientific discoveries and facts {{to the public and}} enhancing general interest in the study and conduction of science. Relating to this issue, the problem of underrepresentation of women in science is seen to be extremely relevant, as despite the fact {{that there has been a}} significant improvement in women's rights and equality issues, many countries are faced with this problem. Even countries like Denmark, which is considered to be relatively advanced in terms of gender equality, have to deal with the fact that the female representation in high and <b>permanent</b> <b>employments</b> within the science sphere is below the European average. To combat the problem, the European Commision launched a campaign named “Science: It’s a Girl Thing” aimed at persuading girls to attend scientific educations and careers. This project examines the effects of this campaign by doing a qualitative interpretation of the responses of two focus groups within the target group’s range. The study utilizes a reception analysis built on a multidimensional model of communication, and concludes that the campaign’s intended objective to a large degree would be considered potentially effective in implementing a message that would lead to a change in perception, in spite of some aspects of the campaign being counterproductive...|$|R

But the Mackay Court never addressed {{the legal status of}} strikebreakers, which it now began to do. [...] In Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, 463 U.S. 491 (1983), the Court held that strikebreakers who were offered <b>permanent</b> <b>employment</b> and then replaced to make room for returning strikers could seek relief in state court for breach of contract and misrepresentation. The Court also began to address the status of union members who crossed picket lines. [...] The Court upheld a union's ability to fine members who crossed picket lines and held that replaced strikers are entitled to reinstatement if the employer expands its workforce after a strike. However, the Supreme Court held that a union may not compel an employer to fire union members who cross a picket line. And in NLRB v. Granite State Joint Board, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court held that a union member who crosses a picket line can avoid union sanctions by simply resigning from the union. Upholding the right to freedom of association, the Court also held that unions may not constitutionally prohibit members from resigning in order to avoid sanctions for crossing picket lines. The right to work, the Court said, even protected an employer's right to entice striking workers back to work with promises of promotions or better pay.|$|E
