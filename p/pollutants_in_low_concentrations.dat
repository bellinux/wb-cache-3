30|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{forms the}} basis for a {{sustainable}} water management policy. With its implementation, the focus was addressed not only to measures like renaturations of stream systems but also to upgrades of wastewater treatment plants with the aim of improving the ecological conditions of streams and reducing discharges of trace pollutants into surface waters. In general, surface waters receive a large number of <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>concentrations</b> [1], especially due to the discharge of diffuse but also point sources like road runoffs in combination with storm water drainage systems. As a consequence, the aquatic fauna frequently experiences chronic exposure to low concentrations of harmful substances, which may result in a serious impairment of the health condition in the affected organisms. When it comes to the question of potential point sources, often little attention is given to storm water relief systems like storm water overflow basins (SOBs), storm water sedimentation basins (SSBs) or road runoff drainage systems. Particularly in the case of heavy rainfall events or enduring snowmelts, these systems gain further importance due to their massive discharge of untreated water (originating from municipal waste waters and road runoff) into the connected surface waters. These discharges contain a mixture of organic and inorganic contaminants that may cause multiple biological effects (e.g., estrogenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, or carcinogenic effects) due to interactions with multiple target sites in the exposed organisms [2, 3]. Ellis et al. [4] reported that 30 % of total hydrocarbons and 50 % of the total suspended solids in urban drainage water originate from road runoff. Such runoff contains a complex mixture of pollutants as, e.g., hydrocarbons, dioxins, metals, de-icing salts, and halogenated phenols originating mainly from traffic and vehicle abrasion [5]. These compounds are of particular concern since {{it has been shown that}} they can lead to adverse effects in aquatic organisms [6 – 9]. Once they (especially those with hydrophobic properties) have been emitted, they can accumulate in sediments and biota. One particular problem is that contaminants in sediments rarely cause effects as single substances, but rather in concert with numerous others that are present in complex mixtures [10]. Furthermore, many contaminants accumulate in the sediments of rivers and reach concentrations far higher than those in the surrounding water. As a consequence, benthic organisms such as invertebrates or ground-living fish species run the risk of continuous exposure to both dissolved and sediment-bound contaminants [11].|$|E
40|$|Every day {{numerous}} sources {{contribute to}} contaminate water resources with {{different types of}} pollutants among which organic compounds represent a major fraction. Conventional remediation processes {{are not able to}} remove completely all these contaminants, especially when the compounds are persistent and resistant to oxidation or when they are present in small concentrations, with the consequent increase of probability of find them even in drinking water. The most innovative techniques recently applied to water purification are based on advanced oxidation processes that use highly reactive species and oxidants such as O 3, and OH radicals. Examples are ozonation, the Fenton process and all techniques that combine UV radiation, H 2 O 2, O 3, with also the possible presence of a catalyst. A more recent approach, still under study and development, applies electrical discharges in the water or in the air above the water. Electrical discharges are the manifestation of the passage of current in a gas and are generated by applying a high voltage between an active electrode and a grounded electrode. The electrical discharge generates a plasma, a highly reactive environment which contains electrons, ions, excited molecules and radicals and as a whole is electrically neutral. When an electric non-thermalizing discharge is applied in a gas at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature a non-thermal plasma is produced, which is a system thermodynamically not at equilibrium, with high energy electrons in a gas which remains at room temperature. If the gas is air, the generated plasma is rich in active oxygen species such as O 3, •OH, O, O•-, O 2 •-, etc. It is therefore a strongly oxidizing environment that can be employed for the oxidation of any organic pollutant dissolved in the water. Electrical discharges can be applied directly in the water or above the water. From {{the point of view of}} energy discharges in the water are more costly. This is one reason that led the research group in which this thesis was carried out to develop a plasma reactor based on discharge above the water. Non-thermal plasma processing is a strongly interdisciplinary field covering engineering, physics and chemistry. It is evident from the literature that our present understanding of the chemical processes occurring in the plasma, and especially the mechanisms of pollutants degradation in water, is still rather incomplete. The aim of my thesis was to study the degradation products and mechanisms of non-thermal plasma induced advanced oxidation of some organic pollutants under well characterized experimental conditions. Phenol was chosen as a model pollutant, to study the role of the main oxidizing species of non-thermal plasma in air, the OH radical and ozone. The research was then extended to a few important emerging organic contaminants. The experiments were carried out with two prototype reactors built in the Department of Chemical Sciences in collaboration with the Department of Electrical Engineering of University of Padova. In this reactors plasma is generated by dielectric barrier discharges in air above the aqueous solution to be treated. In both reactors, the liquid phase is stationary while the air flows above the solution. They differ in size and in the number of wires that constitute the active electrode. In the first part of my project I tested and compared the performance of the two reactors and found that the larger one has an efficiency similar to that of the smaller but allows to treat larger quantities of solution (200 mL instead of 70 mL). This is a good result in view of possible scaling up of the process. Moreover larger samples of treated solution were available for the analyses. I first performed experiments at different pH and with different salts which showed that the oxidation of phenol is much favored in a basic environment. There appears to be no correlation between the reaction rate and the nature and concentration of the salts used (carbonate and phosphate). By means of ionic chromatography I identified and quantified some reaction intermediates. These results integrated with data obtained previously by our group by HPLC and ionic chromatography, TOC analysis and with data on CO 2 quantified by FT-IR spectroscopy, allowed me to determine the carbon balance. From these analyses it appeares that the rate of formation of CO 2 is much less than that of disappearance of phenol and that an important fraction of the organic carbon present in solution at the end of the treatment of phenol is yet to be identified. I measured the release of CO 2 as a function of the treatment time not only for phenol but also for numerous of its reaction intermediates treated individually under the same experimental conditions (formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid, malonic acid and glyoxal). Formic acid, the most advanced intermediate of phenol oxidation to CO 2, is the only one among those tested which is completely mineralized to CO 2 under the conditions investigated. The mechanism of phenol mineralization proceeds through several consecutive reaction steps and possibly involves also some competitive reactions. The slow determining step or steps in the oxidation are before formic acid degradation. I studied also the effect of the pollutant initial concentration on the process efficiency and found that efficiency increases as the pollutant concentration is reduced. Notably at the low pollutant concentrations present in the environment, the DBD discharge induced oxidation leads to complete mineralization of phenol. To determine the role of the main reactive species, O 3 and OH, I conducted a series of experiments of treatment of aqueous solutions containing phenol with ozone produced by ex situ discharge, i. e. ozonation, and in situ discharge, i. e. discharge applied directly above the aqueous solution. These experiments have shown that at the same concentration of ozone, the treatment of phenol with in situ discharge is more efficient. So I studied the phenol oxidation with DBD in the presence of tert-butanol, a compound that reacts very slowly with ozone and is used as an efficient OH radicals scavenger. I verified that in the presence of a large excess of tert-butanol the oxidation of phenol is significantly slowed down. The tert-butanol, treated individually, has proved very useful as a mechanistic probe because it reacts only with the OH radical and not with ozone. Therefore it allowed me to estimate the concentration of OH radicals present in solution under the different types of treatment and pH conditions investigated. Finally, the use of argon instead of air allowed me to generate a plasma without ozone and to study the oxidation process of phenol and of tert-butanol, treated individually and together, by the OH radical. The results of all these experiments allowed me to conclude that the greater efficiency of non-thermal plasma applied directly above the solution to be treated with respect to ozonation, is to be attributed to OH radicals produced directly from the in situ discharge. My attention finally turned to so-called emerging organic contaminants. Among them there are several drugs, whose presence in surface waters is documented since a couple of decades in many European countries. They are continuously released into waters from various sources especially from livestock and patients treated pharmacologically and, thanks to the increased sensitivity of today's detection techniques, they have been also detected in trace amounts in drinking water. I chose three drugs detected in Italian waters, especially in the Po Basin: carbamazepine, an antiepileptic, hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, and atenolol, a beta-blocker. I determined the rate of degradation in mQ water and in phosphate buffer at pH 7 and I found that the reactivity of the three compounds follows the order: carbamazepine > hydrochlorothiazide > atenolol. I determined the mineralization yields and I found that they considerably increase with decreasing concentration. This is a very encouraging result considering that the low concentrations used in my experiments are still ten thousand times greater than those found in natural waters. Finally, through HPLC analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-ESI) I have identified numerous oxidation intermediates of these drugs and found that in turn they undergo oxidative degradation in the course of the treatment. This thesis provides evidence that plasma treatment of aqueous solutions contaminated by organic compounds is a promising approach to develop novel techniques for water purification that can help the traditional remediation techniques, especially in the complete removal of persistent <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> <b>low</b> <b>concentrations...</b>|$|E

For this reason, strict standards have been established for them. In addition, chlorophenols are placed in the 38 th to 43 th in highest priority order of toxic pollutants. As a consequence, contaminated water or wastewaters with {{phenolic compounds}} have to be treated before discharging into the receiving water. In this study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been used in order to optimize the effect of main operational variables responsible for the higher 4 -chlorophenol removal by Activated Carbon-Supported Nanoscale Zero Valent Iron (AC/NZVI). A Box-Behnken factorial Design (BBD) with three levels was applied to optimize the initial concentration, time, pH, and adsorbent dose. The characterization of adsorbents was conducted by using SEM-EDS and XRD analyses. Furthermore, the adsorption isotherm and kinetics of 4 -chlorophenol on AC and AC/NZVI under various conditions were studied. The model anticipated 100 % removal efficiency for AC/NZVI at the optimum concentration (5. 48 mg 4 -chlorophenol/L), pH (5. 44), contact time (44. 7 min) and dose (0. 65 g/L). Analysis of the response surface quadratic model signified that the experiments are accurate and the model is highly significant.

Baby teeth are efficient indicators of environmental exposure {{of children to}} heavy metals. The aim {{of the present study}} is to determine the concentration of lead and cadmium in deciduous teeth of 5 - 12 year old girls and boys in Birjand in 2010. Materials and Methods: In this applied research, teeth samples of children were collected from different clinics of Birjand. The samples were prepared by means of acidolysis method and metal levels were measured using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Data analysis was conducted thanks to SPSS software (version 16) and P< 0. 05 was taken as the significant level. Results: Mean amount of lead and cadmium in teeth samples was 1. 96 ± 1. 62 and 0. 2 ± 0. 17 µg/g, respectively. The highest levels of lead was found in children’s molar teeth, while children’s incisor teeth had a higher level of cadmium. Besides, the amount of lead and cadmium was more in the boys' samples rather than the girls'. However, {{the difference between the two}} genders was not significant. Conclusion: Deciduous teeth are suitable bio indicators to monitor for environmental pollution with heavy metals. The metal levels of lead and cadmium in the teeth of boys are more than girls'.

40|$|Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are innovative, cost-effective, catalyzed {{chemical}} oxidation {{processes for}} treating <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> <b>low</b> or high <b>concentration</b> from contaminated soil, sludge and water. The common used AOPs {{in drinking water}} treatment include UV/H 2 O 2 process, UV/Ozone Process, UV/Titanium Dioxide and Fenton’s Reagent. AOPs are ultraviolet driven, which share predominance from photochemical technology, and often, give the clients dual benefit of both environmental contaminant treatment and disinfection. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are very disturbing contaminants measured in natural waters. Phenols and their tert-butyl derivatives are important contaminants belonging to EDCs. After a successful workshop for developing alternative drinking water treatments at Shanghai, AOPs with UV/H 2 O 2 technology are chosen to remove 4 -tert-butylphenol (4 TBP) from Shanghai water. The kinetics of reaction was studied {{in the first part}} of this thesis. The results show that UV/H 2 O 2 process can effectively decrease 4 TBP concentration than hydrogen peroxide alone. Good free oxidation radical production can be achieved within UV dose range from 0 to 200 mJ/cm 2 by a low pressure mercury lamp. The 4 TBP degradation process fits with pseudo first order equation for UV-dose and H 2 O 2 -dose. However, at very high H 2 O 2 -doses, the scavenging of hydroxyl-radicals needs to be taken into account. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of UV reactor and validation of CFD model were studied in the second part of this thesis work in order to provide an applicable UV reactor design for the 4 TBP treatment and also give possible reactor improvement suggestions. The CFD model used in this study is a 2 -D model developed using software Comsol, V 3. 3 a, based on a current UV reactor design at Kiwa Water Research, the Netherlands. The developed UV dose model includes three parts, a k-? flow model, a UV intensity model and a random walk model. Different feed flow rates and different lamp configurations were studied by the model. The calculation results show that a higher feed flow rate contributes to a relative narrow UV dose distribution than the lower flow rate. With three lamp configurations, position 0 is the best among the three with the highest average UV dose as well as the narrowest dose distribution pattern. Model also predicted low pressure lamps have about 8 % higher power output to UV dose efficiency than medium pressure lamps. Validation of the flow model was helped by flow measurements at Delft University of Technology. Experimental studies of velocity measurements by Laser Doppler Velocity Meter were conducted together with salt and dye dose experiments. After comparisons of model predictions and experimental measurements, it was found that the k-? CFD flow model demonstrated generally good qualitative prediction of flow inside the reactor but failed to give correct prediction of recirculation zones behind the quartz tubes. There are dead zones of water at the top and bottom near the inlet of the reactor. Bigger areas exist behind the quartz tubes that have water recirculation than the model predicted, which may result 25 % of more UV dose prediction by the model. And differences caused by 2 -D model and 3 -D measurements may result about 20 % less UV dose model prediction. Current UV reactor design at Kiwa Water Research, position 0 and low pressure mercury lamps applied at a feed flow rate of 4. 1 m 3 /h appears to be an applicable design for advanced oxidation treatment of 4 TBP by UV/H 2 O 2 in Shanghai. High roughness quartz tubes walls and relative smaller ratio of reactor to feed pipe diameters are recommended to improve reactor performance in the recirculation and dead zones with current design. Further investigations of the dose model and UV-sensitive dyed microspheres particle tracking experiments are recommended. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
