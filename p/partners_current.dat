This paper describes a project started by small farmers and landless labourers in a semiarid areas of south India. The aim is to upgrade dryland holdings of the member families through economically sound dry land horticulture, community woodlots, and planting of fast growing species along orchard and field boundaries.

Irradiation is an approved treatment to control quarantine insect pests in 17 fruits and 7 vegetables for export from Hawaii to the US mainland. The commercial X-ray irradiation facility, Hawaii Pride LLC, has been shipping tropical fruits and vegetables to the US mainland using irradiation since 2000. Hawaiian purple sweet potato is the highest volume product with annual exports of more than 12 million lbs (5, 500 tonnes). The advent of generic radiation treatments for tephritid fruit flies (150 Gy) and other insects (400 Gy) has accelerated commodity export approvals and facilitated adoption by foreign trading <b>partners.</b> <b>Current</b> impediments to wider adoption include the labeling requirement, the 1 kGy limit for fresh horticultural products, and non-acceptance of phytosanitary irradiation in Japan and the European Union. USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has restricted the use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for irradiated fresh fruits exported to the US due to possible increased radiotolerance in the target insects. Data are presented for response of melon fly in papaya to several types of MAP with radiation treatment at 45 – 65 Gy. Low oxygen atmospheres can increase insect radio-tolerance, but the effect is dependent on oxygen concentration and radiation dose...|$|E

To validate our findings, we examined in detail the endoplasmic reticulum-bound transcription factor Spt 23, which we identified as a putative Ubx 2 substrate. Mutant ubx 2 Δ cells are deficient in both cleaving the ubiquitinated 120 kDa precursor of Spt 23 to form active p 90 and in localizing p 90 to the nucleus, resulting in reduced expression of the target gene OLE 1, which encodes fatty acid desaturase.

A sample of 88 patients with colorectal cancer and their partners completed questionnaires approximately 3 and 9  months after diagnosis. The data were analyzed employing dyadic data analytic approaches. In the short-term, spousal active engagement—which involved discussing feelings and engaging in joint problem solving—was positively associated with relationship satisfaction in patients as well as in partners, but only when past spousal support was relatively low. Spousal protective buffering—which involved hiding worries and fears and avoiding talking about the disease—was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction in patients, again only when past spousal support was relatively low. If past spousal support was high, participants rated the quality of their relationship relatively high, regardless of their <b>partner’s</b> <b>current</b> support behavior. Over time, past spousal supportiveness was not found to mitigate the negative association between spousal protective buffering and relationship satisfaction. Overall, our results indicate that relationship satisfaction can be maintained if past spousal supportiveness is high even if the partner is currently not very responsive to the individual’s needs, at least in the short-term...|$|R

We compare scenarios where both Chinese and other emerging Asian export prices change by the same proportion to the case where export prices remain constant in one country and increase in the other.

40|$|Since 2004 Egypt''s {{growth has}} been {{accelerating}} {{in step with the}} launching of a series of ambitious reforms, reversing a trend during the preceding half-decade when Egypt''s growth rate fell below that of most regional peers and well below that of the average developing country. This paper seeks to identify factors that held back Egypt''s growth in the recent past, and explores whether recent reforms have removed the most binding constraints to allow at least a temporary growth spurt. Overall, the Egyptian reforms launched in 2004 appear to have focused well on the most critical constraints-reducing red tape and tax rates, and improving access to foreign exchange-thereby getting a strong growth response out of a limited set of reforms. However, inefficient bureaucracy remains an important obstacle to higher growth and reforms in this area should continue to have high payoffs. Ongoing reforms are also addressing constraints that are likely to become binding soon (or have become so already), such as inefficient financial intermediation and high public debt.

The authors present an interesting development in cyber liability insurance which provides the basis for a cost-effective solution that will encourage good information assurance across the supply chain. The solution offered in association with a major International insurer is explained in detail in this paper. It has the dual advantages for participating SMEs of ensuring that they achieve a level of information assurance that will offer them actual protection, {{and at the same time}} provide them with insurance that will protect them financially against data breaches or other costly consequences of weak information security. The scheme used will provide actuarial evidence for the insurer to further refine the model. Clients that cannot show evidence of a base level of security will not get insurance cover; by contrast those assessed as being more secure will be eligible for a discount.
