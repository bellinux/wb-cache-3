30|$|Figure  5 {{illustrates}} {{the outcomes of}} active management with S 1 that the charging process of PEV is non-interruptible, and it starts to charge whenever arriving if needed. There are 694 PEVs to be charged during the dispatching horizon in this case. As shown in Fig.  5, the charging load grows {{with more and more}} PEVs to be <b>pluged</b> in when people arrive home from work, and it is not until time period 16 : 00 – 17 : 00, when the load demand is larger than the forecasted PV generation, there is no curtaiment in PV generation. The power purchased from the upper grid increases from time period 15 : 00 – 16 : 00 and eventually becomes the dominate power source, with the PV generation decreases to zero gradually due to getting dark. And from the time period 7 : 00 – 8 : 00 in Day 2, the power purchased from the upper grid decreases for the power generated by PV increases. In the intelligent charging mode, when S 2 is adopted, the charging load of PEVs is distributed among the dispatching horizons, as shown in Fig.  6. And the power purchased from the upper grid is altered as well, which has a smaller peak compared with S 1. The economic benefit obtained is 166695 Yuan, and 4  % more than that in S 1, as shown in Table  2. The scenario is illustrated in Fig.  7 when the discharging mode is considered. There are 747 PEVs involved in the active management process, and an obvious pattern, that the equivalent charging process moves to the midnight and the next early morning when the residential load and electricity price are low, can be observed in Fig.  7. The price purchasing power the upper grid from time 17 : 00 to 24 : 00 is higher than discharging cost, so PEVs are scheduled to discharge to compensate the peak load without violating the constraints of the PEVs. And the distribution company can get the most benefit, 14.89  % more compared with that in S 1, when S 3 is adopted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During {{two years}} (1983 - 1985), 8 red rains were {{collected}} in the Montseny mountains. The suspended matter contained in red rains has its source in the Sahara desert and corresponds to fine silts. Due to the calcite content of dust responsible for the red rains, these rains are alkaline with a volume weighted mean pH of 7. 7 versus 4. 7 of non-red rains. Estimated HCO; alkalinity input due to red rains is 0. 21 keqlhalyr and total annual HCO; alkalinity input is 0. 24 keqlhalyr. To that figure, one has to add at least 0. 24 keqlhalyr due to the alkalinity of calcite contained in red dust. For the same period, hydrogen input in bulk deposition amounts to 0. 19 keqlhalyr. These results indicate that acidity due to non-red rain espisodes is neutralized on an annual basis, with red rains being the major neutralizing agent. Ion concentrations in red rains are high, which makes them {{an important source of}} nutrients even though they only account for 5. 4 % of annual preci itation. Red rains are particularly enriched with ca 2 + having a P+ volume-weighted mean Ca concentration 14 times higher than non-red rains and delivering 46 % of the annual inputs of soluble ca 2 + in bulk precipitation at Montseny.

More modern versions of the pattern feature a [...] "pluge pulse." [...] The white square lines up {{so that it is}} below the green and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The <b>pluge</b> (short for [...] "Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level, a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black, and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or [...] "blacker than black"). The <b>pluge</b> pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as [...] "crushing the blacks"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost <b>pluge</b> bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinuishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see YIQ), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 MHz color subcarrier portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.These bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term, [...] "bars and tone". Typically, a television network, TV station, or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 Hz audio tone before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record [...] "bars and tone" [...] {{at the beginning of a}} videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be calibrated.

En zones que s'han de repoblar, ja sigui desprès d'un incendi o una desforestació, varia molt el tipus d'arbre que s'ha de plantar per facilitar la repoblació. En aquesta tesina es pretenia crear un model numèric per estudiar quin es el comportament del impacte d'una gota d'aigua en una fulla per poder, en un futur, modelitzar diferents tipus de fulla i determinar quins tipus d'arbre són millors per al repoblament, depenent del comportament de les fulles. Per tal de poder estudiar l’impacte primerament s’ha estudiat la fulla i les seves propietats amb la finalitat de poder donar una resposta a l’acció que rebrà per part de la gota. Amb l’objectiu d’estudiar les característiques de la fulla es va optar per fer un estudi {{experimental}} i així obtenir les dades base per poder comparar qualsevol anàlisis numèric. Primerament es van escollir 4 fulles d’arbre, en concret de l’Acer saccharum. Seguidament es van pesar, mesurar i escanejar per tal de poder-ne treure les característiques físiques principals. Posteriorment es va haver de determinar el mòdul de Young de la fulla. Per obtenir el valor es va simular al Laboratori de Morfodinàmica Fluvial del GITS (Grup d’investigació en transport de Sediments) la deformació de la fulla, encastant l’extrem de la base del pecíol i estudiant la deformació {{a causa de}} la deformada a partir del pes propi i d’una carga puntual incremental a l’altre extrem del pecíol. A continuació es va crear el model numèric mitjançant la fulla de càlcul Excel i tot seguit es va simular l’experiment mitjançant el programa d’anàlisis Comsol. Mitjançant la fulla d’Excel es va poder determinar el mòdul de Young de la fulla. Mitjançant els resultats obtinguts amb el Comsol i comparant-los amb les dades experimentals s’ha confirmat que el valor del mòdul de Young és correcte. During rainfalls avenues, {{the water}} which arrives in the subsoil under trees changes between {{the different types of}} them. In places where it is needed to be replanted, because the area has been burned by fire or it has suffered deforestation, the selection of the tree needed to replant the area is so decisive. At the beginning of this thesis expect to be the numerical method to study which is the behavior of a tree leaf being impacted by a water droplet. This was the starter for a study which would allow us to make a model of different types of tree leaves and that would permit us to decide which ones are better for a replantation. In order to study the impact of the droplet, firstly we have got to study the leaf and its properties so as {{to be able to give}} an answer about the movement of the leaf touched by the droplet. For that reason we did an experimental analysis to get the results of a real deformation and later we could compare the other results. First of all we choose four tree leaves form the “Acer saccharum” tree. Straight afterwards we weight, measure and scan so that we can have the principal physics features. After that we have to determinate the Young modulus of the tree leaf. In order to know that value we simulate in the Morfodinamical fluvial Laboratory of GITS “(Grup d’investigació en transport de Sediments) ” the leaf deformation. We embed the base of the petiole and we study the deformation of the leaf because of its own weight and the incremental point load at the other end of the petiole. After that we create a numerical method using the Excel spreadsheets and later we simulate the experiment using the analysis element Comsol. By means of Excel we are able to obtain the elastic modulus of the leaf. Finally we enter these values in Comsol and comparing its results with the experimental information we achieve to confirm that we have found the Young modulus correctly...|$|R

A més, com a novetat, també es proposa una evolució d'aquest darrer índex, l'índex s. Amb tots aquestos índex es va fer una comparativa respecte a la informació que ens proporcionà cada episodi, a més, també es va comprovar l'adaptació dels índexs als valors empírics mitjançant un estudi de correlacions R i de MNAE. Els índexs IP i Beta tenen una bona correlació amb la intensitat màxima de cada episodi, mentre que els índexs n i s, descriuen el comportament temporal de la pluja, independentment de la intensitat. Amb això, l'índex que millor es relaciona amb la convectivitat és n_s.

Results show that IP and ß index have a good correlation with the maximum intensity of each episode, whereas n and s index describe quite well the rain temporal behaviour, regardless of the intensity. Thus, according to these results the best index for the convective mode of rain is ns. Finally, it can be concluded that each index has different uses and operational aspects with pros and cons.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen delivered to streams and groundwater has substantially {{increased in the}} last decades due to anthropogenic impacts. This fact has stimulated research on processes related to the nitrogen cycling in order to elucidate the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in controlling nitrogen loads. Some of these studies pointed out during storms streamwater chemistry is significantly altered. However, because of the inherent difficulty of an extensive field experimental setting for dealing with episodic storms, studies focused on hydrological processes or stream solute dynamics during storms rely on a very limited number of events. Hydrobiogeochemical processes have been mainly studied in temperate experimental catchments and {{little attention has been}} paid to Mediterranean catchments. Recent studies have stressed the fragility of Mediterranean regions in front of the global change and because of that Mediterranean regions should become hot spots for present and future studies. The main goal of the present thesis was to study the variability of nutrient dynamics, in particular nitrogen, during stormflow in relation to baseflow conditions in Fuirosos, an intermittent stream draining a small Mediterranean catchment (Part I). As a secondary objective (Part II), solute dynamics in Fuirosos were compared with those measured at one of its main tributaries, the Grimola stream. Biotitic granodiorite was an important fraction of the Fuirosos catchment, whereas the Grimola catchment was underlain by leucogranite. The Fuirosos stream had an alluvial zone and it was flanked by a well developed riparian forest, whereas the Grimola stream had not a significant alluvial zone, neither a well developed riparian area. Thereby, the effect of (i) catchment size, (ii) lithology and (iii) the presence of an alluvial-riparian zone on stream hydrogrochemistry were assessed by comparing the Fuirosos and Grimola streams. The Fuirosos Stream Watershed, a relatively undisturbed Mediterranean ecosystem that can not be considered a N-saturated catchment, leaks to the stream most of the nitrogen loss in the form of nitrate (57 %). This figure contrast with that reported for other pristine tropical and humid catchments where nitrogen export is mainly in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen. In particular, nitrate is mainly mobilized during stormflow conditions (from 52 % to 80 % of the annual yield). Contrastingly, most of the dissolved organic carbon export occurs during baseflow conditions (from 40 to 70 % of the annual yield). These results point to a decoupling between soil nitrification and nutrient uptake by biota, which brings about the leaking of nitrate to the stream. Hydrochemistry in this Mediterranean intermittent stream is highly variable within and in between years. The antecedent moisture conditions and the magnitude of storm events are key factors on shaping the hydrological responses to storm events. However, storm episodes that occur during similar climatological and hydrological conditions produce different streamwater chemistry depending upon the time of the year. This is so, mainly because of the influence of the summer drought period on streamwater chemistry. Both, the mixing model (EMMA) and the spectral analysis approaches, point out that groundwater is the most important contributor to stormflow in Fuirosos. Nonetheless, the EMMA approach emphasizes how stream water and nitrate sources vary throughout the year. Our results stress the importance of sampling storms during all seasons to draw general conclusions about watershed processes. The mixing model shows that nitrate is retained by biota in the Fuirosos alluvial zone only when streamflow is lower than 80 l/s. Above this threshold, the system is not efficient in retaining nitrate arriving from the catchment. This result might be keep on mind when establishing the importance of near- and in-stream processes for regulating catchment nitrate loads since a major fraction of the annual nitrate export usually occurs during stormflow conditions in many catchments. The spectral analysis also shows that the variability of stream nitrate concentrations is more damped in Fuirosos than in Grimola. This is attributed to the buffer effect that biota has on nitrate concentrations in the Fuirosos alluvial zone, which retards its delivery in relation to the Grimola catchment. "Efecte de les <b>pluges</b> en la dinàmica del nitrogen en una riera intermitent i mediterrània" La quantitat de nitrogen dissolt que arriba avui dia als nostres rius i aqüífers és substancialment major a la de fa un parell de dècades a resultes de l'activitat antròpica. Aquest fet ha estimulat força la recerca dels processos relacionats amb el ciclatge del nitrogen, amb la intenció d'esbrinar la capacitat que tenen els ecosistemas terrestres i aquàtics per controlar les càrregues de nitrat que els hi arriben. Alguns d'aquests estudis indiquen que durant les tempestes s'altera de forma substancial la química de l'aigua del riu. Això no obstant, la major part dels treballs realitzats es recolzen en un nombre limitat d'episodis, donada la dificultat inherent al mostreig intensiu de camp a l'hora d'estudiar les respostes hidrològiques i la dinàmica dels soluts durant les crescudes. Tradicionalment, la comunitat científica s'ha dedicat a l'estudi dels processos hidrobiogeoquímics de regions temperades i tropicals, i desafortunadament, les conques Mediterrànies no han estat objecte de la seva atenció. Estudis recents alerten de la fragilitat de les regions Mediterrànies enfront del canvi global, i per tant, urgeixen els estudis focalitzats en aquests ecosistemes. El principal objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha estat l'estudi de la variabilitat de la dinàmica dels nutrients, en particular del nitrogen, durant les crescudes en relació a la seva dinàmica en condicions de cabal basal en una riera intermitent, Fuirosos, en una conca Mediterrània. La hidrologia i la dinàmica dels soluts a la riera de Fuirosos s'ha comparat amb les de la Grimola, un dels seus efluents més importants. Hi ha diferències litològiques notables entre les dues conques. A més la riera de Fuirosos té zona al. luvial i està flanquejada per un bosc de ribera ben desenvolupat, mentre que la riera de Grimola no té zona al. luvial ni tampoc una zona riberenca ben diferenciada. Per tant, els efectes de (i) la mida de la conca, (ii) la litologia, i (iii) la presència d'una zona al. luvial i riberenca sobre la hidrobiogeoquímica d'un riu, van poder ésser contrastats comparant les rieres de Fuirosos i Grimola.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the sedimentological/stratigraphic and {{structural}} evolution of the sedimentary rocks {{that occur in the}} NW continental border of the Potiguar Basin. These rocks are well exposed along coastal cliffs between the localities of Lagoa do Mato and Icapuí, Ceará State (NE Brazil). The sedimentological/stratigraphic study involved, at the outcrop scale, detailed facies descriptions, profile mapping of the vertical succession of different beds, and columnar sections displaying inferred lateral relationships. The approach was complemented by granulometric and petrographic analyses, including the characterization of heavy mineral assemblages. The data set allowed to recognize two kinds of lithological units, a carbonate one of very restricted occurrence {{at the base of the}} cliffs, and three younger, distinct siliciclastic units, that predominate along the cliffs, in vertical and lateral extent. The carbonate rocks were correlated to the late Cretaceous Jandaíra Formation, which is covered by the siliciclastic Barreiras Formation. The Barreiras Formation occurs in two distinct structural settings, the usual one with nondeformed, subhorizontal strata, or as tilted beds, affected by strong deformation. Two lithofacies were recognized, vertically arranged or in fault contacts. The lower facies is characterized by silty-argillaceous sandstones with low-angle cross bedding; the upper facies comprises medium to coarse grained sandstones, with conglomeratic layers. The Tibau Formation (medium to coarse-grained sandstones with argillite intercalations) occurs at the NW side of the studied area, laterally interlayered with the Barreiras Formation. Eolic sediments correlated to the Potengi Formation overly the former units, either displaying an angular unconformity, or simply an erosional contact (stratigraphic unconformity). Outstanding structural features, identified in the Barreiras Formation, led to characterize a neocenozoic stress field, which generated faults and folds and/or reactivated older structures in the subjacent late cretaceous (to paleogene, in the offshore basin) section. The structures recognized in the Barreiras Formation comprise two distinct assemblages, namely a main extensional deformation between the localities of Ponta Grossa and Redonda, and a contractional style (succeeded by oblique extensional structures) at Vila Nova. In the first case, the structural assemblage is dominated by N-S (N± 20 °Az) steep to gently-dipping extensional faults, displaying a domino-style or listric geometry with associated roll-over structures. This deformation pattern is explained by an E-W/WNW extension, contemporaneous with deposition of the upper facies of the Barreiras Formation, during the time interval Miocene to Pleistocene. Strong rotation of blocks and faults generated low-angle distensional faults and, locally, subvertical bedding, allowing to estimate very high strain states, with extension estimates varying between 40 % up to 200 %. Numerous detachment zones, parallel to bedding, help to acommodate this intense deformation. The detachment surfaces and a large number of faults display mesoscopic features analoguous to the ones of ductile shear zones, with development of S-C fabrics, shear bands, sigmoidal clasts and others, pointing to a hydroplastic deformation regime in these cases. Local occurrences of the Jandaíra limestone are controled by extensional faults that exhume the pre-Barreiras section, including an earlier event with N-S extension. Finally, WNWtrending extensional shear zones and faults are compatible with the Holocene stress field along the present continental margin. In the Vila Nova region, close to Icapuí, gentle normal folds with fold hinges shallowly <b>pluging</b> to SSW affect the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, displaying an incipient dissolution cleavage associated with an extension lineation at high rake (a S>L fabric). Deposition of the upper facies siliciclastics is controlled by pull-apart graben structures, bordered by N-NE-trending sinistral-normal shear zones and faults, characterizing an structural inversion. Microstructures are compatible with tectonic deformation of the sedimentary pile, burried at shallow depths. The observed features point to high pore fluid pressures during deformation of the sediments, producing hydroplastic structures through mechanisms of granular flow. Such structures are overprinted by microfractures and microfaults (an essentially brittle regime), tracking the change to microfracturing and frictional shear mechanisms accompanying progressive dewatering and sediment lithification. Correlation of the structures observed at the surface with those present at depth was tested through geophysical data (Ground Penetrating Radar, seismics and a magnetic map). EW and NE-trending lineaments are observed in the magnetic map. The seismic sections display several examples of positive flower structures which affect the base of the cretaceous sediments; at higher stratigraphic levels, normal components/slips are compatible with the negative structural inversion characterized at the surface. Such correlations assisted in proposing a structural model compatible with the regional tectonic framework. The strong neogenepleistocene deformation is necessarily propagated in the subsurface, affecting the late cretaceous section (Açu and Jandaíra formations), wich host the hydrocarbon reservoirs in this portion of the Potiguar Basin. The proposed structural model is related to the dextral transcurrent/transform deformation along the Equatorial Margin, associated with transpressive terminations of E-W fault zones, or at their intersections with NE-trending lineaments, such as the Ponta Grossa-Fazenda Belém one (the LPGFB, itself controlled by a Brasiliano-age strike-slip shear zone). In a first step (and possibly during the late Cretaceous to Paleogene), this lineament was activated under a sinistral transpressional regime (antithetic to the main dextral deformation in the E-W zones), giving way to the folds in the lower facies of the Barreiras Formation, as well as the positive flower structures mapped through the seismic sections, at depth. This stage was succeeded (or was penecontemporaneous) by the extensional structures related to a (also sinistral) transtensional movement stage, associated to volcanism (Macau, Messejana) and thermal doming processes during the Neogene-Pleistocene time interval. This structural model has direct implications to hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities at this sector of the Potiguar Basin and its offshore continuation. The structure of the reservoirs at depth (Açu Formation sandstones of the post-rift section) may be controlled (or at least, strongly influenced) by the deformation geometry and kinematics characterized at the surface. In addition, the deformation event recognized in the Barreiras Formation has an age close to the one postulated for the oil maturation and migration in the basin, between the Oligocene to the Miocene. In this way, the described structural cenario represents a valid model to understand the conditions of hydrocarbon transport and acummulation through space openings, trap formation and destruction. This model is potentially applicable to the NW region of the Potiguar Basin and other sectors with a similar structural setting, along the brazilian Equatorial Atlantic MarginEsta tese contempla a caracterização sedimentológica/litoestratigráfica e estrutural das rochas sedimentares na porção continental NW da Bacia Potiguar, e que afloram em falésias no setor litorâneo compreendido entre as localidades de Lagoa do Mato e Icapuí, Ceará (NE do Brasil). Os estudos sedimentológicos /estratigráficos das unidades mapeadas, em escala de afloramento, envolveram descrições faciológicas, levantamento de perfis com empilhamento vertical das diferentes camadas, e a construção de seções colunares caracterizando as relações laterais observadas. Ainda foram realizados estudos granulométricos e petrográficos, bem como a identificação das assembléias de minerais pesados. O conjunto desses dados permitiu identificar dois grupos de litologias, representados por uma unidade carbonática, que ocorre de forma restrita na base das falésias, e três unidades siliciclásticas, que predominam lateral e verticalmente, nas falésias. As rochas carbonáticas, correlacionadas à Formação Jandaíra, do Cretáceo superior, são capeadas pelas rochas siliciclásticas da Formação Barreiras. A Formação Barreiras ocorre em dois contextos estruturais distintos, sob a forma de estratos horizontalizados e não deformados, a situação mais usual, ou com camadas basculadas e afetadas por forte deformação. Foram individualizadas duas litofácies, dispostas verticalmente em contatos normais, ou por falhas. A denominada fácies inferior é composta por arenitos síltico-argilosos com estratificação cruzada de baixo ângulo; a fácies superior é caracterizada por arenitos médios a grossos, maciços, com intercalações conglomeráticas. No extremo NW da área ocorre uma segunda unidade, a Formação Tibau (arenitos médios a grossos com intercalações de argilitos), que está lateralmente interdigitada com a Formação Barreiras. Finalmente, no topo das unidades anteriores ocorrem sedimentos eólicos correlacionados à Formação Potengi. A discordância na base desta última unidade (a Formação Potengi) torna-se nítida quando os estratos sotopostos estão basculados e falhados (discordância angular). Para os demais casos, o contato é erosional (discordância estratigráfica). Na área estudada, chamam atenção as feições estruturais identificadas na Formação Barreiras, que permitem caracterizar o campo de tensões neocenozóico, que gerou falhas e dobras e/ou reativou estruturas mais antigas na seção neocretácica (a paleógena, no setor offshore da bacia) subjacente. As feições estruturais identificadas nas rochas da Formação Barreiras permitem distinguir duas situações|$|R
