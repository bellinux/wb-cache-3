5|$|In 1928, Sverdrup {{joined with}} his former University of Minnesota {{engineering}} professor John Ira <b>Parcel</b> {{in the formation of}} Sverdrup & <b>Parcel,</b> a civil engineering firm with a speciality field of bridges. <b>Parcel</b> had tenure at Minnesota {{for a long time and}} was reluctant to sever his ties completely, but eventually he decided to join the new company, taking an unpaid Sabbatical from the university for one year. Sverdrup owned 60% and <b>Parcel</b> 40%of the new firm, which opened its doors on 1 April 1928. The company's headquarters was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel's first contract was for the design of a bridge over the Missouri River at Hermann, Missouri, for which it received a fee of $33,000. While at the Missouri State Highway Department Sverdrup met D. C. Wolfe and E. R. Grant, and he asked them if they would join the company. Sverdrup subsequently hired design engineer Brice R. Smith from Missouri's leading supplier of bridge components. By 1936, all three would become partners in the firm.|$|E

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a <b>parcel</b> of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a <b>parcel</b> of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a <b>parcel</b> must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|Heat bursts {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a {{rapid increase in}} temperature and decrease in dew point (moisture).

The <b>parcel</b> descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E

5|$|Paddington was {{extended}} again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge {{and a new}} <b>parcel</b> depot was built. Suburban services, which had never been considered important at Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.13–16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936. By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 <b>parcel</b> bags every day.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{investigated}} proximity effects of greening, we know of no previous study that has employed a cadastral measure to examine proximity effects for urban residential landscapes. Cadastral refers to property boundaries, which is {{a different way to}} measure proximity compared with Euclidean measures, which are typically used. We assumed that each residential property would be managed homogeneously for cues to care (Nassauer, 2011) in visible front and side yards, and that consequently, measurement units delineated by residential properties boundaries would be more valid than units defined by Euclidean distance for measuring heterogeneity in landscape care. We investigated whether cadastral locations for surrounding residential properties significantly affect care for occupied residential <b>parcels</b> in two neighborhoods of Detroit, MI, USA, that are characterized by high levels of vacancy and abandonment of residential property. We used data describing cues to care for 8967 residential <b>parcels</b> information in the Brightmoor and Eastside neighborhoods. These data were collected by inspection of Google Street images checked by field inspection in summer 2011. We tested the relationship between each occupied <b>parcel’s</b> front yard cues to care and its surrounding parcels’ occupancy and care characteristics at eight cadastral locations. We describe these cadastral locations in Fig. 1. We hypothesized that for all surrounding parcels’ characteristics, cadastral locations that were adjacent, face-face and rook-face locations relative to the case <b>parcels</b> would influence the care of case <b>parcels,</b> and that adjacent <b>parcels</b> would have the greatest influence on care of case <b>parcels.</b> We hypothesized that back-back <b>parcels</b> and rook-back <b>parcels,</b> in contrast, would have no significant relationship with care of the case <b>parcels,</b> despite having similar Euclidean distances from the case <b>parcels.</b> Considering different care characteristics of surrounding <b>parcels,</b> we hypothesized that positive care of surrounding <b>parcels</b> would more powerfully affect cues to care of case <b>parcels</b> than would abandoned houses or vacant land on surrounding <b>parcels</b> (Table 2). We further hypothesized that, compared with vacant land, abandoned houses on surrounding <b>parcels</b> would have a stronger negative effect on care of case <b>parcels.</b> Results show that cadastral measures are an important way to analyze and interpret the influence of people’s behavior to cities’ appearance, and the results may guide city planners and policy makers to find a more effective way to revitalize high-vacancy city areas...|$|R

5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air <b>parcel</b> in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} <b>parcel</b> and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the <b>parcel.</b> Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the <b>parcel</b> in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
