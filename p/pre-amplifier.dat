25|$|The {{hair cells}} are {{arranged}} in four rows in the organ of Corti along {{the entire length of}} the cochlear coil. Three rows consist of outer hair cells (OHCs) and one row consists of inner hair cells (IHCs). The inner hair cells provide the main neural output of the cochlea. The outer hair cells, instead, mainly receive neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea's mechanical <b>pre-amplifier.</b> The input to the OHC is from the olivary body via the medial olivocochlear bundle.|$|E
25|$|Where old disc {{recordings}} {{are considered}} to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s. Anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (<b>pre-amplifier)</b> and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>pre-amplifiers</b> are {{designed}} to accept signals from source components without overloading, and Naim claims total stability and a very wide open-loop bandwidth. The half-size <b>pre-amplifiers</b> were modular, consisting of a mother board for higher-level signals into which are plugged various daughter boards that deal with lower-level signals such as phono and tape. Phono boards are plug-in modules {{to provide for the}} gain and equalisation of the cartridge output to line level, and some of the earlier <b>pre-amplifiers</b> may be suffixed with [...] "N", [...] "S", or [...] "K" [...] depending on the phono boards carried. [...] "S" [...] and [...] "K" [...] are for low output moving coil cartridges (the latter being for cartridges requiring a higher impedance load), and the [...] "N" [...] for high output moving coil and moving magnet cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Some phono <b>pre-amplifiers</b> {{implement}} a rumble filter, {{in an attempt}} to remove the noise. A heavier platter can also help dampen this.|$|R
500|$|The {{amplifier}} {{has what}} the manufacturer calls a [...] "dual-mode power supply", where the output stage is only loosely regulated, {{so it is}} free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the <b>pre-amplifier</b> and tone control stages. It is thus claimed that intermodulation distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.|$|E
500|$|Up to {{that point}} a {{manufacturer}} of solid-state pre-/power- amplifier separates, Naim Audio wanted an entry-level integrated amplifier to complement their range and widen their appeal. They worked to create a low-powered model that shared the family characteristics and sound. The approach, seemingly against the received wisdom {{of the time that}} power and sound quality go hand in hand, remained nevertheless controversial, despite the fact that NAD Electronics had trail-blazed five years earlier with the top-selling low-cost audiophile amplifier, the [...] The Naim Audio Integrated amplifier (or NAIT) was created by Julian Vereker as a minimalist black shoe-box design that includes a phono and two line-level inputs – one for tuner and one for tape recorder.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps {{and modern}} practice amps, {{have only a}} single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called [...] "preamplifier" [...] or [...] "gain" [...] and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control works differently on different guitar amp designs. On an amp designed for acoustic guitar, turning up the preamp knob pre-amplifies the signal—but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, turning up the preamp or gain knob usually produces overdrive distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: <b>pre-amplifier,</b> distortion and master control. Turning up the preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the [...] "gain" [...] knob [...] {{is equivalent to the}} distortion control on a distortion pedal, and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.|$|E
50|$|Electrically, the <b>pre-amplifiers</b> are bandwidth-limited, {{and while}} Naim {{is open to}} the {{possibility}} that users might match their pre-amps with another make of power amplifier, Naim warns against using other makes of <b>pre-amplifiers</b> with Naim power amplifiers, arguing that the former define the operating parameters of the latter and guarantee its stability. In practice, modern products' bandwidth has been much extended, but the pre- and power-amplifiers are of such a tight operational fit and sonic synergy that they are rarely used with other makes.|$|R
50|$|Power for the <b>pre-amplifiers</b> {{is drawn}} {{either from the}} 24V {{regulated}} feed from the power amplifier, or from independent power supplies. While being optional at the lower end, external power supplies are obligatory with the flagship models, from the NAC 52 (1990) to the NAC 552 (2002). The 552 was designed to work with an external PSU with an 800VA toroidal transformer that Naim says has enough capacity to supply a 300-400 W power amplifier. As at April 2013, Naim {{have a range of}} six <b>pre-amplifiers</b> at various price points between £1,050 and £18,250.|$|R

When the company upgraded the range in 2002, the NAC 102, NAC 82 and NAC 52 <b>pre-amplifiers</b> were given new names beginning with [...] "2", thus becoming the NAC 202, NAC 282 and NAC 252 respectively; a flagship 5-Series [...] "cost-no-object" [...] amplifier launched also that year was given the designation NAC 552.|$|R

50|$|Naim <b>pre-amplifiers</b> do {{not have}} {{on-board}} power, but {{are designed to be}} powered either from a dedicated feed from the PSU inside the power amplifier, or directly from an independent external PSU. This is done so that the sensitive pre-amps, running at extremely very low voltages and currents, are not adversely affected by the hum field induced by the power supply. Power units have multiple separate secondary windings dedicated to supplying the various sections of the preamp that they feed. However, the NAP 250, NAP 135 and NAP 300 power amplifiers {{do not have}} provision to power <b>pre-amplifiers,</b> so a PSU is mandatory.|$|R
