PR]), for the rate of convergence in Kolmogorov distance of the expected spectral distribution of a Wigner random matrix ensemble to the semicircular law. Here we relax the moment conditions for entries of the Wigner matrices from order 8 to order 4 + ϵ for an arbitrary small ϵ> 0. Comment: This paper is an addendum to arXiv: 1405. 7820, relaxing moment conditions in Theorem 1. 3 of that <b>paper</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 4 +ϵ.
