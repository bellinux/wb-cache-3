40|$|Transcatheter renal artery {{embolization}} {{was performed}} in four dogs with <b>propyliodone,</b> a contrast media for bronchography, as embolic substance. The renal artery could be embolized as aimed. Despite our careful maneuver to avoid reflux of the substance, spinal cord injury developed in 3 dogs due to embolization of anterior spinal arteries. <b>Propyliodone</b> is highly radio-opaque material. However, reflux or spread of this material during maneauver could not be detected by television monitoring. Postoperative routine radiograms also could not prove it. The spinal cord was isolated by autopsy and radiophoto graphed by soft x-ray. Small amount of the substance was the detected. In clinical renal artery embolization, reflux of the embolic substance may occur more frequently than anticipated. In human, iflumbo-sacral cord is supplied with the second to third lumbar arteries, namely below the renal artery, risk of spinal cord injury on renal artery embolizaticn is quite high. This maneuver should never be carried out with easy mind...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the laryngeal reflex during dental treatment in two groups of children was tested using <b>propyliodone</b> 10 ml. In 25 children not specially afraid of dental treatment there was no aspiration of radiopaque dye into the larynx or chest. A similar group of 25 anxious children treated using oxygenâ€”nitrous oxide sedation (relative analgesia) were examined in the same way; there was no aspiration of radiopaque dye. The use of oxygen and nitrous oxide mixtures (rela-tive analgesia) in dental practice to achieve sedation and analgesia, frequently supplemented by local analgesia, has led to queries regarding its safety {{for use by the}} single operator. There has been concern at possible depression of the laryngeal reflex and aspiration of debris from the oral cavity (Pleasants, 1971). Cleaton-Jones (1976) reported that during "rela-tive analgesia " (50 % nitrous oxide in oxygen) the laryngeal reflex remained functional, there being n...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-six subjects, mainly {{derived from}} various {{occupational}} groups and one-third of whom admitted to dyspnoea on exertion, have been grouped {{according to the}} appearance of their peripheral airways at bronchography with oily <b>propyliodone.</b> Eleven subjects showed marked peripheral pooling of radiographic contrast material, 22 showed mild or moderate pooling, and in 33 peripheral pools were absent. Pooling was not seen in non-smoking subjects. In the group of subjects without pooling, pulmonary function in non-smokers and subjects {{with a history of}} smoking was similar. Subjects with marked pooling had a significantly lower pulmonary diffusing capacity (transfer factor) and evidence of loss of pulmonary elastic recoil when compared with subjects with absent peripheral pooling. These results indicate that bronchographic peripheral pooling is associated with the physiological changes of panacinar pulmonary emphysema and suggest that a causal relationship may exist between the organic bronchiolar lesion of pooling and the peripheral parenchymal lesion of panacinar emphysema...|$|E
40|$|Hytrast, a new bronchographic {{medium of}} high iodine content, {{provides}} excellent radiographic contrast. A number of clinical, pathological, and experimental studies have revealed inflamma-tory changes after pulmonary retention of Hytrast. Examination of 43 unselected pneumonectomy specimens after Hytrast bronchography revealed typical crystals in 15 instances. The pulmonary reaction included macrophage and foreign body giant cell accumulation, neutrophil leucocyte exudation, and fibrosis within terminal bronchioles and alveoli. It {{was concluded that}} these changes were associated with Hytrast retention. The gradual refinement of bronchographic con-trast media has been reviewed by Le Roux and Duncan (1964). Iodized poppy seed oil (Lipiodol) has been used since 1922 (Sicard and Forestier, 1922). The addition of sulphanilamide (Visciodol) increased viscosity and reduced alveolar filling, but the occasional complications of methaemoglobin-aemia, allergic sensitization, and acute nephritis stimulated {{the search for a}} better preparation. In 1953 <b>propyliodone</b> in aqueous solution (Dionosil aqueous) became available but was found to be a mucosal irritant, an objection which suspension in an oily medium (Dionosil oily) overcame. Hytrast, introduced as a bronchographic medium in 1962, is a neutral suspension of crystals of N (propyl- 2 : 3 -diol) - 3 : 5 diiodo- 4 -pyridone, and 3 : 5 diiodo- 4 pyridone in a hypertonic aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The latter compound was introduced to maintain the viscosity at 24 - 2 - 8 poise and the pH at 7 - 1. The crystals are 2 - 5 microns across (Le Roux and Duncan, 1964). Esteric groups are not present and hydrolysis to irritant acidic groups does not occur. The concentration of iodine is higher than in previous contrast media (05 g. /ml. in Hytrast...|$|E
