40|$|Antibody {{against a}} {{cross-reactive}} idiotype (CRI) on human IgM- rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies was induced by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide (PSL 2) {{corresponding to the}} second complementarity-determining region (CDR), and adjacent amino acid residues of the kappa light chain of the IgM-RF Sie. The anti-peptide antibody bound efficiently to IgM-RF proteins known to share a cross- reactive idiotype, and to their isolated kappa chains. The anti-CRI was absorbed by, and eluted from, a peptide-Sepharose affinity column. The antibody activity was inhibited by the free peptide in solution. The anti-peptide antibody thus identifies a <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> on human IgM- RF, that is largely dependent on the primary sequence of the second CDR of the light chain. Such peptide-induced antiidiotypes of predefined specificity may facilitate studies of the molecular basis of idiotypic cross-reactions, the inheritance and somatic diversification of antibody molecules, and the regulation of the idiotype network...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of immunoglobulin idiotypes (1) has been pursued in several well-defined antibody systems (2 - 7). The accumulated results {{have suggested that}} the hypervariable regions (complementarity-determining regions, CDR) 1 of the light and heavy polypeptide chains usually contribute to the formation of idiotypic determinants. In the extensively analyzed murine antidextran model, one private idiotype and one <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> (cross-reactive idiotypes, CRI) were assigned, respectively to the third and the second hypervariable regions of the heavy chain (6). In most other cases, idiotypic determinants have not been associated definitively with a specific amino acid sequence (2). The latter result is not surprising, considering that antiidiotype antibodies elicited by immunization with intact immunoglobulin often recognize determinants dependent upon a particular quaternary interaction of the light and heavy chains (2). Using carefully absorbed rabbit antisera, Kunkel and colleagues (8) first described the unusual existence of two major CRI (Wa and Po) among huma...|$|E
40|$|The <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> Id- 16 / 6 and {{the public}} {{idiotope}} Id-LLa were originally defined on the same human monoclonal anti-DNA antibody, {{but they are also}} known to occur separately on other anti-DNA antibodies. We sought the presence of these immunoglobulin variable region markers in purified immunoglobulins from the serum of nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 33 healthy donors. Sera from five patients were positive for Id- 16 / 6, and five were positive for Id-LLa. The immunoglobulin preparations were passed over a Sepharose-Id- 16 / 6 column in order to recover auto-anti-idiotypes. An eluate of that column was obtained from the immunoglobulin preparation of one patient whose serum was Id- 16 / 6 + and Id-LLa-. This eluate was shown by competition assay to bind to IdLLa. This is the first demonstration of spontaneously arising human auto-anti-idiotypes against a specific idiotypic system in SLE. The results suggest that antibodies against the Id-LLa idiotope {{may play a role in}} immunoregulation...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{anti-idiotypic}} reagents {{were prepared}} against three different human serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (Tg). Two of the rabbit antisera recognized private idiotypes (IdI) whilst a third antiserum recognized both an IdI and a cross-reactive idiotype (IdX) which was expressed in 50 % of Hashimoto patients tested. A fourth anti-idiotype was produced against an IgM anti-Tg secreted by a patient's Epstein-Barr (EB) virus transformed lymphocytes. This antiserum only reacted with the immunizing IgM anti-Tg and therefore also recognized a private idiotype. Both {{the private and}} the <b>public</b> <b>idiotypes</b> appear to be restricted to the anti-Tg set of antibodies; this would favour {{the view that the}} IdX represents a collection of idotopes with the ability to bind Tg as their common feature, rather than a common structure based upon closely similar germ line derived amino acid sequences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Joints {{are often}} {{affected}} in Lyme disease {{and in some}} instances {{this may be due to}} immune autoreactivity. To characterise further the immune response in this disease investigations were carried out to determine the expression of three <b>public</b> <b>idiotypes</b> on serum immunoglobulins in patients with Lyme disease during the development of varying degrees of arthritis. METHODS: The expression of idiotypes (Ids) 16 / 6, BEG 2, and PR 4, first identified on monoclonal antibodies to DNA, was determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serial blood samples from 12 patients with Lyme disease over a mean period of six years during the development of a variety of arthritic symptoms, and in serum samples from healthy control subjects and control subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus. RESULTS: Expression of serum IgM or IgG public Ids 16 / 6 and BEG 2 was significantly increased in patients with Lyme disease. IgA Id 16 / 6 expression, in contrast, was significantly increased only during episodes of arthritis and was also related to its severity. IgM and IgG Id 16 / 6 expression was related to their respective total immunoglobulin concentration and, in the case of IgM, to the level of IgM antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, whereas similar findings were not apparent with IgA antibodies. This may indicate that the IgA response is related to the pathogenesis of arthritis, especially as total IgA and IgA Id 16 / 6 levels were found to increase over the duration of disease. Sequential analysis of antibodies also showed restriction in the expression of Id 16 / 6 as it was never found on all immunoglobulin isotypes at the same time, and Id PR 4 was never expressed. Ids 16 / 6 and BEG 2 expression, however, may be associated as seven patients expressed these idiotypes simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate the use of <b>public</b> <b>idiotypes</b> in the immune response against B burgdorferi, which may be restricted in terms of idiotype class and isotype expression, and a possible association between IgA antibodies bearing Id 16 / 6 with arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Since {{their first}} {{description}} over 20 years ago, idiotypes {{have been used}} extensively to study {{various aspects of the}} immune system (1, 2). Idiotypes, antigenic determinants associated with immunoglobulin-variable regions, have been found on VH and VL regions, or both (3 - 11), and have been localized to both antigen-binding and framework regions (12 - 17). Those idiotypes shared by immunoglobulins known to be structurally different are designated IdX, 1 cross-reactive or <b>public</b> <b>idiotypes,</b> whereas those apparently restricted to one or a few closely related types of molecules are designated IdI, individual or private idiotypes. In spite of these general descriptive associations, the molecular bases for idiotypes have not been precisely defined. This lack of molecular correlation stands in striking contrast to the precise structural correlations for the constant region allotypes of rabbit and human immunoglobulins where allotype-positive and-negative proteins differ by only one or a few amino acid residues. Closely related sets of structurally defined idiotype-positive and-negative proteins have not previously been described. As part of an examination of the murine repertoire of anti-a-(1 ~ 3) dextra...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyse further the idiotypic cross-reactivity between anti-Lol p I murine monoclonal antibodies of IgG isotype and basophil-bound human IgE antibodies from grass pollen-sensitive patients. It was also designed to determine the expression frequency of the idiotypes present on cell-bound IgE. Rabbit anti-idiotypic antisera were produced against idiotypes of three anti-Lol p I monoclonal antibodies (290 A- 167, 539 A- 6 and 348 A- 6) of different specificities. Basophils from 19 patients reacting to Lol p I allergen, as shown by positive skin test reactions and by the presence of serum-specific IgE antibodies (measured by RAST), were challenged with these rabbit anti-idiotypic antibodies and the histamine released was measured. Our data indicate that IgE-borne idiotypes were expressed as follows: (i) co-expression of the three idiotypes in 15 % of patients; (ii) co-expression of two idiotypes in 21 % of patients; and (iii) expression of a unique idiotype (290 A- 167) in 42 % of patients. Among the three idiotypes, 290 A- 167 was shown to be a <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> since it was expressed in 80 % of patients. Fab fragments of anti-idiotypic antibodies could inhibit anti-idiotype-induced histamine release, but optimal conditions varied from one patient to another...|$|E
40|$|To further {{characterize}} the circulating antibasement membrane zone (antiBMZ) antibodies {{present in the}} sera of patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), we have generated a mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody (antild 3 - 17) specific for an IgG antiBMZ antibody. Antild 3 - 17 is specific for an idiotype expressed on antiBMZ IgG in the serum of a patient with BP, and not expressed on pooled normal human IgG or IgG from patients with other autoimmune skin diseases. Antild 3 - 17 binds to non-reduced, but not reduced, antiBMZ IgG on immunoblot, suggesting that the idiotype is composed of a conformational epitope expressed on native antibody. By a competitive inhibition ELISA, antild 3 - 17 detects a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) expressed in 18 of 50 (36 %) of the sera of patients with BP, but in the sera of only 1 of 50 (2 %) normal blood bank controls (p < 0. 001, Fisher's exact test) and 1 of 12 (8 %) patients with pemphigus (p = 0. 005). Thus, antild 3 - 17 recognizes a <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> on a native antiBMZ antibody from a patient with BP, which is expressed in the sera of 36 % of the unrelated patients with BP studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{derivation}} of a monoclonal IgG 3 K autoantibody, designated F- 423, from a foetal MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mouse is described. It has immunochemical properties {{similar to}} DNA-binding monoclonal antibodies derived from adult mice with lupus disease {{in that it}} reacts with single-stranded DNA and, to a lesser extent, with double-stranded DNA and some forms of RNA. Its similarities to antibodies from adults extend further: it carries a <b>public</b> <b>idiotype,</b> Id. F- 423, that can also be detected on antibodies from adult MRL and (NZB x NZW) F 1 mice, and F- 423 itself expresses other idiotypes defined originally on antibodies from adult lupus mice of both strains. Its potential involvement in pathological processes is demonstrated by two observations: (i) immunization of young MRL/Mp-+/+ mice with antibody F- 423 induced the nephritic and immunological changes associated with systemic lupus erythematosus; and (ii) heterologous rabbit anti-Id. F- 423 anti-idiotypic antibodies suppressed the progression of lupus disease in adult MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice. Similar effects were found with monoclonal antibody IV- 228, an antibody derived from an adult MRL mouse and previously known to be directly nephrotoxic, and with anti-Id. IV- 228 antibodies. It is concluded that even during foetal life mice of lupus-prone strains have lymphocytes capable of making pathogenic autoantibodies long before symptoms of lupus disease appear...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{infection}} {{is accompanied by}} {{the production of a}} number of autoantibodies, including some that react with DNA. Epidemiological evidence implicates these in the nephritides that arise in human quartan malaria and in experimental malaria infections in mice. Through parallels with the involvement of DNA-reactive antibodies in the autoimmune syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus, a role for DNA-reactive antibodies in forming phlogistic immune deposits in the kidneys is implied. To more fully understand the relationship between antibodies of this specificity made in malaria and systemic lupus erythematosus, we prepared monoclonal DNA-reactive antibodies from BALB/c mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (clone RC) and compared their properties with those of other antibodies previously isolated from lupous MRL/Mp lpr/lpr and (NZB x NZW) F 1 mice. Antibodies from malarial mice were all immunoglobulin M class and bound to single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. They also reacted with synthetic polyribonucleotides in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and with parasitized erythrocytes and parasite pigment in kidney sections. None of the antibodies from lupous mice had identical specificities. The potential involvement of the DNA-reactive antibodies in malarial nephritis was demonstrated, by use of immunocytochemical methods, {{on the basis of their}} binding to existing immune deposits in kidney sections from malarial mice, a similar property having been previously demonstrated for antibodies from lupous mice. Furthermore, antibodies from malarial mice expressed <b>public</b> <b>idiotypes,</b> notably Id. V- 88, which is a member of the Id. 16 / 6 family, commonly found on DNA-reactive antibodies in lupus and other infectious and connective tissue diseases. This study indicates that DNA-reactive antibodies in malaria have immunochemical properties similar but not identical to those of such antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus and that they have the potential to participate in the formation of immune deposits in nephritic malarial kidneys...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA {{library was}} {{constructed}} in pBR 322 from mRNA encoding an anti-GAT (Glu 60 Ala 30 Tyr 10) monoclonal antibody kappa chain. Two cDNA clones were extensively characterized. One, L XI 62, was derived from an aberrant V kappa-J kappa rearrangement {{which resulted in a}} frame-shift at position 96, leading to a stop codon {{at the very beginning of}} the constant region. The second, L XIX 27, 1150 bp long, was unequivocally assigned to a GAT-specific kappa chain, by comparison of its nucleotide sequence with the previously determined NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated kappa chain. A specific probe, containing the leader and most of the V kappa gene-encoded region, was prepared from this clone and hybridized to EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments of liver (unrearranged) DNA extracted from the BALB/c, DBA/ 2 and C 57 BL/ 6 mouse strains. Under stringent conditions, similar patterns were observed for all three strains, and consisted of a small number of bands (3 - 5). Under nonstringent conditions, patterns were again very similar when the different strains were compared, although 15 - 20 bands could be identified. These observations support the hypothesis that the GAT-specific kappa chains found in antibodies expressing the <b>public</b> CGAT <b>idiotypes</b> are encoded by a very small number of germline genes. This V kappa repertoire seems extremely conserved between the three strains that were analyzed, an observation which correlates with the interstrain conservation of these public idiotypic specificities...|$|R
40|$|BALB/c mice {{injected}} with lyophilized vaccine from Streptococcus pneumoniae R 36 a (Pn) predominantly responded with antibody molecules {{the vast majority}} of which expressed the <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> T 15 and were directed to the immunodominant epitope phosphorylcholine (PC). However, after a single immunization with Pn vaccine young (3 -month-old) BALB/c mice did not produce any specific anti-T 15 antibody response. In contrast, young D 1. LP mice were able to mount a specific anti-T 15 response upon primary immunization with pneumococcal vaccine. The anti-PC response in the two mouse strains differed in that the proportion of antibody molecules that expressed the T 15 idiotype for Pn-primed D 1. LP mice showed a smaller proportion of PC-specific antibody expressing the T 15 idiotype. Neonatal injection of anti-T 15 monoclonal antibodies led to a long-term suppression of the PC-specific T 15 + B-cell clones but at young/adult age these mice maintained the ability to produce a normal amount of PC-specific antibody. Interestingly, the idiotypically-suppressed BALB/c mice mounted a significant anti-T 15 response during the primary response to Pn. We interpreted these data as showing that the level of circulating idiotype may regulate the production of the complementary anti-idiotypic antibody. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the lack of the anti-T 15 response during primary antibody response in BALB/c mice is probably because of a state of tolerance that is regulated by T cells...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the immune}} {{response}} in fetuses of mothers with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) is unknown, we investigated sera from six mothers and their paired offspring by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{for the presence of}} a common anti-DNA idiotype (16 / 6 Id) and, as control, for the presence of an unrelated <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In addition, maternal as well as fetal sera were evaluated for the presence of antibodies to ssDNA, dsDNA, poly(I), poly (dT), RNA, cardiolipin, total histones and the presence of lupus anticoagulant. Clinically active SLE mothers showed in general increased IgG and, to a lesser extent, IgM autoantibody activity. Circulating lupus anticoagulant was detectable in clinically active mothers only. All offspring of clinically active SLE mothers showed increased IgG autoantibodies to a variety of antigens, while IgM antibodies were detected in only one fetus. In contrast, fetuses of clinically inactive mothers showed only minor IgG activity. Common anti-DNA-idiotype (16 / 6 Id) activity also correlated with disease activity in both maternal and fetal compartments. One clinically active mother was 16 / 6 -negative; her offspring was, however, positive, indicating de novo production of the idiotype by the fetus. In contrast, a control anti-HBsAg idiotype was not detected in either maternal or fetal sera. It therefore appears that offspring of clinically active SLE mothers serologically reflect maternal disease activity. Furthermore, autoantibodies and common idiotype of autoantibodies can be found within the fetal compartment {{even in the absence of}} such antibodies in the maternal serum. Discrepancies between mothers and offspring in IgM-autoantibody levels and the presence of new idiotypes in fetuses are indicative of fetal de novo autoantibody production...|$|E
40|$|The <b>public</b> <b>idiotype</b> Id-H 130 {{occurs in}} MRL-lpr/lpr serum both {{on a high}} {{proportion}} of anti-DNA autoantibodies as well as on antibodies that do not bind to DNA. To define members of the latter population, we prepared hybridomas and selected Id-H 130 + mAbs that did not bind to DNA. One such antibody, mAb 28 / 12, was found to be an anti-SmRNP antibody. To determine whether mAb 28 / 12 had rheumatoid factor activity, we tested its ability to bind, in a solid-phase assay, to 16 mouse IgM mAbs. mAb 28 / 12 bound to only four of the panel, two anti-DNA antibodies (mAbs 512 and 319) and two anti-gp 70 antibodies (mAbs 514 and 1417). In a liquid-phase competition assay with a panel of 32 monoclonal IgM and IgG antibodies, including allotype-matched Igs, mAb 28 / 12 reacted only with mAbs 512, 319, 514, and 1417. The binding of mAb 28 / 12 to mAbs 512 and 319 was displaced by DNA, but not by RNA, indicating that the idiotype it defines (Id- 28 / 12) is in the antigen- binding region of the two anti-DNA antibodies. In the two anti-gp 70 antibodies (mAbs 514 and 1417), Id- 28 / 12 seems to occur in the framework region. To determine if all four Id- 28 / 12 + antibodies shared a common antigen-binding property, they were tested for their ability to react with DNA and gp 70. The two anti-gp 70 antibodies did not bind to DNA. However, the two anti-DNA antibodies were found to immunoprecipitate viral proteins from retrovirus-infected cells. mAb 512 reacted with gp 70, both in cell membrane lysates and in purified form; mAb 319 reacted with gp 85, which contains both gp 70 and the retroviral protein p 15. Antibodies with properties similar to those of mAb 28 / 12 were found in MRL-lpr/lpr serum. It was possible, by affinity chromatography on an anti-gp 70 antibody column, to isolate from serum those anti-(anti-gp 70) antibodies with anti-SmRNP activity. These results show that parallel sets of autoantibodies, which share a common idiotype, but which bind to different autoantigens, occur in MRL- lpr/lpr mice. Some populations of anti-DNA, anti-SmRNP, and anti-gp 70 antibodies appear to constitute a network of autoantibodies in that strain. We speculate that part of the anti-SmRNP population of autoantibodies can arise by mutation of germline-encoded anti-DNA antibodies...|$|E
