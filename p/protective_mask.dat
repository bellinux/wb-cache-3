5|$|Costa, Oscar and Fàbregas were {{targeted}} by Chelsea supporters as the players whose poor form {{led to the}} dismissal of popular manager José Mourinho in December 2015. Costa scored twice {{in the first game}} under interim replacement Guus Hiddink, a 2–2 home draw against Watford. Costa, who played in a <b>protective</b> <b>mask</b> after breaking his nose in training, improved his form under the Dutchman, scoring seven times in his first eight games under the new management.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{was fitted}} with a <b>protective</b> <b>mask</b> after {{breaking}} his nose in a collision with Charlie Adam during the reverse fixture on 4 April. Eight days later, he scored the only goal {{of the game in}} the 88th minute in a victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. On 3 May, the day before his 28th birthday, he won his first Premier League title at the ninth attempt, following a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace. During the penultimate game of the season, away at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, Fàbregas was shown the red card and booed off by fans for deliberately kicking the ball at Chris Brunt's head while players were speaking to referee Mike Jones. On appeal, the suspension for this red card was cut from three matches to one.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{comparative}} experimental testing of different filtrating type masks {{are presented in}} this study. Some {{of the most important}} functional properties have been tested on available models of Italian, French, British, Canadian, Swiss, American, and three models of Serbian military <b>protective</b> <b>masks</b> (M 3 of the latest generation, as well as M 2, and M 2 FV models of the previous generation). Using of the standardized testing methods, mask models have been tested on protection factor, dynamic resistance of the exhaust valve and its static permeability, the overall inhalation resistance of <b>protective</b> <b>masks,</b> field of view and optical properties. Based on experimental results obtained, it can be concluded that the Serbian mask M 3 is on approximately same quality level as tested foreign masks, and above Serbian <b>protective</b> <b>masks</b> of the previous generation marked M 2 F and M 2 FV.

25|$|The Senators faced John McGraw's heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World Series. The {{two teams}} traded wins {{back and forth}} until the series reached the seventh and {{deciding}} game. The Senators trailed the Giants 3 to 1 {{in the eighth inning}} of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. An aging Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth inning, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the bottom of the twelfth inning with Ruel at bat, he hit a high, foul ball directly over home plate. The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his <b>protective</b> <b>mask</b> to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat. On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and proceeded to score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad hop over Lindstrom's head. This would mark the only World Series triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington.|$|E
500|$|Members of the United States {{armed forces}} are exposed to CS during initial {{training}}, and during training refresher courses or equipment maintenance exercises, using CS tablets that are melted on a hotplate. This is to demonstrate the importance of properly wearing a gas or <b>protective</b> <b>mask,</b> as the agent's presence quickly reveals an improper fit or seal of the mask's rubber gaskets against the face. Following exposure while wearing a mask, recruits are ordered to remove the masks and endure exposure in the room. These exercises also encourage confidence {{in the ability of}} the equipment to protect the wearer from such chemical attacks. Such an event is a requirement for graduation from United States Army Basic Training, Air Force Basic Military Training, Navy Basic Training, and Marine Corps recruit training. CS gas in the form of grenades is also used extensively in the United States Marine Corps and United States Army in some service schools. CS gas is used during the final field exercise of the Scout Sniper Basic Course to simulate being compromised. In addition, it is used during the [...] escape-and-evasion exercise ("Trail of Tears"), the last event before graduation from the course. It is also used during several events in the Marine Corps Basic Reconnaissance Course (BRC) including some rucksack runs and escape-and-evasion exercises. While students going through the course are given the opportunity to bring and wear a gas mask for the event, usually none are worn because once donned, gas masks could not be removed {{until the end of the}} exercise. This could last anywhere from 3–12 hours and would make running 25km while wearing [...] of gear virtually impossible.|$|E
500|$|On March 13 at Victory Road, Sarita and Rosita {{defeated}} Angelina Love and Winter {{to win the}} TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, with Sarita {{proclaiming that}} their victory would start a [...] "Mexican takeover" [...] of TNA. On the following episode of Impact!, the alliance of Sarita, Rosita and Hernandez was named Mexican America. The {{three of them were}} then defeated in a six-person street fight by Love, Winter and Matt Morgan. On the March 24 episode of Impact!, Anarquia became the fourth member of the group. In the following weeks, Sarita and Rosita successfully defended the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, first against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky), and then against Madison Rayne and Tara. They made their third successful defense on the June 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Velvet Sky and Ms. Tessmacher, following interference from ODB. In early July, Stock was sidelined from in-ring competition after suffering facial paralysis. On the July 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sarita, wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>mask,</b> and Rosita lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Ms. Tessmacher and Tara. Sarita and Rosita received a rematch for the title on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, but were again defeated by Tessmacher and Tara. Sarita was eventually unmasked on October 16, during the Bound for Glory pre-show by Ink Inc. member Toxxin. The following month at Turning Point, Sarita, Anarquia and Hernandez faced Ink Inc.'s Jesse Neal, Shannon Moore and Toxxin in a six-person tag team match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, which Mexican America managed to retain, when Sarita pinned Toxxin after hitting her with the title belt. On the March 22, 2012, episode of Impact Wrestling, Sarita and Rosita again failed to recapture the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, when they were defeated by Eric Young and ODB. Sarita and Rosita were given another title opportunity on April 15 at Lockdown, but were once again defeated by Eric Young and ODB, this time in a tag team steel cage match. Afterwards, both Sarita and Rosita went inactive from TNA, while Anarquia left the promotion and Hernandez turned face, effectively disbanding Mexican America.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gas mask}} is a mask {{used to protect}} the user from inhaling {{airborne}} pollutants and toxic gases.

The final prototype, the XM40, was approved for service and then designated the M40.|$|R
