50|$|Within the {{production}} of these drinking vessels, from the mid-2nd century BC onwards, translucent or transparent glass tableware (<b>plates,</b> dishes, <b>bowls,</b> <b>drinking</b> vessels, such as skyphoi, footed bowls or handled cups) was introduced; glass tableware production once established enjoyed several glassworking centres and contributed in the dramatic increase of the Hellenistic glass industry. This {{was the first time}} that glass vessels were widely consumed by the broader public as a widespread commodity, something that continued ever since and was achieved in a higher degree with the invention of the even more economical glassblowing technique.|$|R

The top coating can be changed by development and {{has at least one}} hydrophile and at least one hydrophobe and oliophile component. They are distributed ahead of the latent picture production and the development of the surface so that the surface of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is hydrophile for positive <b>pressure</b> <b>plates</b> and hydrophobe or oliophile for negative <b>pressure</b> <b>plates.</b> A latent, electrostatic picture can be produced in the top coating.

50|$|The TMA-1 and TMA-1A are circular, plastic cased Yugoslavian minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The mine {{consists of}} an upper plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> and the lower body containing the main charge. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has eight triangular raised sectors, and a central fuze cap. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is {{held in place by}} four plastic pins, which when suffient pressure is applied, shear allowing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> to collapse onto the mine body, triggering the UANU-1 fuze. A secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine, allowing the use of anti-handling devices. The mine is found in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.|$|R
50|$|The T-AB-1 is a {{rectangular}} plastic cased Brazilian anti-tank blast mine. The mine uses a T-AB-1 anti-personnel mine as a fuze. The AP mine is {{inserted into the}} body of the AT mine under a large stiff ABS plastic <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is fastened in place by a number of shear pins, which are designed to give way under a pressure of 200 kg. The AP mine under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is then triggered, triggering the mine's main charge.|$|R
5000|$|The Type I mine had a {{cylindrical}} {{case with}} a domed upper <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> that is held above the main case of the mine by the spring-loaded central fuze well. A strip of canvas around the circumference seals {{the gap between the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and {{the main body of the}} mine. The Type II uses a smaller <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> that does not cover the entire top surface of the mine, giving the center of the mine a raised appearance. In every other detail, the mines are identical.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the brake, a spring pushes against a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> squeezing the friction disk between the inner <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the outer cover plate.

50|$|An Elsie mine {{has a small}} raised <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> on the {{top surface}} of the mine which {{is covered with a}} small pad of flock material. The {{flocking}} material is designed to act as camouflage. Sustained downward pressure on the small <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (by the victim's foot) cocks a spring-loaded striker. When the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> has been pressed down approximately 2.5 cm, a single retaining ball bearing flips side-ways into a recess. When the ball bearing flips side-ways, it frees the striker (held under tension by a coiled spring beneath it) which snaps upwards into the stab detonator, thereby detonating the explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|The NV-41 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consists of a square wooden box with a filling plug on the bottom. The top of the box is covered by a thin pressure lid, which covers a <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> held up by a spring. Sufficient pressure on the lid collapses it down onto the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Downward movement of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> moves down a pressure plunger, which in turn levers up the striker retaining lever, releasing the spring-loaded striker and allowing it to impact the stab sensitive detonator, triggering the main charge.|$|R

This action arms the anti-handling device. Thereafter, {{any attempt to}} disarm the mine by unscrewing the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> (to remove the fuze) will automatically trigger detonation.

50|$|The Tellermine {{consists}} of a circular pressed steel main body with a large central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is smaller than the earlier Tellermine 35, which increases the mine's resistance to blast.

50|$|The P2 Mk2 and P3 Mk2 are Pakistani plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mines. The P2 Mk2 has {{a square}} {{case with a}} central circular ribbed <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> the P3 is circular with a central circular <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> Both mines use anti-personnel mines as the fuse, typically the either the P4 Mk1 or P2 Mk2 anti-personnel mines. The anti-personnel mine sits in a cavity below the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> when enough <b>pressure</b> is place on the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> of the mine, it collapses onto the anti-personnel mine triggering it and the main charge which sits below it. A yellow canvas carrying strap is normally fitted {{to the side of}} the mine. The mines have a secondary fuse well on the bottom which can be used with anti-handling devices. A GLM-2 electronic booby trap can be fitted to the cavity under the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> The mine is supplied with a steel disc which makes the mine more easily detectable, although this is seldom used. Since 1997 only a detectable version of the mine has been produced, and to comply with the Convention on Conventional Weapons amended protocol II, Pakistani stocks of the mine are being retrofitted with steel detection discs. The mines are found in Afghanistan, Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Tajikistan.|$|R

50|$|The PRB 408 is a Belgian square shaped {{anti-tank}} mine which {{consist of a}} polyethylene case with a handle in {{one side and a}} cylinder {{in the top of the}} box.

50|$|The M6, M6A1 and M6A2 are {{a series}} of metal-cased, {{circular}} anti-tank landmines produced by the United States; they were superseded in service by the larger M15 mine. The mine is normally painted olive green and has a large central <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> In the centre of the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> is an arming plug that has an arming lever with three settings: ARMED, DANGER and SAFE. The <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> rests on a concertina-like structure, which when enough force is applied is compressed. Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that soilâ€“water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{plays an important role in}} unsaturated soil mechanics, but the measurement of SWCC is inconvenient. In laboratory it requires days of testing time. For fine-grained clays, it may last for a couple of months using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests. In this study, the effects of sample dimensions and shapes on the balance time of measuring SWCCs using <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and the shape of SWCCs are investigated. It can be found that the sample dimensions and shapes have apparent influence on the balance time. The testing durations for circular samples with smaller diameters and annular samples with larger contact area are significantly shortened. However, there is little effect of sample dimensions and shapes on the shape of SWCCs. Its mechanism is explored and discussed in details through analysing the principle of <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> tests and microstructure of the sample. Based on the above findings, it is found that the circular samples with smaller dimensions can accelerate the testing duration of SWCC using the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
