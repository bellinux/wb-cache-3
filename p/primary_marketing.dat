50|$|Standard Oil Company of Iowa {{was created}} in 1885 as a {{subsidiary}} of the Standard Oil Trust to handle marketing along the Pacific Coast states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, California, and Arizona.

A prior company named Standard Oil of California had been formed in 1877, and was not associated with the Standard Oil Trust. In 1906, Standard Oil of Iowa was dissolved and its assets handed over to a new Standard Oil of California, later Chevron Oil Company, and now the Chevron Corporation.

50|$|The {{art market}} {{as a whole is}} {{affected}} by its two main parts: the <b>primary</b> art <b>market,</b> where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative. Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as alpha consumers (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> works.|$|R
50|$|The Lewis lamp {{is a type}} {{of light}} fixture used in lighthouses. It was invented by Winslow Lewis who {{patented}} the design in 1810. The <b>primary</b> <b>marketing</b> point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced. The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp. A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand. While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses.|$|E

By 1924, Victor Animatograph Corporation and Bell and Howell had placed 16mm projectors on the market, so Kodak eliminated the requirement to purchase the equipment as a complete outfit and sold the projector separately.

5000|$|The term rumba may {{refer to}} a variety of {{unrelated}} music styles. Originally, the term rumba was used as a synonym for [...] "party" [...] in northern Cuba, and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as Cuban rumba. Since the early 20th century the term has been used in different countries to refer to distinct styles of music and dance, most of which are only tangentially related to the original Cuban rumba, if at all. The vague etymological origin of the term rumba, as well as its interchangeable use with guaracha in settings such as bufo theatre, is largely responsible for such worldwide polysemy of the term. In addition, [...] "rumba" [...] was the <b>primary</b> <b>marketing</b> term for Cuban music in North America, as well as West and Central Africa, during much of the 20th century, before the rise of mambo, pachanga and salsa.|$|E

An {{industry}} joke {{stated that the}} company was losing money on each computer, but was making up for it in volume. The 99/4A's list price was $400 that autumn, but the street price including $100 rebate was about $200. Sales peaked at 30,000 a week in January 1983, but on 10 January 1983 Commodore lowered the price of its computers; the VIC-20's wholesale price was $130. In February TI responded by lowering the 99/4A's retail price to $150. In April Commodore again lowered prices, and the VIC-20's bundled retail price reached $100. TI also lowered prices and offered rebates, reducing the 99/4A's retail price to under $100; by this time the company was likely losing money on each computer. In early 1983 TI stopped sales for a month to correct a defect, but—predicting in April that the home-computer market that year would be much larger than most industry analysts expected—continued production {{at an annual rate of}} three million, increasing inventory. In May it began offering the PEB for free with the purchase of three peripherals; by this time TI was using price cuts as the 99/4A's <b>primary</b> <b>marketing.</b> In August the company reduced prices of peripherals by 50% and offered $100 of free software; in September, it reduced software prices by up to 43%.|$|E
