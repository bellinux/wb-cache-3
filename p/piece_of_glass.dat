Parker filed a $20 million suit against the night club.

However, on 6 July 2012, he was cleared to participate.|$|E
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> in the Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Bean {{was born}} in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, which was then part of West Riding of Yorkshire (the County of South Yorkshire was created in 1974). He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E

5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface of a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> Only a very {{small fraction of the}} incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E

500|$|The Sovereign's Orb, {{a type of}} globus cruciger, is {{a hollow}} gold sphere about [...] in {{diameter}} and weighing [...] (more than twice as heavy as the original) that was made for CharlesII in 1661. A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator {{and there is a}} half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross symbolising the Christian world. Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey. Queen MaryII's Orb is a smaller version made in 1689 for MaryII to hold at her joint coronation with WilliamIII; it was never used again at a coronation, and is set with imitation gems and cultured pearls. Both orbs were laid on top of Queen Victoria's coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using MaryII's orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria's position as Empress of India.|$|E
