5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft <b>pellets,</b> called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal <b>pellets)</b> are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer <b>pellets</b> to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder <b>pellets</b> may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to video}} fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold <b>pellets,</b> 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the <b>pellets</b> and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the <b>pellets.</b> While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|In the hindgut (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal <b>pellets.</b> The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal <b>pellets,</b> and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate <b>pellets,</b> and fossil <b>pellets</b> that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{observation of}} the solid hydrogen <b>pellet</b> ablation has been performed by using a fast stereo imaging camera to investigate the <b>pellet</b> ablation dynamics.

The breakaway plasmoid recurrently develops at the rate of about 100 times per millisecond and it is non-diffusively transported approximately 0. 1 m during its several 10 ?s lifetime in the opposite direction to the <b>pellet</b> motion, namely, toward the low magnetic field side.

40|$|An {{experiment}} investigated {{performance of}} birds fed the <b>pelleted</b> corn-soy diet versus the <b>pelleted</b> 30 % copra meal based diet with different <b>pellet</b> sizes. This {{study was conducted}} for six weeks. A total of 144 male day old chicks were used in this trial. One day old birds were randomly allocated to four treatment diets with six replications. The starter and grower <b>pelleted</b> diets were with or without 30 % copra meal and in two forms, either fine or mixed sized particles. The experimental design was a two way factorial with two basal diets, two particle sizes and six replicate cages of six birds per treatment. The inclusion of 30 % copra meal in the <b>pelleted</b> diet decreased body weight and feed intake, but improved feed eficiency. Grinding the diet to a fine <b>pellet</b> size impaired the body weight and feed intake. The effect of <b>pellet</b> size became more evident when the birds grew older. Birds fed the <b>pelleted</b> form of copra meal accelerated their growth rate so {{that they were not}} significantly different from the weight of birds fed the <b>pelleted</b> form of the corn-soy diet. However the feed intake of birds fed the <b>pelleted</b> copra meal diet was lower than the feed intake of those fed the <b>pelleted</b> corn soy diets. It was concluded that inclusion of copra meal in the diet impaired growth of birds, particularly in the starter phase. <b>Pelleting</b> and crumbling copra meal diet could increase the bird performance to the same level of the performance of birds fed the <b>pelleted</b> corn-soy control diet while fine grinding the <b>pelleted</b> diet reversed this trend.

5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather.

No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated <b>pellets</b> are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded <b>pellets.</b> Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E

5000|$|Much of Maine Energy Systems {{work to make}} wood <b>pellet</b> heating more {{prevalent}} in the Northeast has been with regulatory agencies. At the time MESys was founded very few regulations existed which directly referred to Wood <b>Pellet</b> boilers in Maine and the surrounding regions. As a result, rules and regulations created to regulate the installation and use of cordwood and coal stoker boilers were frequently applied to <b>pellet</b> boilers.

40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of performance of nuclear fusion plasmas, <b>pellet</b> injection experiments have been actively carried out in many toroidal devices {{in the sense of}} controlling density profile, obtaining high density or improved confinement, and diagnostic purposes. In order to have a common measure of <b>pellet</b> ablation, the regression study has been performed as an international cooperation activity, obtaining "IPAD" (International <b>Pellet</b> Ablation Database) >. However, these are an empirical scaling, and the mechanism of <b>pellet</b> ablation still remains to be studied. According to the code calculations based on a typical <b>pellet</b> ablation model (e. g., so-called the neutral gas shielding model), it is understood that the penetration depth into plasma is always quite sensitive to the <b>pellet</b> size. If the <b>pellet</b> size is too large, the <b>pellet</b> passes through the plasma, and if it is too small, it is trapped at the plasma surface. Also, an effective or suitable range of the <b>pellet</b> size for a certain plasma is generally very narrow, and this range largely varies depending on each plasma size and plasma parameters. Thus, the precise controllability of the <b>pellet</b> size, especially the size controllability with continuously variable system will be quite effective in order to carry out the detailed studies on <b>pellet</b> ablation and associated phenomena. A <b>pellet</b> injector of new type with precisely and continuously controllable system of <b>pellet</b> size is being developed.
