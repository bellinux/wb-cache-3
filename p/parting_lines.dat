There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose.

Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes.

Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions.
