30|$|<b>Pirimiphos-methyl</b> {{occurred}} in 27  % {{of the water}} samples analysed. The range of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> concentrations recorded was from below detection to 0.03  µg/L with a mean value of 0.03  µg/L. There {{were no significant differences}} (p >  0.05) in <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> concentrations in relation to distances of water sources to cocoa farms. However, the mean concentrations of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> recorded at sampled sites with detectable residues, were found to be below the WHO permissible residue limit of 6.00  µg/L for drinking water. The detection of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> in the water samples suggests the use of pesticides with <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> as its active ingredient in the control of cocoa pests and diseases by farmers as it was also detected in the soil samples.|$|E
30|$|The strong {{positive}} correlation between pH and (diazinon and <b>pirimiphos-methyl)</b> and EC and (diazinon and chlorpyrifos) indicates that pH and EC of water could have enhanced the adsorption of these pesticide compounds. Thus, increase in pH and EC resulted in a corresponding increase in concentrations of diazion and <b>pirimiphos-methyl,</b> and diazinon and chlorpyrifos respectively. In addition, the strong {{positive correlation}} between TDS and (diazinon and chlorpyrifos) and TSS and (diazinon) suggests that these pesticides residue levels in water possibly increased with TDS and TSS content of the water. Also, the {{positive correlation between}} ammonia and (diazinon), phosphate and (<b>pirimiphos-methyl),</b> sodium and (chlorpyrifos), and potassium and (<b>pirimiphos-methyl)</b> suggests that these nutrients in water have significant influence {{on the distribution of}} pesticides and an increase in the level of these nutrients resulted in a corresponding increase in their respective pesticide residues. On the other hand, the negative correlation between temperature and <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> indicates that <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> pesticide residue levels in water decrease with increase in water temperature and vice versa. This could be due to decomposition of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> pesticide with increase in water temperature.|$|E

40|$|Background : With {{respect to}} the {{importance}} of chemical control of malaria, the present study was conducted in order to evaluate the <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> as a larvicide. In this respect, its stability, activity, and the interval between two treatments with <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> were evaluated. This study was performed in artificial and natural breeding place at two villages in Kazeroon area. Materials and Methods : It was an experimental study. Having prepared the artificial breeding places, they were sprayed by concentrations of 12. 5, 20, 25, 40, 50, and 80 gr/ha. Meanwhile, temphos, reldan and <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> were compared in concentrations of 25, 22. 5, and 25 gr/ha, respectively. Bioassay test was used to evaluate the poison stability. Results: The recorded mortality rate for Anopheles larvae were 91. 7, 99. 7, 100, 100, 100, and 100, respectively. Results have revealed there was a significant statistically difference between the concentrations of 12. 5 and 20 gr/ha of <b>pirimiphos-methyl,</b> however, this difference did not reach the statistical significant between concentrations of 20 gr/ha and higher. Reldan has shown a great larvicide activity. Conclusion : Temphos is quite safe but expensive, thus can not be widely used. On the other hand, Reldan is not biologically safe. <b>Pirimiphos-methyl</b> is a versatile, easy-to-handle, broad-spectrum insecticide of low toxicity to mammals. Further studies are needed to determine the rate of degradation of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> in natural breeding sites...|$|E

After the final mortality count, all individuals were removed and progeny production was evaluated after an additional period of 65 d. In another series of laboratory bioassays, the insecticidal efficacy of these two <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> formulations was evaluated against S. granarius, T confusum and R. dominica at three temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and two relative humidity (r. h.) levels (55 and 75 %). <b>Pirimiphos-methyl</b> was applied at two dose rates, 2 and 4 ppm, and mortality of beetles was measured after 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure. In all cases, Sitophilus species were highly susceptible to both pirimiphosmethyl formulations, since complete (100 %) mortality was noted with doses >= 1 ppm after 7 d of exposure. In contrast, R. dominica and P. truncatus were the least susceptible to <b>pirimiphos-methyl,</b> as mortality did not exceed 82 and 57 %, respectively, {{for any of the}} dose rates or formulations tested.

This study was conducted at two different concentrations (1 and 10 μg/L) of 14 C-labeled <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> for 28 days uptake and 14 days depuration according to the OECD 305 test guideline. The BCFss for total radioactive residues in whole fish were 1, 251 and 1, 277 for low and high concentrations, respectively. The BCFk based on the uptake and depuration rate constants were 1, 200 for both low and high concentrations. During the depuration phase, the accumulated test substance was rapidly depurated from fish. Greater than 95 % of the residue at steady-state was depurated after 2 days. Although the measured BCF values were high, <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> could be evaluated as a low risk from bioaccumulation by aquatic organisms due to the short depuration period and low amount of bound residue (1. 5 %).

On mud surfaces, the respective odds ratios were 2. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 9 - 3. 3), 3. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 7 - 4. 5), and 1. 7 (95 % CI: 1. 4 - 2. 2). On cement, the residual activity of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> CS BM measured using cone tests was similar to that of lambda-cyhalothrin and for both treatments, mortality of susceptible Kisumu laboratory strain was not significantly below the World Health Organization pre-set threshold of 80 % for 30  weeks after spraying. Residual activity was shorter on mud surfaces, mortality falling below 80 % on both <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> CS BM and lambda-cyhalothrin treated surfaces at 25  weeks post-treatment.; CS formulations of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> are promising alternatives for IRS, as they demonstrate prolonged insecticidal effect and residual activity against malaria mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} window {{screens and}} eave baffles (WSEBs), which enable mosquitoes to enter but not exit houses, {{as an alternative}} to indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria vector control. WSEBs treated with water, the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin, or the organophosphate <b>pirimiphos-methyl,</b> with and without a binding agent for increasing insecticide persistence on netting, were compared with IRS in experimental huts. Compared with IRS containing the same insecticide, WSEBs killed similar proportions of Anopheles funestus mosquitoes that were resistant to pyrethroids, carbamates and organochlorines and greater proportions of pyrethroid-resistant, early exiting An. arabiensis mosquitoes. WSEBs with <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> killed greater proportions of both vectors than lambda-cyhalothrin or lambda-cyhalothrin plus <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> and were equally efficacious when combined with binding agent. WSEBs required far less insecticide than IRS, and binding agents might enhance durability. WSEBs might enable affordable deployment of insecticide combinations to mitigate against physiologic insecticide resistance and improve control of behaviorally resistant, early exiting vectors. 28418299 PMC 540305...|$|E

40|$|Dennettia tripetala {{powder and}} reduced rates of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> dust were tested on cowpea against C. maculatus for their {{effective}} management. The {{study was conducted}} under ambient conditions of 250 C – 280 C and 65 % - 75 % relative humidity in the laboratory {{for a period of}} 3 months. Powder of D. tripetala and dust of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> were tested sole at 0. 4 g and 0. 1 g per 20 g of cowpea seeds respectively while various combinations at 0. 2 g DT + 0. 05 g PM, 0. 2 g DT+ 0. 025 g PM, and 0. 2 g DT + 0. 0013 g PM were also tested on 20 g of cowpea seed. D. tripetala powder was more effective at 0. 4 g when applied singly. Adult mortality of more than 80 % occurred in less than 3 days. It also caused a significant reduction in oviposition, adult emergence and weight loss after emergence. Effect of sole application of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> dust at 0. 1 g per 20 g of cowpea seed was less when compared with 0. 4 g of D. tripetala. The combined treatments of D. tripetala and pirimiphosmethyl slightly reduce adult emergence and weight loss.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{effects of}} the combination of Nicotiana tabacum leaf powder and <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> dust as a treatment is compared with sole treatment of the powder and dust in this study. All laboratory experiments were conducted under prevailing conditions of 28 ± 30 C and 70 ± 5 % relative humidity. Contact toxicity of Nicotiana tabacum powder was tested on Sitophilus zeamais at 0. 4 g and 0. 01 g of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> powder per 20 g of maize seeds singly. The toxicity of combined powder of N. tabacum at 0. 2 g with 0. 0013 g, 0. 0025 g and 0. 005 g of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> dust per 20 g of maize seeds was also tested. These treatments significantly (p> 0. 05) reduced the weight loss and adult emergence of S. zeamais. The powder and dust also caused high mortality to S. zeamais when applied. The efficacy of the Nicotiana tabacum was better when applied singly at 0. 4 g than when combined with dust of <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> at reduced rates. Irrespective of the treatment used in the study, the response of Sitophilus zeamais {{was found to be}} dependent on the concentration. Adult mortality increases with concentration, while adult emergence reduces.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the insecticidal effect of two <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> {{formulations}} [emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and capsule suspension (CS) ] as surface treatment on concrete, plywood, galvanized metal, plastic, and ceramic tile was evaluated in laboratory bioassays against Sitophilus granarius (L.), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), and Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val. <b>Pirimiphos-methyl</b> was applied at two-dose-rates, 0. 01 and 0. 1 mg/cm(2), and insect mortality was assessed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days of exposure. After the final mortality count, alive individuals {{were transferred to}} untreated dishes, and delayed mortality was evaluated after an additional period of 7 days. In another series of laboratory bioassays, the residual efficacy of these two <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> formulations on concrete was evaluated against S. granarius, R. dominica, and T. confusum. <b>Pirimiphos-methyl</b> was applied at two-dose-rates, 0. 01 and 0. 1 mg/cm(2), on concrete dishes which were either kept in continuous darkness or exposed to light. A bioassay was initiated at the day of storage and every 4 weeks for 4 consecutive months (5 bioassays in total). Mortality of the exposed adult beetles was measured after 3 and 7 days of exposure. Both formulations were highly effective, with S. granarius being the most susceptible species. In general, mortality of the exposed beetles was not significantly affected by the surface type, {{with the exception of}} the significantly lower mortality counts of S. granarius adults on ceramic tile. CS appeared to be much more persistent on concrete than EC for all three species tested. Moreover, CS was not affected by light. In contrast, in some of the combinations tested, EC performance was poor in dishes that were exposed to light, in comparison with dishes that were in continuous darkness. We conclude that the surface type does not significantly and consistently affect S. granarius, R. dominica, and T. confusum mortality after surface application of the two <b>pirimiphos-methyl</b> formulations tested. Furthermore, CS can provide long-term protection when applied on concrete surfaces...|$|E
