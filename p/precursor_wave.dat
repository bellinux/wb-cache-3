Impacts extended across Central America, especially in Nicaragua where 70 people were killed. Bridges were collapsed, roads were destroyed, communication lines were downed, {{and up to}} 255 communities were affected by the storm there. Similar but less severe damage was observed in Honduras, where four people were killed, and in El Salvador, where one person died. Widespread rainfall totals of 10in (250mm) were recorded across Veracruz, peaking at 16.73in (424.9mm) in Acayucan. The combined impacts of Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew in the state cost up to $8 billion. Flooding from Matthew further inland in Mexico, which was already observing one of its wettest years on record, led to a landslide in Santa María Tlahuitoltepec that killed seven people.|$|E

The frequency maxima correspond to waves for which the group velocity and thus the energy propagation velocity in the plasma frame of reference is zero. A particle-in-cell (PIC) code is employed {{to show that the}} propagation of wave energy at a non-zero velocity, necessary to couple energy from a stationary antenna to the plasma, is accomplished by propagating <b>wave</b> <b>precursors.</b> The undamped <b>waves</b> at the frequency maxima of the ECH branches are nonpropagating hence the waves remain localized. It is demonstrated that the nonpropagating waves, built up by the <b>wave</b> <b>precursors,</b> are standing <b>waves.</b> The standing wave generation is followed from the linear to nonlinear regimes. For nonlinear emission amplitudes the emission causes a plasma density depletion close to the antenna. The depletion is shown to trigger a modulational instability in which the ECH wave collapses.

40|$|Injecting {{magnetized}} plasma {{with changes}} in magnetization or injection rate necessitate a time variable magnetic field at the boundary of the simulation box. Naive implementation will lead to electromagnetic <b>precursor</b> <b>waves</b> that can affect the simulation results. The problem is well-known and is described e. g. in Lemebege and Dawson 1987.

The cut off frequency of this filter should coincide with the gyro frequency in the magnetized plasma, to make use of (Doppler-broadend) resonant absorption caused by gyrating electrons. We illustrate this idea with a code example and demonstrate the efficency of this method throug sample simulations with our electromagnetic particle-in-cell code.

40|$|The present work {{is about}} the stall margin {{enhancement}} ability {{of a kind of}} stall precursor-suppressed (SPS) casing treatment when fan/compressor suffers from a radial total pressure inlet distortion. Experimental researches are conducted on a low-speed compressor with and without SPS casing treatment under radial distorted inlet flow of different levels as well as uniform inlet flow. The distorted flow fields of different levels are generated by annular distortion flow generators of different heights. The characteristic curves under these conditions are measured and analyzed. The results show that the radial inlet distortion could cause a stall margin loss from 2 % to 30 % under different distorted levels. The SPS casing treatment could remedy this stall margin loss under small distortion level and only partly make up the stall margin loss caused by distortion in large level without leading to perceptible additional efficiency loss and obvious change of characteristic curves. The pre-stall behavior of the compressor is investigated to reveal the mechanism of this stall margin improvement ability of the SPS casing treatment. The results do show that this casing treatment delays the occurrence of rotating stall by weakening the pressure perturbations and suppressing the nonlinear amplification of the stall <b>precursor</b> <b>waves</b> in the compression system...|$|R
40|$|When a {{detonation}} propagates in {{an explosive}} that partially fills a channel, a shock wave {{can be generated}} in the air gap between the explosive and its confinement. This is typically {{referred to as the}} channel effect. In the air gap, the detonation products behave as a piston, which drives the <b>precursor</b> air shock <b>wave</b> ahead of the detonation. Since the shock wave runs ahead of the detonation, it preconditions the explosive and the detonation propagates into shocked explosive. This can affect the detonation in various ways, depending {{on the nature of the}} explosive. Properties such as heterogeneity, porosity and sensitivity of the explosive will determine how the precursor shock will affect the detonation propagation. Four different coupling mechanisms have been identified and are discussed in this thesis. They have been called: precompression, detonation initiation, surface ignition and dead pressing. In the present study, three cases are investigated experimentally: precompression, detonation initiation and the case where no coupling occurs. The goal is to elucidate the respective propagation mechanisms. It is found that boundary layers on the channel walls significantly affect the <b>precursor</b> shock <b>wave</b> propagation. This effect is modeled and the results are compared to experiments. When the explosive is PETN powder, the detonation is found to accelerate to 1. 5 times the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Experiments performed indicate that this is due to precompression of the PETN. Again this effect is modeled and compared with experiments. It is also demonstrated that in the present experiments, coupling via initiation does not occur. However, experiments were performed to determine why the explosive is not initiated by the <b>precursor</b> shock <b>wave.</b> It is found that the initiation delay for the strength of precursor shock generated is simply too long for any coupling to occur...|$|R
