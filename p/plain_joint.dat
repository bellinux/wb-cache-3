40|$|Until {{the early}} 1990 s, curling and warping of Portland cement {{concrete}} pavement did not concern pavement engineers in many transportation agencies. Since beginning {{construction of the}} interstate system in the United States in the late 1950 s through the late 1980 s, the performance of Portland cement concrete pavement {{has been associated with}} properties of concrete as a pavement material. In those years developed standards and design guidelines emphasized better concrete materials and construction control. At the time, combining curling and loading stresses was quite controversial {{due to the nature of}} the load-carrying capacity of concrete pavement and the occurrence of types of loads. Arguments developed that the types of loads (traffic and curling) rarely occurred at the same time of day.

And grain yield, protein content in grain and stability time of paste, reduced as a result. When the topdressing fertilizer N was postponed from jointing stage to booting stage, the regularity of above index changed conversely.

50|$|Three main {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements commonly used are <b>Jointed</b> <b>plain</b> concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and {{continuously reinforced concrete}} pavements (CRCP). JPCP’s are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements do not use any reinforcing steel. JRCP’s are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCP’s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement’s natural transverse cracks together.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{construction}} of <b>Jointed</b> <b>Plain</b> Concrete Pavements (JPCPs) in Chile, {{it was observed that}} joints remained uncracked. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate the effects of uncracked joints (UnCrJ) in JPCPs and to propose possible solutions or improvements to avoid or minimize this phenomenon. Considering low thermal amplitude as cause of UnCrJ, a rational-based, detailed and empirically validated model is used to predict UnCrJ and crack width. The modelled results are not only due to material changes but also to the location of the series of cracks in time in the JPCP system. The paper contributes with this rational approach, instead of an empirical-simplified one, to achieve the objectives. For the modelled conditions, the "as-built" slab length range is 8 m to 56 m instead of the 4 m designed one. Then, more curling, joint faulting, water infiltration in sealed joints and load transfer efficiency &# 8804; 70 % are expected.
