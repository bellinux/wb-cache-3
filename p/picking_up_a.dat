This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley, having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster.

5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions {{are determined by}} rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E

After being on duty for over 22 hours, Wilson volunteered to take reinforcements to the front line, returning with two wounded soldiers. For his actions over the 24‑hour period Flt Lt Wilson was awarded the DFC.|$|E

5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the last year. A more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Diarra {{was signed}} to an amateur {{contract}} by professional club CS Louhans-Cuiseaux who were playing in Ligue 2, {{the second level}} of French football, and was inserted into the club's youth academy.

Diarra refused the deal and was subsequently available to sign with any club on a free transfer.|$|E

5|$|Parslow and McGurk were {{appointed}} as club captains for 2009–10, although Parslow {{would continue to}} wear the armband in matches.
