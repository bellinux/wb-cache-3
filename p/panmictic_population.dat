Although panmictic, {{the population is}} diversifying.

40|$|To {{study the}} genetic {{determinism}} of multifactorial diseases in large <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations,</b> a strategy consists {{in looking for}} an association with markers closely linked to candidate genes. A distribution of marker genotypes different in patients and controls may indicate that the candidate gene {{is involved in the}} disease. In <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations,</b> the power to detect the role of a candidate gene depends on the gametic disequilibrium with the marker locus. In consanguineous populations, we show that it depends on the inbreeding coefficient F as well. Inbreeding increases the power to detect the role of a recessive or quasi-recessive disease-susceptibility factor. The gain in power turns out to be greater for small values of the gametic disequilibrium. Moreover, {{even in the absence of}} gametic disequilibrium, the presence of inbreeding may allow to detect the role of a recessive factor. Ignoring inbreeding when it exists may lead to reject falsely a recessive model if the mode of inheritance is inferred on the distribution of genotypes among patients...|$|R
50|$|A <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> is {{one where}} all {{individuals}} are potential partners. This assumes {{that there are no}} mating restrictions, neither genetic nor behavioural, upon the population, and that therefore all recombination is possible.

50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Anguillidae, longfin eels have a rather unusual life cycle: they grow and mature into fertile adults in fresh water, then migrate to the sea to breed. This {{catadromous}} breeding system also ensures randomised mating, creating a <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, if the {{separating}} {{factor is}} removed before this happens (ex. a road is {{cut through the}} forest), and the individuals are allowed to move about freely, the individual populations will {{still be able to}} interbreed. As the species's populations interbreed over time, they become more genetically uniform, functioning again as a single <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the Penna ageing model to analyze how the {{differences}} in evolution of sex chromosomes depend on the strategy of reproduction. In <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations,</b> when females (XX) can freely choose the male partner (XY) for reproduction from the whole population, the Y chromosome accumulates defects and eventually the only information it brings is a male sex determination. As a result of shrinking Y chromosome the males become hemizygous in respect to the X chromosome content and are characterized by higher mortality, observed also in the human populations. If it is assumed in the model {{that the presence of}} the male is indispensable at least during the pregnancy of his female partner and he cannot be seduced by another female at least during the one reproduction cycle - the Y chromosome preserves its content, does not shrink and the lifespan of females and males is the same. Thus, Y chromosome shrinks not because of existing in one copy, without the possibility of recombination, but because it stays under weaker selection pressure; in <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations</b> without the necessity of being faithful, a considerable fraction of males is dispensable and they can be eliminated from the population without reducing its reproduction potential.

40|$|Selective sweeps affect neutral genetic {{diversity}} through hitchhiking. While {{this effect is}} limited to the local genomic region of the sweep in <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations,</b> we find that in spatially-extended populations the combined effects of many unlinked sweeps can affect patterns of ancestry (and therefore neutral {{genetic diversity}}) across the whole genome. Even low rates of sweeps can be enough to skew the spatial locations of ancestors such that neutral mutations that occur in an individual living outside a small region {{in the center of the}} range have virtually no chance of fixing in the population.

40|$|We present {{discrete}} stochastic mathematical {{models for}} the growth curves of synchronous and asynchronous evolutionary algorithms with populations structured according to a random graph. We show that, to a good approximation, randomly structured and <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations</b> have the same growth behavior. Furthermore, we show that global selection intensity depends on the update policy. The validity of the models is confirmed by a comparison with experimental results of simulations. We also present experimental results on small-world and scale-free population graph topologies. We show that they lead to qualitatively similar results. However, the different nature of the nodes can be exploited to obtain a more varied evolutionary behavior...|$|R
50|$|Balancing {{selection}} {{refers to}} a number of selective processes by which multiple alleles (different versions of a gene) are actively maintained in the gene pool of a population at frequencies larger than expected from genetic drift alone. This can happen by various mechanisms, in particular, when the heterozygotes for the alleles under consideration have a higher fitness than the homozygote. In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved. Evidence for balancing selection {{can be found in the}} number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies. All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is ubiquitous in <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{panmixia}} may not {{be widely}} extant, the potential for it does occur, {{although it may be}} only ephemeral because of those local perturbations. It has been shown, for example, that the F2 derived from random fertilization of F1 individuals (an allogamous F2), following hybridization, is an origin of a new potentially <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b> It has also been shown that if panmictic random fertilization occurred continually, it would maintain the same allele and genotype frequencies across each successive panmictic sexual generation—this being the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. However, as soon as genetic drift was initiated by local random sampling of gametes, the equilibrium would cease.|$|E
50|$|Analysis of {{skulls and}} mandibles {{of a lion}} that {{inhabited}} Yakutia (Russia), Alaska (United States), and the Yukon Territory (Canada) during the Pleistocene epoch suggested {{that it was a}} new subspecies different from the other prehistoric lions, Panthera leo vereshchagini, known as the East Siberian- or Beringian cave lion. It differed from Panthera leo spelaea by its larger size and from the American lion (Panthera leo atrox) by its smaller size and by skull proportions. However, recent genetic research, using ancient DNA from Beringian lions found no evidence for separating Panthera leo vereshchagini from the European cave lion; indeed, DNA signatures from lions from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable, suggesting one large <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ecotypes {{are closely}} related to morphs. In the context of {{evolutionary}} biology, genetic polymorphism is the occurrence in equilibrium of two or more distinctly different phenotypes within a population of a species, in other words, the occurrence of more than one form or morph. The frequency of these discontinuous forms (even that of the rarest) is too high to be explained by mutation. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat {{at the same time and}} belong to a <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> (whose all members can potentially interbreed). Polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations of species by natural selection (most famously sexual dimorphism in humans) in contrast to transient polymorphisms where conditions in a habitat change in such a way that a [...] "form" [...] is being replaced completely by another.|$|E
40|$|Genetic drift is a {{well known}} and {{important}} force in directing {{the evolution of a}} population. The nature of genetic drift in <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations</b> is well understood, and new research is shedding light on the behaviour of genetic drift. This paper explores the concept of using evolutionary algorithms to search for population structures that exhibit the minimum and maximum conditions for loss of variation via genetic drift. Two spatial structures repeatedly emerge as candidates: a star topology that reduces fixation time to a logarithm of population size, and a “line with islands ” topology that can delay fixation via genetic drift {{to a greater extent than}} any previously known population structure...|$|R

Representative gene frequency was estimated as. 0198, with two to four major gene loci per ethnic group. In both the simplex families and those with deaf parents, the only significant etiology found was homozygosity for pathologic recessive genes.

40|$|The use of small-world graphs as a {{topology}} {{structure for}} the population of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) has been recently proposed in the literature.

Therefore, we perform ax study in this work, both theoretically and empirically, on the most appropriate mechanisms to generate SW topologies for Genetic Algorithms (a family of EA). The algorithms are analyzed in terms of efficiency and efficacy, and the best studied variant is validated versus other GAs using well known centralized and decentralized population structures, outperforming them...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today. The specialized Pleistocene wolves did {{not contribute to the}} genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges. Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East. Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the Last Glacial Maximum haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{cycles of}} half-sib {{recurrent}} selection {{were conducted in}} the BSSS maize population followed by ten cycles of S 2 progeny recurrent selection. The population under S 2 progeny recurrent selection is formally known as BS 13 (S). The selection criteria have always placed importance on high grain yield, low grain moisture, and reduced plant lodging. Two evaluations estimating the response of multiple agronomic traits in multiple response units including the population sampled at F IS = 0, FIS = 0. 5, and FIS = 0. 75 levels of inbreeding, and multiple testcrosses of the population were conducted. The average response of grain yield in the FIS = 0. 5 and FIS = 0. 75 response units (i. e. inbred response units) of the population are significantly greater than the average responses in both the <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> and multiple testcrosses of <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b> There is no statistical grain yield response to selection in the FIS = 0 response unit (<b>panmictic</b> <b>population).</b> A testcross of the <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> to BS 13 (S) C 0 has an average response greater than the <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> indicating that the limited response in the FIS = 0 response unit is not likely due to random genetic drift, however, the allelic frequencies are diverging from the progenitor population. Favorable responses have been observed for root lodging {{in all of the}} response units however, a limited response for stalk lodging exist. The response of grain moisture is inconsistent between the two evaluations likely as a result of inconsistent selection practices and the difficulty to select for this trait. We hypothesize that the most important reason for the realized lack of response in the <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> is due to a low inbred-outbred correlation and may be caused by an overdominantlike gene action within this population. To avoid the necessity for assumptions about gene action controlling the traits in maize and importance of additive and non-additive effects, the genetic gain equation must be developed in relation to the selection unit and target response unit (i. e. S 1 s, S 2 s, half-sibs, or full-sibs). This dissertation supports both the genetic gain equations reported by Wardyn (2006) and the hypothesis of overdominant-like gene action in this population reported by Edwards and Lamkey (2002) ...|$|E
40|$|The population-genetic {{consequences}} of population structure are {{of great interest}} and have been studied extensively. An area of particular interest is the interaction among population structure, natural selection, and genetic drift. At first glance, different results in this area give very different impressions {{of the effect of}} population subdivision on effective population size (N(e)), suggesting that no single value of N(e) can completely characterize a structured population. Results presented here show that a population conforming to Wright's island model of subdivision with genic selection can be related to an idealized <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> (a Wright-Fisher population). This equivalent <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> has a larger size than the actual population; i. e., N(e) is larger than the actual population size, as expected from many results for this type of population structure. The selection coefficient in the equivalent <b>panmictic</b> <b>population,</b> referred to here as the effective selection coefficient (s(e)), is smaller than the actual selection coefficient (s). This explains how the fixation probability of a selected allele can be unaffected by population subdivision despite the fact that subdivision increases N(e), for the product N(e) s(e) is not altered by subdivision...|$|E

40|$|Our {{data on a}} {{subterranean}} mammal, Spalax ehrenbergi, {{and other}} evidence, indicate that appreciable polymorphism can be preserved in small isolated populations consisting of several dozens of, or a hundred, individuals. Current theoretical models predict fast gene fixation in small <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations</b> without selection, mutation, or gene inflow. Using simple multilocus models, we demonstrate here that moderate stabilizing selection (with stable or fluctuating optimum) for traits controlled by additive genes could oppose random fixation in such isolates during thousands of generations. We also show that in selection-free models polymorphism persists {{only for a few}} hundred generations even under high mutation rates. Our multi-chromosome models challenge the hitchhiking hypothesis of polymorphism maintenance for many neutral loci due to close linkage with few selected loci...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that the most recent common ancestor for a randomly mating population of size n would have lived approximately log 2 n generations ago; for example, a <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> of one million people would have a common ancestor about 20 generations in the past. Structured populations consisting of panmictic subpopulations connected by migration at frequencies as low as one migrant per generation also have remarkably recent common ancestors. Mathematical analysis of such a structured model reveals that the time to the most recent common ancestor is a typically modest graph-theoretic factor multiplied by the corresponding time for a <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> of the same overall size. Computer simulations of populations having more complex structure, including models not amenable to theoretical analysis, confirm and extend these results.

40|$|Populations of {{cuttlefish}} (Sepia officinalis) in the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel {{have previously}} {{been regarded as}} separate populations, since they display different life cycles and different physiological characteristics. pH analyses of in vitro blood oxygen binding capacities show different pH optima for haemocyanin of animals from the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel. However, analysis of seven microsatellite loci carried out on cuttlefish from sites in the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the southern North Sea revealed that all individuals appear {{to belong to a}} large <b>panmictic</b> <b>population</b> with a low degree of genetic variation, indicating regular genetic exchange.

40|$|Abstract. A {{population}} genetics {{study of the}} mosquito Ochlerotatus triseriatus was performed on 36 collections from adjoining regions of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin covering approximately 120 km 2.

The heated oligonucleotide ligation assay was used to identify the ND 4 haplotype of each mosquito. No evidence of genetic isolation by distance was found, nor did Interstate 90 or the Mississippi River serve as barriers to gene flow. The effective migration rate varied from 18 to 45 reproductive migrants/generation, which is similar to estimates from an earlier study. The collections belong to a single, large, <b>panmictic</b> <b>population.</b> However, within this <b>panmictic</b> <b>population,</b> local genetic drift arises, possibly due to one or a few females ovipositing in larval breeding containers.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{structures for}} various multiallele sex-determining genetic models of <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations</b> with sex expression {{depending on the}} genotypes of either the zygote or a parent are described. Even-sex-ratio equilibrium surfaces can exist apart from equilibrium points having coincident male and female allelic frequency sets. The latter (symmetric) equilibrium states entail biased sex ratios. A stable symmetric equilibrium and an even-sex-ratio equilibrium segregating the same alleles cannot coexist. The tendency to evolve toward an even-sex ratio is embodied by the following optimality property: starting from an equilibrium having a biased sex ratio, mutant sex-determining alleles can accumulate only in the case in which in the augmented system all attainable equilibrium states have a sex ratio closer to one to one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Population disjunctions, as a {{first step}} toward {{complete}} allopatry, present an interesting situation to study incipient speciation. The geological formation of the Baja California Peninsula currently divides 19 species of fish into disjunct populations that are found on its Pacific Coast and {{in the northern part of}} the Gulf of California (also called the Sea of Cortez), but are absent from the Cape (Cabo San Lucas) region. We studied the genetic makeup of disjunct populations for 12 of these 19 fish species. Phylogeographic patterns for the 12 species can be separated into two major classes: a first group (eight species) showed reciprocal monophyly and high genetic divergence between disjunct populations. A second group (four species) displayed what appeared to be <b>panmictic</b> <b>populations.</b> Population structure between Pacific Coast populations, across the Punta Eugenia biogeographic boundary, was also evaluated. While dispersal potential (inferred by pelagic larval duration) was a poor predictor of population structure between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we found that population genetic subdivision along the Pacific Coast at Punta Eugenia was always positively correlated with differentiation between Pacific and Gulf of California populations. Vicariant events, ongoing gene flow, and ecological characteristics played essential roles in shaping the population structures observed in this study...|$|R
