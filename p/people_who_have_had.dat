SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury, and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E

5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit {{a large proportion of}} maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 percent of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two {{areas of the brain}} that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke can present with symptoms similar to MD, and in {{people at risk}} for stroke magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be conducted to exclude TIA or stroke, and as TIA is often a precursor to stroke, that risk should be managed.|$|E
25|$|Family {{members may}} have a genetic {{tendency}} for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> ischemic stroke for the first time.

The group occupies the back room of the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa.

25|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) infection causes {{more than}} 90% of cases; most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex {{at a young}} age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done {{to determine whether or}} not the cancer has spread.|$|E

50|$|Pain is {{a common}} symptom in MS. A recent study {{systematically}} pooling results from 28 studies (7101 patients) estimates that pain affects 63% of people with MS. These 28 studies described pain in a large range of different people with MS.

25|$|Given {{the disease}} burden of strokes, {{prevention}} {{is an important}} public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. In those who are otherwise healthy, aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended. In <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a myocardial infarction or those with a high cardiovascular risk, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had a stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 {{approximately}} 6.9 {{million people}} had an ischemic stroke and 3.4 million {{people had a}} hemorrhagic stroke. In 2015 there were about 42.4million people who had previously had a stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of strokes which occurred each year decreased by approximately 10% {{in the developed world}} and increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of strokes occurred in those over 65 years old.|$|E
25|$|The ABO antigen is also {{expressed}} on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% {{of the total}} genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by {{the effect of the}} ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to the ninth chromosome (9q34), the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.|$|E
