50|$|By 1923, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 99,153 {{applicants}} only 7,345 actually {{received the}} <b>parcels.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of planned {{villages in the}} Wołyń Voivodeship only three were ever actually created, with 51 inhabitants altogether. The pace of the action was equally slow {{in other parts of}} the area. Altogether the land granted to the demobilized soldiers amounted to 1,331.46 km². <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> 8732 plots of land allotted to demobilised soldiers only 5557 have actually been settled by January 1, 1923. Some state-owned land parcels were also sold to civilians, establishing civilian or mixed settlements.|$|R
50|$|Chief Solano {{was also}} {{one of a handful of}} natives to receive a land grant in the mission {{secularization}} and <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mexican-American lands.

Some chose to work as seasonal or year-round ranch labors for Vallejo at the Rancho Petaluma Adobe or other area ranches.|$|R
50|$|What {{resulted}} was the plunder of movable wealth (of {{which the}} monasteries {{had become the}} keepers {{during the period of}} Viking invasion) and the <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.|$|R
50|$|The first {{documented}} {{visit to}} the Durham area was by Eliab Youmans, who had been commissioned to survey the Maitland patents in 1767. Undoubtedly explorers, hunters, and trappers preceded Youmans, but their travels were unrecorded. The patents were the first official <b>parceling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the largely unclaimed land and were the precursors to settlement. Eight patents have been identified for lands that were in, or partly {{in the town of}} Durham.|$|R

(However, this house was not used for the filming <b>of</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> Africa, as the pictures were taken in her first farmhouse, Mbagathi, nearby, where she lived between 1914 and 1917.) Nowadays the museum is situated in the upscale Nairobi suburb of [...] "Karen," [...] a town that was created by the <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the coffee farm's land after Blixen's return to Denmark.|$|R
40|$|The agrarian {{question}} {{was one of}} the main problems of the economy of the Second Republic of Poland (1918 - 1939). Witold Staniewicz - the minister of the agrarian reform - was the creator of the agrarian program which was based on the agrarian act of December 28 th 1925. According to this act the government should have realised the following tasks: an integration of the separate pieces of land of the same owner into a whole, an aggrandizement of the smallholdings, the state’s credits for the agriculture, a creation of the new farms with the land <b>of</b> <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the great property, a settlement action on the eastern borderlands of Poland, an arrangement of the melioration, and a regulation of the easements. In the years 1926 - 1930 a <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a great property, a liquidation of the servitudes, an integration of the lands, and the other works which influenced the agrarian structure of the country were completed quicker than before. They were realised in a moderate still consequent way. A good conjuncture in agriculture that had lasted since 1928 favoured the realisation of such a policy. Still in the following years, the diminution of sum spending on those purposes slopped that activity. Zadanie pt.

50|$|In 1568, {{responding}} to {{protests against the}} common abuses resulting from the direct enslavement of indigenous people by conquistadors, the Spanish King, Phillip II, created laws to protect the Indians and decreed such <b>parceling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> indigenous peoples as slaves to be illegal. Instead of being owned directly by individual conquistadors, Indian villages or tribes were to pay a prescribed amount into a fund <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which an annual stipend was {{to be paid to}} each of the grantees. Nonetheless, the conquistadors protested to their Governor against this new arrangement and in January 1569 the Governor, Perafin de Ribera, illegally apportioned the indigenous peoples as slaves, including those of the villages surrounding Cartago, amongst approximately forty Spaniards.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, {{sensitive}} {{to how the}} treatment of waqf properties would be viewed internationally, criticized government policy towards the cemetery. A ministry representative described the vandalism to tombstones, including their use by the guard appointed by the Religious Ministry to build a henhouse beside his shelter in the cemetery, {{and the destruction of}} ancient tombs by bulldozers cleaning the Mamilla Pool. Noting the site constituted waqf property and lay within sight of the American Consulate, the ministry said it viewed the situation, which included plans for new roads and the <b>parceling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> portions to private landowners as compensation for other properties confiscated by the state, with deep regret.|$|R

She had been pitiless towards Cissie in her grief.

Cissie had still to play the lover, and her man was already in khaki. There would be no such year as Letty had had {{in the days before}} the war darkened the world. Before Cissie's marrying the peace must come, and the peace was still far away. And Direck too would have to take his chances....|$|R

50|$|Buildings in {{the city}} have various {{development}} levels that are met by improving the local area, with higher levels providing more benefits to the city. For example, a commercial store will increase in level if nearby residents are more educated, which in turn {{will be able to}} allow more employees to be hired and increase tax revenue for the city. When the player has accumulated enough residents and money, they can purchase neighboring plots of land, allowing them to build up 8 additional <b>parcels</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 25 within a 10 x 10 km area. The parcel limitation is to allow the game to run across the widest range of personal computers, but players can use Steam Workshop modifications to open not only all of the game's standard 25-tile building area, but the entire map (81 tiles, 324 square kilometers).|$|R
50|$|After the {{accession}} of James I of England, Caulfield was knighted. After the Flight of the Earls of 1607, he {{was appointed}} receiver of the rents of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, until 1610.

On 17 April 1613 he was named a privy councillor, and the same year he was chosen knight of the shire for Armagh. in the Irish Parliament. On 19 February 1615 he was made master of the ordnance, and on 10 May of the same year one of the council for the province of Munster. Subsequently {{he was appointed}} a member of the commission for the <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> escheated lands.|$|R

50|$|A city near Colenda {{lived by}} robbery {{because of its}} poverty. It was {{inhabited}} by mixed Celtiberian tribes who had been allies of Marcus Marius in a war against the Lusitianians and he settled them there five years earlier {{with the approval of}} the senate. Titus Didius wanted to destroy them and got the approval of senatorial commissioners. He told the city that he would allot the land of Colenda to them and to assemble for the <b>parcelling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the land. He moved the Roman soldiers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their camp and told the people to go in there because he wanted to put the men on a register and the women and children on another. When they got in he had them killed by the army. This is similar to the kind of treachery with which Servius Sulpicius Galba butchered many Lusitanians to end their rebellion of 155-150 BC (see Lusitanian War and Viriathic War section).|$|R
