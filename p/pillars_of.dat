5|$|<b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> Eternity was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game uses {{a modified version of}} the Unity game engine made specifically for <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> Eternity. The game was directed by Josh Sawyer. There were multiple competing pitches for <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> Eternitys storyline within the studio, and the one worked on by Eric Fenstermaker and George Ziets ultimately won, after which Fenstermaker, who previously worked as a writer on the company's , was designated the game's lead narrative designer. Also involved in production were Adam Brennecke, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain. The audio director of <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> Eternity was Justin Bell, who also composed the game's score. Bell stated he was inspired by the music of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when composing the game's music.|$|E

Together with further funds collected via PayPal, its budget rose to $4,163,208. In December 2013, Obsidian announced that the official title for the game would be <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> Eternity, dropping the working title Project Eternity. They also launched a poll asking backers whether or not they would support further fundraising.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{separate}} legal entities, the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially {{shared the}} Common Assembly and the European Court of Justice, although the Councils and the High Authority/Commissions remained separate. To avoid duplication, the Merger Treaty merged these separate {{bodies of the}} ECSC and Euratom with the EEC. The EEC later {{became one of the}} three <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> the present day European Union.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Fire {{name comes}} from Book of Exodus, 13:21–22, which states: [...] "By day the Lord went ahead {{of them in a}} <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cloud by day nor the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire by night left its place in front of the people." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Gemara {{told that}} Rav Joseph's wife used to kindle the Sabbath lights late (just before nightfall). Rav Joseph {{told her that}} it was taught in a Baraita that the words <b>of</b> [...] "the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cloud by day, and the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire by night, {{departed}} not," [...] teach that the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cloud overlapped the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire, and the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire overlapped the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cloud. So she thought of lighting the Sabbath lights very early. But an elder told her that one may kindle when one chooses, provided that one does not light too early (as it would not evidently honor the Sabbath) or too late (later than just before nightfall).|$|R
5|$|During the Vietnam War the Shrine {{became a}} centre of {{conflict}} when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's {{involvement in the}} war.

5|$|If general {{relativity}} {{were considered to}} be one of the two <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics, would be the other.

40|$|Within {{the current}} {{discourse}} and the often overly-commercialized hyperbole of branding and positioning, {{there is a}} particular area {{that has not been}} given due attention. Yet, with the rapid changes and the multiple crises of present-day realities, a frequently neglected area, emerges as vitally imperative. The troubles can be seen in both large as well as small businesses within Malaysia. This article, thus, aims to bring back ethics, one of the management blind-spots, into the center stage of branding and organizational transformation. The objectives of this article are two-fold: (1) to build a discussion on the value and importance of ethical branding through CSR initiatives and (2) to present a CSR ethical branding (CSR-EB) framework which delineates the content (yin) and context (yang), comprising seven pillars: <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> ethical core, <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> inner stakeholders, <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> products and services, <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> outer stakeholders, <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> cultural context, <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> spatial context, and <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> temporal context...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{official}} English {{name of the}} operation is <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Defense, the Hebrew name translates as <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Cloud. Eytan Buchman, head of the IDF's North American media desk, explained that this usage refers to the <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Cloud in the Bible that protected the Israelites during the Exodus and guided them to the Promised Land (...) [...] The Hebrew Bible and the New Testament elaborate on the story, specifying that the <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Cloud shielded the Israelites from the Egyptians' arrows and catapults. The analogy is thus to the Israel Defense Forces, which shielded Israeli citizens from rocket attacks.|$|R
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics professor was Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which Haushofer cited to justify the proposal that Germany should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.|$|E

5|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, a time {{known as}} jahiliyyah, the Kaaba became {{surrounded}} by pagan idols. In 630 CE, Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, cleansed the Kaaba by destroying all the pagan idols, and then reconsecrated {{the building to}} Allah. In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage {{with a large number}} of followers, and instructed them on the rites of Hajj. It was from this point that Hajj became one of the five <b>pillars</b> <b>of</b> Islam.|$|E

5|$|Stephen and {{his reign}} have been {{occasionally}} used in historical fiction. Stephen {{and his supporters}} appear in Ellis Peters' historical detective series Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters' depiction of Stephen's reign is an essentially local narrative, focused on the town of Shrewsbury and its environs. Peters paints Stephen as a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler, despite his execution of the Shrewsbury defenders after the taking {{of the city in}} 1138. In contrast, Stephen is depicted unsympathetically in both Ken Follett's historical novel The <b>Pillars</b> <b>of</b> the Earth and the TV mini-series adapted from it.|$|E
50|$|This {{movie is}} based on the first novel by Gerald N. Lund in the nine-part The Work and the Glory series.

However, <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Light: The Work and the Glory was the working title for the film.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Fire {{was one of}} the {{manifestations of}} the {{presence}} of the God of Israel in the Torah, the five books of Moses which appear {{at the beginning of the}} Old Testament Bible. According to Exodus, the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire provided light so that the Israelites could travel by night during the Exodus from Egypt (claimed to be the 18th Dynasty; see dating of the Exodus). The <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire is traditionally paired with the manifestation of the divine presence by day as the <b>Pillar</b> <b>of</b> Cloud. This was so they [...] "could travel by day or night". YHWH, the God of Bible, manifested himself in this <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire or cloud in order to directly guide and comfort the Israelites while he rescued them from their Egyptian slavery. Throughout the Israelite's time in the desert, traveling from Egypt to Canaan (The Promised Land), YHWH continually used this <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> fire and cloud to lead his people and remind them of his presence. When the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> God moved forward, the people of Israel would pack up their camp and follow behind it. Similarly, when the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> God's presence stopped, the Israelites would set up camp underneath it. The Tabernacle of the Lord would be set up directly underneath the cloud of the Lord. This way, God's presence was visibly in the center of the camp at all times. YHWH's holy and awesome manifestation in the cloud among the people would inspire a righteous fear as well as a blessed assurance of their safety and favor.|$|R
