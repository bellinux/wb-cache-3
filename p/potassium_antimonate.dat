40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to compare the fruit cell {{ultrastructure}} and subcellular localization of Ca 2 + after heat stress {{with the use of the}} <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> method (Slocum and Roux 1982, Tretyn et al. 1992). The tomato plants Robin cv., relatively tolerant to heat stress, were grown under uncontrolled greenhouse conditions to the stage of fruiting. The plants were placed for 20 h in two temperature regimes: 23 o C (optimal temperature) or 40 o C (heat stress) in darkness, under water vapour saturated atmosphere. Immediately after heat stress the fruits were harvested to estimate water soluble and insoluble calcium contents and subcellular localization of Ca 2 +. After heating the concentration of calcium in tomato fruits increased about twice. In both temperature treatments the water soluble fractions were lower than insoluble ones at smaller differences between insoluble and soluble fractions after heat stress. The shapes and localization of Ca 2 + detected with the use of <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> method show that in fruits of control plants the precipitates were numerous, small and of oval shape. They were dispersed in cytosol or adjoined to endoplasmic reticulum or to external membrane of chloroplast. In the fruit of heated plants the precipitates were irregular in shape, amorphous and singly dispersed in the cytosol. We observed also some cytological changes in the structure of membranes and organelles of the plants of both experimental treatments. The heat induced increase of calcium content and the changes in subcellular localization of Ca 2 + under heat stress suggest that calcium ions may be involved in avoiding heat injury. The problem requires more detailed further investigations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> {{was used}} to locate Ca 2 + in fertile and sterile anthers of a photoperiod-sensitive genic {{male-sterile}} rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica). During the development of fertile anthers, abundant calcium precipitates accumulated in the anther walls and {{on the surface of}} pollen grains and Ubish bodies at the late developmental stage of the microspore, but not in the cytoplasm of pollen grains. Following the accumulation of starch grains in pollen, calcium precipitates on pollen walls diminished and increased in parenchymatous cells of the connective tissue. In sterile anthers, calcium precipitates were abundant in the middle layer and endothecium, but not in the tapetum, as was found in fertile anthers. A special cell wall was observed between the tapetum and middle layer of sterile anthers that appeared to relate to distinctive calcium accumulation patterns and poor pollen wall formation in the loculi. The formation of different patterns of antimonate-induced calcium precipitates in the anthers of photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile rice indicates that anomalies in the distribution of calcium accumulation correlate with the failure of pollen development and pollen abortion...|$|E
40|$|Calcium was {{localized}} in ovules of Plumbago zeylanica from 1 {{day before}} anthesis to 3 days after anthesis using <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> and {{transmission electron microscopy}} in pollinated and emasculated flowers. At 1 day before anthesis, embryo sacs (containing an egg cell, a central cell and zero to three accessory cells) appear mature and contain abundant calcium precipitates (ppts), in contrast to nucellar cells. At anthesis, the vacuoles of nucellar cells have enlarged, and micropylar cells, in particular, are heavily labeled with calcium ppts. As pollen tubes elongate through ovular tissues, ppts diminish in ovular cells and become concentrated in the pollen tube cell wall. After fertilization? the calcium ppts sharply diminish in fertilized ovules; in unfertilized ovules, calcium ppts remain abundant up to 3 days after anthesis (when unfertilized ovules are shed). The distribution of calcium in the ovule changes in apparent response to fertilization, suggesting that calcium content {{may be related to}} the attraction and receipt of the pollen tube. In contrast with conventionally-organized embryo sacs with synergids, Plumbago accumulates calcium in the egg cell...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{localize}} sodium and <b>potassium</b> with <b>antimonate</b> and cobaltinitrite reagents in Suaeda leaf segments by rapid aqueous and freeze-substitution precipitation procedures and to localize chloride by freeze-substitution precipitation with silver ions. Substantial sodium losses occurred from the tissue during both types of preparation although potassium and chloride losses were considerably reduced by the use of freeze-substitution when compared with the rapid aqueous procedures. The losses during freeze-substitution resulted from the required use of ethanol as substitution solvent (rather than acetone or diethyl ether, in which the reagents were much less soluble). Analytical electron microscopy showed that silver and cobaltinitrite specifically precipitated chloride and <b>potassium</b> respectively, but <b>antimonate</b> did not specifically precipitate sodium. The vacuoles were important sites of silver and antimonate deposits, although the chloroplasts were the major sites of cobaltinitrite localization. The value of these techniques in ion localization studies is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{equilibrium}} relations of four systems were investigated in detail. These consisted of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonates</b> with antimony oxide and tantalum and niobium oxide with rubidium oxide {{as far as}} the ratio 4 Rb 2 O:llB 2 O 5 (B=Nb, Ta). The ternary system NaSbO 3 -Sb 2 O 4 -NaF was investigated extensively to determine the actual composition of the body centered cubic sodium antimonate. Various other binary and ternary oxide systems involving alkali oxides were examined in lesser detail. The phases synthesized were screened by ion exchange methods to determine mobility of the mobility of the alkali ion within the niobium, tantalum or antimony oxide (fluoride) structural framework. Five structure types warranted further investigation; these structure types are (1) hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB), (2) pyrochlore, (3) the hybrid HTB-pyrochlore hexagonal ordered phases, (4) body centered cubic antimonates and (5) 2 K 2 O: 3 Nb 2 O 5. Although all of these phases exhibit good ion exchange properties only the pyrochlore was prepared with Na(+) ions as an equilibrium phase and as a low porosity ceramic. Sb(+ 3) in the channel interferes with ionic conductivity in this case, although relatively good ionic conductivity was found for the metastable Na(+) ion exchanged analogs of RbTa 2 O 5 F and KTaWO 6 pyrochlore phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to isolate and {{investigate}} the antimony-resistant bacterial cultures which had played a role in the biological methylation of antimony compounds in the soils and cultures examined. Methods Related experiments were carried out in order to investigate antimony-resistant bacterial cultures and also to try to enrich and isolate the ones which were responsible from the methylation of inorganic antimony compounds. After mixed bacteria cultures were amended with different antimony compounds (potassium antimonyl tartrate and <b>potassium</b> hexahydroxy <b>antimonate)</b> in various growth media (DMN, trypticase soy broth with nitrate), the ones which were resistant to antimony grew in anaerobic environment and produced trimethylstibine. Individual colonies were separated from the rest of the mixed colony by striking the solution that contained the bacterial colonies on agar plates that amended with potassium hexahydroxy antimonate; and then after they grew, they were picked off the plates and re-inoculated in sterile bacterial medium. After the amendment of these monocultures with the specified antimony compounds, th...|$|R

40|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> {{was used}} to locate loosely bound calcium in the stigma and style of tobacco. The tobacco stigma is wet and covered by {{a thick layer of}} {{glycoprotein}} exudate at anthesis. The exudate contains abundant vesicles, which are densely labeled with calcium precipitates. When pollen grains arrive at the stigma, become hydrated, and as the pollen swells, Ca 2 + precipitates accumulate at the aperture. Calcium precipitates that accumulate in pollen cytoplasm are initially concentrated within small vacuoles, but as germination proceeds these appear to fuse, forming prominent, densely labeled vesicles that preferentially accumulate near the proximal region of the growing tube. Although the stigma has abundant particles, few calcium precipitates are observed in the transmitting tissue from anthesis to 11 h after pollination. However, at 22 h after pollination, accumulation of calcium increases distally from the stigmatic interface with the transmitting tissue through the length of the style to the ovary. An examination of flowering plants with differing floral biology will be needed to understand the role of loosely bound calcium accumulation and its relationship to tissue-level changes in calcium uptake, maintenance of other calcium pools, including [Ca 2 +](cyt), and in pollen and style maturation during the progamic phase.

40|$|Six arsenic species [arsenate, arsenite, arsenocholine, arsenobetaine, monomethyl arsonic acid, and {{dimethyl}} arsinic acid] {{present in}} human urine were determined using ion-exchange chromatography combined with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS). Baseline separation was achieved for all six species {{as well as for}} the internal standard (<b>potassium</b> hexahydroxy <b>antimonate</b> V) in a single chromatographic run of less than 30 min, using an ammonium carbonate buffer gradient (between 10 and 50 mM) at ambient temperature, in conjunction with cation- and anion-exchange columns in series. The performance of the method was evaluated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy, and detection limits. This method was applied to determine the concentration of these six arsenic species in human urine samples (n = 251) collected from a population-based exposure assessment survey. Method precision was demonstrated by the analysis of duplicate samples that were prepared over a 2 -year analysis period. Total arsenic was also determined for the urine samples using flow injection analysis coupled to ICP-MS. The summed concentration of the arsenic species was compared with the measured arsenic total to demonstrate mass balance...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the vacuolation in root apex {{cells of}} soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr. ]) {{seedlings}} grown in microgravity were investigated. Spaceflight and ground control seedlings were {{grown in the}} absence or presence of KMnO 4 (to remove ethylene) for 6 days. After landing, in order to study of cell ultrastructure and subcellular free calcium ion distribution, seedling root apices were fixed in 2. 5 % (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0. 1 M cacodylate buffer and 2 % (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 2. 5 % (w/v) formaldehyde, 2 % (w/v) <b>potassium</b> <b>antimonate</b> K[Sb(OH) 6] in 0. 1 M K 2 HPO 4 buffer with an osmolarity (calculated theoretically) of 0. 45 and 1. 26 osmol. The concentrations of ethylene in all spaceflight canisters {{were significantly higher than}} in the ground control canisters. Seedling growth was reduced in the spaceflight-exposed plants. Additionally, the spaceflight-exposed plants exhibited progressive vacuolation in the root apex cells, particularly in the columella cells, to a greater degree than the ground controls. Plasmolysis was observed in columella cells of spaceflight roots fixed in solutions with relatively high osmolarity (1. 26 osmol). The appearance of plasmolysis permitted the evaluation of the water status of cells. The water potential of the spaceflight cells was higher than the surrounding fixative solution. A decrease in osmotic potential and/or an increase in turgor potential may have induced increases in cell water potential. However, the plasmolysed (i. e. non-turgid) cells implied that increases in water potential were accompanied with a decrease in osmotic potential. In such cells changes in vacuolation may have been involved to maintain turgor pressure or may have been a result of intensification of other vacuolar functions like digestion and storage. c 2003 COSPAR.
