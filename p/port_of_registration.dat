5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E

Transcription and translation of thirteen Exchequer 'particular' accounts and port books of sixteenth century Bristol written originally in Latin. These customs accounts cover eleven complete accounting years, running from Michaelmas (29 September) to Michaelmas. The years covered are: 1503 / 4, 1516 / 7, 1525 / 6, 1541 / 2, 1542 / 3, 1545 / 6, 1550 / 1, 1563 / 4, 1575 / 6, 1594 / 5 and 1600 / 1. The original documents are all in The National Archives in London. They were transcribed {{as part of the}} ESRC-funded project: 'Ireland-Bristol trade in the sixteenth century'. Main Topics : The customs accounts were intended to be complete records of all the overseas trade of the Port of Bristol. As such, they list every ship entering or leaving the port that was engaged in overseas trade, its <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> the shipmaster's name and the date of entry/exit. Below each shipping entry are listed all the merchants who laded goods on the ship concerned, the goods they were trading and the customs valuation/customs paid.
