5|$|<b>Pyroclastic</b> density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within <b>pyroclastic</b> {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from <b>pyroclastic</b> density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash plumes {{can form}} above <b>pyroclastic</b> density {{currents}}, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As <b>pyroclastic</b> density currents travel {{away from the}} volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the <b>pyroclastic</b> density current.|$|E

30|$|With the {{increase}} of water depth, the huge static pressure in deep water area will inhibit the expansion of boiling water vapor and magmatic gas, weaken the degree of explosion, and condense the gas at the eruption column, {{which resulted in the}} no-magmatic cementation in volcanic scoria and plastic pyroclasts. <b>Pyroclastics</b> or welded <b>pyroclastics</b> (Fig. 1 e) rather than lava are developed because of lacking welding or magma cementation.

5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually rise above the crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large <b>pyroclastic</b> flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the <b>pyroclastic</b> flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor <b>pyroclastic</b> flows, explosions and eruption columns.

Eleven rock samples of the <b>pyroclastics</b> were studied and interpreted {{on the basis of}} their petrography and whole-rock geochemistry in order to generate reliable interpretative model for their genetic and geodynamic history. Petrographic characterization shows that the rocks are composed of plagioclase (labradiorite and andesine), clinopyroxene (cpx) (augite), orthopyroxene (opx) (hypersthene), iron ores, olivine, nepheline and k-spar (in three samples), and quartz (in five samples). Major element geochemistry indicates that the <b>pyroclastics</b> are deficient in CaO and MgO, high in Na 2 O, TiO 2, and LOI, and low to high in K 2 O and are mainly alkali rocks with some olivine tholeiites, and a wide range of SiO 2 contents (38. 51 - 51. 69 %; av. 45. 07 %). The <b>pyroclastics</b> are opx- and cpx-normative with high normative plagioclase (44 - 66 %; av. 53 %). Trace element compositions indicate low contents of LILE, Zr, Ni, and Cr and high contents of HFSE, while the range of REE abundances and distinctive chondrite-normalized patterns define LREE enrichment and HREE depletion. The <b>pyroclastics</b> probably underwent fractional crystallization of olivine and cpx from a partial melt generated from the mantle due to hotspot activities underneath constructive plate margin.

5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), <b>pyroclastic</b> flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the <b>pyroclastic</b> flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene.

40|$|Gold {{mineralization}} at the Pani prospect {{in north}} Sulawesi, Indonesia, {{is related to}} a Miocene or younger rhyodacitic volcanic center. The center, which is 3. 5 km in diameter, consists of porphyritic lavas, intrusions, breccias, and <b>pyroclastics.</b> It overlies and partly intrudes horn-blende and hornblende-biotite granodiorite and Eocene (?) basaltic volcanics. Mineralization is spatially related to the Baganite dome, which is centered on Gunung Baganite. Low-grade (0. 8 ppm) disseminated gold mineralization, associated with pyrite and minor base metals, is hosted by the dome. Silver mineralization (acanthite) occurs in minor quartz-hematite veins in overlying silicified <b>pyroclastics.</b> The most important gold mineral-ization occurs on the flank of the dome at the Pani ridge, less than 1 km from Gunung Baganite.

40|$|The {{complex is}} {{composed}} of alkaline plutonic rocks, <b>pyroclastics</b> and carbonatites, whose outcrop pattern is concentric. The alkaline plutonics consist of a. central body of biotite uncompahgrite, turjaite and ijolite, only part of which survives, and small outlying intrusions of carbonatite and nepheline syenite and areas of brecciation, fenitisation and felspatliisation of the basement. The biotite uncompahgrite is formed by the metasomatism of the inner part of a mass of pyroxenite and melteigite, the outer part of which is intruded by ijolitic conesheets and dykes. The <b>pyroclastics,</b> which were emplaced later than the central alkaline plutonics, consist of banded agglomerate, which was formed by fluidisation, and tuffs, which were deposited subaerially and under water.

Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left <b>pyroclastic</b> deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago.

40|$|The {{explosive}} jection {{of material}} from a volcanic vent produces <b>pyroclastics.</b> These are stratigraphically important {{because of their}} isochronous nature, lateral extent and potential for absolute age determinations. The <b>pyroclastics</b> also provide information {{on the nature of}} the volcanic activity, which is possibly the only record because of non-preservation in other areas. The recognition of <b>pyroclastics</b> is therefore important, but often difficult, because the high-temperature igneous material is susceptible to alteration in the diagenetic environment. In Quaternary sediments the composition of glass shards is an important aspect of tephrochronology (Westgate & Briggs, 1980) but in older sediments glass shards are usually altered to clay minerals. Exceptionally, shards are preserved unaltered, as in the case of early carbonate and silica cementation (Francis et al., 1968; Jeans et al., 1977). According to Ross (1928), features that are diagnostic for the recognition of a volcanic clay (bentonite is the term used by Ross) are, in order of apparent reliability: (i) presence of glass relict structure; (ii) presence of minerals and crystal forms characteristic of volcanic rocks, including biotite, feldspar, pyroxenes and hornblende; (iii) absence of minerals that do not have a volcanic origin, including microcline, garnet, muscovite...|$|R

30|$|The {{high heat}} {{capacity}} of the water leads to rapid cooling of magma and hot rocks, and generates chilled margins, quenching fragments and other special morphology features in particle surfaces such as quenching crack and fracture (Yu et al. 2011). The formation of cracks through particles and explosive fissures in phenocryst generated in the <b>pyroclastics</b> {{may be related to}} the rapid cooling. Additionally, the bread-crusted structures (Fig. 1 b) and cauliflower-shaped surfaces are the result of quenching fragmentation when hot <b>pyroclastics</b> are interacted with cooled water.

These microtextures of quenching cracks, bread-crusted structures, cauliflower-shaped surfaces and irregular fractures of the Quaternary Nanlongwan volcano in Jilin Province can indicate that there may have been phreatomagmatic eruption with water involved.|$|R
