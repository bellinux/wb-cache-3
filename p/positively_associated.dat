5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is <b>positively</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

40|$|I {{examined}} the environmental relationships of feathermosses, vascular plants, and mat-forming lichens in lodgepole pine forests. Seventy-two mature forest plots were surveyed using microhabitat-scale sampling for functional group abundance, canopy characteristics, nutrient availability, soil texture, topography, relative humidity and air temperature. Feathermosses <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with canopy closure, afternoon shade, nitrogen or base-cation availability, duff thickness, fine soil texture, and water-receiving positions. Lichens <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with total irradiance, aluminum:calcium availability, water-shedding positions, and base-cation or nitrogen deficiency. Vascular plants have higher within-group variability, but <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with direct irradiance, afternoon shade, canopy heterogeneity, duff thickness, nutrient availability, alkalinity, and fine soil texture. Lichen patches {{are characterized by}} lower atmospheric moisture than vascular plant or feathermoss patches, but microclimate is more strongly associated with macroclimate and soil than canopy or understory vegetation. Competition among functional groups probably occurs but is unimportant environmental filtering and initial floristics are more likely mechanism of niche partitioning. [...] P. i.

This research examines the linkages of cultural globalization (acculturation to global consumer culture, AGCC), (Lebanese) ethnic identity (LEID), religiosity (REL), individual-level (Schwartz) and consumption-related values (materialism and consumer ethnocentrism, MAT/CET) and numerous consumption behaviors; contrasting coexisting religious groups. A negative AGCC-LEID relationship exists for Muslims, whereas for Christians the two cultural forces are independent.

For the data collection, the total samples size contains of 105 firms with 525 observations, from the audited financial statements of the public listed companies at Colombo Stock Exchange, which are engaged with the R & D activities over the period of last five financial years between 2010 / 2011 and 2014 / 2015.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of personal and collective work identity (including emotion and cognition components), in predicting work motivation (operationalized as work self-determined motivation) and organizational justice (operationalized as organizational pay justice). Digitized questionnaires were distributed by e-mail to 2905 members, teachers, of a Swedish trade union. A total of 768 individuals answered the questionnaire and by that participated in this study. Personal- compared to collective work identity was shown to <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with self-determined motivation accounted for by the emotion component of personal work identity. Collective compared to personal work identity was reported to <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with organizational pay justice accounted for by the cognition component of collective work identity. All this suggests that both work-related motivation and organizational justice might be, to some extent, accounted for by the psychological mechanisms of work identity and that, as predicted, different types of work identity, play different significant roles in predicting motivation and justice at work. More precisely, the emotion component of work identity was more pronounced in personal work-bonding relationships, and the cognitive component, of work identity in contrast, was more pronounced in collective work-bonding relationships...|$|R

One hundred and thirty young adults residing in Israel filled out measures assessing Anorexia (drive for thinness), Bulimia, perceived control, and EI (two measures). The results lent only partial support to the hypotheses: EI showed a nonlinear association with control, which in turn showed nonlinear association with Anorexia scores, and contrary to our hypothesis, positive association with Bulimia scores.

40|$|Pre-operative kidney {{volume is}} an {{independent}} predictor of glomerular filtration rate in renal cell carcinoma patients. Compensatory renal growth (CRG) can ensue prior to nephrectomy in parallel to tumor growth and benign parenchyma loss. We aimed to test whether renal metabolite abundances significantly associate with CRG, suggesting a causative relationship. Tissue metabolomics data from 49 patients, with a median age of 60 years, were previously collected and the pre-operative fold-change of their contra to ipsi-lateral benign kidney volume served as a surrogate for their CRG. Contra-lateral kidney volume fold-change within a 3. 3 +/- 2. 1 years follow-up interval {{was used as a}} surrogate for long-term CRG. Using a multivariable statistical model, we identified metabolites whose abundances significantly associate with CRG. Our analysis found 13 metabolites in the benign (e. g. L-urobilin, Variable Influence in Projection, VIP, score = 3. 02, adjusted p = 0. 017) and 163 metabolites in the malignant (e. g. 3 -indoxyl-sulfate, VIP score = 1. 3, adjusted p = 0. 044) tissues that significantly associate with CRG. Benign/tumor fold change in metabolite abundances revealed three additional metabolites with that significantly <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with CRG (e. g. p-cresol sulfate, VIP score = 2. 945, adjusted p = 0. 033). At the pathway level, we show that fatty-acid oxidation is highly enriched with metabolites whose benign tissue abundances strongly <b>positively</b> <b>associate</b> with CRG, both pre-operatively and long term, whereas in the tumor tissue significant enrichment of dipeptides and benzoate (positive association), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, lysolipid and nucleotide sugar pentose (negative associations) sub-pathways, were observed.

Conscientiousness is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in conscientiousness are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, perhaps because they elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and responsible behavior.|$|E
25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as alcohol misuse in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a significant predictor of reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been <b>positively</b> <b>associated</b> with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E
