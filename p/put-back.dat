In the 2006 All-Star Game, Wade made the game-winning <b>put-back</b> off of the Philadelphia 76ers' Allen Iverson's missed shot, to lead the East to a 122–120 victory over the West. He scored 20 points on 9/11 field goals in 30 minutes of play. He finished the 2005–06 regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals per game.|$|E
25|$|Ball State Cardinals men's {{basketball}} {{began in}} 1920. Although {{there was little}} success in the program from its start until the 1970s, {{the next two decades}} would be the highlight of the program's performance. Ball State became a powerhouse in the Mid-American Conference, winning a record seven MAC tournaments and with subsequent appearances in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament between 1981 and 2000. The Cardinals' most successful year was 1990, when the team reached the Sweet Sixteen but lost to eventual national champion UNLV, 69-67. Even though the Cardinals lost the game, BSU player Chandler Thompson recorded what is considered {{to be one of the}} most memorable <b>put-back</b> dunks in College Basketball History. The team's last NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament appearance was in 2000. James Whitford became head coach in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In Game 4, Sacramento again {{got out to}} a fast {{start with}} a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final {{possession}} {{with a chance to}} tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a <b>put-back</b> attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry at the arc, who hit a 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two more crucial 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant with 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.|$|E
2500|$|However, Wallace {{was never}} a potent scorer, {{averaging}} 5.7 points per game in his career. [...] The majority of his points came from offensive <b>put-backs,</b> baskets in transition, or other high-percentage field goals. Wallace also holds the record for worst free throw shooting percentage in NBA history, at under 42 percent (minimum 1,000 free-throw attempts). This often led to teams fouling him in the fourth quarter, much like the Hack-a-Shaq defense.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Oladipo ranked fourth in the country in field goal {{percentage}} (61.4), on pace to have the highest field goal percentage by any guard since the 1996-97 season. He ranked third in the nation in true shooting percentage (68.4), which measures shooting efficiency that takes into account field goals, three-point field goals and free throws. He also averaged 1.39 points per play and shot 73.9% on offensive rebound <b>put-backs,</b> both of which ranked among the top five in the country.|$|R
50|$|In retail terms, a go-back is {{an item of}} {{merchandise}} which must be placed back on the store shelves. Such items usually accumulate during the store's open hours, and comprise a combination of returned items, items customers {{have decided not to}} purchase, and items store employees may have found left lying on the wrong shelf. Go-backs can often accumulate over several days because businesses, especially larger department stores, tend to have other priorities at the time and not enough employment to put the go-backs away. Go-backs are sometimes referred to as re-shop, <b>put-backs,</b> misplaced, shop-backs, returns, abandons, left-behinds, loose-stock, or shop-downs.|$|R

On April 4 Kentucky and Wisconsin faced off for a berth to the National Championship game against Duke. The Wildcats, once trailing by nine {{points in the first}} half and eight early in the second, were poised to close out another opponent in the final minutes, this time in the Final Four. With an 8 to 0 run and their defense holding Wisconsin scoreless for more than six minutes, the Cats grabbed a 60-56 lead with less than five minutes remaining. The Badgers reeled off an 8 to 0 run of their own that Sam Dekker started. Next, Nigel Hayes tied the game with a <b>put-back.</b> It was the last of Wisconsin's 12 offensive rebounds and 13 second-chance points. Wisconsin handed Kentucky its lone loss of the season, defeating the Wildcats 71 to 64.|$|E
500|$|The {{win over}} Madison Central {{set up a}} title game between Clay County and Louisville's Ballard High School. Clay County had only one starter taller than , while Ballard started four players taller than , {{including}} star shooting guard Allan Houston. The game featured 24 ties and 15 lead changes; neither team led by more than four points during regulation. Farmer scored Clay County's last 9 points in regulation, including consecutive go-ahead baskets at 3:19, 2:46, and 0:30. Ballard's Leonard Taylor scored on a <b>put-back</b> basket at the buzzer to tie the score at 65 and force overtime. Clay County never trailed in the overtime, and Farmer's [...] jump shot with 1:44 left put the Tigers in the lead for good. The 7673 win was Clay County's first-ever KHSAA state championship. Farmer played all 35 minutes {{of the game and}} led all scorers with 27 points to go with 6 rebounds and 4 assists. He was named to the all-tournament team, selected the tournament's Most Valuable Player, and given the Ted Sanford Award for citizenship, basketball ability, academic achievement, and sportsmanship. He was also the only underclassman named to the Lexington Herald-Leaders 1987 All-State First Team.|$|E

50|$|Jordan is {{a strong}} rebounder, {{averaging}} 10.1 rebounds per game in his career and leading the league in two different seasons. He is also an excellent post-defender who averages 1.8 blocks per game for his career. Jordan's defensive play has even been compared to the defensive play of Bill Russell, Hall of Fame center who {{is considered by many}} to be one of the greatest defenders and players of all time. On offense, he heavily relies on <b>put-backs</b> and alley-oops to score. He has led the league in field goal percentage in four different seasons. However, he is a poor free throw shooter, making just 42% of his shots at the line, leading to opponents exploiting this weakness by intentionally fouling him with the Hack-a-Shaq strategy. Jordan is considered one of the more durable players in the NBA, having played in 360 straight games at one point.|$|R
500|$|In 1957, 23 teams {{played for}} the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The Midwest {{regional}} tourney was held in Dallas, Texas, {{which at the time}} was segregated. In the first game, the Jayhawks played the all-white SMU team, and KU player John Parker later said: [...] "The crowd was brutal. We were spat on, pelted with debris, and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible." [...] KU won 73–65 in overtime, after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out. The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant, with KU winning 81–61 under intense racist abuse. In the semi-finals, Chamberlain's Jayhawks handily defeated the two time defending national champion San Francisco, 80–56, with Wilt scoring 32 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and having at least seven blocked shots. (Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred, or the ball just fell short due to Chamberlain's withering defensive intimidation). Chamberlain demonstrated his growing arsenal of offensive moves, including jump shots, <b>put-backs,</b> tip-ins, and his turnaround jump shot. He was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than he would later be during his pro career. He had outstanding foot speed throughout the game, and several times led the fast break, including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup. His stellar performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead, and he rested on the bench for the final 3:45 remaining in the game.|$|R

50|$|When play resumed Clark {{extended}} Kingston's lead to 15 {{points with}} a pair of free-throws, but a Cunningham <b>put-back</b> from a rebound sparked a Portsmouth revival.

50|$|A Tomahawk dunk can be {{performed}} {{with one or two}} hands. During the jump, the ball is raised above, and often behind the player's head for a wind-up before slamming the ball down into the net at the apex of the jump.
