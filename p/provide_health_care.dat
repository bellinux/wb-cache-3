25|$|Many {{distinct}} organizations <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the US. Facilities {{are largely}} {{owned and operated}} by private sector businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their or a family member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.|$|E
25|$|Benefis {{reported}} excess {{revenues of}} $7 million on income of $140 million in 1997. In early 1999, Benefis {{announced it was}} suffering serious financial losses that were imperiling its ability to <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> In January 1999, the company reported a loss of $3 million on revenues of $128 million in 1998, and projected a doubling of that loss in 1999 with no appreciable growth in revenues. Benefis claimed its COPA agreement did {{not account for the}} costs of consummating the merger of Columbus and Deaconess hospitals, and did not provide for adjustments to the agreement in the event competition forced changes to its business plan. The company cut costs by $17 million, saw construction costs increase by $17 million, and had not yet implemented any staff reductions. Benefis predicted losses totaling $25.7 million by 2003 unless changes to the COPA were made. After two months of negotiations, the state amended the COPA to allow Benefis to raise prices faster than originally permitted (generating $12 million in revenues), and reduce cost savings returned to the community by $39.5 million. The term of the COPA (its initial terms were to end in 2006) was not changed.|$|E

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> as [...] "a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E
