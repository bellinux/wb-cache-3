40|$|Abstract. High {{contact stress}} between the vane tips and the cam ring {{is one of}} the main {{obstacles}} to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic vane pump. A <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> for regulating the bottom pressure of the vanes at the pump suction zone is presented in this paper. Through optimization and simulation, it is found that the throttle structure has great influence on the dynamic performance of the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> and the triangular-rectangular groove is proved to be more suitable for the valve among all the investigated grooves. The theoretical analysis results show that the use of the pressure reducing valve can obviously reduce the contact forces between the cam ring and the vanes at the suction zone of the pump. The work in this research provides a feasible solution to improve the working pressure of a water hydraulic vane pump...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control the high PV value between the vanes and the cam ring in a water {{hydraulic}} vane pump, a <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> with a constant pressure ratio was developed in this study. The pressure and leakage characteristics of the valve were theoretically analyzed by simulation and the experiments were also conducted based on the valve prototype. The theoretical analysis agrees well with the experimental results. Further, these results reveal that the pressure ratio of the valve decreases to the design value with the increasing working pressure. Additionally, the leakage of the valve rises simultaneously with the increasing working pressure and can be reduced significantly by decreasing the clearance between the valve body and the spool. The presented research not only proves the successful development of the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> but also lays a foundation for the investigation of a high-pressure water hydraulic vane pump...|$|R

For a considerable time faulty operation of the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> went unnoticed, resulting in slow, imperceptible leakage of gas from the cylinder. A careful soap test revealed that gas was escaping through a small nozzle {{on the back of}} the pressure regulator.

40|$|A multiobjective {{approach}} is used here to optimize design {{and operation of}} the C-Town pipe network, searching for trade-off solutions between (1) installation cost, (2) operational cost, and (3) cost of the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> Due to {{the large number of}} decisional variables and to the complexity of the constraints considered, the optimization problem was tackled in five steps: (1) identification of some feasible (on the basis of the many constraints) first attempt solutions; (2) application of a multiobjective genetic algorithm to the 2 D optimization problem with objective functions 1 and 2, in order to obtain optimal trade-off solutions between the installation cost and operational cost, without considering the installation of pressure-reducing valves; (3) application of the multiobjective genetic algorithm to the optimization problem with objective functions 2 and 3 for each of the solution selected at the end of Step 2, in order to assess how the operational cost can decrease thanks to the installation and operation of pressure-reducing valves; (4) derivation of the 3 D Pareto surface by grouping the solutions found at the end of Steps (2) and (3). A solution was extracted from the 3 D Pareto surface of optimal solutions following some specific criteria. This solution was then further refined (Step 5) in order to allow for variable settings of the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valves</b> installed and to make it compliant with the battle guidelines concerning leakage modeling...|$|E

5000|$|Most modern {{open-circuit}} scuba sets have {{a diving}} regulator {{consisting of a}} first-stage <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the diving cylinder's output valve or manifold.

A low-pressure hose links this with the second-stage regulator, or [...] "demand valve", which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way mushroom valve in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver's mouth.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{upgraded}} high-iron domestic chromite concentrates by a carbonyl process. The upgraded chromite concentrates show {{as much as}} 10 wt pct higher Cr 203 {{content and}} up to a threefold in-crease in the Cr:Fe ratio, compared with the starting concentrates. The high-iron chromites were first reduced to convert the iron oxides to the metal, and then treated with CO at elevated pressures and low temperatures to convert part of the metallic iron fraction to iron pentacarbonyl. Carbonylation was accelerated {{by the addition of}} H 2 S in small quantities. The iron pentacarbonyl was extricated from the con-centrate in the pressure reactor during carbonylation by a CO sweep through a <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve</b> and passed through a decomposer at atmospheric pressure to convert it back to iron metal and CO.

40|$|In this paper, {{pressure}} management through <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs) {{is discussed}} with particular reference to metaheuristic optimization techniques, which {{have proven to}} be very effective in producing good results with reduced use of computational resources. In particular, the application of the harmony search (HS) method to the strategic location and setting of a prefixed number of PRVs is proposed and discussed. A single-objective optimization problem that aims at the leakage reduction through the minimization of the water pressures is defined. A double harmonic component is adopted for taking into account both the location and setting of each PRV. The hydraulic constraints handled by simulation software are considered as well. Two examples from literature are analyzed to allow comparisons. Good results compared to reduced computational time are obtained. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} important fundamentals {{associated with}} water and energy efficiency and {{highlights the importance of}} using renewable energy sources. A model of multi-criteria optimization for energy efficiency based on water and environmental management policies, including the preservation of water resources and the control of water pressure and energy consumption through a hybrid energy solution, was developed and applied to a water supply system. The methodology developed includes three solutions: (1) the use of a water turbine in pipe systems where pressures are higher than necessary and <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valves</b> are installed, (2) the optimization of pumping operation according to the electricity tariff and water demand, and (3) the use of other renewable energy sources, including a wind turbine, to supply energy to the pumping station, with the remaining energy being sold to the national electric grid. The use of an integrated solution (water and energy) proves to be a valuable input for creating benefits from available hydro energy in the water supply system in order to produce clean power, and the use of a wind source allows for the reduction of energy consumption in pumping stations, {{as well as of the}} CO 2 emission to the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Cheap and {{reliable}} electricity {{is an essential}} stimulus for economic and social development. Currently fossil fuels are used {{for the majority of}} global electricity generation, but energy shortages and pressure on all industries to reduce CO 2 emissions provide incentives for growing emphasis on the development of alternative energy-generation methods. Presently hydropower contributes about 17 % of global energy generation, which is only a fraction of its total potential. In Africa only 5 % of its estimated hydropower potential has been exploited, making it the most underdeveloped continent in terms of hydropower. An often overlooked source of hydropower energy is found in conduits, where pressure-reducing stations (PRSs) are installed to dissipate excess energy. The energy dissipated by these devices can instead be captured as hydroelectricity if turbines are installed in the conduits, either by replacing <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valves</b> (PRVs) with a turbine, or by installing the turbine in parallel with the PRV. An initial scoping investigation indicated that significant potential exists for small-scale hydropower installations in water-distribution systems in South Africa. Almost all of the country’s municipalities and water-supply utilities have pressure-dissipating stations in their water-distribution systems, where hydropower potential may exist. This dissertation reflects the development of a Conduit Hydropower Decision Support System (CHDSS), summarised in a series of flow diagrams that illustrate the developmental process (Figure i(a) provides an example). A Conduit Hydropower Development (CHD) Tool was developed to facilitate the calculation of necessary factors (the Phase 1 Economic Analysis is shown in Figure i(b)). The objective of this CHDSS was to assist municipalities and engineers in identifying conduit hydropower potential in South Africa and to provide proper guidance for the development of potential sites.

50|$|In {{some early}} oxygen rebreathers the diver had to {{manually}} {{open and close}} the valve to the oxygen cylinder to refill the counter-lung each time the volume got low. In others the oxygen flow is kept constant by a <b>pressure-reducing</b> flow <b>valve</b> like the valves on blowtorch cylinders; the set also has a manual on/off valve called a bypass. In some modern oxygen rebreathers, the pressure in the breathing bag controls the oxygen flow like the demand valve in open-circuit scuba; for example, trying to breathe in from an empty bag makes the cylinder release more gas.|$|R
5000|$|The Hyfish {{hydrogen}} fuel cell system had some unique attributes. It was ultra light and compact, which helped to keep the UAV's weight to 13.2 pounds. This fuel cell created no emissions, another great attribute, and consisted of polymer electrolyte. Because of this, {{it was able to}} create one kilowatt of electrical power output. All in all, the fuel cell weighed a measly 6.6 pounds, which included its pressurized hydrogen tank. The fuel cell stack gave power to an impeller jet which enabled flight for about six minutes, despite the less than ideal weather conditions for such an experiment. This kind of technology is what is used in jet skis. The Hyfish excited scientists and made history {{because it was the first}} fast plane with jet wings to fly with only a {{hydrogen fuel}} cell and its only power source. It performed vertical climbs into the air, loops, circles, and various other aerial acrobatics and tricks while flying at extremely fast speeds reaching 124 miles per hour. George Gu, president and CEO of Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, verbally displayed his high hopes for the future of UAVs: [...] "We are confident that record-breaking 15 to 30 hour flight times are now within reach for small UAVs, which would offer new and distruptive possibilities in the aviation industry." [...] The Hyfish development team included some notable and accomplished Scientists and researchers. SmartFish GmbH of Bern, Switzerland, developed the flight model. The gas-cell stack was designed and created by Horizon Fuel Technologies in Singapore. Drukon, located in Spitzkunnersdorf, Germany, developed and oversaw the <b>pressure-reducing</b> <b>valve.</b> And finally, Ainet in Germany developed the building of forms.|$|R
50|$|A {{low-temperature}} separator is {{a special}} one in which high-pressure well fluid is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure reducing valve so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule-Thomson effect of expanding well fluid as it flows through the <b>pressure-reducing</b> choke or <b>valve</b> into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.|$|R
40|$|This work formulates {{a unified}} set of {{boundary}} conditions to efficiently represent {{the majority of}} valve and orifice devices found in water supply, transmission, and distribution systems. A particularly useful combination of mathematical components results when a lumped inertia model is linked with a throttling device. This combination of elements, termed a pipe replacement element/valve-in-line (PREVIL), has been constructed to permit {{a wide range of}} control-valve/short-pipe combinations to be conveniently modeled with the method of characteristics. The solution is quadratic in form and explicit, regardless of the number of pipes that are connected to the boundary condition. A variety of on-off and modulating valves can be accurately handled within this framework. An additional feature developed in this treatment of <b>pressure-reducing</b> and pressure-sustaining <b>valves,</b> how controllers, and other similar devices permits a more realistic representation of these important control devices. The response time of the regulating valve on opening or closing can be readily approximated so that a greater range of control behavior can be simulated.
