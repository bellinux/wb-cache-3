5|$|A common <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> {{to include}} the modern borough of Tower Hamlets, and the former parish and borough of Shoreditch (this {{includes}} Hoxton and Haggerston {{and is now the}} southern part of the modern London Borough of Hackney). This version makes the East End conterminous with the Tower Division of Middlesex under the borders that area had in the 19th century when the East End completed the process of urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Preference</b> <b>is</b> {{given to}} {{siblings}} of {{current or former}} Benet students. In 1993 the average admitted eighth grader scored in the 87thpercentile on the placement test. Applicants without siblings at the school were admitted only with scores above the 75thpercentile; applicants with siblings at Benet were admitted with scores as low as the 50th percentile on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award is {{an award}} given {{annually}} {{as part of}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. The award is given to the coach who was considered to have made the most substantative contribution to British sport in that year. The award is decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist votes for their top two choices; their first <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> awarded two points, and their second <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> awarded one point. The winning coach is the one with the largest points total. In the case of a points tie, the person chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} graph gives {{two examples}} of <b>preferences</b> that <b>are</b> not single-peaked. The blue <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> clearly not single-peaked because the preference ranking spikes down for [...] "D" [...] and then spikes up for [...] "E". The green <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> not single-peaked because they have two outcomes that are the most preferred: [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C". Such <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called single-plateaued.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Dubliners' preferences for {{a sample of}} residential neighbourhoods and their perception of three characteristics was examined by means of Carroll's preference-mapping hierarchy. Both unconstrained and constrained <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> described by vector models but there are marked differences between the two. The unconstrained <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> strongly related to perceptions of social status, but constrained <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> far more variable and reflect the subjects' assessments of the suitability of the places for themselves. However, the <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> only tenuously related to the subjects' own personal characteristics. ...|$|R
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} problem of {{reconciling}} normative and behavioural economics. In conventional welfare economics, individuals’ <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> assumed to be coherent, and the satisfaction of those <b>preferences</b> <b>is</b> the normative criterion; but this approach breaks down if <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> incoherent. Traditionally, the preference-satisfaction criterion has been interpreted in three conceptually different ways, emphasising respectively the normative value of happiness, self-assessed well-being, and freedom. If individuals’ <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> incoherent, these interpretations diverge, leading to fundamentally different strategies {{for dealing with the}} reconciliation problem, and new questions are raised about whether normative economics should be addressed to governments or individuals...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{database}} queries, computational methods for handling <b>preferences</b> can <b>be</b> broadly divided into two categories. Query personalization methods consider that user <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> provided as a user profile separately from the query and dynamically determine how this profile will affect the query results. On the other hand, preferential query answering methods consider that <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> explicitly expressed within queries. The focus of this chapter is on query personalization methods. We will first describe how <b>preferences</b> can <b>be</b> represented and stored in user profiles. Then, we will discuss how <b>preferences</b> <b>are</b> selected from a user profile and applied to a query. ...|$|R
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|The ruling Swedish Social Democratic Party have {{remained}} in favour of neutrality and non-alignment. This <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> shared by their partners, the Green Party, {{as well as the}} Left Party. The centre-right Moderate Party and the Liberal Party are the largest parties by current parliamentary representation in favor of NATO membership. The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea is credited with renewed public calls for NATO membership from notable politicians. The Centre Party was opposed to NATO membership until September 2015, when party leadership under Annie Lööf announced that they would motion to change the party policy in order to push for Sweden to join NATO at their next party conference. The Christian Democrats, also previously opposed, likewise voted to support NATO membership at their party meeting on 9 October 2015.|$|E
5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic <b>preference</b> <b>is</b> applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
