5000|$|... 91 Express Lanes {{customers}} pay tolls from pre-paid accounts, using a FasTrak transponder — a <b>pocket-sized</b> <b>radio</b> transmission device {{mounted to}} the inside of their vehicle's windshield. This electronic toll collection technology eliminates the need to stop and pay tolls at traditional tollbooths, thus ensuring the free flow of traffic on the 91 Express Lanes.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Edward Keonjian (14 August 1909 - 6 September 1999) was a {{prominent}} engineer, an early leader {{in the field of}} low-power electronics, the father of microelectronics. In 1954 Keonjian designed the world's first solar-powered, <b>pocket-sized</b> <b>radio</b> transmitter. In 1959 Keonjian designed the first prototype of integrated circuit. In 1963 he organized the world's first international symposium on low-power electronics. Later on Keonjian collaborated with NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong as chief of failure analysis on the Apollo 11 project.|$|E

The transmitter now is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Keonjian has had more than 100 publications and 27 U.S. and foreign patents. One of the books Keonjian edited and co-authored, Microelectronics: Theory, Design, and Fabrication, sold more than one million copies worldwide and has been translated into six languages since it was first published in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|Transistor radio - {{an older}} {{term for a}} {{portable}} <b>pocket-sized</b> broadcast <b>radio</b> receiver. Made possible by {{the invention of the}} transistor and developed in the 1960s, transistor radios were hugely popular during the 1960s and 70s, and changed the public's listening habits.|$|R
5000|$|The first [...] "production" [...] all-transistor {{radio was}} the Regency TR-1, {{released}} in October 1954. Produced as {{a joint venture}} between the Regency Division of Industrial Development Engineering Associates, I.D.E.A. and Texas Instruments of Dallas Texas, the TR-1 was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was a near <b>pocket-sized</b> <b>radio</b> featuring 4 transistors and one germanium diode. The industrial design was outsourced to the Chicago firm of industrial design firm of Painter, Teague and Petertil. It was initially released in one of four different colours: black, bone white, red, and gray. Other colours were to shortly follow.|$|E
5000|$|In 1949, {{the company}} {{developed}} magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first tape recorder in Japan. In 1957, it produced a <b>pocket-sized</b> <b>radio</b> (the {{first to be}} fully transistorized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from [...] "sonus"--Latin for [...] "sound"—and Sonny-boys the most common American expression). Morita was an advocate for all the products made by Sony. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a [...] "pocket sized" [...] appearance. In 1960, it produced the first transistor television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an Emmy Award for its Trinitron television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first Betamax home video recorder, a year before VHS format came out. In 1979, the Walkman was introduced, {{making it one of}} the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.|$|E
