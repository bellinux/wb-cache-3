5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the same size. A review of their morphology and habitat, however, suggested a closer relationship to the modern <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{the modern}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> the Malagasy pygmy hippo has {{eyes on the}} side of its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of the}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b> The Malagasy pygmy hippo is {{similarly}} less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested highlands of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, {{distinct}} from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
50|$|Covering roughly 3 sq mi of savannah bush, the Jos Wildlife Park is {{a popular}} local {{attraction}} and includes animals such as lions, pythons and <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotami.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} {{deposits}} with bones of <b>pygmy</b> elephants and <b>hippopotami</b> on the island, but these {{do not contain}} artifacts.|$|R
40|$|History: Medical {{knowledge}} of <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotami</b> is limited. Anaesthesia {{has been considered}} a challenge because of the anatomy, semi-aquatic life style and aggressive behaviour. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) has been described and can contribute to active kidney disease potentially affecting anaesthesia. Physical examination and Management: Fourteen <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotami</b> were anaesthetized for general health assessment and reproductive procedures. Animals (estimated bodyweight 250 kg) were darted intramuscularly with 0. 08 mg kg(- 1) medetomidine and 1. 2 mg kg(- 1) ketamine. After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered either by circle system (100 % oxygen) or by Triservice apparatus (air or air/oxygen admixture). Heart rate (HR) respiratory rate (f(R)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and end tidal CO 2 were recorded at 5 -minute intervals. Atipamezole was administered intramuscularly (0. 4 mg kg(- 1)) {{at the end of}} the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (p < 0. 05). Most animals rapidly became recumbent although five hippopotami needed additional drugs to assure acceptable immobilization. There were no statistical differences in mean HR between animals with or without PKD (PKD: 34 +/- 8 beats minutes(- 1); no PKD: 33 +/- 6 beats minutes(- 1)), f(R) (PKD: 15 +/- 7 breaths minutes(- 1); no PKD; 12 +/- 5 breaths minutes(- 1)) and end tidal CO 2 (PKD: 7. 1 +/- 1. 3 kPa; no PKD: 7. 8 +/- 1. 4 kPa). SpO(2) was higher in animals receiving 100 % oxygen or air with oxygen (92 +/- 8 % and 91 +/- 9 % respectively) compared with animals receiving air only (77 +/- 5 %) (p = 0. 003). Recovery was uneventful after atipamezole administration. Follow-up: There were no apparent adverse effects after anaesthesia during a 24 -hour follow-up period. Discussion and conclusions: Medetomidine-ketamine-isoflurane induced satisfactory anaesthesia in this species. Incremental induction doses were related to remote injection and the animals' thick skin. There were no differences in anaesthetic parameters in animals with or without PKD. Supplemental oxygen should be mandatory during anaesthesia in this species...|$|R
5|$|Cetaceans and {{artiodactyls}} now {{are classified}} under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still {{referred to as}} Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. The hippopotamus and <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} (also known as Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus or Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> or Madagascan instead of Malagasy) {{lived on the}} island of Madagascar but are now believed to be extinct. The animals were very similar to the extant hippopotamus and <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b> The fossil record suggests that at least one species of hippopotamus lived until about 1,000 years ago, and other evidence suggests that the species may have survived until much more recently. The taxonomy of these animals is not resolved and not widely studied. The various species are believed to have survived into the Holocene era.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} mid-19th century by Alfred Grandidier, who unearthed nearly 50 individual hippos from a dried-up swamp at 'Ambolisatra' (thought to be Ambolisaka, near Lake Ihotry), {{a few miles from}} the Mozambique Channel. As many as four different species of hippopotamus were subsequently identified by various researchers. In a careful revision of the fossil record of the Malagasy hippos, Solweig Stuenes concluded that there were only two species of hippopotamus which she classified as Hippopotamus lemerlei and Hippopotamus madagascariensis. In 1990, Faure and Guerin discovered a distinct third species of hippo, which they named Hippopotamus laloumena. In a review of Stuenes work, Harris suggested that Hip. madagascariensis had much in common with the extant <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> of West Africa. Since the extant <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> was placed in the genus Hexaprotodon, he used the name Hex. madagascariensis. Some taxonomists, however, consider the modern pygmy hippo to belong to the genus Choeropsis, so this species may also be classified as C. madagascariensis.|$|E
40|$|Madagascar is {{a country}} known for its {{incredible}} biodiversity, but it has lost {{the majority of its}} distinctive megafauna. In a progressive extinction event still not well understood, Madagascar lost its giant lemurs, hippopotami, crocodylians, elephant birds and tortoises species. This research project focuses on the extinction of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotami</b> from Anjohibe cave, and includes the description of multiple adult individuals as well as one juvenile. There are currently three extinct hippo species described from the island; Hippopotamus madagascariensis, Hippopotamus lemerlei, and Hippopotamus laloumena. Evidence from this study, combined with our understanding of species’ distributions, suggests that the species discovered in Anjohibe Cave was Hippopotamus madagascariensis. Recent habitat transformation and degradation in this region has changed the habitat around the cave system; while it used to be very forested and moist, it is currently much drier and degraded. Given the strong build of the skull, it can be concluded that this species was likely more land-based. The possible role of habitat change in the extinction of this species, as well as hunting, is explored. Dating of hippopotamus fossils indicate that many of these animals were alive when humans came, and that they overlapped for at least a millennium. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{adaptations to}} a more {{terrestrial}} life than the common <b>hippopotamus,</b> <b>pygmy</b> hippos are still more aquatic than all other even-toed ungulates. The ears and nostrils of pygmy hippos have strong muscular valves to aid submerging underwater, and the skin physiology {{is dependent on the}} availability of water.|$|R
50|$|Cyprus {{was settled}} by humans in the Paleolithic period (known as the stone age) who coexisted with various dwarf animal species, such as dwarf {{elephants}} (Elephas cypriotes) and <b>pygmy</b> hippos (<b>Hippopotamus</b> minor) {{well into the}} Holocene. There are claims of an association of this fauna with artifacts of Epipalaeolithic foragers at Aetokremnos near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. The first undisputed settlement occurred in the 9th (or perhaps 10th) millennium BC from the Levant. The first settlers were agriculturalists of the so-called PPNB (pre-pottery Neolithic B) era, but did not yet produce pottery (aceramic Neolithic).|$|R
5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, African wild dogs, Grévy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped skunks, <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> Scottish wild cats, Malayan tapirs, white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile lechwe, grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus.</b> The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
50|$|Cyprus was not {{settled in}} the Paleolithic (before agriculture) which allowed {{survival}} of numerous dwarf forms, such as dwarf elephants (Elephas cypriotes) and <b>pygmy</b> hippos (<b>Hippopotamus</b> minor) well into the Holocene. These animals {{are thought to have}} arrived on the island as a result of being swept out to sea while swimming off the coast of the nearby mainland. There are claims of an association of this fauna with artifacts of Epipalaeolithic foragers at Aetokremnos near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. The extinction of the pygmy hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of Homo sapiens on Cyprus. There is evidence of this because of the piles of burned bones in the camps occupied by these early humans in caves on the southernmost point on the Island.|$|R
40|$|Plants evolve {{physical}} defences, such as spines, against browsing herbivores. However, in some cases, these defences may be anachronistic {{because the}} principal consumers of protected {{parts of the}} plant are extinct. In such cases, there may be few extant species consuming heavily defended resources. Here we examine the spiny defences of Madagascar’s endemic Didiereoideae, and ask whether they may be anachronistic. To accomplish this aim, we reviewed the literature to determine which species consume these plants today, and then used stable isotope biogeochemistry to determine who may have exploited Didiereoideae in the recent past. There are four major groups of browsers that are now extinct in Madagascar: giant lemurs, elephant birds (Aepyornis and Mullerornis: Aepyornithidae), <b>pygmy</b> hippopotamuses (<b>Hippopotamus)</b> and giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys: Testudinidae). Each group was evaluated for isotopic evidence of didiereoid plant consumption. Given the structure of members of this plant clade (especially Alluaudia), we predicted that lemurs would be their most important consumers. Three extant lemur species consume Didiereoideae. Several of the extinct lemurs, particularly Hadropithecus stenognathus, may have relied heavily on these spiny plants. None of the non-lemur megafaunal browsers (elephant birds, hippopotamuses and giant tortoises) were important consumers of Didiereoideae...|$|R

25|$|On 12 November 2007, a 13-ft long {{reticulated}} python {{was found}} in a ventilator inside the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> enclosure in the zoo. According to the zoo officials, the rescued python could have escaped from its enclosure, when it was young, 4 to 5 years ago. When the workers tried to take the reptile, it bit one of the animal keepers, but since it was a non-poisonous one, the animal keeper was not harmed fatally and was provided treatment for the injury. The reptile was feeding on small mammals, roaming freely inside the zoo, which helped it survive without any problem.|$|E
500|$|The Malagasy <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> is {{classified}} {{along with the}} modern Liberian <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> but researchers sometimes place the Liberian hippo in two different genera.

500|$|After {{a year or}} two at the National Zoo, Billy's {{offspring}} {{were typically}} sent to other locations. [...] Among the places to which his progeny were transferred: the Cole Bros. Circus, Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, Catskill Game Farm, the Miller Bros. Circus, the Fort Worth Zoo, as well as international destinations such as Sydney and London. [...] In 1960, after learning that the zoo's female pygmy hippos remained without male companionship after Billy's death, Liberian President William Tubman dispatched a search party to find a new male <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> to ship to Washington. [...] The <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> named Totota, arrived in Brooklyn, New York, on February 4, 1960, and traveled via station wagon to Washington the next day, where he would continue Billy's breeding legacy with the zoo's female pygmy hippos, two of which were Billy's daughters.|$|E
500|$|While {{the fossil}} record of hippos is still poorly understood, the two modern genera, Hippopotamus and Choeropsis (sometimes Hexaprotodon), may have diverged {{as far back as}} [...] Taxonomists {{disagree}} whether or not the modern <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> is a member of Hexaprotodon – an apparently paraphyletic genus, also embracing many extinct Asian hippopotamuses, that is more closely related to Hippopotamus – or of Choeropsis, an older and basal genus.|$|E
500|$|Billy, [...] or William Johnson Hippopotamus, (1920s – October 11, 1955) was a <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> {{given as}} a pet to U.S. President Calvin Coolidge.

500|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semi-aquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, {{and one of}} only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis).

500|$|In Coolidge's {{autobiography}} {{he wrote}} about the unusual menagerie he collected and stated that he donated many of these animals, including Billy, to the National Zoo.

[...] By August 1927, Coolidge had sent the second largest collection of animals of any president after Roosevelt to the zoo, and paid them frequent visits. [...] Upon his arrival, Billy {{was one of the}} most-valuable animals the zoo had ever received, and was only the eighth <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> to be brought to the United States.

500|$|Local {{tales of}} a song'aomby (Malagasy for [...] "cow {{that is not}} a cow"), or <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus,</b> led French naturalist Alfred Grandidier to follow a village headman to a marsh in southwestern Madagascar, a site called Ambolisatra, which became the first known subfossil site in Madagascar. In 1868, Grandidier {{uncovered}} the first subfossil remains of lemurs—a humerus from Palaeopropithecus and a tibia of a sifaka. [...] The Palaeopropithecus remains were not described for several decades, and it took decades more for the remains to be correctly paired with other sloth lemur remains. It was not until 1893 that giant lemur species were formally described, when Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major discovered and described a long, narrow skull of Megaladapis madagascariensis in a marsh. [...] His discoveries in various marshes of central and southwestern Madagascar sparked paleontological interest, resulting in an overabundance of taxonomic names and confused assemblages of bones from numerous species, including non-primates. Specimens were distributed between European museums and Madagascar, often resulting in the loss of field data that went with the specimens, if the data had been recorded at all.|$|E
500|$|Today, pygmy hippos breed well in captivity: since Billy's arrival, 58 pygmy hippos {{have been}} born at the National Zoo alone. As one of the {{earliest}} pygmy hippos in captivity in the U.S. zoo system, Billy {{went on to become the}} direct ancestor of nearly all pygmy hippos in American zoos. When Billy first came to the zoo, however, keepers did not know much about <b>pygmy</b> <b>hippopotamus</b> husbandry. [...] A mate for Billy, a female named Hannah, was acquired by the zoo on September 4, 1929. [...] Billy's and Hannah's first calf was born on August 26, 1931, but did not survive the week. [...] "Inability to survive the neglect of an errant mother was the cause given for baby Hippo's demise", eulogized The Washington Post. [...] Over the next two years, two more calves would follow, both of which died in infancy. [...] Billy's third calf was killed when Hannah rolled on top of the baby and crushed it. [...] "She's just a bad mother", said the zoo's long-time director Dr. William M. Mann to The Washington Post, upon the death of the third infant.|$|E
