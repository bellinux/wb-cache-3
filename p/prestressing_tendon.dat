In this study, for the prestressed containment structure, a detailed model is obtained by a full 3 D model. Nonlinear finite element method is employed to predict the response of the structure using ANSYS software. The major challenges for modelling <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon</b> elements are to accommodate parameters affecting prestressing forces. In previous research studies, the prestressing system is modelled using an equivalent pressure and tendon end forces, and tendons are modelled as smeared reinforcement in the concrete elements. In this study, the prestressing tendons are modelled using discrete elements. This method enables the capability of the model to update the prestressing forces accommodating the non-uniform losses. The difference in the response of the structure using the discrete model for the prestressing tendons and the smeared approach is 15 percent. It is observed that the containment structure, meets the design requirements of the current standards as it behaves linearly up to 1. 5 times the design pressure, and the ultimate pressure capacity is estimated as 2. 7 times the design pressure.

30|$|The {{compression}} or tension-controlled {{failure mode}} of concrete beams prestressed with unbonded FRP tendons {{is governed by}} the relative amount of <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon</b> to the balanced one. Explicit assessment to determine the balanced reinforcement ratio of a beam with unbonded tendons (ρ_pfb^U) is difficult because it requires a priori knowledge of the deformed beam geometry in order to evaluate the unbonded tendon strain. In this study, a theoretical evaluation of ρ_pfb^U is presented based on a concept of three equivalent rectangular curvature blocks for simply supported concrete beams internally prestressed with unbonded carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons. The equivalent curvature blocks were iteratively refined to closely simulate beam rotations at the supports, mid-span beam deflection, and member-dependent strain of the unbonded tendon at the ultimate state. The model was verified by comparing its predictions with the test results. Parametric studies were performed {{to examine the effects}} of various parameters on ρ_pfb^U.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cold-drawn}} {{prestressing steel}} as reinforcement in concrete is common among bridge design throughout the world. This composite material is particularly useful for designs consisting of large spans where the dead load will cause significant cracking and deflection. Unlike mild steel reinforcement, prestressing steel is stressed and cause a compression force within the concrete. This prevents cracking {{and increases the}} structure’s capacity. A prestressed concrete member will also have a longer life expectancy due to the prevention of cracks. Without cracks the steel will not {{be exposed to the}} environment and therefore will be at a reduced risk of corrosion. The increased capacity, ability to sustain longer spans, and durability make this type of material an advantageous choice of construction. This paper investigates the residual properties of seven wire, uncoated, 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) and 0. 375 in.

The behavior of prestressed bridges is complicated, i. e., it includes inelastic response, concrete cracking, steel yielding, creep, shrinkage, temperature, and tendon relaxation phenomena. This study considers the material nonlinearities (concrete, reinforcing mild steel, and <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon),</b> and tension stiffening effect between concrete and reinforcement. The time-dependent material behavior is also included. Environmental conditions which influence concrete creep and shrinkage, thermal effect, and instantaneous and long term prestressing force losses are also included. In addition, a construction and a service load stage analyses are developed by accounting for the considerable changes generated during bridge construction and its service life. Another special feature considered {{in this study is}} the effect of curved geometry on the analysis of PC box girder bridges. To account for this effect, a finite element formulation based on thin-walled box beam theory including longitudinal warping mode and transverse distortion mode of the trapezoidal cross section is utilized. Nonprismatic concrete box section along the longitudinal axis as well as diaphragms, which reduce warping and distortional effects, are also considered in this analysis. The moment redistribution resulting from the construction and service load stage is also checked in tracking the actual behavior. A computer program (NTPBOX) is developed to implement the analysis of curved box girder bridges. The analysis capabilities of the developed program (NTPBOX), including time dependent nonlinear analysis, are compared with other programs and experimental results. The comparison is shown to be satisfactory. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{hazardous}} effects of wildfire on bridge structures have not attracted {{as much attention}} as building fires. In this study, the effects of bushfire on prestressed concrete bridges were analysed through a sequentially-coupled numerical approach comprising fire dynamics simulation, nonlinear thermal analysis and structural analysis. The adiabatic surface temperature distribution of the bridge was first obtained with a fire simulating model by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fire Dynamics Simulator. The surface temperature was then applied as boundary condition to a thermal model to get the internal temperature distribution. The mechanical response of the bridge was finally studied using the software ABAQUS (Figure 1). The time-equivalence method was used to simplify the transfer from the CFD model to ABAQUS. The thermal and mechanical properties were assumed to be temperature-dependent in all the simulations. For fire simulation, the grid size, simulation domain and clear space were investigated to ensure the accuracy of results. Based on the fire model verified, sensitivity studies were carried out to evaluate the effects of wildfire taking into account fire intensity, front width, spread rate, fire height and bridge headroom. A structural model was verified using experimental results from a fire test on a post-tensioned concrete beam available in the literature. Results show that the finite element model can well predict the increase of temperature in <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon</b> and the mid-span deflection.

40|$|A new, double-tensioned {{prestressing}} steel strands anchorage system (DTPSSAS), characterized by low prestress loss caused by <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon</b> retraction, is described. When {{it is used}} for short prestressing tendons in concrete box-girder webs, this anchorage system significantly reduces prestress loss. To investigate its efficiency in reducing prestress loss, a rectangular thin plate using the DTPSSAS was devised and tested; the results demonstrated that the average rate of instantaneous prestress loss decreased from 32. 35 % after the first tension to 2. 68 % after the second tension. Further, long-term observations of prestress loss with the DTPSSAS were conducted in the laboratory and in a field test. Based on the field test of a continuous concrete box-girder bridge, the average loss rate of instantaneous prestress loss to the control tensile stress of two strands in the web is 7. 61 %, and the average rate of prestress loss at 150 days is 10. 53 %. Concurrently, the time-dependent prestress loss was calculated with Models GL 2000 and CEB-FIP 90 for different concrete shrinkage and creep prediction by the step-by-step calculation method. In comparison with the laboratory test results, the calculated results with the two models were greater than the test values. In addition, the effect of stress redistribution caused by the constraint of reinforcing bars to concrete shrinkage and creep was evaluated. The results revealed that the stress redistribution effect increased the vertical compressive prestress loss of concrete, indicating that the time-dependent compressive prestress loss rate of concrete was greater than the tensile prestress loss rate of prestressed tendons.

40|$|AbstractConventional bridge seismic design {{practices}} {{depend on}} the ductility capacity of bridge columns. However, damaged columns tend to produce large residual deformations following a seismic event due {{to the formation of}} a flexural plastic hinge. Improved seismic response can be realized through the use of unbonded post-tensioning prestressing cast-in-place (CIP) column systems or precast segmental column systems. These bridge column systems can produce significantly less residual displacements when compared to a traditional concrete column. Moreover, precast segmental construction can also significantly reduce construction time and minimize construction cost of bridges in highly congested urban environments. Therefore, one research thrust area of bridges is the seismic performance of prestressing CIP reinforcement concrete columns and prestressing precast segmental column systems which were investigated through quasi-static, shake table test and numerical analyses. However, numerical analytical models which can allow for major nonlinear factors of prestressing concrete bridge column systems are not available yet.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the general behaviour of an internal panel in a column supported multi-bay floor structure, under the influence of various <b>prestressing</b> <b>tendon</b> arrangements. The prestressing effects are studied {{with the help of a}} finite element package (PAFEC), representing the prestressing forces by equivalent vertical loads. From a variety of possible spacing arrangements, the distribution of prestressing moments is shown to be most effective in counteracting the moments due to externally imposed load when the tendons are narrowly banded in the column vicinity. The effects of tendon arrangement on slab behaviour are further investigated by means of an experimental programme comprising three series of ten tests of 1. 5 m span partially prestressed panel with typical span to depth ratio, levels of loading, levels of prestress and geometry of tendon profiles. The models were fixed along the edges to simulate the continuity of an internal panel in a multi-panel slab system. Post-tensioned tendons were arranged in various patterns, as currently employed in construction practice, to induce either a medium or a low level of prestress in the test panel, conforming to the design recommendations of a number of codes of practice. Test results indicated that the serviceability behaviour of the slabs with a low level of prestress was strongly influenced by the tendon distribution and the amount of non-prestressed reinforcement. Slabs with tendons banded closely in the column area exhibited a higher cracking load and were stiffer after cracking. The flexural strength of the test slabs was found to be greater than that predicted by yield line theory and the increase was attributed to membrane action. The experimental values of tendon stress at ultimate load and of punching shear were compared with those obtained by various design methods. ...|$|E
