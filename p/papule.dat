25|$|The {{infection}} {{in most instances}} presents as a painless lump just under the skin. In southern Australia, the presentation is more often as a pimple in the skin (dermis) rather than under it. The infection is mostly in the limbs, most often in exposed areas, {{but not on the}} hands or feet. In children, all areas may be involved, including the face or abdomen. A more severe form of infection produces diffuse swelling of a limb, which, unlike the <b>papule</b> or nodule, can be painful and accompanied by fever. Infection may frequently follow physical trauma, often minor trauma such as a small scratch.|$|E
25|$|Cercariae use a tail-like {{appendage}} (often forked in genera causing swimmer’s itch) to swim to {{the surface}} of the water; and use various physical and chemical cue in order to locate the next and final (definitive) host in the life cycle, a bird. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercariae cannot infect humans, but they cause an inflammatory immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly itchy spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each <b>papule</b> corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{classical}} {{management of}} acne calls for prolonged oral and/or topical treatments; however, some patients request a rapid effect {{to make the}} <b>papules</b> disappear {{within a few hours}} or days. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of a single overnight application of a paste containing 0. 25 % miconazole nitrate on acne <b>papules,</b> and comparison with the effect of the same but unmedicated paste. METHOD: Narrow-band reflectance spectroscopy was used to assess the changes in E index (erythema) after overnight application of the pastes. In the first study, a total of 117 acne <b>papules</b> were assessed in 15 adolescents. Measurements of the E index were performed at 24 -h intervals for 4 days on acne <b>papules</b> and the surrounding normal-looking skin. The last two assessments were performed the mornings preceding and following, respectively, a single application of the medicated paste. The second part of the study consisted of a double-blind, split-face study on 25 adolescents with acne. They applied each of the two formulations on a randomized part of the forehead. A total of 161 acne <b>papules</b> received the medicated paste and 160 received the same but unmedicated paste. Measurements were performed the mornings before and after the overnight treatment. RESULTS: In {{the first part of the}} study, no significant daily difference was observed between the three series of pretreatment E indices, on both acne <b>papules</b> and normal skin. The treatment did not affect the E index of normal skin. By contrast, it decreased significantly the E index of the acne <b>papules.</b> The second part of the study also showed that the medicated paste significantly decreased the E index of acne <b>papules.</b> This effect was significantly (P < 0. 05) superior to that of the unmedicated paste. CONCLUSION: A single overnight application of miconazole nitrate paste appears to reduce the erythematous aspect of acne <b>papules.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Fibrous <b>papules</b> of {{the face}} are hamartomas {{characterized}} by stellate-shaped stromal cells, multinucleated giant cells, and proliferative {{blood vessels in the}} dermis. The pathogenesis of fibrous <b>papules</b> remains unclear. There is a striking microscopic resemblance between fibrous <b>papules</b> and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) -associated angiofibromas. A germline mutation of the TSC 1 or TSC 2 gene, leading to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, accounts for the pathogenesis of TSC-associated angiofibromas. Activated mTOR subsequently activates p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K) and ribosomal protein S 6 (S 6) by phosphorylation. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, is effective in treating TSC-associated angiofibromas. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand whether the mTOR pathway is activated in fibrous <b>papules.</b> We studied immunoexpressions of phosphorylated (p-) mTOR effectors in fibrous <b>papules,</b> TSC-associated angiofibromas, and normal skin controls. P-mTOR, p-p 70 S 6 K and p-S 6 were highly expressed in dermal stromal cells and epidermal keratinocytes in fibrous <b>papules</b> and TSC-associated angiofibromas but not in fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes of normal skin controls (p, 0. 001).
