For imperfect procurement contracts such a separation may increase efficiency. Efficiency can be increased by postaward, <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> between the award-winning firm {{and one of the}} losing firms. Surprisingly, the efficiency gains can be higher if the award is given to a seller with a lower reputation for quality instead of to a seller with higher reputation. ...|$|E

For incomplete procurement contracts we show that such a separation may increase efficiency. We show that efficiency can be increased by post-award, <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> between the award-winning seller {{and one of the}} `losing' sellers. Surprisingly, the efficiency gains can be higher if the award is given to a seller with a lower reputation for quality instead of to a seller with higher reputation. Under certain conditions post-award, pre-contract rent-seeking activities also increase efficiency. This is always the case if the procurement agency is corrupt, but may also occur in the case of lobbying. Procurement, Incomplete contracts, lobbying, corruption...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a complex negotiations model {{that has been}} adapted to the organisation {{of the process of}} the conclusion and execution of a contract between customer (buyer) and bidder (seller), each represented by software agents. Most research on agent-based automated negotiation is focused on models that end their action at the time at which the contract is concluded. However, the implementation of the contract can be a long process. In this time, the needs and capabilities of both sides are subject to change. In complex negotiations, the negotiation is spread over the entire lifespan of the contract and includes <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> as well as renegotiations during the execution of the contract. With this approach, participants can adapt dynamically to changing conditions, and can renegotiate contract conditions which have previously been concluded by both parties...|$|E

On the other hand, the information society requires the development of new and more intelligent methods, tools and theories to analyse, define, model and specify agent-based systems. It is under this presupposition that in this work are introduced a pre-argumentative reasoning scheme, which {{need to be able to}} take into account, in a negotiation, factors such as temporality, priority, delegation, gratitude and agreement, enabling the agents to react and pro-act accordingly. This argument-based negotiation among agents has much to gain from the use of Extended Logic Programming and Incomplete Information, in terms of the argument’s evaluation. Indeed, it is based on this substratum that are presented the bases for a <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiation</b> via argumentation, where <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiation</b> will be defined as a protocol which, once enforced, will allow the exchange of messages containing proposals, counter-proposals, critiques, justifications or even explanations. The terms of a negotiation are also set, adjusting the contract according to the agent’s knowledge base. In fact, an important contribution of this work relies on the presentation of the basic definitions and the general model of pre-contract-based negotiations via argumentation...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Software Licensing The thesis {{deals with}} {{different}} practical aspects of commercial software licensing {{from the perspective}} of the Czech legal system. The focus is put on software license agreement as the most important legal instrument granting rights of use for computer programs. The thesis opens with a summary of Czech legislation in force in this area in the context of European community law and international law. The legislation in effect is largely governed by the Copyright Act. Coming into effect from 1 st January 2014, the software licensing agreement legislation moves into the New Civil Code. The thesis deals with the changes arising from this transition. The fifth chapter considers the regulation of pre-contractual liability in the New Civil Code as it is especially important in protecting confidential infor- mation in <b>pre-contract</b> <b>negotiation.</b> In summarising the issue of software licensing, the thesis builds on the elements of legal relationship. It examines the roles of licensee and licensor, the two parties of software license. The text also deals with cases where a licensor of creative work is a different from the creator of the work. The role of licensor can be assumed by a legal successor or by a party authorized to exercise property rights to work made for hire. The next part explores [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Loading and {{unloading}} {{is one of}} {{the processes}} of import activities in fertilizers; it {{is a part of the}} important link of NPK fertilizer production of PT Sentana Adidaya Pratama. Without sufficient raw materials, the process of productivity cannot run punctually so that it will affect the distribution of NPK fertilizers to end-customers such as estates and other agricultural sectors. The importance of mutual agreement in loading and loading is a written contract for the parties concerned who agree on providing and receiving employment in loading and unloading of raw materials at Belawan harbor. The process of making the contract began with making <b>pre-contract,</b> the <b>negotiation</b> between the parties concerned which was then embodied in a contract through its articles, followed by the post-contract in which they fulfill their duties according to the agreement in the contract The conclusion of the research was that so far the balance between the right and the obligation has not been sufficiently carried out. Therefore, the parties concerned should pay more attention to the content of the contract and to all factors which are related to loading and unloading activities so any problem which arises in the field can be settled without any interpretation which can harm one of the parties in order to avoid any default. Therefore, ship loading and unloading should be implemented well, fast, and correctly and should cut down on cost as minimal as possible so that work performance and work outcome, which are righteous and satisfactory, can be accepted by each part...|$|R
