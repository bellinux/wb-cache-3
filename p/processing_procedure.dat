25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet <b>processing</b> <b>procedure</b> prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E

40|$|This {{undergraduate}} thesis presents {{details of}} the RCERO Ljubljana project, the Regional Waste Management Centre with its most important part: the mechanical-biological treatment plant. The plant has been constructed for the reception and processing of household waste, bulky waste, biodegradable waste and waste from craft activities, manufacturing and service activities {{for the city of}} Ljubljana and the Central Slovenia region. The presentation covers a description of the facilities and installations at the plant. Individual groups of activities are presented, including waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> and the connections and interconnections between <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> at a plant of this type. Waste processing is necessary and important for reducing the quantities of waste placed in andfill and for increasing the use of renewable sources obtained from waste processing. Individual groups and sub- groups of mechanical and biological waste processing herefore take place at the plant. Waste fractions capable of being used for recycling and fractions serving as raw materials for the preparation of secondary fuels are obtained by means of the mechanical processing of waste with separation. In biological processing, biogas is obtained from biodegradable waste through a process of anaerobic fermentation. This gas is used as a fuel in waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Furthermore, the thesis addresses the optimisation of <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> via an analysis of waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> and data. The daily plan, {{in the form of a}} table, is a plan for the optimal use of working time, depending on the waste <b>processing</b> <b>procedures</b> involved. The daily plan table for waste processing has been already in use at the plant for the processing of waste and the analysis of procedures...|$|R

50|$|The <b>processing</b> <b>procedure</b> {{consists}} of four parts. Characteristic sound of each object will be generated first. Then the sound is created and attached to the moving objects. The third step is to calculate the convolutions. Finally the calculated convolutions will {{be applied to the}} sound sources we get in step two.The convolution calculations in step three are related to the effect of reverberation. The mathematical description of reverberation is a convolution with a continuous weighting function. This is due to the echos in the environment. The sound rendering method approximates this by using the fact that the wavelength of sound {{is similar to that of}} the object, so it diffuses in its reflections. This provides a smoothing effect of the sound. These facts allow us to use a simplified sound tracking algorithm without making much difference.All in all, this method is much simpler than HRTF, but it is not real-time. However, its similarity to ray-tracing and its unique approach to handling reverberation are noteworthy aspects.|$|E
