The bank is subject to a capital requirement and chooses the liquidity buffer that it wants to hold and the risk of its loan portfolio. The equilibrium choice of risk is shown to be decreasing in the capital requirement, and increasing in the interest rate charged by the LLR. Moreover, when the LLR does not charge <b>penalty</b> <b>rates,</b> the bank chooses the same level of risk and a smaller liquidity buffer than in the absence of a LLR. Thus, in contrast with the general view, the existence of a LLR does not increase the incentives to take risk, while <b>penalty</b> <b>rates</b> do. bank supervision; capital requirements; central bank; deposit insurance; lender of last resort; moral hazard; <b>penalty</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{ordinary}} principle of the price discrimination, that is, that the price will be lower in the market with the greater demand elasticity will hold or not if we take the tax evasion by a monopolist into consideration. We have derived the results that the equality of the demand elasticities in the two markets doesn't necessarily imply the equality of prices in the two markets and that the price in the market with the greater demand elasticity will not necessarily be lower. In addition, we have obtained the following policy implications. Raising the <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> for the tax evasion will raise the ratio between the home market price and the foreign market price. Therefore, when the home market price is higher than the foreign market price, the policy of raising the <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> will further increase the price difference between the home market and the foreign market under the price discrimination. In order to implement the policy for the tax evasion without increasing the price difference, we will be required to implement the following two policies; raising the <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> and decreasing the tax rate. If the <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> in the foreign market is also raised in accordance with the raised <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> in the home market, it would be possible to implement the policy for the tax evasion without increasing the price difference even if the tax rate is given...|$|E
