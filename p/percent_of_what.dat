Fuel Entertainment partnered with Xbox Entertainment Studios and Lightbox to make a documentary about the 1983 massive game burial of Atari games, said {{to be one of}} the gaming culture's greatest urban legends. On April 26, 2014, video game archaeologists began sifting through years of trash from the old Alamogordo landfill. The first batch of E.T. games was discovered after about three hours of digging, and hundreds more were found in the mounds of trash and dirt scooped by a backhoe. In the deal between the City of Alamogordo and Fuel Entertainment regarding the excavation, Fuel Entertainment was to be given 250 games or 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was found.|$|E

He grabbed 20or more rebounds 11times, among them a 29-board outburst against the Atlanta Hawks and 15offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the Los Angeles Clippers. Led by the aging Jordan and Rodman (respectively 35 and 37years old), the Bulls reached the 1998 NBA Finals, again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Malone {{in the first three}} games, he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with Hulk Hogan. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he earned with this stint. However, Rodman's on-court performance remained top-notch, again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3–2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward Bryon Russell, the Bulls won their third title in a row and Rodman his fifth ring.|$|E

The writers listened to both network executive and fans in order to formulate the best idea as to how to handle the situation. Peterson noted that people wanted [...] "one big transformation". According to Souders, the writers initially wished to include more members of the Justice League but, because of budgetary constraints, these ideas did not come to pass. Peterson, however, noted that the episode contained [...] "80 to 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> everyone [...] ". After the scripts were finished, they were heat-marked to ensure secrecy.

500|$|In 1911, the Fairbanks Commercial Club, a {{group of}} businesses, created the slogan [...] "Fairbanks, Alaska's Golden Heart." [...] The slogan remains the city's motto today. In that year, Fairbanks boasted a {{population}} of more than 3,500 people, making it the largest city in Alaska. Thousands more people lived in mining camps outside the city itself. But 1910 marked the beginning of a decline in Fairbanks' fortunes. That year, less than $6 million in gold was produced—two-thirds the total of the previous year. By 1911, production was half what it had been in 1909. In 1918, it was ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it had been nine years before. The decline in production caused businesses to go out of business. Stores that sold to miners closed, as did those that supported the mines directly. World War I caused a further decline as the town's young men were drafted and sent overseas. Economic effects also were felt. A local judge later stated that the war [...] "set Fairbanks back by 10 years" [...] because it dried up construction and sent men overseas. After the war, the 1918 flu pandemic was particularly virulent in Alaska; it killed between 2,000 and 3,000 people in the territory. By 1923, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner estimated there were fewer than 1,000 people in the city, and almost none at the mining camps beyond town.|$|E
40|$|Isaac newton’s {{universe}} was a cozy, tidy place. Gathered {{around the sun}} were six planets, a handful of moons and the occasional comet, all moving {{against a backdrop of}} stationary stars. Newton provided us with the mathematical tools needed to compute the motions of these bodies. Given initial positions and velocities, we can calculate the forces acting on each object, using Newton’s law of universal gravitation. From the forces we can determine accelerations, and then update the positions and velocities for the next round of calculations. This scheme of computation is known as the n-body method. Perhaps Newton himself could have put it to work if he had had suitable computing machinery. Today we have the computers. On the other hand, our universe is far larger and more intricate than Newton’s. Now the solar system is merely a speck in a spiral galaxy of several hundred billion stars. Our galaxy drifts among billions of others, which form clusters and superclusters and a whole hierarchy of structures extending {{as far as the eye}} (and the telescope) can see.

Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier.

But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation.

This is surprising given that China is a relatively poor country with a capital-labor ratio about one-fifth the world average and one-tenth the U. S. level. The main questions that we address are whether it makes economic sense for China to be a net creditor and how we see China’s net foreign asset position evolving over the next 20 years. We calibrate a theoretical model of international capital flows featuring diminishing returns, production risk, and sovereign risk. Our calibrations for China yield a predicted net foreign asset position of- 17 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> China’s wealth. We also estimate non-structural cross-country regressions of determinants of net foreign assets in which China is always a significant outlier with 5 to 7 percentage points more of net foreign assets relative to wealth than is predicted by its characteristics. China’s extensive capital controls can explain why its current net foreign asset position is far away from what is predicted by open-economy models and cross-country empirics. It seems reasonable to assume that China’s international financial integration will increase over time. We calibrate and predict different scenarios out to 2025. These scenarios are necessarily speculative, but it is interesting that they typically imply negative net foreign asset positions between 3 and 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> wealth. <b>What</b> may be counter-intuitive for many policy-makers is that successful institutional reform and productivity growth are likely to lead to more negative net foreign asset positions than occurs with stagnation. Starting from China’s zero net foreign asset position, it would take current account deficits in the range of 2 - 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> GDP to reach any of these future net foreign asset positions. These are not unreasonable deficits, but they require a large adjustment from the present 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> GDP current account surplus...|$|R
