25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E

25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first final against {{cross-town}} rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It {{was also the first}} time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2 point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.|$|E

Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became The Washington Posts first {{official}} obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced. Smith labeled her family [...] "upper crust and reserved". As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated: [...] "I've sounded <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way since I was six. Maybe [...] a little deeper now." [...] She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.|$|E

[...] The next day police arrested two armed men who were allegedly trying to steal turtle eggs from the same beach where Mora was killed. Also on June 4, {{a group of three}} men and a minor was arrested on similar charges. [...] Subsequently, Limón began to dispatch twenty police officers nightly to escort conservationists and patrol the beaches. In spite of increased police presence Lizano remarked, on June 11, [...] "Every night all of the [...] nests are raided.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Roland" [...] was rated a B+, with guest star Željko Ivanek's portrayal of the eponymous Roland being called [...] " [...] astonishing (and convincing)", and the episode's [...] "excellent death scenes" [...] noted as highlights. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed feelings about the episode, feeling that its plot was too similar to the previous episode [...] "Born Again", though rating Ivanek's acting as [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "uncontrived"; ultimately calling the episode [...] "well-built enough to be enjoyable despite its familiarity". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, felt negatively about the episode, again finding it too similar to other episodes of the season, finding it to be [...] "nothing incredibly exciting", noting that it [...] "follows <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> template {{as many of the}} other episodes".|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} were {{inspired}} by 1960s and 1970s rock bands. [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was written with The Animals, The Zombies and Paul Revere & the Raiders in mind, and Weiland considered [...] "Cinnamon" [...] to {{be a combination of}} 1960s British pop and Ian Curtis (of Joy Division). [...] "Huckleberry Crumble" [...] was inspired by Aerosmith, specifically [...] "Same Old Song and Dance". Dean admitted to the similarities: [...] "The arrangement is almost the same: riff, solo, verse, chorus, solo, back to a second verse—it's <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> setup." [...] He also noted how the song sounded different {{depending on the type of}} instruments used to play it. [...] "It's amazing how, if you were to present that opening riff on a Tele really clean, it's almost a country riff. But if you present it with a Les Paul through a Marshall, it takes on this whole different thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{been hired}} by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given {{timeframe}} for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous {{five and a half}} to six months. An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as [...] "dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor" [...] were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original [...] "serious" [...] tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, [...] "we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone {{film critic}} Peter Travers rated the reissue 3.5 stars out of 4, {{explaining}} {{he found it}} [...] "pretty damn dazzling". He said, [...] "The 3D intensifies Titanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns {{its place in the}} movie time capsule." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, [...] "For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive." [...] Richard Corliss of Time who was very critical in 1997 remained in the same mood, [...] "I had <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged." [...] In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the [...] "careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels." [...] Ann Hornaday for The Washington Post found herself asking [...] "whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't." [...] She further added that the [...] "3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition." ...|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{some people}} may still believe this, Lafcadio Hearn (see below), in Shadowings, {{makes it clear that}} at least in his time (1880 to 1905, the date of publication), the ending -ko (...) was not any part of the name, but an honorific suffix like [...] -san. Particularly, even though the symbol was [...] "child", it meant [...] "Lady" [...] and was used only by upper-class females. It would have been ridiculous to apply to middle-class or lower-class women. <b>Pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> names were used by all classes, but Hana-ko was upper class, while lesser women would be O-Hana-san, with honorific prefix as well as suffix.|$|E
2500|$|Tanx {{inspired}} Suede {{for their}} Coming Up album as producer Ed Butler related: [...] "The blueprint was Tanx by T.Rex – I actually thought The Slider {{was a better}} choice, but Brett (Anderson) always had a different take on things. I always looked at The Slider as being the ultimate T.Rex album, but he’s right, Tanx is actually a better record, because it’s more interesting. Basically, what we did, is that every track started with acoustic guitar, bongos, tambourine and Brett, so it all started life <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that Marc Bolan recorded all of his stuff originally. He started with an acoustic guitar song and then he’d build it up with guitar and drums and electronics. So {{the foundation of the}} songs on Coming Up, is a groove made-up out of kongas, tambourine and acoustic guitar." [...] In 2003, Martin Gore from Depeche Mode recorded in solo two covers from Tanx as extra-tracks of his single [...] "Stardust": [...] "Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys", and [...] "Life is Strange".|$|E
2500|$|In the band's early days, HIM's {{image was}} heavily {{characterized}} by occult and satanic imagery. The {{use of the}} number [...] "666" [...] was prominent in lyrics, as well as song and album titles, while the band's original name [...] "His Infernal Majesty" [...] was inspired by The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey, the song [...] "Oblivious to Evil" [...] by Deicide, and Haile Selassie, who was known as [...] "his imperial majesty". This flirtation with the occult was seen by the band as purely [...] "symbolic" [...] and [...] "traditionally rock 'n' roll". Ville Valo first {{became interested in the}} subject while in school and soon began reading books on the occult. All of the band were also big fans of black metal. HIM has maintained that none of them were seriously interested in satanism, that it was [...] "more about the fascination", while honoring [...] "the masters", with [...] "our tongue in cheek about it" [...] His Infernal Majesty eventually shortened their name to HIM in 1996, because Finnish people had difficulty remembering and pronouncing [...] "His Infernal Majesty". Since then, HIM have further toned down the use of satanic imagery, and when asked about the band's image in 2013, Valo responded that [...] "I think we're <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> [...] The only difference is I'm not necessarily wearing eyeliner every day." ...|$|E
