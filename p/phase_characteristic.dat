There are designed and implemented user interface for electronic circuit schematic entry and graphical display of frequency and <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the analysis of electronic circuits.

50|$|A {{suitable}} ripple characteristic {{is obtained}} by taking power series approximations of sinh(x) and cosh(x), rather than deriving the continued fraction expansion of tanh(x), {{as was done}} earlier. Typically, with this procedure, the ripple on the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> deviates by ±5% from the mean (linear) value.|$|E
50|$|A {{cascade of}} second order {{networks}} with, maybe, a single first order network, {{can be used}} to give a high order response. For example, the article Lattice delay network gives pole-zero locations for many all-pass transfer functions which approximate to a linear <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic.</b> That article also includes some examples.|$|E
50|$|Introducing zeros, in this way, gives {{double the}} delay of an {{all-pole}} low pass filter, but the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> still retains the desired maximally flat feature. The circuit {{can be realized}} as a single lattice network, or a cascade of low order lattices, as shown later in some examples, as in lattice networks.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{aim of the}} work {{reported}} in {{this paper is to}} establish a method of determining the diffusivity of an SEA subsystem using the phase of transfer functions. Specifically, this paper reports an investigation into the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of transfer functions obtained using two flat plate structures. In the first experiment the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of bending waves in a directional field are obtained using a perspex plate with additive damping. In the second experiment the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of bending waves in a diffuse field are obtained from a freely suspended steel plate.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} variants concerning {{connection of}} non-linear compensating devices comprising, as a rule, two channels for amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of automatic control systems. It is shown that owing to {{presence of the}} mentioned channels {{it is possible to}} have much higher number of connections than for ordinary linear compensation means. Some examples with frequency characteristics of such connections that ensure efficient and independent formation of amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the systems to be compensated are given in the paper. </p...|$|R
50|$|The maximally flat {{response}} {{is not very}} efficient. It has an excellent linear <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> within its operating passband, but large complex networks are needed to obtain large delays. However, by allowing the phase response to ripple within the passband, a network of a specific order can achieve a wider bandwidth, (or more delay for a given bandwidth).|$|E
50|$|This method uses {{an inverse}} Fourier {{transform}} {{in order to}} derive a waveform which has a spectrum with the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a chosen chirp but a new amplitude profile which is rectangular and ripple free. The method is very effective but, unfortunately, the waveform that is so derived has a semi-infinite time duration. If, for convenience, the newly derived waveform is truncated to a practical length, then some ripple is reintroduced onto the spectrum.As an example, a linear chirp waveform with a time bandwidth of 25 is shown together with its spectrum magnitude (shown by a full line) which, as demonstrated earlier, has a large ripple component. It is possible to find, {{by means of an}} inverse FFT, a chirp waveform which, in the frequency domain, has the same <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> as before, but with the rectangular magnitude characteristic shown by the dashed line on the plot. The chirp waveform resulting from this process has a very long time duration, but when it is truncated to say, a length 2T, then the spectrum acquires some ripple once more, as shown.|$|E

The proposed method introduces an adaptively weighted aggregation of signal characteristics based on the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of medical image signals. The proposed method exploits the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the image signals to adaptively accentuate important anatomical and functional characteristics captured by each image signal during the signal fusion process. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can improve the visualization of important anatomical and functional characteristics from different medical image signals in the fused image signal when compared with non-adaptive image signal fusion methods. ...|$|R

It was concluded as follows: - calcite (CaCO 3) is a major mineral component (cca 80 - 90 %) prevailing in the marble over the other minerals - dolomite is generally of minor importance (cca 10 - 20 %) in the rock - quartz, micas graphite, pyrite represent typical accessories.

50|$|Most {{amplifiers}} use {{negative feedback}} to trade gain for other desirable properties, such as decreased distortion, improved noise reduction or increased invariance to variation of parameters such as temperature. Ideally, the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> of an amplifier's frequency {{response would be}} linear; however, device limitations make this goal physically unattainable. More particularly, capacitances within the amplifier's gain stages cause the output signal to lag behind the input signal by 90° for each pole they create. If the sum of these phase lags reaches 360°, the output signal will be in phase with the input signal. Feeding back any portion of this output signal to the input when the gain of the amplifier is sufficient will cause the amplifier to oscillate. This is because the feedback signal will reinforce the input signal. That is, the feedback is then positive rather than negative.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presents}} an approximate computation of high-frequency high-voltage power-line characteristics: amplitude, phase and group delay characteristic. Analytical approximate formulae are derived {{for the power}} line with three conductors in horizontal disposition and middle-phase to ground coupling. Expressions derived from modal analysis and detailed computation methods allow analysis of power-line high-frequency characteristics, like oscillations in high-frequency characteristics due to reflection on the power line. Such formulae {{are available in the}} literature for modal propagation functions and power-line amplitude characteristic. However, this paper also treats power-line <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> and group delay important for digital communication systems design that are not thoroughly investigated in analog communications. The paper shows that nonlinearities in the <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> due to reflection are determined with Hilbert transform of the amplitude characteristic...|$|E
40|$|Digital filters with {{a linear}} <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{are needed in}} many {{applications}} for signal processing. In this paper, design of a Chebyshev-type IIR filter with approxi-mate linear phase characteristics in the passband is de-scribed. First, it is shown that a flat stopband can easily be realized by placing multiple zeros at the specified frequency points in the stopband. Next, the complex Remez exchange algorithm {{is applied to the}} passband so that the filter design problem is formulated as an eigenvalue problem. Hence, by solving the eigenvalue problem, the filter coefficients can be derived easily. Further, by means of iterative calcula-tions, an equiripple characteristic of the error function in the passband is obtained. Finally, it is shown that a reverse Chebyshev-type IIR filter with an approximate linear <b>phase</b> <b>characteristic</b> can also be obtained by parallel connection of the proposed Chebyshev-type filter and...|$|E
