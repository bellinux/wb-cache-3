50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>level</b> sensors {{are used}} where {{hazardous}} conditions exist, {{where there is}} no electric power or its use is restricted, and in applications involving heavy sludge or slurry. As the compression of a column of air against a diaphragm is used to actuate a switch, no process liquid contacts the sensor's moving parts. These sensors are suitable for use with highly viscous liquids such as grease, as well as water-based and corrosive liquids. This has the additional benefit of being a relatively low cost technique for point level monitoring.|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to hand-arm vibration and dust {{have been shown}} to have deleterious human health effects. Exposure to vibration from pneumatic tools can result in Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), which is a collection of vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal disorders. Exposure to dust can result in a variety of adverse respiratory symptoms. The use of a low-frequency, high-magnitude sand rammer tool during mold-making processes at a foundry could result in significant exposure to these hazards, thus it is important to mitigate the associated risks in order to ensure worker safety. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels</b> and sand rammer types have an effect on reducing hand-arm vibration and dust exposures at a foundry. Vibration and dust measurements were obtained at three different <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels</b> (90 psi, 80 psi, 70 psi) and for three different sand rammer types (LM, SM, T). The primary concern of the study was reducing hand-arm vibration exposure. Measurements were taken in compliance with ISO 5349 - 1 resulting in frequency-weighted, root-mean-square (rms) acceleration values (m/s 2). Significant differences in mean rms acceleration were observed across all <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels</b> and sand rammer types. At 90 psi the mean rms acceleration value was 25. 53 m/s 2, decreasing to 19. 58 m/s 2 at 80 psi, and further decreasing to 18. 38 m/s 2 at 70 psi. The mean rms acceleration values were 19. 63 m/s 2 for sand rammer LM, 21. 46 m/s 2 for SM, and 19. 95 m/s 2 for T. The results of this study indicate that reducing <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels</b> can reduce vibration exposure in the workplace when using low-frequency, high-magnitude tools. The results also indicate that the use of different sand rammer types produces differences in vibration exposure when tested across all <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels.</b> Dust measurements were taken concurrently with vibration measurements. The number of dust particles was counted for each <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>level</b> and sand rammer type. Overall, the mean particle count for the dust measurements was the highest at 90 psi (41, 681) followed by 70 psi (33, 514), and 80 psi (26, 047). Sand rammer SM had the highest mean dust particle count at 35, 732, followed by T at 34, 460, and LM at 31, 382. The results indicate that lowering <b>pneumatic</b> pressure <b>levels</b> could potentially reduce dust exposure in the workplace when using a percussive tool such as a sand rammer. However, variability in the sampling conditions related to dust measurements weaken the association...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. From the {{analysis}} of vibration generating machines, {{made on the basis}} of experimental data and virtual models, closed cyclic trajectories had been obtained. In this case the motion is produced using two generators with non-equilibrated masses while the machine body is supported by special rubber elastic elements with fixed mechanical characteristics. In order to increase the domain of operation of such machines and also to improve their functional capabilities the authors propose a new machine structure which uses pneumatic cylinders as actuators but in the same time as supporting elements with controllable mechanical characteristics. A virtual model of this structure had been developed and tested, and the test results are presented together with conclusions on the new structureâ€™s behavior. The virtual model, allows {{the analysis}} of mechanical parameters (rigidity) of a pneumatic cylinder in order to establish the controllability of the supporting element. In order to obtain the desired cyclic trajectories the inverse kinematic analysis had been developed, obtaining the displacements at <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder <b>level...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of process control, process {{indicators}} and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard <b>pneumatic</b> signal <b>level</b> used during these years was 3-15 psig.|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, mandatory noise standards have been developed that specify time-noise limits of mine personnel exposure. Most affected by elevated noise <b>levels</b> is the <b>pneumatic</b> roof bolter operator, {{both in terms of}} levels near or in excess of 115 dbA and in terms of length of exposure. Therefore, the principal emphasis of this Bureau of Mines report is on pneumatic drill noise control. It is not the intent of this report to suggest any drill redesign; instead, methods are suggested to reduce the noise level by complementing existing machines. An integral muffler system and a separate muffler system were tested in an attempt to lower pneurnaric drill noise <b>levels.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> drills, when new, operate at about 115 dbA when drilling in sandstone.

40|$|Emissions from 377 gas {{actuated}} (pneumatic) controllers {{were measured}} at natural gas production sites {{and a small}} number of oil production sites, throughout the United States. A small subset of the devices (19 %), with whole gas emission rates in excess of 6 standard cubic feet per hour (scf/h), accounted for 95 % of emissions. More than half of the controllers recorded emissions of 0. 001 scf/h or less during 15 min of measurement. <b>Pneumatic</b> controllers in <b>level</b> control applications on separators and in compressor applications had higher emission rates than controllers in other types of applications. Regional differences in emissions were observed, with the lowest emissions measured in the Rocky Mountains and the highest emissions in the Gulf Coast. Average methane emissions per controller reported in this work are 17 % higher than the average emissions per controller in the 2012 EPA greenhouse gas national emission inventory (2012 GHG NEI, released in 2014); the average of 2. 7 controllers per well observed in this work is higher than the 1. 0 controllers per well reported in the 2012 GHG NEI...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of cumulative binomial probabilities for a quantal-type test like ASTM G 74 indicates {{that for a}} probability of reaction in a single trial of 0. 05, the probability of obtaining zero reactions in 20 trials is only approximately 36 percent, Because the lack of precision with the ASTM G 74 test logic could be potentially misleading, an investigation was conducted to determine if pneumatic impact sensitivity could be predicted more reliably from other, more precise test methods. Pneumatic impact sensitivity tests were conducted following ASTM G 74, but employing more rigorous test logics; autoignition temperature tests were conducted per ASTM G 72. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Viton A, polyethylene, polyoxymethylene polyamide, and silicone were the polymers used. After a fixed number of pneumatic impact tests was performed at set pressures, a plot of reaction frequency over a 3. 4 to 24. 1 MPa impact pressure range indicated that PTFE, Viton A, and silicone would outperform other polymers. The 50 percent <b>pneumatic</b> impact reactivity <b>level</b> was determined with the Bruceton test method. The data obtained resulted in {{a strong correlation between}} the 50 percent reactivity level and the autoignition temperature of polymers, indicating similar ignition mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{position}} sensor based on the magnetostrictive delay line (MDL) technique and the eddy currents induced on a soft magnetic material preferably {{in the form of}} a ribbon on top of the MDL, which generate elastic micro-strains on the MDL and consequently a pulsed voltage output across a search coil. These eddy currents are due to the pulsed current transmitted through a pair of pulsed current conductors parallel to the MDL, close to the soft magnetic material, and the presence of a permanent magnet, movable along the length of the MDL. The sensor output is the variation of the delay time of the MDL pulsed voltage output due to the motion of a moving magnet along the length of the MDL. The sensor response is by design linear, monotonic and anhysteretic. The sensor materials and characteristics are discussed. Some of the most important sensor applications are presented, namely the static measurement of the position of <b>pneumatic</b> pistons, liquid <b>level</b> and absolute ground velocity. Finally, a possible method of production is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} noise and {{vibration}} levels associated with three hand-held rock drills (pneumatic, hydraulic and electric) currently used in South African mines, and a prototype acoustically shielded self-propelled rock drill. METHODS: Equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels were recorded on a geometrical grid, using Rion NL- 11 and NL- 14 sound level meters. Vibration measurements were conducted on the pneumatic, hydraulic and electric drills {{in accordance with the}} ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) international standard on human exposure to hand-transmitted vibration, using a Brel and KjÃ¦r UA 0894 hand adaptor. PCB Piezo accelerometers were used to measure vibration in three orthogonal directions. No vibration measurements were conducted on the self-propelled drill. RESULTS: All four drills emitted noise exceeding 85 dB(A). The <b>pneumatic</b> drill reached <b>levels</b> of up to 114 dB(A), while the shielded self-propelled drill almost complied with the 85 dB(A) 8 h exposure limit. Vibration levels of up to 31 m sâ€“ 2 were recorded. These levels greatly exceed recommended and legislated levels. CONCLUSIONS: Significant engineering advances will need {{to be made in the}} manufacture of rock drills to impact on noise induced hearing loss and hand arm vibration syndrome. Isolating the operator from the drill, as for the self-propelled drill, addresses the problems of both vibration and noise exposure, and is a possible direction for future development.

40|$|Ambulance {{suspensions}} often give a poor ride {{which may}} result in deterioration in the condition of ill or injured patients. To reduce patient vibration, purpose-built ambulances or ambulances with modified chassis can be used. A potentially lower cost and more effective alternative is to provide additional isolation for the stretcher only. This thesis describes the design and performance of a pneumatic stretcher suspension which uses a novel linkage to provide isolation in bounce and pitch. Results of linear and non-linear analyses are presented which characterise the behaviour of the suspension. The kinematics of the suspension linkage are shown to give to a vertical stiffness which reduces in compression. Pneumatic cylinders connected to auxiliary tanks are used as springs. These give the suspension essentially load-independent natural frequencies of around 0. 46 Hz in bounce and pitch. Damping is provided by fitting a flow restriction between the cylinders and tanks. By simulating {{the response of the}} stretcher to realistic random floor vibrations, it is concluded that a low level of damping is required and that an orifice restriction is preferable to a capillary restriction. These simulations are {{believed to be the first}} for which pneumatic damping is assessed by using a realistic random input. Additional simulation results demonstrate that improved isolation is possib 1 e by using an innovative semi-active pneumatic damper which is controlled according to the skyhook damping principle. A mechanical shaker which uses adjustable stroke round cams is described. Suspension tests carried out using this shaker are detailed. Various combinations of patient mass, <b>pneumatic</b> damping <b>level,</b> and shaker stroke and frequency are used. Acceleration transmissibilities are presented which indicate both that good levels of vertical isolation are obtained (eg. greater than 90 % isolation above 5. 2 Hz), and that isolation performance is largely independent of patient mass. Coulomb damping is shown to have a detrimental effect on isolation - particularly for low acceleration or high frequency inputs. The results of road tests are presented. These show that the suspension provides isolation above 1 Hz and reduces r. m. s. accelerations by 45 - 60 %. The suspension is concluded to offer the potential to reduce patient vibration at reasonable cost, although improvements to the design are required in moving to a production model...|$|R
40|$|Intussusception (IS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{paediatric}} emergencies, and the best mode of conservative reduction and its exact incidence remains unclear. For different reasons, availability of reliable incidence data are useful and additionally may be fundamental to monitor potential effects of recently introduced rotavirus (RV) vaccines.; We performed a prospective German nationwide surveillance between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, followed by separate collection of all IS cases in a random sample of 31 clinics for an unbiased estimation of underreporting. For case definition, the Brighton Collaboration (BC) criteria were applied.; A total of 1200 children with at least 1 episode of IS were included. For children younger than 1 year the incidence was calculated to be 60. 4 / 100, 000 child-years. The risk for surgery increased 2 -fold if the interval between onset of symptoms and first attempt of conservative reduction exceeded 5 hours (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 - 3. 1). We also observed a 2. 8 -fold increased risk for surgery for hydrostatic (CI 1. 2 - 6. 4) and a 3. 7 -fold for barium enema reduction (CI 1. 6 - 8. 8) compared to <b>pneumatic</b> reduction. The <b>level</b> of specialisation of the hospital did not influence the success of conservative management.; For children with IS a fast attempt of pneumatic reduction seems to be the optimal management. Considering the current practice we estimated that approximately 104 (CI 46 - 161) surgical interventions would be preventable in Germany every year. Also, conduction of reliable postmarketing monitoring of the new RV vaccines is now possible based on the provided incidence data...|$|R
