40|$|Introduction: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an inflammatory}} demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS). Because of limited efficacy and adverse side effects, identifying novel therapeutic and protective agents is important. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the correlations between expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and cytokines after intervention with co-supplemented hemp seed and evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oils</b> and hot-natured diet in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods: We studied a group of 23 patients with clinically definite RRMS, with EDSS< 6 who received co-supplemented hemp seed and evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oils</b> with advising hot-natured diet. Clinically EDSS and immunological factors (plasma cytokines of IL- 4, IFN-γ and IL- 17) were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. Results: Mean follow-up was 180 ± 2. 9 days (N= 23, 7 Male and 16 Females aged 25. 0 ± 7. 5 years with disease duration 6. 26 ± 3. 9 years). After 6 months, significant improvements in extended disability status score were found in the patients in agreement with decrease cytokines of IFN-γ and IL- 17 and increase cytokines of IL- 4. Clinical and immunological parameters showed improvement in the patients after the intervention. Conclusion: Our study shows that co-supplemented hemp seed and evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oils</b> with hot-natured diet can have beneficial effects in improving clinical symptoms in relapsing remitting MS patients and significant correlation was found between EDSS and immunological findings...|$|R
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Chinese herbs help or harm. Dietary {{supplements}} are commonly used by people with eczema.

25|$|In 2006, {{a column}} in The Guardian {{suggested}} that Horrobin had also actively suppressed research findings contradicting his claims about EPO. Horrobin wrote a meta-analysis of EPO research on eczema in 1989, concluding that EPO was effective. Horrobin excluded the negative results of the largest published study to date but included purported results of seven of his own unpublished studies that remained unpublished as of 2006. When several scientists asked to see the unpublished data, Horrobin's legal team convinced the journal to refuse the request. In 1997, Horrobin's team successfully halted the publication of another meta-analysis commissioned by the Department of Health.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{high-pressure}} extraction of borage (Borago officinalis L.) and evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) seed oil, containing the valuable -linolenic acid (GLA), has been investigated. Extraction was performed with {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} on a semi-continuous flow apparatus at pressures of 200 and 300 bar, and at temperatures of 40 and 60 °C. A constant flow rate of {{carbon dioxide in the}} range from 0. 17 to 0. 20 kgžhwas maintained during extraction. The extraction yields obtained using dense CO 2 were similar to those obtained with conventional extraction using hexane as solvent.

2500|$|As the {{supplement}} sales generated revenue, Horrobin's company {{began work on}} numerous drugs, most of them containing evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oil.</b> In 1993, the company was floated and enjoyed several years of increasing capitalisation as Horrobin reassured investors who worried about the company's lack of success, operating losses and enigmatic nature. Horrobin stated that any of four products in Scotia's drugs pipeline could bring the company billions of pounds in revenue. In early 1995, Horrobin said that he hoped to receive approval in the [...] "next 18 months to sell one or both" [...] of two of these drugs.

2500|$|The BMJ {{obituary}} {{sparked a}} months-long controversy. The obituary described Horrobin as [...] "effortlessly prolific" [...] and [...] "one {{of the most}} persuasive people on earth", but also criticised him as excessively promoting evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oil</b> {{despite a lack of}} scientific evidence, noting that some critics questioned his ethics. It suggested that Horrobin [...] "may prove to be the greatest snake oil salesman of his age", stating that his evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oil</b> would [...] "go down in history as the remedy {{for which there is no}} disease" [...] and reporting that several of Scotia's product licences were later withdrawn because the drugs were ineffective. The obituary generated the largest e-mail response to an obituary in the history of the BMJ. Respondents, including Horrobin's colleagues, friends and family, were largely critical of the negative tone of the obituary. On behalf of Horrobin's family, Horrobin's son-in-law, Adam Kelliher, filed a complaint with the British Press Complaints Commission, alleging that the BMJ obituary was [...] "inaccurate" [...] and [...] "intrusive at a time of grief" [...] in violation of the Code of Practice. Kelliher was founder and at the time chief executive of Equazen, a company marketing fish and evening primrose oils including a formulation called eye q, said to improve scholastic ability in children. However, in his initial complaint to the BMJ Kelliher stated that he had no competing interests. [...] In reaction, the BMJ published an apology to Horrobin's family expressing regret for any distress caused. The journal corrected what its editor considered several insignificant spelling and factual errors and published three further obituaries of Horrobin. However, the journal also defended its original obituary as fairly presenting [...] "both the positive and negative aspects of its subject's life". Kelliher did not accept the BMJ apology as genuine and maintained that inaccuracies and [...] "unjustified slander" [...] remained, but the Press Complaints Commission declined to take any action against the journal, stating that the BMJ had offered [...] "sufficient remedial action". According to the Commission, the journal was not obliged to omit negative information, including the journal's contention [...] "that Dr Horrobin was 'in some ways a charlatan'".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997, Scotia {{was nearly}} broke {{and did not have}} enough money to fund another year of research. Investors worried that Horrobin had spread the company and its {{resources}} too thinly, a state described by The Guardian as [...] "woolly, sprawling and lacking in focus". They also questioned Horrobin's judgement in promoting his wife to research manager of the company despite her lack of scientific or business training; her highest qualification was a BA in English and women's studies. Investors were restive about Horrobin's emphasis on products related to evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oil,</b> which they considered a [...] "hippy" [...] project, [...] "outmoded and of questionable scientific validity". When it was found that borage contained a higher percentage of gamma-linolenic acid than did the evening primrose, rival companies had begun to take market share of the supplement. In 1996, The Independent described Scotia's supplement business as [...] "struggling". Horrobin responded to the borage competition by accusing his rivals of [...] "duping women, selling pigs in pokes and marketing 'unstable and potentially toxic products'." ...|$|E
40|$|Dietary {{fatty acids}} and the glomerular hemodynamic {{response}} to cyclosporine in borderline hypertensive rats. We have recently reported that cyclosporine A (CsA) decreases glomerular filtration {{rate in the}} borderline hypertensive rat (BHR), but that the glomerular filtration rate is normal when the rats are maintained on a diet supplemented with evening <b>primrose</b> (EP) <b>oil.</b> The current studies were designed to determine the glomerular hemodynamic changes responsible for this effect. A first group (PLAC-SAFF) received a diet supplemented with safflower oil (SAFF) (10 % of calories) and placebo (PLAC). A second group (CsA-SAFF) received a diet supplemented with SAFF and CsA (10 mg/kg/day). A third group (CsA-EP) also received CsA, but the diet was supplemented with EP oil (10 % of calories). Routine micropuncture studies were performed after five to nine weeks of treatment. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) was lower in CsA-SAFF than in PLAC-SAFF (36 ± 2 vs. 46 ± 1 nl/min, p < 0. 05). Maintenance of SNGFR in CsA-EP compared to CsA-SAFF (48 ± 2 nl/min vs. 36 ± 2 nl/min, P < 0. 05) was due to higher values for single nephron plasma flow rate (156 ± 16 vs. 118 ± 9 nl/min, P < 0. 05), and higher values for the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (0. 091 ± 0. 013 vs. 0. 054 ± 0. 010 nl/s/mm Hg, P < 0. 05). Since dietary fatty acids can affect prostaglandin (PG) production, we measured PGE production in isolated glomeruli. Mean values for basal production rates of PGE were greater in rats maintained on EP than in rats maintained on SAFF (3958 ± 105 vs. 3378 ± 146 pg PGE/mg glomerular protein, P < 0. 05). Increased renal vasodilatory PG production may be responsible, at least in part, {{for the maintenance of}} normal SNGFR in CsA-EP rats...|$|R

By contrast, 2 ̆ 7 dummy adjuvants 2 ̆ 7 prepared with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and flaxseed, evening <b>primrose</b> or fish <b>oils</b> were still arthritigenic in Dark Agouti rats (doses of oil = 90 mg/rat). Lyprinol subfractions inhibited leukotriene-B biosynthesis by stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro, and prostaglandin- E production by activated human macrophages in vitro. Much of this AI activity was associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids and natural antoxidants (carotenoids, etc.).

40|$|BACKGROUND For several decades, gynecologists {{have been}} {{successfully}} using various forms of hormonalreplacement therapy (HRT) for treating climacteric symptoms. After 2002, when the expertand the general public learned about the undesired side effects of hormonal replacementtherapy, the interest in such forms of therapy has been reduced, and as a consequence, theinterest in natural healing has increased. Some plants contain phytoestrogens, which are structurally and/or functionally similar toestrogen and which can have agonistic, partly agonistic and antagonistic interactions with estrogen receptors. Among the more familiar sources of phytoestrogens are soya, redclover, ginseng, dong quai, evening <b>primrose</b> seed <b>oil,</b> and they are marketed as food supplements for ameliorating climacteric symptoms. Very few relevant clinical studies havebeen done {{on the effectiveness of}} the above-mentioned food supplements in eliminatingclimacteric symptoms and they have not conclusively demonstrated their positive effect. Any beneficial effects are usually attributed to the placebo effect. The most promising arethe soya preparations, as clinical data proves their effectiveness in reducing blood lipids. Estimating their effectiveness in eliminating climacteric symptoms is made difficult because of varying compositions and doses of isoflavones in them. There is more evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of the unique medication made from the rhizome ofthe medicinal plant Cimicifuga racemosa (Black Cohosh), which has been on the marketsince 1956.  The exact mechanism of the natural medication made of CR is not known, butit is attributed to the properties of a vegetative SERM (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator) and central activity through dopamine and serotonin receptors has been proven. Thismedication has been subject to the most clinical trials of all natural medications in generaland it was tested on more than 3800 patients. Its effectiveness is proven compared toplacebo and it is also very effective compared to HRT. The effects of long-term use and theexact mechanism remain unknown. CONCLUSIONS The studies could not decisively confirm the effectiveness of various phytoestrogens inamelioration of climacteric symptoms. Most studies have proven the effectiveness of thenatural medication made of Cimicifuga racemosa and its safe short-term use. Gynecologists should be familiar with the basics of phytotherapy and the results of clinical studiesin this field in order to confidently advise women to use the natural medications in caseswhere despite the climacteric symptoms they cannot or will not use HRT, consequentlygreatly reducing the quality of their lives. In cases where climacteric symptoms are mild tomoderate, some menopausal societies around the globe suggest trying natural medicationfirst, and only later implementing HR...|$|R

2500|$|While {{working as}} an {{academic}} investigator, in Africa and later, Horrobin developed a theory implicating altered fatty acid metabolism in schizophrenia.

To raise money for his research, Horrobin left academia and in 1977 established a company called Efamol to sell evening <b>primrose</b> <b>oil</b> (EPO) as a proposed treatment for various ailments.
