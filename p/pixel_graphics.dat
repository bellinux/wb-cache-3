5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics,</b> but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} amplified monaural {{sound and}} <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> on a CRT monitor. A Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} handles the graphics and gameplay, while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork is stenciled on the wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness was {{developed}} by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor, and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, {{which is similar to}} a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real time so that it is in synchronization with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.|$|E
50|$|González {{first began}} his {{interest}} in programming video games {{at the age of}} eleven, when he received his Casio PB-700, and began to write small programs and games in BASIC. His first program was a <b>pixel</b> <b>graphic</b> program.|$|R
50|$|Robotron {{developed}} additional {{components for}} internal usage, like a <b>pixel</b> <b>graphic</b> extension or a battery-backed 4KB memory. Even though those {{were not available}} via the official Robotron sales channel, the goal was provide that information as reference or enable independent reuse.|$|R
50|$|The C900 was a 16-bit {{computer}} {{based on the}} segmented version of the Zilog Z8000 CPU. It ran Coherent, a UNIX-like operating system. Two versions of the machine were developed: a workstation with 1024×800 <b>pixels</b> <b>graphics,</b> and a server with text-only display.|$|R
5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
500|$|Dunlop {{had been}} seeking {{contract}} work {{when he was}} hired by Jones. Glancy was working at a computer shop in Scotland when he met Dunlop, who was working on Walker at the time. [...] "I had been working on pixel art games and projects for some years so offered to create an entire set of level graphics for the game", Glancy said. The Terminator (1984) and Akira (1988) influenced Glancy's design work, which he described as [...] "the most complex <b>pixel</b> <b>graphics</b> [...] had ever made", due to the addition of motion blur and dynamic lighting. While Jones was impressed by Glancy's designs, he selected alternative designs by the art department at DMA Design because Glancy was not an employee.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{there was}} a single type of graphician {{creating}} typical 2D graphics (referred to as <b>pixeled</b> <b>graphics</b> because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, {{sometimes referred to as}} (3D) modelers.|$|R
50|$|Dark Seed is a {{psychological}} horror point-and-click adventure game developed {{and published by}} Cyberdreams in 1992. It exhibits a normal world and a dark world counterpart, {{which is based on}} the artwork by H. R. Giger. It {{was one of the first}} point-and-click adventure games to use high-resolution (640 × 350 <b>pixels)</b> <b>graphics,</b> to Giger's demand. A sequel, Dark Seed II, was released in 1995.|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 <b>pixel</b> monochrome <b>graphics</b> capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color <b>Graphics</b> Adapter 320×200 <b>pixel,</b> or 640×200 <b>pixel</b> <b>graphic</b> standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R

50|$|ColorCAM was {{originally}} developed and marketed {{under the name}} LAYCAD and was running on computers from ELTEC in Mainz, Germany, and HEMA in Aalen, Germany, using the Motorola 6809 CPU, {{one of the most}} powerful 8/16-bit processors at that time. To be able to address more than the maximal 64 kilobytes of RAM available with a 16-bit address space, these computers had special hardware to superimpose a memory window in this 16-bit address space, from a bigger storage with up to 512 Kbyte RAM. The ELTEC computer had a 512×256 <b>pixel</b> memory mapped <b>graphic</b> while the HEMA computer had a 640×400 <b>pixel</b> <b>graphic</b> using the NEC 7220 graphics controller chip. Both computers used the FLEX (operating system).|$|R
