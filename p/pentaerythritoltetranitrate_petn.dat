40|$|A microcoating {{technique}} {{was used to}} apply a polymer to an energetic explosive material. The explosive was <b>pentaerythritoltetranitrate</b> (<b>PETN),</b> and the coating was a copolymer consisting of vinylchloride/trifluorochloroethylene in a 1. 5 / 1. 0 molecular ratio. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) were used to study the surface and interfacial chemistry of PETN powders and pellets made from compressed powders having either 0. 5 or 20 wt% coating. Two simple models were used to discuss {{the nature of the}} copolymer film on the PETN. Model I shows the copolymer completely coating PETN; Model II depicts the copolymer as only partially covering PETN. Model II was applicable in explaining the 0. 5 and 20 wt% microcoating of powders, as well as the 0. 5 wt% coated pellets. However, the pellets with 20 wt% coating showed the copolymer to completely coat PETN (Model I), suggesting copolymer redistribution during pelletization. XPS and ISS results showed the copolymer film to be thin. An XPS expression modified to accommodate ISS data was developed for the calculation of the average copolymer thickness of PETN. The thicknesses were determined to be 10 {angstrom} and 6 {angstrom} for 0. 5 wt% coated PETN powders and pellets, respectively. Bonding between the copolymer and PETN was concluded to be mechanical...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{formulations of}} plastic bonded explosives (PBXs) based on three highly brisant explosives, namely 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazinane (RDX), 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocane (HMX) and <b>pentaerythritoltetranitrate</b> (<b>PETN)</b> with polyurethane (PU) based on Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) as an energetic binder {{in comparison with}} composition-B, which used in the fragmentation warheads. The sensitivity and performance properties {{of different types of}} PBXs were evaluated by experimental results of prepared selected PBX compositions. Casting technique was used to prepare the selected compositions containing 14 % PU based on GAP. It has been observed that the brisance of the PBX based on HMX was higher than that of comp-B by 21. 3 %, the detonation velocity showed a remarkable increase of the order of 8480 (m/s) while that of comp-B was 7638 (m/s). A controlled fragmentation warhead with an outer grooving warhead case of dimensions 100 x 35 x 4 mm was used and arena test was carried out to determine the lethal zone of the fragmentation warhead. The lethal zone obtained from arena test for PBX composition based on HMX named PBXHG 4 was higher than that based on RDX or PETN, and than that of comp-B by 40 %...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{suggest that}} <b>pentaerythritoltetranitrate</b> (<b>PETN)</b> undergoes {{changes at the}} molecular level that cause macroscopic changes in the overall PETN powder characteristics over time. These changes have been attributed to the high molecular mobility of PETN, but the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for this redistribution are still uncertain. Two basic approaches have been implemented in the past year to provide insight into the nature of these underlying mechanisms. The first approach is of an experimental nature, utilizing both AFM and evaporation measurements, which address both surface mobility and evaporation. These data include AFM measurements performed at LLNL and evaporation rate measurements performed at Texas Tech. These results are compared to earlier vapor pressure measurements performed at SNL, and estimates of recrystallization time frames are given. The second approach utilizes first-principle calculations and simulations that will be used to compare directly to those experimental quantities measured. We are developing an accurate intermolecular potential for PETN, which via kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations would mimic real crystallite shapes. Once the basic theory is in place for the growth of single crystallites, we will {{be in a position to}} investigate realistic grain coarsening phenomena in multi-crystallite simulations. This will also enable us to study how to control the morphological evolution, e. g., through thermal cycling, or through the action of custom additives and impurities...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in terrorist activities committed using explosives {{in recent years}} has generated the need for improved analytical methods that can accurately and quickly identify explosives and their residues. In this study such an analytical method is evaluated. In the rst phase of the study, standard solutions and a standard mixture solution of TNT (2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene), RDX (1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazocyclohexane), <b>PETN</b> (<b>pentaerythritoltetranitrate)</b> and TETRYL (2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenylmethylnitramine) were examined using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). In the second phase, qualitative analysis of a real explosion residue was carried out and the explosive material used in the bomb was identied by analysing the acetone extract. In the third phase, a handswab sample taken from a suspect was analysed for trace explosive residues. Some advantages of using IMS for the detection of explosives and their residues were determined. Key Words: Explosives, ion mobility spectrometry, trace explosive evidence, criminalistics...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of isotopic techniques to investigations requiring {{the provision of}} evidence to a Court is limited. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the {{application of}} light stable isotopes and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to solve complex forensic cases by providing a level of discrimination not achievable utilising traditional forensic techniques. Due to the current threat of organic peroxide explosives, such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP), research was undertaken to determine the potential of IRMS to differentiate samples of TATP that had been manufactured utilising different starting materials and/or manufacturing processes. In addition, due to the prevalence of <b>pentaerythritoltetranitrate</b> (<b>PETN)</b> in detonators, detonating cord, and boosters, the potential of the IRMS technique to differentiate PETN samples from different sources was also investigated. Carbon isotope values were measured in fourteen TATP samples, with three definite groups appearing in the initial sample set based on the carbon data alone. Four additional TATP samples (in a second set of samples) were distinguishable utilising the carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions individually, and also in combination with the oxygen isotope values. The 3 D plot of the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen data demonstrated the clear discrimination of the four samples of TATP. The carbon and nitrogen isotope values measured from fifteen PETN samples, allowed samples from different sources to be readily discriminated. This paper demonstrates the successful application of IRMS to the analysis of explosives of forensic interest to assist in discriminating samples from different sources. This research represents a preliminary evaluation of the IRMS technique for the measurement of stable isotope values in TATP and PETN samples, and supports the dedication of resources for a full evaluation of this application in order to achieve Court reportable IRMS results.
