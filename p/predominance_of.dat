In this paper, we introduce the EMI technique, which the metal material is applied in shielding the strong electromagnetic wave interference on some frequency region in field space, {{and analyze the}} electromagnetic shielding principle of the metal plate and the metallic mesh. The design method and the actual manufacture about the shielding system are also given. The test result shows that the system’s shielding effectiveness is practical and effective...|$|R

5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of {{practical}} training and the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E

5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, {{as shown by the}} <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and {{political}} changes, stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E
5|$|The Huns {{destroyed}} Drobeta and Sucidava in the 440s, but the forts were restored under Emperor Justinian I (527565). Eastern Roman coins {{from the}} first half of the 6thcentury suggest a significant military presence in Olteniaa region also characterized by the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> pottery with shapes of Roman tradition. Although Eastern Roman emperors made annual payments to the neighboring peoples in an attempt to keep the peace in the Balkans, the Avars regularly invaded Scythia Minor from the 580s. The Romans abandoned Sucidava in 596 or 597, but Tomis, which was the last town in Scythia Minor to resist the invaders, only fell in 704.|$|E

5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|Phase IV: As Rome {{began to}} {{struggle}} to keep control over its sprawling territories, military service continued to be salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded {{to such an extent}} that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a trend in the late empire of an increasing <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-five {{specimens}} of gastric carcinoma from Northern Nigeria were classified using {{the criteria of}} Lauren (1965). Forty were intestinal, 16 diffuse, 2 mixed, and 7 unclassifiable. The intestinal type predominated in {{both men and women}} and in all age groups contrary to the expectation <b>of</b> a diffuse <b>predominance</b> because <b>of</b> the relatively young age groups of the population and the low risk for gastric carcinoma in this region...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the success}} of his party systems theory, Giovanni Sartori’s {{predominant}} party system is a type that is consistently avoided by party systems scholars, yet the reasons for this have been unclear. This article exposes the flaws in Sartori’s predominant party system, but we also argue that it remains a useful concept and, consequently, that the literature’s rejection <b>of</b> <b>predominance</b> and retreat to the cruder dominance notion is unnecessary. Instead, we amend predominance to ensure its coherence within Sartori’s typology and consistency with his party systems theory. We show that our amendments improve the value <b>of</b> <b>predominance</b> as a category for empirical analysis of the effects of party systems...|$|R

5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns {{had been able to}} resist Mongol attacks, {{following}} the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of urbanization was characterized by the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and wine is also documented in royal charters.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> Halophila), and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
5|$|Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) {{are located}} {{close to the}} banks of the Irwell, near to its {{confluence}} with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, a 88 800 m² site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs.|$|E

25|$|Benign {{epilepsy}} with centrotemporal spikes {{is thought}} to be a genetic disorder. An autosomal dominant inheritance with age dependency and variable penetrance has been reported, although not all studies support this theory. Linkage studies have pointed to a possible susceptibility region on chromosome 15q14, {{in the vicinity of the}} alpha-7 subunit of the acetylcholine receptor. Most studies show a slight male <b>predominance.</b> Because <b>of</b> the benign course and age-specific occurrence, it {{is thought to}} represent a hereditary impairment of brain maturation.|$|R

5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to mutations in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different mutations is known. There {{is likely to be a}} <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 mutations, which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing mutations. Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG mutations are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 mutations may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 mutations. People with exactly the same mutations may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the nature and}} {{limitations}} of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true thalassocracy. Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and {{were not able to}} play a truly independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses. Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals. Combined with the traditional <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> the great Anatolian land-holders in the higher military and civil offices, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. This fact is clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the <b>predominance</b> <b>of</b> matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E
