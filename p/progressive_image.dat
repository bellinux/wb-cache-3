40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} human visual weighted quantization for transform/subband coding of interlaced pictures. Merged field coding is assumed. The criterion proposed for the optimization of the quantizer is the distortion measured on the deinterlaced and decoded image. This criterion and the associated weighting factors are shown {{to be dependent on}} the motion between two successive fields. 1 Introduction The problem of optimum quantization of transform/subband coefficients, taking into account the HVS (Human Visual System) has received a lot of attention as far as <b>progressive</b> <b>images</b> are concerned [4, 6, 5]. A correct analysis of the problem has not yet been proposed for interlaced pictures. Actually, when field transformation is applied the problem reduces to the case of <b>progressive</b> <b>images,</b> with adapted sampling parameters. However, a higher efficiency may be expected by applying frame transformation which means processing the two fields merged together [1]. The purpose of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} optimization framework for solving the end-to-end problem of multiple antenna transmission of <b>progressive</b> <b>images</b> over noisy channels. Such channels exhibit temporally correlated loss characteristics and {{are associated with}} wireless communication links. In our study, we protect the pro-gressive bitstream associated with an image source utilizing a fam-ily of rate compatible punctured RS product codes along with re-ceiver feedback. We consider the impacts of transmission bit er-rors as well as packet erasures. To cope {{with the impact of}} random bit errors, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at mini-mizing the end-to-end expected distortion of a reconstructed image subject to rate and efficiency constraints. In order to eliminate the impact of packet erasures, we propose utilizing an algorithm that is capable of statistically guaranteeing the delivery of a number of packet sets associated with a progressive bitstream. Our experiments capture the effects of embedding multiple antennas in the transmission of <b>progressive</b> <b>images</b> over wireless tandem channels. Under identical power constraints, our results show that increasing the number of antennas on either transmitting or receiving sides improves the quality of a reconstructed image. Further, the use of receive diversity used in conjunction with simple communication coding schemes such as MRC yields more improvements than the use of transmit diversity used in conjunction with comparable communication coding schemes such as STBC. Finally, the use of receiver feedback can further improve the quality of an image reconstructed in the absence of feedback...|$|R

50|$|The lower resolutions {{can operate}} either in {{progressive}} scan or interlaced mode, {{but not the}} largest picture sizes. The 1080-line system does not support <b>progressive</b> <b>images</b> at the highest frame rates of 50, 59.94 or 60 frames per second, because such technology was seen as too advanced at the time. The standard also requires 720-line video be progressive scan, since that provides better picture quality than interlaced scan at a given frame rate, {{and there was no}} legacy use of interlaced scan for that format. The result is that the combination of maximum frame rate and picture size results in the same maximum number of samples per second for both the 1080-line interlaced format and the 720-line format, as 1980*1080*30 is equal to 1280*720*60.

50|$|This rough {{animation}} compares {{progressive scan}} with interlace scan, also demonstrating the interline twitter effect associated with interlacing. On the left {{there are two}} progressive scan images. In the middle there are two interlaced images and on the right there are two images with line doublers. The original resolutions are above and the ones with spatial anti-aliasing are below. The interlaced images use half the bandwidth of the progressive ones. The images in the center column precisely duplicate the pixels of {{the ones on the}} left, but interlacing causes details to twitter. Real interlaced video blurs such details to prevent twittering, but as seen in the pictures of the lower row, such softening (or anti-aliasing) comes at the cost of image clarity. A line doubler shown in the bottom center picture cannot restore the previously interlaced image to the full quality of the <b>progressive</b> <b>image</b> shown in the top left one.|$|E

50|$|The Second Townsville General Hospital {{demonstrates}} {{the emergence of}} the Australia-wide trend for a <b>progressive</b> <b>image,</b> inspired by European modernist architecture, for highrise hospital design. The high rise plan, in which various functions could be concentrated in vertically stacked spaces, replaced the earlier pavilion planning principles, in which detached buildings containing single wards were widely separated. Developments in medical theory meant that ventilation and isolation were no longer considered as important {{to the health of the}} patient. New priorities based on more efficient use of space, staff, circulation between different parts of the hospital and reduced heating costs led to the popularity of the much more compact highrise type of hospital. Block 3 at the Brisbane General Hospital, designed in 1930, was the first hospital building in Queensland to fully incorporate the principles of the highrise plan. It was designed in the Spanish Mission style to coordinate with the earlier Blocks 1 and 2. The design for the Second Townsville General Hospital was probably the first in Queensland to combine highrise planning principles with a progressive modern image.|$|E
30|$|Deinterlacing {{and image}} {{upscaling}} {{have been studied}} for decades. These methods can be roughly classified into linear filtering interpolation (LFI) and edge directional interpolation (EDI). Among the deinterlacing methods, LFI approaches[2 – 7] can be categorized into spatial (intra-field), temporal (inter-field), and spatio-temporal methods, according to the field information. In order to obtain <b>progressive</b> <b>images,</b> missing pixels have to be reconstructed using linear filters according to the spatial correlations, the temporal correlations, and both the spatial and temporal correlations in interlaced video sequences. Particularly, some algorithms[5 – 7] discover missing pixel values by interpolating the pixels along motion trajectories, because temporal correlation is dependent on motion information. Among the image upscaling methods, LFI approaches[8 – 12] design a particular interpolation kernel, which {{can be applied to}} the entire image. Especially, these methods can resize images with arbitrary ratios, which is one of the preferred features for image upscaling applications. LFI methods for both deinterlacing and upscaling are as old as image processing, and they are still popular because of their simple implementation. However, LFI approaches usually produce jagged edge artifacts (stair-like artifacts) in diagonal edge regions because they do not consider any edge information during the resampling process.|$|R
