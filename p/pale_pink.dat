5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a reddish volva, and P.formanosus, which has a <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> stipe and volva.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

50|$|Another similar species known {{under the}} same common names is Habranthus robustus. They can be {{differentiated}} from Z. rosea by having <b>paler</b> <b>pink</b> and larger flowers.|$|R
5000|$|The once-flowering {{rambling}} rose [...] "Félicité et Perpétue" [...] (R. sempervirens x 'Old Blush') with <b>palest</b> <b>pinks</b> buds opening nearly white, {{was introduced by}} Robert Jacques in 1828.|$|R
5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, and <b>pale</b> <b>pink.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{oxidation}} state for manganese is +2, {{which has a}} <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> color, and many manganese(II) compounds are known, such as manganese(II) sulfate (MnSO4) and manganese(II) chloride (MnCl2). This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite (manganese(II) carbonate). Manganese(II) most commonly exists with a high spin, S = 5/2 ground state {{because of the high}} pairing energy for manganese(II). However, there are a few examples of low-spin, S =1/2 manganese(II). There are no spin-allowed d–d transitions in manganese(II), explaining why manganese(II) compounds are typically pale to colorless.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
50|$|A scarce endemic orchid, {{resembling}} the common Pyramidal Orchid, but having smaller and <b>paler</b> <b>pink</b> or white flowers. Flowers {{can be found}} from February to April in garrigue and rocky steppes.|$|R
5000|$|E. [...] "Ballerina" [...] (ACRA reference: ACC469) is {{a larger}} flowered form with pink flowers rimmed with red, {{collected}} from a plant in western Tasmania in 1986. It is a <b>paler</b> <b>pink</b> than [...] "Pink Cloud".|$|R
50|$|Plants of Silene latifolia × Silene dioica = Silene × hampeana {{that are}} fertile hybrids with the closely related white campion (Silene latifolia) {{are common in}} some areas.

5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
25|$|Red chokeberry, Aronia arbutifolia (Photinia pyrifolia), {{grows to}} 2–4m tall, rarely up to 6 m and 1–2 m wide. Leaves are 5–8cm wide and densely {{pubescent}} on the underside. The flowers are white or <b>pale</b> <b>pink,</b> 1cm wide, with glandular sepals. The fruit is red, 4–10mm wide, persisting into winter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers and}} seed pods are similar, but {{the leaves and}} stems are [...] (have stems). Streptocarpellas are {{generally}} clump-forming or trailing plants. Their flowers are only about 2.5-3.5 cm in diameter, and their colour range seems {{to be limited to}} mid-purples, <b>pale</b> <b>pinks,</b> and white.|$|R
50|$|They {{are one of}} {{the three}} species of rain lilies {{commonly}} known as 'pink rain lilies'. The other two are Zephyranthes rosea and Habranthus robustus. Z. rosea is a much smaller species with pink flowers that have green centers. H. robustus, on the other hand, have generally <b>paler</b> <b>pink</b> and more strongly bent flowers.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{paintings}} Sellmann uses a watercolor-on-canvas technique in [...] "candy colored acrylic tones (bonbonbunte Acryltöne)" [...] and “multi-layers of translucent pigments in <b>pale</b> <b>pinks,</b> powder blues, and acidic yellows and greens“.Works of her {{have been described}} as “see-through versions of Old Master paintings ... gone translucent and ethereal“, [...] "particular reverie-inducers“, exploring “the other side of pink“.|$|R
25|$|This genus, {{circumpolar}} in its distribution, {{is closely}} related to carnations. The stems and leaves are very sticky and viscid, which may discourage ants and beetles from climbing on the plant. The variety exscapa has shorter flowering stems. The other variety subacaulescens, from Wyoming and Colorado, has <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> flowers all summer.|$|E
25|$|In the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes very <b>pale,</b> <b>pink</b> red wines {{that are}} often mistaken for rosés from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau {{varieties}}. But the region also makes even paler actual rosés from the same grape varieties that are pressed {{after only a few}} hours of skin contact.|$|E
25|$|At the Driggith Mine, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, on dumps {{from the}} 30 fathom level, {{radiating}} aggregates of lath-like crystals of ianbruceite {{have been found}} in fractures in quartz-dolomite matrix with sphalerite, chalcopyrite and cobalt-bearing köttigite as rounded pink aggregates, or more rarely <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> to colorless monoclinic blades, as well as irregular black patches of a cobalt-bearing manganese oxide, adamite and an unidentified copper silicate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subterranean}} part, {{which can}} weigh several kilograms, {{is made up}} of white stems covered with fleshy scales. The flowers are 40 to 50 mm, with long pedicels; they appear near to the ground in April - May. The normal colour of the flowers is purple or purplish-violet, but rarely colonies with <b>paler,</b> <b>pink</b> or even wholly white flowers may be encountered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{is made up}} of one or more {{heads of}} bisexual and male-only flowers with tiny, curving, <b>pale</b> salmon <b>pink,</b> yellowish or straw-colored petals.|$|R

25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E
25|$|The grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, {{is famous}} for the rich {{polymorphism}} of its shell. The system is controlled {{by a series of}} multiple alleles. The shell colour series is brown (genetically the top dominant trait), dark pink, light pink, very <b>pale</b> <b>pink,</b> dark yellow and light yellow (the bottom or universal recessive trait). Bands may be present or absent; and if present from one to five in number. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see epistasis).|$|E
25|$|Some {{tourmaline}} gems, especially pink to red colored stones, are {{altered by}} heat treatment {{to improve their}} color. Overly dark red stones can be lightened by careful heat treatment. The pink color in manganese-containing near-colorless to <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> stones can be greatly increased by irradiation with gamma-rays or electron beams. Irradiation {{is almost impossible to}} detect in tourmalines, and does not, currently, impact the value. Heavily included tourmalines, such as rubellite and Brazilian paraiba, are sometimes clarity-enhanced. A clarity-enhanced tourmaline (especially the paraiba variety) is worth much less than a non-treated gem.|$|E
500|$|The travel {{writer and}} biographer, James Pope-Hennessy, {{described}} the River Shannon at Banagher in September in his biography of Anthony Trollope: [...] "The month of September in Banagher, and {{all along the}} Shannon banks, is visually a glorious one, with golden autumn mornings, the low sun making long shadows of the houses in the street.

50|$|Habranthus robustus are {{commonly}} sold as Zephyranthes robusta by merchants, an incorrect synonym. Due {{to having the}} same common names, it is also frequently confused with other 'pink rain lilies' - namely Zephyranthes rosea and Zephyranthes carinata (also sold under the name Zephyranthes grandiflora). The three species are often mislabeled, but H. robustus is easily recognizable from the other two by its larger, more strongly bent (and often asymmetrical), <b>paler</b> <b>pink</b> flowers. H. robustus also have leaves covered with a fine grayish waxy coating (glaucous) {{in contrast to the}} leaves of Z. carinata.|$|R

25|$|During the 19th century, Pinot Meunier {{was widely}} planted {{throughout}} northern France, {{especially in the}} Paris Basin. It was found across the northern half of country from the Loire Valley to Lorraine. Today, Pinot Meunier is found outside of Champagne in dwindling quantities in the Loire Valley regions of Touraine and Orleans {{as well as the}} Cotes de Toul and Moselle regions. In these regions Pinot Meunier is used to make light bodied reds and rosés. These wines most often fall into the vin gris style are characterized by their <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> color and distinctive smokey notes.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{distinctive}} crown patches allow for easy {{identification of the}} adult golden-crowned sparrow in breeding plumage, an immature or non-breeding bird might {{be mistaken for a}} white-crowned or white-throated sparrow. It is distinguished from the former by its crown pattern and dusky (rather than <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> or yellowish) bill, and from the latter by its larger size, plain throat, and lack of a buff-colored central crown stripe. A young or non-breeding bird may also resemble a female house sparrow, but can be distinguished by its larger size, darker plumage, longer tail and (usually) some amount of dull yellow feathering on its forehead.|$|E
25|$|As in all Proteaceae, {{individual}} flowers {{consist of}} a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.acuminata, the perianth is 24–25mm long, <b>pale</b> <b>pink</b> at the base and mauve above, with sticky hairs on the base. The pistil is 29–40mm long, and cream or pink in colour. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing a single winged seed.|$|E
