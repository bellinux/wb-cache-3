Based on this {{they bought a}} forty-percent stake in Brymon Airways' holding company, <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line,</b> in November 1988. The other major shareholder was British Airways. Brymon was based at London City Airport, but had failed {{to make a profit}} since operations commenced. BEA was bought by the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line</b> in 1988s.|$|E
25|$|With the {{deregulation}} approaching, Maersk looked at other markets {{in which it}} could operate. Maersk determined that the British market was lucrative. Through its joint venture with British Airways, the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line,</b> it bought Birmingham Executive Airways. The <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line</b> had previously bought Plymouth-based Brymon Airways and also owned Plymouth City Airport. The rules at the time hindered Maersk from owning more than {{fifty percent of the}} company. Birmingham Executive Airways was of particular interest for Maersk as they held concessions from Birmingham Airport to Copenhagen, Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Milano. This would allow Maersk to establish itself with additional international routes.|$|E
50|$|Disraeli moved {{that he be}} reprimanded, but on the {{suggestion}} of Lord Hartington agreed to adjourn the matter for a week to allow Plimsoll time for thought.Eventually Plimsoll made an apology. Many people, however, shared his view that the bill had been stifled by {{the pressure of the}} shipowners, and popular feeling forced the government to pass a bill which in the following year was amended into the Merchant Shipping Act.This gave stringent powers of inspection to the Board of Trade, and the mark that indicates the safe limit to which a ship may be loaded became generally known as <b>Plimsoll's</b> mark or <b>line.</b>|$|R
25|$|A Court of Marine Inquiry, {{presided over}} by Judge Stacey, {{commenced}} in Sydney on 6 April 1949. Evidence was given that both holds of the vessel were loaded and trimmed properly, the hatches secured and covered with tarpaulins, and both battened down. The pilot noted that the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line</b> was well visible, indicating the vessel was carrying less than its maximum capacity. The Chairman of Quarries Pty Ltd, the ship's owners, testified that Captain Bell had had command of the SS Bombo {{for the life of}} the ship with the company, that he was a sober, efficient and most reliable Master, and that he had operated on the blue metal trading run from Kiama to Sydney for most of the previous 25 years.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the 19th century, Stanley became one of the world's busiest ports. However, the ship-repair trade began to slacken off in 1876 with the {{establishment}} of the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line,</b> which saw the elimination of the so-called coffin ships and unseaworthy vessels that might otherwise have ended up in Stanley for repair. With the introduction of increasingly reliable iron steamships in the 1890s the trade declined further and was no longer viable following the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Port Stanley continued to be a busy port supporting whaling and sealing activities {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, British warships (and garrisons) in the First and Second World War and the fishing and cruise ship industries in the latter half of the century.|$|E

This report was confirmed by a survey board, which recommended, however, that the ship be returned to the U.S. She made an unscheduled stop in Barbados because the water level was over the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line,</b> indicating an overloaded condition; however investigations in Rio proved the ship had been loaded and secured properly. Cyclops then set out for Baltimore on 4 March, and was rumored to have been sighted on 9 March by the molasses tanker Amolco near Virginia, but this was denied by Amolcos captain. Additionally, because Cyclops was not due in Baltimore until 13 March, {{it is highly unlikely that}} the ship would have been near Virginia on 9 March, as that location would have placed her only about a day from Baltimore. In any event, Cyclops never made it to Baltimore, and no wreckage of her has ever been found. Reports indicate that on 10 March, the day after the ship was rumored to have been sighted by Amolco, a violent storm swept through the Virginia Capes area. While some suggest that the combination of the overloaded condition, engine trouble, and bad weather may have conspired to sink Cyclops, an extensive naval investigation concluded: [...] "Many theories have been advanced, but none that satisfactorily accounts for her disappearance." [...] This summation was written, however, before two of Cyclopss sister ships, [...] and , vanished in the North Atlantic during World War II. Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on Cyclops during her fatal voyage. In both cases, it was theorized that their loss was the result of catastrophic structural failure, but a more outlandish theory attributes all three vessels' disappearances to the Bermuda Triangle.|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope the}} Government will not think just now about {{appointing}} a Poet Laureate. I hardly {{think they can}} be altogether in the right mood. The business just now before the country makes a very good detective story; but as a national epic {{it is a little}} depressing. Jingo literature always weakens a nation; but even healthy patriotic literature has its proper time and occasion. For instance, Mr. Newbolt (who has been suggested for the post) is a very fine poet; but I think his patriotic lyrics would just now rather jar upon a patriot. We are rather too much concerned about our practical seamanship to feel quite confident that Drake will return and [...] "drum them up the Channel as he drummed them long ago." [...] On the contrary, we have an uncomfortable feeling that Drake's ship might suddenly go to the bottom, because the capitalists have made Lloyd George abolish the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line.</b> One could not, without being understood ironically, adjure the two party teams to-day to [...] "play up, play up and play the game," [...] or to [...] "love the game more than the prize." [...] And there is no national hero at this moment in the soldiering line--unless, perhaps, it is Major Archer-Shee--of whom anyone would be likely to say: [...] "Sed miles; sed pro patria." [...] There is, indeed, one beautiful poem of Mr. Newbolt's which may mingle faintly with one's thoughts in such times, but that, alas, is to a very different tune. I mean that one in which he echoes Turner's conception of the old wooden ship vanishing with all the valiant memories of the English: ...|$|E

50|$|Samuel Plimsoll (10 February 1824 - 3 June 1898) was an English {{politician}} and social reformer, now best remembered for having devised the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line</b> (a line on a ship's hull indicating the maximum safe draft, {{and therefore the}} minimum freeboard for the vessel in various operating conditions).|$|E
50|$|The {{loss of the}} London {{increased}} attention in Britain to the dangerous condition of the coffin ships, overloaded by unscrupulous ship owners, and the publicity had {{a major role in}} Samuel Plimsoll's campaign to reform shipping so as to prevent further such disasters.

50|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, the British Government {{had passed}} few laws about safety at sea. The Merchant Shipping Act made the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line</b> or load line {{compulsory}} in 1876, {{but it was not until}} 1894 that the positioning of the mark was fixed in law. It was the Lloyds Register (the insurance institution) who in 1835 originally recommended freeboards as a function of the depth of the hold (three inches per foot of depth, equivalent to 25 cm/m).|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century it was {{sometimes}} the practice to send heavily insured [...] "coffin ships" [...] to sea that were old, poorly maintained and overloaded. In 1868 Samuel Plimsoll became {{concerned by the}} scandal and published Our Seamen which revealed the situation. A load line (which {{became known as the}} <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line)</b> was required by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1876 {{but it was not until}} 1890 that the Board of Trade became responsible for determining where it should be.|$|E

The first pressing even had a porthole cut out in the sleeve. The inside of the original foldout LP sleeve featured a schematic of one of the Queen Elizabeth 2s decks as well as a stylised picture of her engine; these have not been reprinted in later reissues, except for the 2012 reissue by Mercury Records on CD and LP, which reinstates all the elements of the original artwork {{with the exception of the}} cut-out porthole.|$|E
50|$|Maersk Air {{also decided}} to enter the British market. It bought part of the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line,</b> which again bought Birmingham Executive Airways (BEA) and Brymon Airways. After a merger into Brymon European Airways and {{subsequent}} demerger, Maersk Air UK was founded on the foundations of BEA. It operated a series of international and domestic services out of Birmingham Airport, initially with a fleet of three Jetstream 31 and three BAC One-Elevens. Maersk signed a franchise agreement in which Maersk Air UK would fly with British Airways livery and flight codes, but at their own expense and their own aircraft and crew. The 1-11s were replaced with Boeing 737-500s in 1996. Bombardier CRJ200s were introduced two years later.|$|E

50|$|There {{were four}} {{churches in the}} Benefice of Cheriton, which comes under the Deanery of Elham. The church of St Martin is very ancient, {{the base of the}} thirteenth-century tower may have been a Saxon porch. The {{decorative}} arcading in the chancel is made of Bethersden marble and is very finely carved. The churchyard contains the grave of shipping reformer Samuel Plimsoll (whose gravestone bears the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line),</b> and, among many military burials, 24 CWGC-registered war graves, with all three armed forces represented, 15 from World War I (Major-General Hubert Hamilton being the first and highest-ranking of the latter) and nine from World War II. The church gives its name to the military training area of St Martin's Plain and now serves Shorncliffe Camp.|$|E
5000|$|The {{waterline}} is {{the line}} where the hull of a ship meets {{the surface of the}} water. Specifically, it is also the name of a special marking, also known as an international load line, <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>line</b> and water line (positioned amidships), that indicates the draft of the ship and the legal limit to which a ship may be loaded for specific water types and temperatures in order to safely maintain buoyancy, particularly with regard to the hazard of waves that may arise. Varying water temperatures will affect a ship's draft; because warm water is less dense than cold water, providing less buoyancy. In the same way, fresh water is less dense than salinated or seawater with the same lessening effect upon buoyancy.|$|E

5000|$|The easy {{antitrust}} {{cases are}} at the two ends of the continuum, he says, and the more difficult cases are in the middle. Stern suggests that this calls {{for the type of}} analysis the Supreme Court required in United States v.

[...] He concedes that [...] "such an analysis is not wholly satisfactory for predicting the outcome of litigation," [...] but it indicates that to avoid problems one should avoid unnecessarily titling the balance of factors to the unfavorable end of the continuum in drafting licenses. One should not put restrictions unneeded for business reasons into licenses just [...] "as a matter of principle or habit." [...] He maintains that {{it is not necessary to}} try to find out how close to the edge of a precipice it is possible to walk without falling over, and asserts that many businessmen [...] "are able to conduct their affairs satisfactorily without trying to see how close to the <b>Plimsoll</b> <b>Line</b> it is possible to load the ship"—and at the same time do so [...] "without any undue damage to legitimate business expectations." ...|$|E
