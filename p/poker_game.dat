5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the <b>poker</b> <b>game.</b> Having a sense of déjà vu during the <b>poker</b> <b>game</b> and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the <b>poker</b> <b>game,</b> but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind.

When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The film's plot sees Bond becoming involved in an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes <b>poker</b> <b>game,</b> after foiling an attack he arranged on a new aircraft being demonstrated at Miami International Airport; during the course of his assignment, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game.

5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a <b>poker</b> <b>game</b> {{show where}} amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
