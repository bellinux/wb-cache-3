25|$|There is {{only one}} paralog {{identified}} for CCDC130, which is CCDC94, the only other known human member in the CWC16 family of proteins. The two have about 27% identity, most of which {{is located in the}} COG5134 domain and at the C-terminus. CCDC94 has three predicted serine phosphorylation sites at positions 213, 220, and 306 that line up with serines in CCDC130 in the multiple sequence alignment and a threonine <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>site</b> that lines up with a phosphorylated serine in CCDC130.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{mutations}} {{affecting the}} PER2 <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>site</b> of the CK1ε gene results in Familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS). This mutation, {{which results in}} the loss of a single phosphate acceptor site on PER2, prevents CK1ε protein from binding to PER and leads to an unusually short circadian period. Therefore, while the mutation to the human Per2 gene results in a similarly shortened period as in the CK1ε-tau hamsters, the biological mechanisms behind each phenotype are a result of disruptions to different parts of the clock pathway.|$|E
25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the {{potassium}} channel KCNE family and is one five single transmembrane domain voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel ancillary subunits. KCNE2 is composed of three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain protrudes out of the extracellular side of the cell membrane and is, thus, soluble in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, the transmembrane and C-terminal domains are lipid-soluble to enable the protein to incorporate into the cell membrane. The C-terminal faces the intracellular side of the membrane and may share a putative PKC <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>site</b> with other KCNE proteins.|$|E

25|$|Other, {{less well}} characterised substrate-binding sites also exist. One such site (the DEF site) is {{formed by the}} {{activation}} loop (when in the active conformation) and the MAP kinase-specific insert below it. This site can accommodate peptides with an FxFP consensus sequence, typically downstream of the <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>site.</b> Note that the latter site can only be found in proteins that need to selectively recognize the active MAP kinases, thus they are almost exclusively found in substrates. Different motifs may cooperate with each other, as in the Elk family of transcription factors, that possess both a D-motif and an FxFP motif. The presence of an FxFP motif in the KSR1 scaffold protein also serves {{to make it an}} ERK1/2 substrate, providing a negative feedback mechanism to set the correct strength of ERK1/2 activation.|$|E
25|$|As {{typical for}} the CMGC kinase group, the {{catalytic}} site of MAP kinases {{has a very}} loose consensus sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids {{to be followed by}} a small amino acid, preferably proline ("proline-directed kinases"). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelty. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>site</b> by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. Interestingly, D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that are absolutely required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{an important}} post-translational modification influencing many aspects of dynamic cellular behavior. Site-specific phosphorylation of amino acid residues serine, threonine, and tyrosine can have profound effects on protein structure, activity, stability, and interaction with other biomolecules. <b>Phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> can be affected in diverse ways in members of any species, one such way is through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The availability {{of large numbers of}} experimentally identified <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites,</b> and of natural variation datasets in Arabidopsis thaliana prompted us to analyze the effect of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) onto <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites.</b> Results From the analyses of 7, 178 experimentally identified <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> we found that: (i) Proteins with multiple <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> occur more often than expected by chance. (ii) Phosphorylation hotspots show a preference to be located outside conserved domains. (iii) nsSNPs affected experimental <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> as much as the corresponding non-phosphorylated amino acid residues. (iv) Losses of experimental <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> by nsSNPs were identified in 86 A. thaliana proteins, among them receptor proteins were overrepresented. These results were confirmed by similar analyses of predicted <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> in A. thaliana. In addition, predicted threonine <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> showed a significant enrichment of nsSNPs towards asparagines and a significant depletion of the synonymous substitution. Proteins in which predicted <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> were affected by nsSNPs (loss and gain), were determined to be mainly receptor proteins, stress response proteins and proteins involved in nucleotide and protein binding. Proteins involved in metabolism, catalytic activity and biosynthesis were less affected. Conclusions We analyzed more than 7, 100 experimentally identified <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> in almost 4, 300 protein-coding loci in silico, thus constituting the largest phosphoproteomics dataset for A. thaliana available to date. Our findings suggest a relatively high variability in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> between different natural accessions in receptor and other proteins involved in signal transduction. Elucidating the effect of <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> affected by nsSNPs on adaptive responses represents an exciting research goal for the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|During cell division, the {{mitotic spindle}} segregates the sister chromatids into two nascent cells, such that each {{daughter}} cell inherits one {{complete set of}} chromosomes. Errors in spindle formation can result in both chromosome missegregation and cytokinesis defects and hence lead to genomic instability. To ensure the correct function of the spindle, the activity and localization of spindle associated proteins has to be tightly regulated in time and space. Reversible phosphorylation {{has been shown to}} be one of the key regulatory mechanisms for the organization of the mitotic spindle. The relatively low number of identified in vivo <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> of spindle components, however, has hampered functional analysis of regulatory spindle networks. A more complete inventory of the <b>phosphorylation</b> <b>sites</b> of spindle-associated proteins would therefore constitute an important advance.
