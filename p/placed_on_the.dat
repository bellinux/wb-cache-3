5|$|As sensor coils are <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{tongue of}} the subject, {{articulation}} {{may be affected}} depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
