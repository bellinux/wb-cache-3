50|$|The {{extension}} of the above considerations confirms that where B is to H, and where J is to ρ, then it necessarily follows from Gauss's law and from the equation of continuity of charge that E is to D. i.e. B <b>parallels</b> <b>with</b> E, whereas H <b>parallels</b> <b>with</b> D.|$|R
5|$|In this example, {{instruction}} 3 {{cannot be}} executed before (or even in <b>parallel</b> <b>with)</b> instruction 2, because instruction 3 uses a result from instruction 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the use of daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of}} the 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is {{a unitary}} state. Since the 1880s, {{the number of}} {{territorial}} management units has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast). A new administrative structure was adopted in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> {{the west coast of}} Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E

5|$|From the 1550s to the 1640s, as {{a result}} of {{increased}} foreign trade, Aalborg enjoyed great prosperity, second only to that of Copenhagen. The population grew in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the development of many fine buildings in the city as merchants benefitted from their shipping routes from Norway to Portugal. In 1663, the city suffered yet another serious fire, which destroyed the tower of Budolfi Church.|$|E
5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme that is still used nowadays, in <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E
5|$|Hillside Road, {{which runs}} <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> South Road several hundred metres to the south, is an {{arterial}} route connecting South Dunedin (at its eastern end) with Dunedin's southwestern suburbs. At its western end is Forbury Corner, a road junction linking Hillside Road with suburban arterial routes {{to the suburbs}} of Saint Clair (Forbury Road) and Corstorphine (Easther Crescent), as well as David Street, the major road link between Hillside Road and South Road. Numerous other small residential streets run <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> David Street between Hillside Road and South Road. The suburb's other main roads include Caversham Valley Road, Playfair Street, Surrey Street, and Glen Road. The latter of these lies at the Glen at {{the eastern end of}} Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of Maryhill, Balaclava, and Mornington.|$|E

The local stations provide commercial beef producers in their region with bulls of high production potential for use by commercial farmers whose herds are not necessarily registered in the French herd book.|$|E
5|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> the {{construction}} of the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In <b>parallel</b> <b>with</b> {{the efforts}} of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had {{requested}} access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E
