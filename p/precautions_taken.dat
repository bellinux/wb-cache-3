25|$|Space {{agencies}} {{have already had}} experience with returning samples {{thought to be a}} back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon. The <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> then were inadequate by modern standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different approach would be needed for a modern sample return.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with all}} the <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> by medical professionals, {{infection}} reportedly occurs in up to 13.9% of patients after stabilization of an open fracture, and in about 0.5-2% of patients who receive joint prostheses. In order to reduce these numbers, the surfaces of the devices used in these procedures have been altered in hopes to prevent {{the growth of the}} bacteria that leads to these infections. This has been achieved by coating titanium devices with an antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. This antiseptic combination successfully prevents the growth of the five main organisms that cause medical related infections, which include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{measures}} include {{observation of}} vital signs, especially Glasgow Coma Scale and airway patency. IV access with fluid administration {{and maintenance of}} the airway with intubation and artificial ventilation may be required if respiratory depression or pulmonary aspiration occurs. Supportive measures should {{be put in place}} prior to administration of any benzodiazepine antagonist {{in order to protect the}} patient from both the withdrawal effects and possible complications arising from the benzodiazepine. A determination of possible deliberate overdose should be considered with appropriate scrutiny, and <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent any attempt by the patient to commit further bodily harm. Hypotension is corrected with fluid replacement, although catecholamines such as norepinephrine or dopamine may be required to increase blood pressure. Bradycardia is treated with atropine or an infusion of norepinephrine to increase coronary blood flow and heart rate.|$|E

25|$|In August 1709, {{the plague}} {{arrived in the}} small Swedish Pomeranian town of (Alt-)Damm (now Dąbie) on the eastern bank of the Oder river, rapidly killing 500 inhabitants. Stettin (now Szczecin), {{the capital city of}} Swedish Pomerania located on the {{opposite}} bank of the river, reacted by isolating the town with a guarded cordon sanitaire. <b>Precautions</b> <b>taken</b> in Stettin since the arrival of the plague in Danzig included restrictions for travellers, especially soldiers' families returning from Swedish-occupied Poland after the lost Battle of Poltava (8 July 1709), and a ban on fruits in the town's markets, since fruits were believed to transmit the disease. According to Zapnik (2006), the returning soldiers' wives who had contact with the plague-stricken areas around Poznań were most likely the transmitters of the plague to Pomerania. After the outbreak in Damm, the mail route connecting Stettin with Stargard in the adjacent Prussian province of Pomerania via Damm was relocated to Podejuch. Despite the precautions, the plague broke out in Warsow, just north of Stettin, {{and by the end of}} September also inside Stettin's walls, transmitted by a local woman who had provided food to her son in Damm. As in Danzig (see above), the city council downplayed the plague cases to not impair Stettin's trade, but also set up a health commission and pest houses and hired personnel to deal with the infected.|$|E
500|$|Although malaria {{was known}} to be endemic in the Milne Bay area, <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> against the disease were haphazard. Men wore shorts and kept their sleeves rolled up. Their {{mosquito}} repellent cream was ineffective, quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets, which were stowed deep in the ships' holds and took several days to unload. A daily dosage of [...] was prescribed but Field's troops were told not to take their quinine until they had been in the area a week. By this time, many had become infected with the disease. The Director of Medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters was Brigadier Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical medicine. He visited Port Moresby in June, and was alarmed at the ineffectiveness of the measures being taken to combat the disease, which he realised was capable of destroying the entire Allied force in Papua. He made sure that the 110th Casualty Clearing Station left Brisbane for Milne Bay with a fully equipped pathological laboratory and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies, including 200,000 quinine tablets. Unfortunately, some equipment was lost or ruined in transit, and the danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at Milne Bay.|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the turret}} had been hit the captain had ordered Q {{magazine}} doors closed and the magazine flooded, the order passing to the Transmitting Station below the armoured deck where Stoker 1st Class William Yeo was entrusted with passing the order on. The magazine was consequently flooded and locked up within minutes of the hit. [...] However the cordite charges which had fallen down from gun house after the hit were not removed to safety, and there were still ready charges in the working chamber. [...] A large number of crewmen still remained in the shell room, magazine handing room and working chamber. [...] The fire which was {{thought to have been}} put out after the hit on the turret gained strength and ignited the remaining cordite charges, setting off a large explosion at 16:28 which killed the turret crewmen, the flame of the explosion reaching as high as the top of the ship's masts. [...] Even with the <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> in hand, the magazine doors were later found to be severely buckled – only the seawater in the magazine behind it prevented the blast reaching inside. Other ships of the battlecruiser fleet were less lucky; {{at about the same time}} as Harvey's death, [...] was torn to pieces by a series of magazine explosions that claimed 1,013 lives and just minutes after that HMS Queen Mary exploded [...] "like a puffball" [...] in one huge column of grey smoke, killing 1,275 sailors. Hours later during the main battlefleet engagement, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood's flagship [...] was destroyed with 1,032 lives. All three ships were lost as the result of magazine explosions similar to the one narrowly avoided on Lion.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{processes}} {{involved in}} randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; {{this may be a}} simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be [...] "restricted", or may be [...] "adaptive." [...] A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random [...] "systematic" [...] methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause [...] "limitless contamination possibilities" [...] and can cause a breach of allocation concealment.|$|E

2500|$|Tuning a {{klystron}} is delicate work which, if {{not done}} properly, can cause damage to equipment or {{injury to the}} technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician {{must be careful not}} to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent magnets. [...] If a technician uses ferrous tools (which are ferromagnetic) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight nonmagnetic (aka diamagnetic) tools made of beryllium alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{air strip}} {{in the park}} is at the Sila River on Wager Bay's north coast. [...] In 1987, Inuit from the area built Sila Lodge at this location.

[...] From Sila Lodge, guided tours were offered, for instance boating tours to the Wager Bay islands, or to Ford Lake across the reversing falls, to the former Hudson's Bay Company outpost, or walks to the surrounding area, where one would find impressive relics of earlier settlements, such as tent rings, qarmaq and inuksuk. [...] The site {{can be used as a}} starting point for backpacking trips, but with suitable <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> for polar bears in the area.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after Lokela's death, {{others who}} had been in contact with him also died, and people in the village of Yambuku began to panic. This led the country's Minister of Health along with Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko to declare the entire region, {{including}} Yambuku and the country's capital, Kinshasa, a quarantine zone. No one was permitted to enter or leave the area, with roads, waterways, and airfields placed under martial law. Schools, businesses and social organizations were closed. Researchers from the CDC, including Peter Piot, co-discoverer of Ebola, later arrived to assess the effects of the outbreak, observing that [...] "the whole region was in panic." [...] Piot concluded that the Belgian nuns had inadvertently started the epidemic by giving unnecessary vitamin injections to pregnant women, without sterilizing the syringes and needles. The outbreak lasted 26 days, with the quarantine lasting 2 weeks. Among the reasons that researchers speculated caused the disease to disappear, were the <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> by locals, the quarantine of the area, and discontinuing the injections.|$|E

2500|$|Manet {{embarked}} {{on the canvas}} after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, [...] "only the <b>precautions</b> <b>taken</b> by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" [...] by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.|$|E
