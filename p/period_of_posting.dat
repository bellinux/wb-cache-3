40|$|Background: The primary aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{undergraduate}} students’ perception on ward-round and clinical teaching activities and its perceived impact on their academic performance in Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Shika-Zaria. A descriptive survey design was employed as a methodology for the study. The study population includes undergraduate students of Bachelor of Nursing Sciences (BNSc) in 400 & 500 L, Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences (B. Pharm) in 500 L and Bachelor of Medicine; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 400 & 500 Levels with a total number of 910. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional descriptive survey was employed as a study design. Structured questionnaire was used as instrument for data collection which was divided into five sections according to the objectives of the study. Results: The study population comprises of undergraduate students of Bachelor of Nursing Sciences (BNSc) in 400 & 500 L, Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences (B. Pharm) in 500 L and Bachelor of Medicine; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 400 & 500 Levels. A sample size of 276 was used. Thef indings of the study revealed that, BNSc and MBBS students demonstrated good perception toward the concept of ward-round as clinical teaching strategy; B. Pharm students had good perception toward ward round but their clinical role was not clearly defined because of limited <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>posting.</b> Most of the students enjoyed participating in ward-round and they always participate. Among the BNSc students, “Team work” was rated most as an impact of ward-round that strongly influence their performance, while among the MBBS students “Work-based teaching” got the highest rating and B. Pharm students rated “Improved motivation” as an impact of ward-round that strongly influence their performance. Conclusion: It was concluded that undergraduate students demonstrated good perception of the concept of ward-round and they enjoy participating in all activities during clinical teaching. Interventions such as supervision and guidance of students’ activities while in the clinical area by the clinical instructors, increasing the number of postings of B. pharm students to the ward are needed for effective integration of learning...|$|E

The Slack-Based Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) method employed to compute the profit efficiency of 31 commercial banks operating in the Bangladesh over the years 2004 – 2011. Furthermore, the multivariate panel regression analysis framework based on the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Generalized Least Square (GLS) methods comprising the Fixed Effect (FE) and Random Effect (RE) models adopted to examine the determinants of banks profit efficiency. Results indicate the levels of profit efficiency on SCBs and PCBs are increasing by 3. 7 % and 5. 8 % during financial crisis years. However, over the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> financial crisis years exhibited, profit efficiency levels on SCBs and PCBs are decreasing by 38. 7 % and 9. 9 %. Although profit efficiency levels on both ownership of banks show declining over the post financial crisis years, the PCBs still higher than SCBs (67. 8 %> 60. 1 %) but insignificantly different. Furthermore, the findings reveals that the relationship of size of bank, liquidity, economic growth and market concentration are significantly negative with profit efficiency of SCBs but positive to PCBs.

30|$|Interestingly, {{tree growth}} was {{significantly}} decreased {{beginning with the}} Civil War drought, but the reduced growth rates persisted until about 1904. Many trees show a growth release circa 1904, which {{could be related to}} the establishment of the forest reserve (that later became the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge) (Figure 5). Based on the pith dates of sample trees, a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> oak tree recruitment appears to have occurred around 1890 to 1895. This cohort established following approximately 20 years of frequent burning, and during a grazing transition from native herbivore to domestic animals. From a broad temporal perspective, the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> tree establishment represents a transition to less frequent fires compared to the previous century, plausibly with intervals long enough to allow trees to attain fire-resistant sizes. In the Great Plains, forest communities commonly relate to a gradient of species fire tolerance and forest density, whereby areas with more frequent fire {{are more likely to be}} dominated by fire tolerant species and open forest structure (Anderson 1990, Batek et al. 1999). The establishment and occurrence <b>of</b> <b>post</b> oak suggests a range of fire frequencies that may be relatively frequent (e.g., 4 yr to 20 yr) over a long period. Similarly, the establishment, encroachment rate, and extent of eastern redcedar is also a general clue to an even further decreased frequency or severity of fires as the species is very fire intolerant.|$|R
