5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme <b>polar</b> <b>variation</b> in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{geomagnetic}} Lorentz force on the muon component of extensive air shower (EAS) has been studied in a Monte Carlo generated simulated data sample. This geomagnetic field affects the paths of muons in an EAS, causing a local contrast or polar asymmetry in the abundance {{of positive and negative}} muons about the shower axis. The asymmetry can be approximately expressed as a function of transverse separation between the positive and negative muons barycentric positions in the EAS through opposite quadrants across the shower core in the shower front plane. In the present study, it is found that the transverse muon barycenter separation and its maximum value obtained from the <b>polar</b> <b>variation</b> of the parameter are higher for Iron primaries than protons for highly inclined showers. Hence, in principle, these parameters can be exploited to the measurement of primary cosmic-ray chemical composition. Possibility of practical realization of the proposed method in a real experiment is briefly discussed. Comment: 13 pages, 25 figures, submitted to Journa...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) for characterizing the surface region of processed compound semiconductor materials is explored {{with respect to}} depth-compositional profiling and with respect to assessing the crystalline surface structure. It is demonstrated by analyzing the sputtered surface region of a (Hg, Cd) Te wafer that ARXPS can readily distinguish between three different compositional zones regarding their sequence and their chemical nature in a depth region of about 50 A. The quantitative scaling of the depth profile is accomplished using a theoretical model of photoemission from a planar sample covered with two uniform overlayer. It is futher demonstrated, by analyzing a (Hg Cd) Te sample grown by liquid phase epitaxy on (111) oriented (Cd, Zn) Te, that azimuthal and <b>polar</b> <b>variation</b> in the angle-resolved photoemission of Hg, Cd and Te occur which are indicative of the phenomenon of x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD). The prominent m axima of the respective photoemissions were observed at three azimuthal angles (120 degree C periodicity) for a polar angle of about 35 degree C. A shift of 60 degree C betweeen the azimuthal maxima of the photoemission of Te and the metal atoms (Cd or Hg) is attributed to a reconstruction of the examined (111) surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of conversion and {{the disparity in}} the direction of conversion were studied for six frameshift mutants lying in locus b 2 of Ascobolus immersus and giving more 2 wild type: 6 mutant (2 + 6 m) than 6 wild type: 2 mutant (6 + 2 m) aberrant asci (type B). The {{frequency of}} conversion decreased from left to right in the locus. The disparity steadily increased from left to right and then reached a plateau. Twenty-two frameshift mutants giving more 6 + 2 m than 2 + 6 m aberrant asci (type A) and closely linked to three type B mutants were also studied; they showed the same frequency of conversion and the same disparity (but in the opposite direction) as the type B mutant to which they are linked. The <b>polar</b> <b>variation</b> of both the frequency of conversion and the disparity as a function of position were expected {{on the basis of a}} previous study of 15 mutants giving postmeiotic segregations and located in locus b 2. This variation is assumed to reflect the existence of a preferential region for the initiation of hybrid DNA (HDNA) during recombination and a duality in the distribution of this HDNA, with preponderant asymmetrical HDNA near the starting point and preponderant symmetrical HDNA farther from it...|$|E
40|$|The first {{geophysical}} observatory at Sodankylä was the Polar Year observatory in years 1882 - 84. The Finnish Academy of Science and Letters, established in 1908, {{set up the}} Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory in 1913 as a geomagnetic observatory. Its activities increased {{before and during the}} Second Polar Year 1932 - 33, but then the observatory was destroyed because of war in autumn 1944. The rebuilt observatory started on January 1, 1946. During IGY (1957 - 58) the ionospheric station was started, as well as the seismological station. During the time 1961 - 71 there was an active period of construction. In 1973 - 92 an astronomical station (<b>polar</b> <b>variation</b> telescope) was run; this activity had been the original goal of the donation, which led to the establishing of the observatory. After 1970 the activities of the observatory have enhanced remarkably. In 1977 a receiving station of the EISCAT radar association was located at Sodankylä. A network of field stations is run, mainly in Northern Finland. In 1997 the observatory joined to the University of Oulu. Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory (SGO) is situated near the southern edge of the Auroral Zone (Lat. 67 ° 22 ’N, 26 ° 38 ’E), 5 km south of the Sodankylä village on the left (eastern) bank of the Kitinen river.

40|$|Solar {{activity}} is evident {{both in the}} equatorial activity centres and in the <b>polar</b> magnetic field <b>variations.</b> The total solar irradiance variation {{is due to the}} former component. During the extraordinarily long minimum of activity between sunspot cycles 23 and 24, the variations related to the equatorial field components reached their minimum values {{in the first half of}} 2008, while those related to the <b>polar</b> field <b>variations</b> had their extreme values rather at the end of 2009 and the first half of 2010. The explanation of this delay is another challenge for dynamo theories. The role of the open solar flux has so far been grossly underestimated in discussions of Sun-climate relations. The gradual increase in the average terrestrial ground temperature since 1610 is related both to the equatorial and <b>polar</b> field <b>variations.</b> The main component (0. 077 K/century) is due to the variation of the total solar irradiance.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} lateral {{density of}} a cosmic air shower with a non-zero zenith angle is asymmetric. The asymmetry {{consist of a}} stretching of the iso-density contours to ellipses and to a shift {{of the center of}} the elliptic contours with respect to the core of the shower. The shift is caused by atmospheric attenuation. The modeling of the attenuation results in an equation for the shift as a function of zenith angle {{and the size of the}} iso-density contours. A more accurate equation is obtained by investigating the shift in lateral densities of simulated showers. It is shown how the shift can be incorporated in an elliptic lateral density function. A linear approximation for the shift allows for an analytical solution for the shifted elliptic density. Its predictions for the <b>polar</b> <b>variations</b> of the density are compared with data of simulated showers. Comment: 30 pages, 20 figure...|$|R

It is found that during the day hours a system of ionospheric currents encircles the magnetic poles on every day. The current system may extend up to 15 deg from the pole but is strongest at 8 to 10 deg invariant colatitude. The current direction as seen from near the magnetic poles is counterclockwise during interplanetary sectors with field pointing away {{from the sun and}} clockwise during toward sectors.

Shortterm variations in springtime midlatitude ozone demonstrate {{only a modest}} correlation with springtime <b>polar</b> ozone <b>variations.</b> However by early summer, ozone variations throughout the extratropics are highly correlated. Analysis of correlation functions indicates that springtime midlatitude ozone, not polar ozone, is the best predictor for summertime polar ozone. Long-term total ozone trends at middle and high latitudes are also different for spring and nearly identical for summer. About 39 % of the observed southern midlatitude ozone decline in December {{can be attributed to}} the polar ozone depletion up to November.

40|$|Several {{properties}} of the A/C index of <b>polar</b> cap <b>variations</b> introduced by L. Svalgaard in 1972 {{have been found to}} vary with time. In the presatellite era, C days, as measured by the Ap index, are almost twice as geomagnetically active as A days, while in the modern epoch they have essentially identical activity. Prior to 1962 there were over 40 % more A days than C days per year, while during the modern epoch there are essentially equal numbers of A days and C days. In view of this strong bias to assigning a 'toward' classification on geomagnetically active days it is recommended that the Svalgaard A/C classification not be used in studies of geomagnetic activity. It is also recommended that a full and thorough documentation of the index be prepared and/or that others undertake to compile such a classification separately...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{processes}} {{involved in}} {{the interaction between the}} solar wind and the earth's magnetosphere are reviewed. The evolution of models of the magnetosphere is first surveyed.

The dynamic changes occurring in the magnetosphere, including erosion of the magnetopause, changes {{in the size of the}} <b>polar</b> cap, <b>variations</b> in the flaring angle of the tail, neutral point formation, plasma sheet motions, and the inward collapse of the midnight magnetosphere, are discussed. The cyclical variations of geomagnetic activity are explained in terms of the control of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction by the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field. Present phenomenological models allow prediction of geomagnetic activity from interplanetary measurements, but modeling of detailed magnetospheric processes is still in its infancy...|$|R

Examination of the 2 -D patterns of spectral power and coherence shows the occurrence of significant variations in geomagnetic power levels but with low spatial coherence near the cusp projection and in the auroral region. At the same time, low-amplitude pulsations, which we coin Pi(cap) 3 pulsations, are very coherent throughout the polar cap. The region occupied by coherent Pi(cap) 3 pulsations is shifted toward local MLT night from the geomagnetic pole and is decoupled from the regions of auroral and cusp ULF activity. The spectral power varies with time at polar latitudes in a manner different from that at auroral latitudes. Diurnal variations of power at different stations at the same geomagnetic latitude exhibit different behavior depending on the station's position relative to geomagnetic and geographic poles. This asymmetry is shown to be partly attributed to the variations of the ionospheric conductance. The primary source of polar pulsations is probably related to intermittent magnetosheath turbulence and tail lobe oscillations, though a particular propagation mechanism has not as yet been identified...|$|R
