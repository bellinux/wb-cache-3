5000|$|The {{essence of}} society, a rigidly {{hierarchical}} {{system in which}} people were ranked according to race and class was well established {{by the time of}} full emancipation in 1838. The act to abolish slavery throughout the British colonies, passed in 1833, was intended to avoid drastic social changes by effecting emancipation over a five-year transition period. The act included two generous measures for slave owners: a system of [...] "apprenticeship" [...] calculated to extend their control over the former slaves who were to continue to work for their masters without <b>pay,</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> for the former slave owners for their loss of property. These measures helped ensure {{that the majority of the}} population, even when it was legally freed after apprenticeship ended in 1838, depended on their former owners for work. These owners still monopolized the land. Before 1838, a handful of the inhabitants controlled the settlement and owned most of the people. After 1838, the masters of the settlement, a tiny elite, continued to control the country for over a century by denying access to land, and by promoting economic dependency of the freed slaves through a combination of wage advances and company stores.|$|E
5000|$|In a February 1998 {{referendum}} {{that gave}} local members {{the option to}} cut Bevona's salary to $122,000 a year, 70% of those casting ballots voted against the proposal.Citing family and health reasons as being behind his resignation, Bevona stepped down from his post heading the local in 1999. In the months before he left office, he had won a 9% increase for local workers in 1,000 commercial buildings in Manhattan and had been re-elected to head the local with 82% of the vote. Bevona left office {{as part of a}} deal in which dissidents would drop a lawsuit that claimed that Bevona had used money from the local to support his re-election bid. Bevona had been facing increasing criticism for receiving a salary that reached $531,529 in 1997 and a lavish package of benefits, more than 17 time the earnings of the building workers he represented. Bevona justified his compensation by pointing to his accomplishments in dealing with building owners in wage negotiations, saying that he had [...] "produced the highest wages, most benefits and most generous benefits" [...] for the workers in 32B-32J. SEIU president Andy Stern singled Bevona out for criticism, saying that none of the officials in the parent union were paid anywhere near what Bevona was earning and that the combination of salary, an apartment and a penthouse office was [...] "excessive". A $100,000 jury verdict in a suit against the local that charged that the local had hired a private investigator to spy on a union dissident also weighed against Bevona. Upon leaving office in February 199, Bevona received a $1.5 million package that included $850,000 in severance <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> for accrued vacation time that added another $650,000, while Bevona's wife resigned from her position with the local as an administrative assistant and received a $50,000 severance package of her own.|$|E

In support of the received literature, I present field evidence that suggests an inefficiently low number of trades occur for naïve traders, suggesting reference-dependent preferences. In contrast, this anomaly is not evident for consumers that have significant trading experience. These results uncover important successes and failures of the theoretical literature, and provide challenges for both neoclassical and reference-dependent theorists...|$|E

This study examines the generality of these experimental findings by going to a well-functioning marketplace and examining more than 350 individual decisions across two incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms. The data suggest that behavior of individuals with intense experience approaches neoclassical predictions: any observed WTA/WTP disparity amongst this group is negligible.

40|$|The World Bank Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network, Public Sector Governance Unit, Policy Research Working Paper 6744 The {{adequacy}} of compensation for government {{workers and the}} affordability {{of the public sector}} wage bill are important concerns for many developing countries. Suitable pay is considered a necessary—albeit far from sufficient—condition for attracting and retaining skilled public sector staff. This paper makes the case for conducting fine-grained analysis of <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> issues in order to enable an accurate assessment of the challenges faced and thereby to generate good-fit reform recommendations that are both principled and feasible. The first part of the paper focuses on prevalent challenges in pay reform, both contextual and analytical. It builds on the experiences from three very different settings: Armenia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Mongolia. The study begins by surveying some of the common difficulties in conducting granular analysis on civil service compensation. It then outlines a series of methodological approaches that can prove useful in developing comprehensive, targeted, and nuanced pay analyses and discusses how it is possible to overcome potential limitations in practice. The second half of the paper presents a case study of <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> analysis in Lao PDR. The study illuminates how a number of these approaches can be combined in assessing a specific set of pay challenges and generating robust recommendations tailored to context. A brief postscript, with the benefit of hindsight on what subsequently happened on the ground in Lao PDR, reflects on the limitations of technical analysis in motivating reform implementation in practice...|$|E

40|$|As public employees, {{elementary}} and secondary school teachers have the enormous responsibility of educating our youth, and much hinges on their success. Teacher quality is the most important input schools contribute to the academic success of their students. 1 The ability of school officials to recruit and retain highly effective classroom teachers is a struggle in many school districts throughout the United States. For decades now, a small and declining fraction of the most cognitively skilled graduates choose to become teachers, 2 while rigorous national standards and school-based accountability for student performance have pushed the demand for talented teachers to an all-time high. Prolific career opportunities have made it increasingly difficult to attract {{the best and the brightest}} into the profession. Professional women, historically afforded limited choices outside of teaching, have increasingly diverse career prospects.

They {{are based on a}} soviet-era military structure, but are attempting to adopt a Western-style of force structure, similar to the U. S. and U. K. A key element in this is the establishment of a professional NCO corps within the Armenian Army. As they seek to develop the senior enlisted ranks, as well as move to an all-volunteer force, they have identified the need to re-evaluate their current military <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> structure. This must all be done with an eye toward long-term personnel costs, which is currently not happening. This project developed a cost model to examine the various life cycle costs of the military compensation system for the Armenian Army. The focus is on the structure of the Armenian Army peacekeeping brigade and incorporates the new, proposed professional NCO corps into a new rank and pay structure. The model allows the Armenians to adjust criteria to look at the cost implications of various manpower policy decisions. It also provides total compensation costs on an annualized basis, allowing policy makers to make informed budgeting decisions. The results show the costs at different manpower and rank mixes.

40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{debate has}} surrounded {{the issue of}} whether a fundamental transformation of employment relations is underway in both the industrialised and industrialising countries. Comparative studies at the national or macro-level of employment relations have been conducted within both an OECD group of countries (see Locke et al 1995) and newly industrialising economies (see Verma et al 1995). To these have been added complementary studies at the industry-level: in steel, telecommunications, banking and automobile manufacturing. These studies have adopted a broader similar analytical framework that focus on five sets of employment practices or issues, as follows: (1) the way work is organised (2) the process of skills acquisition and development (3) the structures and processes of <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> (4) staffing and employment security arrangements (5) enterprise governance and labour-management relations issues. The analytical framework adopted for these studies argues that employment practices are shaped by features of the external environment and the choices of firms, unions and governments, {{as well as by the}} broader institutional context at the industry and firm levels.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Talent commitment, {{efficiency}} and retention issues are {{emerging as the}} most important corporate challenges of the present and immediate future, driven by talent loyalty concerns, corporate reorganization efforts and stiff competition for key talent. For most organizations, “surprise” talent departures can be devastating on the execution of business strategy and the achievement of business goals and objectives. This phenomenon is most prevalent now in light of current economic uncertainty and following corporate downsizings when the risk of losing critical talent increases exponentially. Talent retention {{is one of the greatest}} challenges confronting many business organizations today. For most organizations talent recruitment and retention is a major concern as the ability to keep talent is crucial for the organization’s performance and future survival. It is recognized that talent turnover, is a critical challenge to most organizations that cost money, effort and energy. This challenge poses major problems to HR professionals in their efforts to formulate talent retention policies. South Africa has for the past few decades seen an influx of foreign investment, ideas and practices, facilitated by the development of the Internet and associated technologies. As with many organizations worldwide including organizations in South Africa, staff retention problems affect organizational productivity and performance. The global war for talent has increased the challenge to most organizations in attempting to address the issue of talent retention in the context of increasing competition in the global marketplace. It is against this background that this research will look into talent retention problems within the socio‐economic context of South Africa and in particular factors impacting on talent retention at Alexander Forbes as an organization.
