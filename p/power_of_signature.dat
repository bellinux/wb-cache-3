The use <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> {{on this kind of}} document has an obvious interest. Indeed, considering a raw vectorial description of the graphical layer of a technical document (e. g. a set of arcs and segments), signatures can be used to perform a pre-processing step before a "traditional" graphics recognition processing, or can be used to establish a classification that can be sufficient to feed a further indexation step. To compute vectorial signatures, we have based our approach on a method proposed by Etemadi et al., who study spatial relations between primitives to solve a vision problem. We considerer five types of relations, invariant to transformations like rotation or scaling, between neighboring segments: parallelism with or without overlapping, collinearity, L junctions and V junctions. A quality factor is computed for each of the relations, computable with low requirements <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> The <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> all models of symbols that could be found in a given document are computed and matched against the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the document, in order to determine what symbols the document is likely to contain.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a leading}} cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The recurrence of HCC after curative treatments is currently a major hurdle. Identification of subsets of patients with distinct prognosis provides an opportunity to tailor therapeutic approaches as well as to select the patients with specific sub-phenotypes for targeted therapy. Thus, the development of gene expression profiles to improve the prediction of HCC prognosis is important for HCC management. Although several gene signatures have been evaluated for the prediction of HCC prognosis, there is no consensus on the predictive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> these <b>signatures.</b> Using systematic approaches to evaluate these signatures and combine them with clinicopathologic information may provide more accurate prediction of HCC prognosis.

Aggregating geosocial check-ins of millions of users to the place type level leads to powerful temporal bands and signatures. In previous work these signatures have been used to estimate the place being visited based purely on the check-in time, to label uncategorized places based on their individual signature’s similarity to a type signature, and to mine POI categories and their hierarchical structure from the bottom-up.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of specific gene expression signature for distinguishing sample groups is a dominant field in cancer research. Although {{a number of}} tools {{have been developed to}} identify optimal gene expression <b>signatures,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> genes obtained is often overly large to be applied clinically. Furthermore, experimental verification is sometimes limited by the availability of wet-lab materials such as antibodies and reagents. A tool to evaluate the discrimination <b>power</b> <b>of</b> candidate genes is therefore in high demand by clinical researchers. Results Signature Evaluation Tool (SET) is a Java-based tool adopting the Golub's weighted voting algorithm as well as incorporating the visual presentation of prediction strength for each array sample. SET provides a flexible and easy-to-follow platform to evaluate the discrimination <b>power</b> <b>of</b> a gene <b>signature.</b> Here, we demonstrated the application of SET for several purposes: (1) for <b>signatures</b> consisting <b>of</b> a large number of genes, SET offers the ability to rapidly narrow down the number of genes; (2) for a given signature (from third party analyses or user-defined), SET can re-evaluate and re-adjust its discrimination power by selecting/de-selecting genes repeatedly; (3) for multiple microarray datasets, SET can evaluate the classification capability <b>of</b> a <b>signature</b> among datasets; and (4) by providing a module to visualize the prediction strength for each sample, SET allows users to re-evaluate the discrimination power on mis-grouped or less-certain samples. Information obtained from the above applications could be useful in prognostic analyses or clinical management decisions. Conclusion Here we present SET to evaluate and visualize the sample-discrimination ability of a given gene expression signature. This tool provides a filtration function for signature identification and lies between clinical analyses and class prediction (or feature selection) tools. The simplicity, flexibility and brevity of SET could make it an invaluable tool for marker identification in clinical research. </p...|$|R

Identifying genes and pathways most essential to a signature performance may facilitate clinical application, provide insights into cancer progression, and uncover potentially new therapeutic targets. We previously developed a 17 -gene prognostic signature (HTICS) for HER 2 +:ERα- breast cancer patients, using genes that are differentially expressed in tumor initiating cells (TICs) versus non-TICs from MMTV-Her 2 /neu mammary tumors. Here we probed the pathways and genes that underlie the prognostic <b>power</b> <b>of</b> HTICS. We used Leave-One Out, Data Combination Test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Correlation and Substitution analyses together with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to identify critical biological pathways within HTICS.

A 6 -gene minimal Core that retained a significant prognostic power, albeit less than HTICS, also comprised the proliferation/immune/migration pathways.

The meta-assembly and review of published studies highlight the historical selection events, the role of underlying genes for various traits, limitations of the available bovine genomic resources and implications of using different methodologies. This study also developed another new method called composite selection signals (CSS) – to improve the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> selection <b>signature</b> scans – in which multiple pieces of evidence for selection derived from the rank distribution of individual tests are combined in a single score. CSS has shown improved power by localizing the genomic regions under selection for major traits in multi-breed panels of cattle and sheep. CSS was also used to detect regions associated with the complex trait of bovine stature and implicated 12 (nine were novel) regions harbouring multiple candidate genes in contrasting cohorts within the European and African cattle. Without phenotypic records on individual animals, the CSS method provides a firsthand scan of the genome to detect putative regions associated with complex traits. The genome-wide CSS scans for individual breeds (n = 60) of cattle using previously available and new genotypes from 50 K SNP chip assay identified 177 genomic regions under selection. Finally, an ultra-high density dataset (1. 6 million SNPs) was investigated with CSS for Angus and Holstein. A high (8 of 9) reproducibility of the 50 K SNPs based CSS regions and up to 14 fold additional genomic regions under selection were detected using 1. 6 million SNPs.

40|$|Improving {{application}} {{performance is}} a major challenge for computer architects. Two important reasons for it are the shift to multi-core architectures, which will no longer emphasize improvements in instruction-level parallelism, and long memory latencies. A versatile primitive for overcoming these obstacles is Speculative Tasking. With Speculative Tasking (ST), {{the outcome of a}} long or risky operation is assumed to be known, thereby allowing the execution of the following code section [...] - potentially in parallel [...] -by taking a hardware checkpoint and buffering the speculative state. Later, {{if it turns out that}} the assumption was incorrect, the hardware rolls back the whole section to the checkpoint and re-executes it transparently. ST has been studied in depth and has been shown to improve application performance. However, when applying ST to existing systems important problems and concerns become apparent. This dissertation considers three systems and three new problems facing Speculative Tasking. The first system studied is a checkpointed processor that uses a task to speculate past cache misses rather than stalling; if the speculation is successful, the processor can potentially hide the latency of the memory access and boost Memory-Level Parallelism (MLP). However, the boost in MLP substantially increases the number of in-flight memory operations to the extent that conventional memory hierarchies are unsuited to support them [...] - they need to be redesigned to support 1 - 2 orders of magnitude more outstanding misses. Yet, designing scalable MHAs is challenging: designs must minimize cache lock-up time and deliver high bandwidth while keeping the area consumption reasonable. Hence, a novel scalable MHA design for high-MLP processors is proposed that introduces two main innovations. First, it is hierarchical, with a small MSHR file per cache bank, and a larger MSHR file shared by all banks. Second, it uses a Bloom filter to reduce searches in the larger MSHR file. The result is a high-performance, area-efficient design. Compared to a state-of-the-art MHA on a high-MLP processor, the proposed design speeds-up some SPECint, SPECfp, and multiprogrammed workloads by a geometric mean of 32 %, 50 %, and 95 %, respectively. The second system studied is Speculative Multithreading (SM) on a Chip Multiprocessor (CMP). While it has the ability to speed-up hard-to-parallelize applications, the <b>power</b> inefficiency <b>of</b> aggressive speculation is a concern. To improve power efficiency, I note that not all the tasks that are running in such an environment are equally critical. To leverage these insights, a widely-applicable, novel task-criticality model for SM is developed for analyzing SM programs. Then, an architecture is proposed that (i) uses this model to analyze and predict the criticality of tasks in a SM application at run-time, and (ii) uses criticality to schedule tasks on a SM CMP for power efficient execution. Experiments with SPECint, SPECfp, and Olden show that CAP reduces E x D^ 2 by 9 %, 21 %, and 23 % on average respectively. Finally, recent proposals for Speculative Tasking have called for signatures in hardware to accelerate memory disambiguation. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> lie in their ability to represent a set of addresses concisely while allowing for set operations directly on the signatures. As a result, they make costly set operations cheap to perform in hardware. To take full advantage <b>of</b> <b>signatures,</b> this thesis presents SoftBulk, a novel architecture that exposes signatures to software directly through the instruction set. Using SoftBulk, programs can collect information about their own memory access patterns and use that information for a variety of purposes including code optimization and debugging...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{classification}} {{of breast cancer}} patients into risk groups provides {{a powerful tool for}} the identification of patients who will benefit from aggressive systemic therapy. The analysis of microarray data has generated several gene expression signatures that improve diagnosis and allow risk assessment. There is also evidence that cell proliferation-related genes have a high predictive power within these signatures. Methods: We thus constructed a gene expression signature (the DM signature) using the human orthologues of 108 Drosophila melanogaster genes required for either the maintenance of chromosome integrity (36 genes) or mitotic division (72 genes). Results: The DM signature has minimal overlap with the extant signatures and is highly predictive of survival in 5 large breast cancer datasets. In addition, we show that the DM signature outperforms many widely used breast cancer signatures in predictive power, and performs comparably to other proliferation-based signatures. For most genes <b>of</b> the DM <b>signature,</b> an increased expression is negatively correlated with patient survival. The genes that provide the highest contribution to the predictive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the DM <b>signature</b> are those involved in cytokinesis. Conclusion: This finding highlights cytokinesis as an important marker in breast cancer prognosis and as a possible targe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model by {{introducing}} fundamental economic factors in China (including {{the interest rate}} and deposit reserve rate) and the historical volatilities of targeted and US equity indices into the original model, which is a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict regime changes in financial markets. We then derive a general method to incorporate these selected factors {{in addition to the}} log-periodic <b>power</b> law <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> herding and compare the prediction accuracy of the critical time between the original and the new JLS models (termed the JLS-factor model) by applying these two models to fit two well-known Chinese stock indices in three bubble periods. The results show that the JLS-factor model with Chinese characteristics successfully depicts the evolutions of bubbles and “antibubbles” and constructs efficient end-of-bubble signals for all bubbles in Chinese stock markets. In addition, the results of standard statistical tests demonstrate the excellent explanatory <b>power</b> <b>of</b> these additive factors and confirm that the new JLS model provides useful improvements over the standard JLS model...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} "power signatures" as an {{important}} concept for building energy analysis. Power signatures are considered to contain "energy or <b>power</b> characteristics" <b>of</b> a building. Developing relationships between energy characteristics and building physical characteristics is seen as {{an important}} area for improvement of analytical tools for commercial and related buildings. Knowledge of the causes of variations in energy use, and the expected relative impacts of different schedules, functional uses, and energy systems, should be improved. A categorization of analysis methods is presented to define the parameters of interest for several currently used methods. Power signatures indicate building energy behavior with respect to time, so the parameters of interest are average power level and time of occurrence. Because a rate quantity (power) is used, comparisons between different time steps are practical. If practitioners could begin using power signature concepts to present energy use data on buildings, improved communication of results appears possible. Potential future study could be continued in several areas to improve the use <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>signatures</b> and energy analysis overall...|$|R
25|$|Berger's {{original}} classification also included non-positive-definite pseudo-Riemannian metric non-locally symmetric holonomy. That list consisted <b>of</b> SO(p,q) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (p, q), U(p, q) and SU(p, q) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (2p, 2q), Sp(p, q) and Sp(p, q)·Sp(1) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (4p, 4q), SO(n, C) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (n, n), SO(n, H) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (2n, 2n), split G2 <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (4, 3), G2(C) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (7, 7), Spin(4, 3) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (4, 4), Spin(7, C) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (7,7), Spin(5,4) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (8,8) and, lastly, Spin(9, C) <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> (16,16). The split and complexified Spin(9) are necessarily locally symmetric as above {{and should not}} have been on the list. The complexified holonomies SO(n, C), G2(C), and Spin(7,C) may be realized from complexifying real analytic Riemannian manifolds. The last case, manifolds with holonomy contained in SO(n, H), were shown to be locally flat by R. McLean.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis chapter tackles {{the problem}} of quality <b>of</b> online <b>signature</b> samples. Several works in the {{literature}} point out signature complexity and signature stability as main quality criteria for this behavioral biometric modality. The drawback of these works is the measurement of such criteria separately. In this study, we propose to analyze such criteria with a different unifying view, in terms of entropy-based measures. We consider signature complexity as the intrinsic disorder <b>of</b> a <b>signature</b> instance and variability as the intra-class disorder of a set <b>of</b> genuine <b>signatures.</b> We introduce a novel statistical measure <b>of</b> complexity for <b>signature</b> samples and analyze it relatively to Personal Entropy that we proposed in former works. We study the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> both measures for an automatic writer categorization on several databases. We show that such categories retrieve separately on one hand degraded data {{and on the other}} hand good quality signatures. Finally, the degradation <b>of</b> <b>signatures</b> due to mobile acquisition conditions is quantified by our entropy-based measure...|$|R
