40|$|The {{asynchronous}} {{transfer mode}} (ATM) handles cells of different classes in various ways to provide the different services with their respective quality of service requirements. To decrease the loss probability of high priority cells {{at the expense of}} cells with lower priorities, two loss priority schemes have been proposed in the literature: capped threshold and <b>push</b> <b>out.</b> Since throughput is slightly greater in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme while buffer management complexity increases when passing from threshold to <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> it seems natural to prefer the threshold scheme. A limitation of the removal depth in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme, called L <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> is proposed. The most attractive feature in limiting <b>push</b> <b>out</b> is the decrease of buffer management complexity, since {{only a small part of}} the buffer seems to be necessary to reach both loss rates (those of both the low and the high priority class) using the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> strategy. Approximation analysis was used for random traffic and simulations for bursty traffi...|$|R

40|$|ATM network handles {{cells of}} {{different}} classes {{in various ways}} {{in order to provide}} the different services with their respective QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. A possible way to provide this is to use buffers in nodes by giving priority to cells relating to the most demanding bearer capability. When time priority is used, the next cell to be transmitted, if more then one is waiting in a queue, is the one with highest priority. In order to decrease the loss probability of high priority cells at the expense of cells with lower priorities, two loss priority schemes have been proposed in literature: Threshold and <b>Push</b> <b>out.</b> Since throughput is slightly greater in the <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme while buffer management complexity increases when passing from threshold to <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> it seems natural to prefer the threshold scheme. In this paper a limiting removal depth in <b>push</b> <b>out</b> scheme called L <b>push</b> <b>out,</b> is proposed.

50|$|In this contest, {{each player}} tries to <b>push</b> his {{opponent}} <b>out</b> of the ring, {{through the back}} or {{the side of the}} circle. If a player falls to the ground, or he releases Suk, he is declared to be the loser. No player is to throw his opponent off balance by pulling the latter's rod. An expert player can skid or slide around within the circle, but the game or round is not won until a player is successfully <b>pushed</b> <b>out.</b> A round is considered as drawn if no player is <b>pushed</b> <b>out</b> of the circle. If all three rounds are drawn, a tie-breaker is declared, without any time limit, until a player is <b>pushed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

In such schemes, named OC <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (POC), OC Threshold <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (T-FQC) and Partitioned OC <b>Push</b> <b>out</b> (P-FQC), Handoff Calls (HC) and Originating Calls (OC) are both queued and a service selection policy based on {{measurement of the}} received signal MBPS, in addition the simpler FIFO policy has been used. The proposed strategies are studied by means of simulations for Merent percentages of HC, selected according to the radius of the cells. The performance achieved is superior with respect to classic schemes based on only HC queuing and to the Non Prioritized Scheme (NPS). ...|$|R
