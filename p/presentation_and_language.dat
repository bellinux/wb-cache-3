40|$|To {{have good}} {{acquisition}} and awareness in reading, the learners need {{a long and}} continuous process, and therefore, {{they are required to}} have autonomy in learning reading. This study aims to promote learner autonomy in reading class by combining learner-centered reading teaching and extensive reading teaching. Learner-centered reading teaching was carried out through group discussion, <b>presentation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> awareness activities. Meanwhile, extensive reading teaching was done to review the learners‘ materials in presentation and reinforce their acquisition. Those two different approaches were applied due to differences on learner's characteristics and needs. The result showed some success in the practice of autonomy, indicated by changes on learners' attitude. However, many learners showed that they focused more on obtaining score than on developing their language acquisition. By implementing the approach, the teacher can assist learners to be aware of their ability to learn independently and equip them with the skill needed for long-life learning. ...|$|E

An important means of encouraging good writing is the provision of good readers during the composition stage. A Swedish undergraduate course in English as a second language uses peer readers during the prewriting and revision stages. During prewriting, peer group work is used for brainstorming for ideas and for selecting, grouping, and organizing the ideas to make an outline. During revision of the first draft, peers respond helpfully to the ideas, <b>presentation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> in each other's essays. A survey found that most students reacted favorably to the use of peer group interaction, attributing changes in their own writing to the peer group sessions and providing suggestions to their classmates during those periods. A few felt they had not learned anything from the sessions. The technique encourages the students to resolve common and basic language errors early in the process and among themselves, enabling the teacher to concentrate on style and coherence; moreover, it is a useful practice for students planning to teach.

40|$|The study {{analyzed}} Nigerian newspaper {{coverage of}} militancy in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Content {{analysis was used}} to generate data for the study. Four purposively selected Nigerian national dailies: THISDAY, The Guardian, Vanguard, and The Sun published between January 1, 2006 and October 4, 2009 were content analyzed. The population was 5, 532 issues from where a sample of 553 was systematically selected. The units of analysis for the study include straight news, feature article, editorial opinion, interview, and letter to the editor that made reference to militancy in the Niger Delta. Coding was by two independent coders based on frequency, prominence, portrayal of militancy, format of <b>presentation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> of reports. The results showed that Nigerian Newspapers covered militancy in the Niger Delta in a fair, balanced and responsible manner, even though there were a few instances when confrontational languages slipped into reports. It also found that the dailies accorded low prominence to reports on militancy in the Niger Delta and did not endorse militancy as the preferred option for resolving the conflict in the region. Rather, they advocated a peaceful resolution of the conflict as is evident in the high score (77. 88 %) of the use of conciliatory tone in their reports. On the downside, the preponderance of straight news indicated that not much of conflict analysis and interpretative reporting was done in the coverage to help readers grasp thoroughly the dominant issues involved in militancy.

40|$|The {{segment of}} the {{population}} that is 65 years and older is undergoing rapid growth. With this growth, there is an increased need for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to treat cognitive-communicative disorders, most of which are age-related disorders secondary to neurologic disease. To do this effectively, SLPs require an understanding of how healthy aging affects cognition, memory and sensory processing. Although the interactions between sensory and cognitive processing are increasingly being investigated, little {{attention has been paid to}} the relationship between modality of information <b>presentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>language</b> comprehension in aging. Language comprehension is affected by component processes such as memory span and processing abilities, but to date there has been no systematic investigation of the effect of presentation modality on the processing of linguistic information across a number of tasks ranging in complexity. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of presentation modality on language processing. The secondary purposes of the study were to determine whether age affected performance on language processing measures, and whether adults can accurately predict if their performance was better in either the auditory or visual presentation condition. The effects of presentation modality were evaluated on four dependent measures: a digit span task, a word span task, a complex span task and a procedural instruction processing task. The participants were 37 older adults and 41 younger adults, matched for years of education and estimated verbal IQ. Three notable findings emerged from the study. First, both young and older adults recalled more information when it was presented in the auditory modality, regardless of the task. Second, age effects were present on all measures. Third, individuals were generally inaccurate in predicting which modality would result in better processing. Implications for the evaluation and treatment of older adults are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Provision of {{consumer}} information and patient education are considered {{an essential part}} of chronic disease management programmes developed for patients with heart failure. This study aimed to review the quality and availability {{of consumer}} information materials for people with heart failure in Australia. Methods The availability of consumer information was assessed through a questionnaire-based survey of the major organisations in Australia known, or thought, to be producing or using consumer materials on heart failure, including hospitals. The questionnaire was designed to explore issues around the use, production and dissemination of consumer materials. Only groups that had produced consumer information on heart failure were asked to complete the totality of the questionnaire. The quality of information booklets was assessed by using a standardised checklist. Results Of 101 organisations which were sent a questionnaire, 33 had produced 61 consumer resources on heart failure including 21 information booklets, 3 videos, 5 reminder fridge magnets, 7 websites, 15 self-management diaries and 10 self-management plans. Questionnaires were completed for 40 separate information resources. Most had been produced by hospitals or health services. Two information booklets had been translated into other languages. There were major gaps in the availability of these resources as {{more than half of the}} resources were developed in 2 of the 8 Australian states and territories, New South Wales and Victoria. Quality assessment of 19 information booklets showed that most had good <b>presentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>language.</b> Overall eight high quality booklets were identified. There were gaps in terms of topics covered, provision of references, quantitative information about treatment outcomes and quality and level of scientific evidence to support medical recommendations. In only one case was there evidence that consumers had been involved in the production of the booklets. Conclusion Key findings arising from the study included the need to develop a nationally coordinated approach for increasing the dissemination of information resources on heart failure. While the more recent publication of a booklet by the National Heart Foundation may have improved the situation, dissemination of written information materials may remain sub-optimal, especially among patients who are not enrolled in chronic heart failure management programmes. </p...|$|E

This is a research and development (R&D) study. It is mixed of the model presented by Borg and Gall with the systematic design of instruction by Dick and Carey. This study was conducted at Cipta Bhakti Husada Center and its branch. The data were collected using an interview guide, evaluation checklist, and questionnaires of teacher, students and expert responses. The needs analysis questionnaire was used to obtain the data about the students’ needs and the try-out questionnaire was used to gain information about the students’ agreement towards the materials. The data obtained were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of the target needs indicate that most students prefer to the topics related to desease, medicine, midwifery and hospital. The result of learning needs points out that materials and activities needed by the students are about nursing tasks and medical equipment. The material consists of four units. Each of the unit has two astabrata characters. First, I am Looking After You Today (conversation). It has earth characters which are helpful and caring, and stars characters which are precise and honest. Second, How are You Feeling Today (recount text). It has sun characters which are communicative, warm and emphaty, and wind characters which are curious and carefully. Third, Medical Equipment and Disease (procedure text) has fire characters which are firm and strict, and sea characters which are creative and innovative. Fourth, Congratulations! You are Allowed to Go Home Today (information report text). It has moon characters which are friendly and good looking, and cloud characters which are kind and wise. The unit has eight components: unit title, objectives, warm-up, main activities, summary, reflection, evaluation, and cultural value of astabrata. The first draft was validated by two experts. The first is culture expert to correct Astabrata. The second is curriculum, media, and English education expert to correct the whole material. The product is revised before it was tried out. The first try-out data of the second draft show that the draft is “good” because the average score is within the data interval 2. 52 - 3. 27.

40|$|Background: Outcome {{following}} Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is {{variable and}} there are only limited studies from India. Aim: The study aims to evaluate the predictors of functional outcome in a cohort of patients with ADEM. Setting: Tertiary-care teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Patients admitted with the diagnosis of ADEM from 1999 to 2004 have been included. Clinical features and radiological findings were evaluated. Functional outcome at discharge was scored using modified Rankin Scale and patients were followed up regularly. Statistical Analysis: Chi-Square test or Fisher&#x 2032;s exact test, and Student&#x 2032;s t test for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, respectively, and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Results: Sixty-one patients were evaluated (mean age 22 &# 177; 15. 9 years, 1 - 65). Fifty-two patients had preceding febrile illness or vaccination with mean 9. 1 &# 177; 12. 5 days interval to first neurological symptom. Non-specific febrile illnesses were the commonest trigger. Commonest findings were motor signs (n= 41), impaired consciousness (n= 33), bladder symptoms (n= 21), ataxia (n= 15), and seizures (n= 14). Between adult (mean age 30. 1 &# 177; 13. 1 years, 13 - 65, n= 38), and pediatric (mean age 6. 2 &# 177; 2. 8 years, 1 - 12, n= 23) patients, language disturbances were {{more common in the}} latter (P = 0. 047). MR imaging (n= 35) demonstrated lesions mostly in frontoparietal white matter (n= 23) and thalamus (n= 15). Nine patients expired.
