50|$|Printing was as for {{conventional}} screen printing. The screen {{and the paper}} to be printed were sandwiched in the Gocco <b>printing</b> <b>frame.</b> A squeegee was then used to work a viscous ink around the screen, passing through the mesh in the bare parts of the stencil and onto the paper.|$|E
50|$|Low density {{photographic}} negatives of {{the same}} size as the final image are used for exposing the print. No enlarger is used, but instead, a contact <b>printing</b> <b>frame</b> or vacuum exposure frame is used with an ultraviolet light source such as a mercury vapor lamp, a common fluorescent black light, or the sun. The negative is sandwiched between the prepared paper and a sheet of glass in registration with previous passes.|$|E

50|$|Often {{however, they}} are used {{with one of the}} {{alternative}} processes such as Inkodye or cyanotype. In these cases digital negatives are most commonly printed full-size to create contact prints.

They {{can also be used to}} create positives (where the initial digital file is not inverted) to make positives on emulsions such as collodion processes.|$|E

25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the <b>frames</b> were <b>printed</b> first {{and it is the}} planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is so far off center that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to <b>print</b> the <b>frames.</b> The Smithsonian's National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of <b>printed</b> <b>frames</b> was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|R

50|$|Contact {{printing}} {{machines are}} more elaborate devices {{than the more}} familiar and widely available contact <b>printing</b> <b>frames.</b> They typically combine in a box the light source, intermediate glass stages, and a final glass stage for the negative and paper to be placed upon, {{as well as an}} elastic pressure plate to keep the negative and the paper in tight contact. Dodging can be accomplished by placing fine tissue paper on the intermediate glass stages between the light source and the negative/paper sandwich to modify the exposure locally. The benefit to such time intensive techniques is the ability to then make multiple prints with negligible variation, at full production speed.|$|R

The book-object is a work that is a book, an art object, an exhibition and a catalogue, all at once.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{characteristic}} features of the book indicating that it was printed using movable type, such as the gaps between the perimeter lines at the corners, and between the centre fold lines and the top and bottom perimeter lines, this being due to the <b>print</b> <b>frame</b> being made of loose pieces of wood rather being carved from a single block of wood {{as is the case with}} woodblock printing. [...] Even more tellingly, characters are sometimes inverted, which is typical of books printed with movable type, but cannot accidentally occur in woodblock editions. [...] That it was printed using wooden type rather than clay type is indicated by the occasional presence of uneven lines between the columns of characters, which were left by bamboo strips used to set the wooden type (but which were not used for setting clay type).|$|R

50|$|It is {{a typical}} New Order release—the sleeve of the CD has no printed {{information}} of its contents and the outer cover has two photographs, one {{on the front and}} one on the back. The front cover shows Peter at his drawing board, whereas the back shows a screen <b>print</b> <b>frame</b> for the Peter Saville Show exhibition poster. The inner sleeve (made of a slightly lighter weight card) shows two photographs (one on front and one on back) of the exhibition artwork in preparation. The disc itself states that The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack was written and produced by New Order and mixed by Merv De Peyer. It also states that the design and photography was by the Graphic Thought Facility. The only indication of a catalogue number is shown on the reverse (shiny) side of the disc. Around the centre hole clearly reads 'DISCTRONICS' and 'SAVILLE 1 01'.|$|R
50|$|The 220 format was {{introduced}} in 1965 and is the same width as 120 film, but with about double the length of film and thus {{twice the number of}} possible exposures per roll. Unlike 120 film, however, there is no backing paper behind the film itself, just a leader and a trailer. This results in a longer film on the same spool, but there are no <b>printed</b> <b>frame</b> numbers. Moreover, it cannot be used in unmodified old cameras that have a red window as frame indicator. Also, since the film alone is thinner than a film with a backing paper, a special pressure plate may be required to achieve optimal focus if the film is registered against its back side. Some cameras capable of using both 120 and 220 film will have a two position adjustment of the pressure plate (e.g. the Pentax 6x7, Mamiya C220 or Mamiya C330) while others will require different film backs e.g. the Pentax 645 or Kowa Six).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} provide {{anthropomorphic}} robotic hands with adequate frictional contact and proper tactile sensing during dexterous manipulation {{it is necessary to}} develop artificial skin that is easy-to-implement and compatible with existing designs of robotic hands. In this paper, we detail the design of a set of artificial skin pads that can accommodate a complex surface topology for a variety of robotic hands. The multilayered artificial skin is composed of deformable thermoplastic, 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>frame,</b> force sensing tactile element (sensel), and a silicon rubber epidermis. The prototyping process makes the most of 3 D printing technology, and takes important factors such as maintainability and modification into consideration. A unique design for the thumb web is proposed, a crucial component for stabilizing tools and trigger operated tasks. We also address the importance of biomimetically replicating the tapered fingertip of the human hand based on an analysis of stiffness at distal joints of a robotic hand while performing a precision grip. Overall, we show our skin design to be cost-effective and flexible to design constraints. I...|$|R
