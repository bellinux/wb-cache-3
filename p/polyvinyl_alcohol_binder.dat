Such pellets of MIL- 53 (Al) were produced using a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>binder.</b> As revealed by N 2 adsorption isotherms, {{the use of}} polyvinyl alcohol as binder results in a loss in overall capacity of 32 %. Separations of binary mixtures in breakthrough experiments were successfully performed at pressures varying between 1 and 8 bar and different mixture compositions. The binary adsorption isotherms reveal a preferential adsorption of CO 2 compared to CH 4 over the whole pressure and concentration range. The separation selectivity was affected by total pressure; below 5 bar, a constant selectivity, with an average separation factor of about 7 was observed. Above 5 bar, the average separation factor decreases to about 4. The adsorption selectivity is affected by breathing of the framework and specific interaction of CO 2 with framework hydroxyl groups.

In this research, submicron alumina powders, AKP- 30 were deposited on the porous alumina tube support containing approximately 40 % porosity by dip coating. The effects of solid loading, dispersant, and binder system on colloidal process were evaluated. It was found that the thickness of membrane layer depend on the type of binders (latex binder, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>binder,</b> and poly (ethylene oxide) polymer binder) and dipping time when the withdrawal speed was constant. The proper suspension of 30 wt. % AKP- 30 alumina powder with 18. 8 wt. % latex binder provided proper sintered membrane without cracking or delaminating. The porosity and average pore size of coating layer was about 29 % and 0. 06 µm, respectively at a sintering temperature of 1400 ºC for 2 hr.

40|$|Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEO) are commercially {{available}} non-ionic surfactants that, {{along with the}} parent nonylphenol (NP), {{are considered to be}} possible endocrine disrupters. NP and NPEO are resistant to conventional aerobic biological water treatment systems. Alternatives to this technology are sought to remove these and other bio-resistant compounds from wastewaters. Composites of the photocatalyst, TiOi, and activated carbon (AC) adsorbents have been prepared, characterised and applied as adsorbents and photocatalysts in removal of phenols and NPEO from aqueous solution. Two methods were utilised to prepare of TiO 2 /C composites. AC was coated with TiO 2 derived from the hydrolysis of Ti(OPr') 4, and with Degussa P 25 using a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>binder</b> that was subsequently carbonised in an inert atmosphere. The TiO 2 /C composites were characterised by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-visible reflectance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The AC and TiO 2 /C adsorption capacity for phenol was observed to be affected by the surface area and surface chemistry of the adsorbent, as well as the pH of solution. The NPEO adsorption capacity and rate of adsorption was found to be dependant on the pore size distribution of the adsorbent. The effect of surface chemistry and solution pH was minimal. The selectivity of the adsorbent in the adsorption of NPEO was studied using HPLC. The rate of photooxidation of phenol was found to be first-order and greatest under basic conditions. This is attributed to changes in the electronic structure of the TiO 2 under these conditions that increases the rate of reduction of molecular oxygen, often considered to be the rate limiting step. Photodegradation of NPEO led to the aggregation and sedimentation of TiOz particles.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} scale process developed by Navarro [Navarro, 2001] {{for the production}} of pyroelectric ceramics was used as a case study for the design of a high-level methodology for the scale-up of ceramic processes. A twofold approach was adopted as the basis of the methodology to perform the process scale-up. A "process focussed" approach was used that considered the sequence of processing operations, their feasibility on a larger scale and the potential problems foreseeable for a scaled-up process. Secondly, a "product focussed" approach analysed the quality of the product in respect to the customer requirements (the specifications). This approach also concerned the analysis of the process potential to perform within an essential tolerance interval. This aim was pursued {{through the use of a}} statistical technique, the Statistical Process Control. With the product focussed approach, the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the wafers obtained with the {{laboratory scale}} process were compared with the industrial requirements. The ceramic wafers possessed satisfactory characteristics except for their strength. The processing parameters were investigated in order to optimise the sintered ceramic microstructure and to understand their relative influence on the achievement of adequate characteristics for allowing handling and machining. Sintered density and grain size were studied as functions of green density and firing temperature. Increasing the green density from the original 37 % to approximately 65 % of the theoretical density by means of warm pressing allowed the wafers to achieve a more homogeneous microstructure and a higher sintered density up to approximately 97 % of the theoretical. Thanks to the increase in green density, the sintering temperature could be reduced by 100 °C and the total sintering time was shortened by 190 minutes. The samples produced with warm pressing were more resistant as 75 % of them survived during the poling and machining test, in contrast with the 5 % of the original samples. The suitability of the warm pressing technique to increase the green density up to 5 g. cm 3 (61 % of the theoretical density) was investigated by means of the statistical process control tool. A correct design of the press equipment was judged the most relevant factor for determining the control and the capability of the process. A rheological study was directed to understand how the slurry ingredients influenced the ceramic suspension, the green tape density and morphology. Two preparation routes were compared in order to discriminate among the effects induced by the electrosteric dispersant and the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>binder</b> on the PZT particles suspension. It was shown how the dispersant influenced both the suspension characteristics and the comminution efficiency of the milling. The binder was shown to adsorb onto the ceramic particles. A model was proposed describing the interaction among ingredients which suggested that the adsorbing polymer induced particles flocculation by bridging mechanism, especially when added to stabilised slurries. As a result, PVA was judged inappropriate for tape casting of this PZT powder as it yielded low green density tapes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Effect of m-ZrO 2 (2 %- 5 % in mass) on sintering behavior and thermal shock resistance of Cr 2 O 3 material was investigated.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} involved {{in the development of}} holography is that of the recording material used. In this study the behavior of a photopolymer is analyzed when thicknesses greater than 100 μm are used. The photopolymer is made up of acrylamide as monomer, triethanolamine as radical generator, yellowish eosin as sensitizer and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> as <b>binder.</b> The main problem is that an increase in thickness produces more scattering and consequently a decrease in the diffraction efficiency. In this study we analyzed the influence of the concentration of monomer on scattering and found that an increase in the concentration reduces scattering. The behavior of the material varies as the concentration of acrylamide is increased. Two polymerization mechanisms compete and so the behavior of the photopolymer is not linear, the reaction is slower and the expected maximum efficiency is not reached. It has been demonstrated experimentally that when the recording intensity is reduced the photopolymer behaves in a linear way.

Coating pigment pore and {{particle size distribution}} are the key parameters that influence in modifying media surface properties, thus affecting the rate of ink penetration and drying time (Schölkopf, et al. 2004). The primary objective of this study was: (1) to investigate the synthetic zeolite pigment effects on inkjet ink absorption, dynamic contact angle and printability, and (2) to evaluate these novel synthetic zeolite pigments in replacing the fumed silica pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings. In this research study, single pigment coating formulations (in equal P:B ratio) were prepared using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments (5 A, Organophilic and 13 X) and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PVOH) <b>binder.</b> The laboratory-coated samples were characterized for absorption, air permeance, roughness, drying time, wettability and print fidelity. Based on the rheological data, {{it was found that}} the synthetic zeolite formulated coatings depicted a Newtonian flow behavior at low shear; while the industry accepted fumed silica based coatings displayed a characteristically high pseudoplastic flow behavior. Our coated samples generated using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments produced low absorption, reduced wettability and accelerated ink drying characteristics. These characteristics were caused due to the synthetic zeolite pigments, which resulted in relatively closed surface structure coated samples. The research suggested that no single selected synthetic zeolite coating performed better than the conventional fumed silica based coatings. Experimental data also showed that there was no apparent relationship between synthetic zeolite pigment pore sizes and inkjet ink absorption. For future research, above coated samples should be evaluated for pore size distribution using Mercury Porosimeter, which quantifies surface porosity of coated samples. This presented approach can be easily used for investigating other such microporous coating pigments in formulating inkjet receptive coating. The research findings will benefit the coating formulators, engineers and material science students, in understanding the absorption characteristics of selected synthetic zeolite pigments thereby encouraging them in identifying other such alternative pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings...|$|R

40|$|Dehydro-thermal {{treatments}} for 3, 24 and 72 h {{were used to}} crosslink blends of collagen and <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> with various compositions. This crosslinking method increases the biological stability in vitro of collagen, as was established by an enzymatic test. When the <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> content is not more than 20 % the resistance of collagen to enzymatic digestion is not affected {{by the presence of}} the synthetic component. A higher content of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> produces a steric hindrance screening that enhances the resistance of collagen to the collagenase. Dehydro-thermal treatment performed for 24 and 72 h increases the crystallinity of <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol),</b> thus reducing the solubility of this component of the blend. Calorimetric analysis was carried out by differential scanning calorimetry to investigate the structure and the thermal stability of the blends. Dehydro-thermal treatments carried out for 24 and 72 h induce high degrees of crosslinking in collagen and high crystallinity in <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol).</b> The two components of the blend seem to create independent structures and the blend can show interpenetrating-network-like behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of treated cellulose with different bleaching conditions on the <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> matrix. Cellulose was extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunch fibre through chlorite bleaching, alkali treatment and acid hydrolysis. A casting technique was employed to prepare <b>poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> /fibre composites. <b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> composites with various loadings of cellulose were prepared by using the treated cellulose with 8 hours bleaching. Composite films were characterised by thermogravimetric analysis and UV/Vis spectrometry. Higher loading of the treated cellulose into PVA composite resulted in a lower decomposition temperature, and a relatively better transmission in the range of visible light. <b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> reinforced cellulose with a longer bleaching period allowed higher transmittance of light because of more lignin removed. <b>Poly(vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> composites reinforced with treated cellulose gave better thermal stability without differing much its clarity compared to the pure PVA...|$|R
