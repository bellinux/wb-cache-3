50|$|The DVD release {{does not}} include any deleted scenes. At least two scenes were filmed that {{did not make the}} final cut. In one, Tara sees her mother flirting at a roller rink. This scene might have given more insight into why Tara carries roller skates with her and Joleen's motivations for running <b>off.</b> <b>Brief</b> clips of this scene can be viewed on the {{official}} movie trailer. Two stills from the movie's official website depict Tara and James in a colorful room with a piano, sunflowers, and streamers.
