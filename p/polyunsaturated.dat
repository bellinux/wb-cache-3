5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by <b>polyunsaturated</b> vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much <b>polyunsaturated</b> fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced <b>polyunsaturated</b> peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (<b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 alleles are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor alleles of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 alleles, especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiesel}} {{produced from}} {{the processing of}} microalgae differs from other forms of biodiesel {{in the content of}} <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats. <b>Polyunsaturated</b> fats are known for their ability to retain fluidity at lower temperatures. While this may seem like an advantage in production during the colder temperatures of the winter, the <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats result in lower stability during regular seasonal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|By {{metabolizing}} the ω-3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} and docosahexaenoic acid, into 17-HpDHA, 17-HDHA, and the resolvins and protectins, 15-LOX-1's metabolic action {{is thought to}} be one mechanism by which dietary ω-3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, particularly fish oil, act to ameliorate inflammation, inflammation-related diseases, and certain cancers.|$|E
25|$|Marine omega-3 <b>polyunsaturated</b> {{fatty acids}} appear {{to reduce the}} risk. High {{consumption}} of soy-based foods may reduce risk.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid {{levels in the}} blood, and intervention studies of <b>polyunsaturated</b> fat supplementation concludes that the findings ″do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.″ Researchers acknowledged that despite their results, further research is necessary, especially in people who are initially healthy. Until the picture becomes clearer, experts recommend people stick to the current guidelines on fat consumption.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 73% of {{the energy}} in hemp seeds {{is in the form}} of fats and {{essential}} fatty acids, mainly <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, linoleic, oleic and alpha-linolenic acids.|$|E
25|$|A {{vegetarian}} diet which is poorly planned {{can lead to}} hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of vitamin B 12 and <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids.|$|E

25|$|Walnut oil is {{composed}} mostly of <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, although it also contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat and 31% of total fat is saturated fat.|$|E
25|$|While {{many studies}} have found that {{including}} <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats in the diet in place of saturated fats produces more beneficial CVD outcomes, the effects of substituting monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates are unclear.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, oils high in {{saturated}} fats, such as avocado oil, {{have relatively}} long shelf lives {{and can be}} safely stored at room temperature, as the low <b>polyunsaturated</b> fat content facilitates stability.|$|E
25|$|ALOX15 (also termed arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, 15-lipoxygenase-1, 15-LO-1, 15-LOX-1) is, {{like other}} lipoxygenases, a seminal enzyme in the {{metabolism}} of <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids {{to a wide}} range of physiologically and pathologically important products.|$|E
25|$|Although {{omega-3 fatty}} acids, which are <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids (PUFA), are a popular {{treatment}} {{for children with}} ASD, {{there is very little}} high-quality scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness, and further research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Both crunchy/chunky {{and smooth}} peanut butter are sources of {{saturated}} (primarily palmitic acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly oleic acid as 47% of total fat, and <b>polyunsaturated</b> fat (28% of total fat), primarily as linoleic acid).|$|E
25|$|Isofurans are non-enzymatically formed dervatives of <b>polyunsaturated</b> {{fatty acids}} that possess a Furan ring structure; they are studied as markers of {{oxidative}} stress.

25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with <b>polyunsaturated</b> and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{efficacy}} of n−3 long-chain <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis decreases down the cascade of α-linolenic acid conversion, DHA synthesis from α-linolenic acid is even more restricted than that of EPA. Conversion of ALA to DHA is higher in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|Both human ALOX15 and ALOX15B {{genes are}} located on {{chromosome}} 17; their product proteins have an amino acid sequence identity of only ~38%; they also differ in the <b>polyunsaturated</b> fatty acids that they prefer as substrates and exhibit different product profiles when acting on the same substrates.|$|E
25|$|In a 2017 {{comprehensive}} {{review of the literature}} and clinical trials, the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats, a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.|$|E
25|$|A {{guideline}} for {{the appropriate}} amount of fat—a component of daily food consumption—is established by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration. The recommendation is that 10% or fewer of daily calories should be from saturated fat, and 20-35% of total daily calories {{should come from}} <b>polyunsaturated</b> and monounsaturated fats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA {{sponsored}} scientific research on a plant-based food source that could generate oxygen and nutrition on long-duration space flights.

25|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the fatty acids in the body are obtained from the diet, in the form of triglycerides of either animal or plant origin. The fatty acids in the fats obtained from land animals tend to be saturated, whereas the fatty acids in the triglycerides of fish and plants are often <b>polyunsaturated</b> and therefore present as oils.|$|E
25|$|Refined oils high in {{monounsaturated}} fats, such as macadamia oil, keep up to a year, {{while those}} high in <b>polyunsaturated</b> fats, such as soybean oil, keep about six months.
