This paper documents iceberg data collected during the experiments, which include above water dimensions and <b>underwater</b> <b>profiles,</b> temperature profiles and samples of iceberg ice from the contact zone for microstructural analysis. The characteristic iceberg dimensions were scaled from photographs based on the measured range from the camera to the iceberg. The lengths of the icebergs impacted ranged from 4 to 73 m. A multibeam sonar was attached to the side of an auxiliary vessel and used to profile the icebergs during the impact experiment. Iceberg temperatures measured using a thermistor probe ranged from near zero at the surface to a minimum of - 15. 4 0 C at 60 cm into the core of the iceberg. Iceberg mass was stimated from photographs of profile and oblique views as well as <b>underwater</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained using the multibeam sonar.

40|$|UV {{radiation}} at 4 wavelengths (305, 320, 340 and 380 nm) and PAR {{were measured}} from May 1994 to October 1999 using Biospherical UV-radiometers. A surface reference sensor {{located on the}} roof of the Marine Station at Helgoland recorded values every 5 min, and an equivalent <b>profiling</b> <b>underwater</b> sensor was used for measurements in the sea at approximately monthly intervals. The ratio of 305 nm radiation to PAR varied seasonally, with a 14 -fold increase from winter to summer. A much weaker seasonal trend (c. 1. 5 -fold) was apparent in the ratio of 320 nm radiation to PAR, but there was no seasonal trend in the ratios of 340 or 380 nm radiation to PAR. The year-to-year variations in 305 nm radiation were also much greater relative to PAR than for the other UV wavelengths, but there was no evidence of a change in the 305 :PAR ratio over the study period. The ratios of both 305 and 320 nm radiation to PAR increased from dawn to midday, but those of 340 and 380 nm radiation were almost constant through the day, except shortly before sunrise and after sunset when the proportions of 340 and 380 nm radiation increased. Underwater measurements of PAR and UV suggest that the 1 % depth for 305 nm radiation was little more than 1 m, but this estimate is valid only for summer and autumn because, in other seasons, few reliable readings for 305 nm radiation could be obtained underwater, and no attenuation coefficient could be calculated. The 1 % depths recorded for the other UV wavelengths in the middle 6 months of the year were 2. 0 m for 320 nm, 2. 6 m for 340 nm and 4. 6 m for 380 nm, compared with 12 m for PAR, but the attenuation of all wavebands increased sharply in October and remained higher until March. An analysis of the influence of sun angle, total column ozone concentration, the proportion of skylight, and cloud cover on the ratio of UV-wavelengths to PAR in surface irradiance demonstrated that solar angle has a greater influence than ozone concentration on the irradiance at 305 nm, and that the typical occurrence of ozone "holes" in spring may not result in higher UV-B irradiances than occur under higher ozone concentrations in summer. The implications of the data for attempts to model the biological effects of natural UV-radiation on marine organisms are considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Most {{recent work}} in {{underwater}} network development {{has relied on}} using expensive commercial acoustic modems or on building custom transceivers for each application to establish acoustic communication links among the sensors. Using commercial modems or designing custom hardware may require prohibitive monetary or time investment for many applications. Our work proposes the design of software acoustic modems that can utilize built-in microphones and speakers on the relatively cheap Tmote Invent platforms. The built-in Tmote hardware and the software modem enable acoustic communication in a short range shallow water network. In this paper, we present the initial design and architecture of our acoustic communication system which targets environmental monitoring applications. Our experiments with generic acoustic hardware to <b>profile</b> this <b>underwater</b> communication channel reveal that the channel favors frequencies below 3 Khz, a result which guides the design choices for our FSK software modem. We perform experiments with our software modem/generic hardware system to explore the system’s data transfer capability.

50|$|History. Diving in the Canadian Army {{began in}} the 1960s when, {{as a result of}} the {{introduction}} of amphibious vehicles, it was essential to provide a diving capability to the safety organization for the swimming of the vehicles. Amphibious operations also required a better capability for the <b>underwater</b> reconnaissance of <b>crossing</b> sites. Following trials in 1966, diving sections were established in engineer units in 1969. Once the diving capability was established, additional tasks were added to make combat diving an extension of combat engineering into the water. Other tasks such as obstacle construction and breaching, employing and detecting landmines and limited underwater construction were added to the safety standby and reconnaissance tasks.|$|R

We provide the background of GPS techniques that have been used to gather data for wildlife studies. We review how GPS has been integrated into functional systems with data storage, data transfer, power supplies, packaging and sensor technologies to collect temperature, activity, proximity and mortality data from terrestrial species and birds. GPS ‘rapid fixing’ technologies combined with sensors provide location, dive frequency and duration <b>profiles,</b> and <b>underwater</b> acoustic information for the study of marine species. We examine how these rapid fixing technologies may be applied to terrestrial and avian applications. We discuss positional data quality and the capability for high-frequency sampling associated with GPS locations. We present alternatives for storing and retrieving data by using dataloggers (biologging), radio-frequency download systems (e. g. very high frequency, spread spectrum), integration of GPS with other satellite systems (e. g. Argos, Globalstar) and potential new data recovery technologies (e. g. network nodes). GPS is one component among many rapidly evolving technologies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and overview of bergy bit impact trials {{carried out on}} the CCGS Terry Fox off {{the northern tip of}} the island of Newfoundland in June 18 - 23, 2001. The trial consisted of impacting target iceberg ice masses ranging from roughly 30 t (growlers) to 22, 000 t (bergy bits) on an instrumented bow area of the 'Terry Fox' at various forward speeds. Parameters measured included impact forces, pressure and contact areas, ship motions with six degrees of freedom, ship forward speed, and ambient environmental factors. In addition, extensive video and photographic records were compiled, including stereo photographs of the bergy bits. Furthermore, a multi-beam sonar was used to determine <b>underwater</b> <b>profiles</b> of some of the targeted ice massed.

40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{determination}} of underwater irradiance in PAR {{region of the}} spectrum are con-sidered: (1) measurements in situ (alternative possibility is theoretical calculations using spectral values of radiation) (2) computations using the depth-averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient (mean value for PAR region), (3) computations using depth-dependent diffuse attenuation coefficient. The results by methods (1) and (2) are compared for optically homogeneous water column (model calculations), the methods (1), (2) and (3) are compared using in situ measurements in Estonian and Finnish lakes and corresponding calculations.
