40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the design}} of high-power induction motor with special constraints. Direct online start-up and <b>pull-up</b> <b>torque</b> of rather high value represent two of the imposed requirements. Three different structures are analyzed, which involve deep bars, magnetic wedges and double cage respectively. The proposed solution advances a new rotor structure with two different rotor cages. The first cage acts mainly during start-up and is made of iron with both electric and magnetic properties. The second one is made of copper and represents the main rotor winding. It has a particular cross-section of the bars in order to carry into effect the required constraints both during start-up and steady-state. The proposed models are finally evaluated by means of finite element method analysis...|$|E
