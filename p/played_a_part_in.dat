5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a {{peace treaty}} was agreed {{with one of the}} raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 9th century, Leo V reintroduced {{the policy of}} iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora {{restored}} the veneration of icons {{with the help of}} Patriarch Methodios. Iconoclasm <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called Photian schism, when Pope Nicholas I challenged the elevation of Photios to the patriarchate.|$|E
5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken {{little interest in the}} property.

5|$|The season {{closed with}} {{the defeat of}} Tulane by a score of 21–0. The Colonels were favored, and McMillin <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> all of the scoring plays. He threw {{touchdown}} passes to Bartlett and to Snoddy, and ran one score in himself. He also kicked all the extra points.|$|E
5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E
5|$|An {{expedition}} to Ross by King William {{and his brother}} Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald's activities. Two years later the rebellion of Domnall, son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim, broke out in Ross and Moray, and it is presumed that Earl Harald <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> this. The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187.|$|E

5|$|Battleships <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans {{used their}} battleships as {{independent}} commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, {{and most of}} the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the genetic}} {{strength}} of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced {{the development of the}} Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești debuted as {{a writer}} and {{political}} essayist. It was later reported, but not confirmed, that he published his pieces in newspapers and magazines of diverse backgrounds—Le Figaro, Le Gaulois, Gil Blas, L'Intransigeant and La Libre Parole among them. A lover and protector of actresses in both France and Switzerland, he also claimed to have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> staging the first Genevan showing of Richard Wagner's Die Walküre.|$|E

5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva had <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> uncovering the conspiracy, {{perhaps in a}} fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{the victory}} over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay {{as a place to}} construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men by creating an obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, his son Pierre Bouchard, also a defenceman, {{played for}} the Montreal Canadiens. While father Émile participated in {{the birth of the}} Montreal Canadiens' dynasty, thirty years later son Pierre <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{continuing}} the Canadien dynasty into the 1970s. With Butch's four and Pierre's five they have the distinction of winning the most Stanley Cups of any father-son combination in NHL history.

5|$|Keynsham <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the Civil War as the Roundheads {{saved the}} town and also camped there for the night, using the pub {{now known as the}} Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Later sources {{suggest that}} {{perceptions}} of legitimacy <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the arguments, {{as did the}} relative age of the two candidates. In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames, most likely in 975. There {{is evidence that the}} settlement involved a degree of compromise. Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, the biography of Roy Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesian pilots <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> {{the siege}} of Malta during 1942. John Plagis, a Rhodesian airman of Greek ancestry, joined the {{multinational}} group of Allied airmen defending the strategically important island in late March and on 1 April achieved four aerial victories in an afternoon, thereby becoming the siege's first Spitfire flying ace. By {{the time of his}} withdrawal in July he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 World Championship was {{the final}} IndyCar race for Davey Hamilton, Alex Lloyd, Vitor Meira, Danica Patrick, Buddy Rice, Tomas Scheckter, and Paul Tracy. For some drivers, they had planned to retire or move onto other racing at season's end. For others Wheldon's crash <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> the {{decision}} to retire or move onto other forms of racing. Finally for some, they were simply unable to secure an IndyCar race seat in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E
