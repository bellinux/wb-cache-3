Her parents met while {{attending}} Idaho State University in Pocatello. Her <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> their parents before them, had a love of language and song which they passed to their children. Her father worked for the highway department and the family often travelled {{with him as he}} did field work.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the cases}} in which the Court had allowed a {{religious}} motivation to exempt a person from a neutral, generally applicable law involved the assertion of both the right of free exercise along with some other right. Thus, religious publishers are exempt from a law requiring them to obtain a license if that license may be denied to any publisher the government deems nonreligious. The government may not tax religious solicitors. The government may not require the Amish {{to send their children to}} school because their religion demands otherwise, and Amish <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> all parents, have the right to direct the education of their children. Because Smith and Black were not asserting a hybrid right, they could not claim a religious exemption under the First Amendment from Oregon's ban on peyote.|$|E
25|$|As Emma and Hook {{return to}} the present day, Emma admits that her home is in Storybrooke and {{that she has been}} {{treating}} her <b>parents</b> <b>like</b> acquaintances for too long. Emma returns home and gives them a big hug and calls them mom and dad for the second time. Mary Margaret and David tell her that they are naming their new son Prince Neal in honor of Emma's first love and Gold's son who saved them all from Zelena. That evening, Hook tells Emma that he traded the Jolly Roger for a magic bean so he could bring her back to Storybrooke. Realizing this is the ultimate expression of Hook's feelings, Emma finally gives him a passionate kiss. Also that night, Gold and Belle are officially married, watched over by Belle's father Moe French and ordained minister Archie Hopper.|$|E

500|$|Many Northern cities {{also had}} de facto {{segregation}} policies, {{which resulted in}} a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built {{since the turn of the}} century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped stimulate activism among African-American <b>parents</b> <b>like</b> Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Browns principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first freedom schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of white flight, however.) ...|$|E
500|$|... is the {{daughter}} of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. She seems to have inherited traits from both her <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> her mother's [...] verbal tic and her father's aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge certain people, but she is not above commending them when they truly deserve it. Sarada is a central character of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada felt hurt and betrayed when she suspects being Karins's biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family {{is not a matter of}} blood, Sarada later learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin explained that she was Sakura's midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage one day. She finds Boruto annoying, but is later hinted to have a mutual crush on him. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese. While in the English version, she is voiced by Laura Bailey in , and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging <b>parents</b> <b>like</b> old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy {{also won}} acclaim {{for a series}} of stage roles. In 1971 he played the {{starring}} role of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof, which toured for eight weeks. Nimoy, who had performed in the Yiddish theater as a young man, said the part was like a [...] "homecoming" [...] for him, explaining that his <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> Tevye, also came from a shtetl in Russia and could relate to the play when they saw him in it. Later that year he starred as Arthur Goldman in The Man in the Glass Booth at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|The writing staff {{wanted to}} touch {{on the fact that}} even though Clark has all of these powers he cannot save everyone, as well as {{expanding}} on the idea of Clark’s continual feeling of isolation. [...] "Asylum" [...] served to remind Clark that he cannot save everyone when he fails to stop Lionel from giving Lex electric shock therapy, which ultimately erases seven weeks of Lex’s memory that includes his knowledge that Lionel murdered his own <b>parents.</b> <b>Like</b> season two’s [...] "Ryan", Clark is faced with the reality that he is not [...] "God", and that he will fail to save people from time to time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commentary}} of John Wesley on the commandment to honour {{father and}} mother {{is consistent with the}} interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged <b>parents.</b> <b>Like</b> the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, [...] "Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?" [...] This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.|$|E

2500|$|Lucky's rich life {{experience}} for his young age makes him wise beyond his years. He plays cons {{with his parents}} and is always {{able to make a}} quick get away; in his introduction storyline, he travels from Canada to Port Charles on his own when his parents have to send him ahead for safety. He later is able to stay one step ahead of his parents when he and his friend Emily Quartermaine (then Tamblyn) briefly run away. He has a loving relationship with his unconventional parents, who often treat him as a friend and peer, especially his father. Luke in turn looks to see himself in Lucky, and the two have a very close bond. In 1995, Jackson described to the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Lucky lives every boy's dream. He has loving parents, a baby sister, a loyal dog, and even a little bit of danger in his life. But with <b>parents</b> <b>like</b> Luke and Laura, he can't help but get in on the action." ...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{endosperm}} {{cells have}} a nuclear ratio of two maternal genomes to one paternal genome. This 2 to 1 dosage relationship provides a unique system {{for studying the}} additivity of gene expression levels in reciprocal hybrids. A combination of microarray profiling and allele-specific expression analysis was performed using RNA isolated from endosperm tissues of maize (Zea mays) inbred lines B 73 and Mo 17 and their reciprocal hybrids at two developmental stages, 13 and 19 d after pollination. The majority of genes exhibited additive expression in reciprocal hybrids based on microarray analyses. However, {{a substantial number of}} genes exhibited nonadditive expression patterns, including maternal like, paternal <b>like,</b> high <b>parent</b> <b>like,</b> low <b>parent</b> <b>like,</b> and expression patterns outside the range of the parental inbreds. The frequency of hybrid expression patterns outside of the parental range in maize endosperm tissue is much higher than that observed for vegetative tissues. For a set of 90 genes, allele-specific expression assays were employed to monitor allelic bias and regulatory variation. Eight of these genes exhibited evidence for maternally or paternally biased expression at multiple stages of endosperm development and are potential examples of differential imprinting. Our data indicate that parental effects on gene expression are much stronger in endosperm than in vegetative tissues...|$|R

The boy had behaved well. There were many doting <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Catherwood, whose boys had accepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.

60|$|John Gibson, sculptor, of Rome, as {{he loved}} to call himself, was a {{remarkable}} embodiment, in many ways, of this self-respecting, artistic, ideal Welsh peasant temperament. In a little village near Conway, in North Wales, there lived {{at the end of}} the last century a petty labouring market gardener of the name of Gibson, who knew and spoke no other tongue than his native Welsh. In 1790, his wife gave birth to a son whom they christened John, and who grew up, a workman's child, under the shadow of the great castle, and among the exquisite scenery of the placid land-locked Conway river. John Gibson's <b>parents,</b> <b>like</b> the mass of labouring Welsh people, were honest, God-fearing folk, with a great earnestness of principle, a profound love of truth, and a hatred of all mean or dirty actions. They brought up the boy in these respects in the way he should go; and when he was old he indeed did not depart from them. Throughout his life, John Gibson was remarkable for his calm, earnest, straightforward simplicity, a simplicity which seemed almost childish to those who could not understand so grand and uncommon and noble a nature as his.|$|E
