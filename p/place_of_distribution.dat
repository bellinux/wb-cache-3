Combs replied by saying that all businesses must obey the law [...] "It is our belief that this is a very, very clear issue about nexus. As I say, this started probably because of catalog sales 47 years ago in 1963," [...] said Combs. Combs also cited a Texas law to back up her argument that Amazon is required to collect sales taxes: [...] "A retailer is engaged in business in this state if the retailer: 1.) maintains, occupies, or uses in this state permanently, temporarily, directly, indirectly or through a subsidiary or agent, however named, an office, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution,</b> sales or sample room or place, warehouse, storage place, or any other place of business.” The Dallas Morning News published an editorial supporting Combs' efforts to collect sales tax from Amazon.com on 17 February 2011.

The scientists believe that if environmental degradation continues at its current pace, the prospect of human life will be shrouded in mystery. One {{of the most effective}} ways to deal with the environmental adverse effects is by implementing green supply chains. In this study a multilevel mathematical model including supply, production, distribution and customer levels has been presented for routing–location–inventory in green supply chain. Vehicle routing between distribution centres and customers has been considered in the model.  Establishment <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> centres among potential places is determined by the model. The distributors use continuous review policy (r, Q) to control the inventory. The proposed model object is to find an optimal supply chain with minimum costs. To validate the proposed model and measure its compliance with real world problems, GAMS IDE/Cplex has been used. In order to measure the efficiency of the proposed model in large scale problems, a genetic algorithm has been used. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed model as a practical tool for decision makers to solve location-inventory-routing problems in green supply chain.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the logistics contract {{that is to}} say a contract where a logistics operator regulates for the customer the flows of goods from the place of materials’ purchase to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> of final products. The services performed by the logistics operator generally are: transportation, warehousing, cargo handling, inventory management, etc. No one service prevails over another. So a logistics contract is a mixed contract involving numerous activities of an extremely diverse nature which are no longer considered as stages of the supply chains but as the constituent parts of a complete interrelated logistics activity. There is no legal source for this contract and {{it is for this reason}} that it is necessary to define the legal nature of the contract and to identify the law applicable in order to regulate the logistics provider’s liability and other issues not covered in the contract. In particular this paper illustrates the origin of logistics contracts, the contract parts (logistics operator and customer), the logistics activities, the issue relating the law applicable to this contract, the theses of the doctrine, the absence of case law, the attempt to elaborate standard forms and the inopportunity of a legal regulation because of the presence of many contracts of different content...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} comparison is to examine whether road safety policy can be improved by utilising practical knowledge gained in {{the corporate}} sector. Specifically, the report focuses on target group segmentation which, in the corporate sector, is a marketing component. According to marketing principles, what a company offers {{to a group of}} customers consists of a mix (the marketing) composed of the 'four Ps': product, price, <b>place</b> (<b>of</b> <b>distribution),</b> and promotion. Target group segmentation occurs previous to composing the marketing mix, and is intended to produce different marketing mixes for each group. Marketing principles can also be applied to road safety (being the 'product' in this case), but this is rarely done. Target group segmentation can alsobe applied to 'promoting' road safety. When using this in the road safetyfield, groups are usually selected according to the problem they form in regard to safety. A following step could be to make a subdivision focusing on the solution to the problem. This step is rarely taken; what usually happens is that the largest possible target group is sought with as few subdivisions as possible. (A...|$|E

Not only in a traditional footstall but this food made of corn are also available in supermarkets. This study aims at finding out the characteristics of the consumers who consume food made of corn and also it is aimed at finding out the factors which influence those consumers to consume food made from corn (Zea Mays.

40|$|Homelessness is {{a public}} state {{experienced}} by individuals {{who do not have}} a regular home or stable personal shelter that is warm, safe and secure. It also means not having a home. An individual {{does not have to be}} living on the streets to be homeless, even if one has a roof over their head, they can still be homeless. This may be because their home is unsuitable or they do not have any rights to stay where they live. As indicated by Gwo Burne (Masalah Gelandangan, April 2007), it is said that Kementerian Pembangunan Wanita, Keluarga dan Masyarakat has given the total of homeless in big city is as many as 7833 since 2007 to December 2011. From the research, the factors of them becoming a homeless is 46. 6 % jobless, 17. 7 % who has low income, 10. 5 % old, poor and living alone, 4. 8 % addiction of drugs, 4. 4 % to those who are neglected and abandoned, 2. 2 % for those who have mental illness, 2. 1 % critical illness, 1. 9 % who does not have a permanent place to stay, 1. 2 % ex convict, 1. 1 % disabled, 1. 0 % who escaped from home, 0. 6 % for those who have family issues, 0. 5 % of depression, 0. 5 % of alcoholic, 0. 4 % refugees and 0. 2 % of acceptance in family. Another 1. 0 % remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the awareness of the society to donate and to volunteer for the homeless people in Kuala Lumpur. It is argued that although providing food for them might be the right thing to do, it is also causing a lot of problems. It is how an individual takes in about an issue and whether or not they are willing to help instead of being selfish. Indepth interviews were carried out with two volunteers and another random stranger that passed by the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>distribution</b> place. The researcher also distributed online survey through emails and social networking for the people in Kuala Lumpur area. It is found that many of people in the society are aware with the problem but as to how they reflect an issue is up to an individual. Although it is questionable whether immediate homelessness could actually be prevented, some chose that path for their life due to their lack of self esteem. This study contributes to discussions between a range of volunteers and some random strangers who are interested in the potential benefits of being aware and a help for the homeless.
