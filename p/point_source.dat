Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E

Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a <b>point</b> <b>source</b> one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic <b>point</b> <b>source</b> is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Point</b> <b>source</b> water {{pollution}} refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, {{such as a}} pipe or ditch. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant, a factory, or a city storm drain. The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines <b>point</b> <b>source</b> for regulatory enforcement purposes. The CWA definition of <b>point</b> <b>source</b> was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.|$|E
25|$|Acousticians, in {{studying}} the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> sometimes called a simple source. An ideal <b>point</b> <b>source</b> is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.|$|E
25|$|Pollution {{is often}} classed as <b>point</b> <b>source</b> or nonpoint source {{pollution}}. <b>Point</b> <b>source</b> pollution occurs {{when there is}} a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution.

Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural runoff and wind blown debris are prime examples.|$|E

40|$|The {{study on}} <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> in astronomical images is of special importance, since most {{energetic}} celestial {{objects in the}} Universe exhibit a point-like appearance. An approach to recognize the <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> (PS) in the X-ray astronomical images using our newly designed granular binary-tree support vector machine (GBT-SVM) classifier is proposed. First, all potential <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> are located by peak detection on the image. The image and spectral features of these potential <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> are then extracted. Finally, a classifier to recognize the true <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> is build through the extracted features. Experiments and applications of our approach on real X-ray astronomical images are demonstrated. comparisons between our approach and other SVM-based classifiers are also carried out by evaluating the precision and recall rates, which prove that our approach is better and achieves a higher accuracy of around 89 %.

In this work we analyze a dedicated Chandra observation of the same target to identify <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> and characterize the background emission in the bridge. We find that the count number of the <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> is much higher than average field population (using CDFS~ 4 ~Ms as a reference).
