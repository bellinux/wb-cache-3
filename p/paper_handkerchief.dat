40|$|International audienceLignocellulosic {{materials}} from {{municipal solid waste}} emerge as attractive resources for anaerobic digestion biorefinery. To increase the knowledge required for establishing efficient bioprocesses, dynamics of batch fermentation by the cellulolytic bacterium Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum were compared using three cellulosic materials, <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> cotton discs and Whatman filter paper. Fermentation of <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> occurred the fastest and resulted in a specific metabolic profile: it resulted in the lowest acetate-to-lactate and acetate-to-ethanol ratios. By shotgun proteomic analyses of <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and Whatman paper incubations, 151 proteins with significantly different levels were detected, including 20 of the 65 cellulosomal components, 8 non-cellulosomal CAZymes and 44 distinct extracytoplasmic proteins. Consistent with the specific metabolic profile observed, many enzymes from the central carbon catabolic pathways had higher levels in <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> incubations. Among the quantified CAZymes and cellulosomal components, 10 endoglucanases mainly from the GH 9 families and 7 other cellulosomal subunits had lower levels in <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> incubations. An in-depth characterization of the materials used showed that {{the lower levels of}} endoglucanases in <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> incubations could hypothetically result from its lower crystallinity index (50 %) and degree of polymerization (970). By contrast, the higher hemicellulose rate in <b>paper</b> <b>handkerchief</b> (13. 87 %) did not result in the enhanced expression of enzyme with xylanase as primary activity, including enzymes from the ªxyl-docº cluster. It suggests the absence, in this material, of molecular structures that specifically lead to xylanase induction. The integrated approach developed in this work shows that subtle differences among cellulosic materials regarding chemical and structural characteristics have significant effects on expressed bacterial functions, in particular the cellulolysis machinery, resulting in different metabolic patterns and degradation dynamics...|$|E

These paper types consist usually of 2-3 plies. Because of high quality requirements the base tissue is normally made entirely from pure chemical pulp, but might contain added selected recycled fiber. The tissue paper might be treated with softeners, lotions or added perfume {{to get the right}} properties or [...] "feeling".

An Army list of 1814, with his name written on the cover; a little dictionary he was wont to use in writing; and the Bible his mother had given him, were on the mantelpiece, with a pair of spurs and a dried inkstand covered with the dust of ten years.

40|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) technique brought about a major advance in DNA study, and criminology experts have obviously noticed the possibilities that imple-mentation of this technique can contribute to investigat-ing criminal cases. It is now possible to extract and study DNA from very small samples, even those that are invisible or latent. Although preferred samples from which to obtain DNA are those from biological fluids, {{it is possible to}} obtain DNA from fingerprints (1). The possibility of studying profiles of DNA obtained from fingerprints allows us to consider that invisible or latent lip prints (that is, lip prints from protective lipstick or long-lasting lipstick that does not leave any visible mark) may provide cell remains from which DNA can be extracted. The following study demon-strates an attempt to obtain DNA from latent lip prints on porous surfaces (<b>paper</b> <b>handkerchiefs).</b> When dealing with latent traces, the first step is visualizing them by a developing process. The developing of latent lip prints on porous sur-faces is more recent than that for fingerprints. The first research showed that traditional reagents used for fingerprints are not successful (2). It has recently been determined that lysochrome...|$|R

She turned over the pen-wiper and the hat, and looked round at me. Grosse, waiting to try another experiment, left it to me to answer. The result, in both cases, was the same as in the cases of the sheet of <b>paper</b> and the <b>handkerchief.</b> Scarlet was not half as red--black, not one-hundredth part as black--as her imagination had figured them to her, in the days when she was blind. Still, as to this last color--as to black--she could feel some little encouragement. It had affected her disagreeably (just as poor Oscar's face had affected her), though she had not actually known it for the color that she disliked. She made an effort, poor child, to assert herself, against her merciless surgeon-teacher. [...] "I didn't know it was black," [...] she said.
