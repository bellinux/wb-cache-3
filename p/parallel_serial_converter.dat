OFDM uses the spectrum efficiently compared to FDMA by spacing the channels much closer together and making all carriers orthogonal {{to one another}} to prevent interference between the closely spaced carriers. The main advantage of OFDM is their robustness to channel fading in wireless environment, but here MB-OFDM transmitter baseband is designing {{in order to provide}} high speed for application than OFDM. The objective of this project is to design and implement a baseband of MB-OFDM transmitter on FPGA hardware which provides very high speed for application. This project concentrates on developing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). The work also includes in designing a mapping module, <b>serial</b> to <b>parallel</b> and <b>parallel</b> to <b>serial</b> <b>converter</b> module. The design uses FFT and IFFT for the processing module which indicate that the processing block contain inputs data. All modules are designed using VHDL programming language and implement using Apex 20 KE board. The board is connected to computer through serial port. Input and output data is displayed to computer. Software and tools which used in this project includes VHDLmg Design Entry, Altera and Altera Quartus-II Software tools are used to assist the design process and downloading process into FPGA board while Apex board is used to execute the designed module. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|R

The digital control system has been derived using the existing analogue control system as a reference to find the important functions that has to be included in the system. The digital control system should be able to handle <b>parallel</b> and <b>serial</b> connected <b>converters</b> as well as single converter operation. The analogue control system has been analysed in the beginning of the thesis and the important functions has been listed to serve as a guideline of how the digital control system should function. After listing the functions of the analogue control system a digital component has been chosen that can perform some of these functions, the digital components studied in this thesis are FPGAs and microcontrollers. The chosen component to replace some of the functions of the analogue control system is a microcontroller, a XC 164 CM from Infineon. This component has been programmed in assembler and C and the complete program has been tested on the module, to be able to connect the microcontroller to the module, a new PCB has been designed and constructed. Before connecting the digital control system to the module the system has been tested with the help of a step-down converter, constructed during the thesis work, to avoid damaging the module. The results from the tests of the constructed digital control system are presented in the thesis, according to the tests performed on the module the system works as intended. One of the goals with the regulation was to not increase the output voltage ripple compared to the analogue control system, this goal was not completely reached. This may have to do with the connection used in the tests, the microcontroller are not placed on the same PCB as the other components needed for the system and this may increase the system?s sensitivity to noise. To create a complete product the microcontroller and the other components has to be placed on the same PCB and some other functions, not included in this thesis, has to be implemented...|$|R
