50|$|The Lake Erie & Western Shops {{were located}} in Tipton, which, as of 1914, {{employed}} 350-400 people. The Tipton Chamber of Commerce was founded on March 24, 1914. Canning was a popular industry in Tipton during the early 20th century. The industry was brought to Tipton by N.S. Martz. Tomato processing was common due to the high quality black loam in the area. The Fame Canning Company canned corn, peas and tomatoes. The Snider Preserve Company processed tomato pulp. The Oakes Manufacturing Company produced <b>poultry</b> <b>incubators</b> <b>and</b> related supplies for international distribution. There were two buggy factories in Tipton, too: the Binkley Buggy Company and the Charles Bros. Carriage Factory. The J.J. McIntosh broom factory was {{the largest in the}} state.|$|R

40|$|International audience: Because {{glucocorticoid}} (stress) hormones fundamentally affect {{various aspects}} of the behaviour, life history and fitness of free-living vertebrates, {{there is a need to}} understand the environmental factors shaping their variation in natural populations. Here, we examined whether spatial heterogeneity in breeding territory quality affected the stress of colonial king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We assessed the effects of local climate (wind, sun and ambient temperature) and social conditions (number of neighbours, distance to neighbours) on the baseline levels of plasma total corticosterone (CORT) in 77 incubating and 42 chick-brooding birds, breeding on territories of central or peripheral colony location. We also assessed the oxidative stress status of a sub-sample of central vs. peripheral chick-brooders to determine whether chronic stress arose from breeding on specific territories. On average, we found that brooders had 55  % higher CORT levels than incubators. Regardless of breeding status, central birds experienced greater social density (higher number of neighbours, shorter distance between territories) and had higher CORT levels than peripheral birds. Increasing social density positively explained 40  % of the variation in CORT levels of both <b>incubators</b> <b>and</b> <b>brooders,</b> but the effect was more pronounced in brooders. In contrast, climate was similar among breeding territories and did not significantly affect the CORT levels of breeding birds. In brooders, oxidative stress status was not affected by local density or weather conditions. These results highlight that local heterogeneity in breeding (including social) conditions may strongly affect the stress levels of breeding seabirds. The fitness consequences of such variation remain to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Incubation {{of poultry}} egg is very {{important}} these days as the demand for chicken is increasing day by day. But the process of hatching eggs by the conventional method is very difficult {{as well as it}} consumes much power. In short conventional method of egg hatching requires continuous supply of power. In this paper a new method of solar <b>poultry</b> <b>incubator</b> design is suggested which could be used to hatch eggs from solar pv and hence could reduce the usage of power and can maximize the usage of solar power which is a renewable source of energy. By implementing this method of solar <b>poultry</b> <b>incubator</b> {{we will be able to}} reduce the power consumption of the incubator by 75 % and the cost involved in the design also yields profit and hence could bring out a revolution in this field...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{industrial}} uses of the thermostat was in the regulation of the temperature in <b>poultry</b> <b>incubators.</b> Charles Hearson, a British engineer, designed the first modern incubator for eggs that was taken up for use on poultry farms in 1879. The incubators incorporated an accurate thermostat to regulate the temperature so as to precisely simulate the experience of an egg being hatched naturally.|$|R

40|$|Technology {{entrepreneurship}} rarely {{succeeds in}} isolation; increasingly, {{it occurs in}} interconnected networks of business partners and other organizations. For entrepreneurs lacking access to an established business ecosystem, <b>incubators</b> <b>and</b> accelerators provide a possible support mechanism for access to partners and resources. Yet, these relatively recent approaches to supporting entrepreneurship are still evolving. Therefore, it can be challenging for entrepreneurs to assess these mechanisms and to make insightful decisions {{on whether or not}} to join an <b>incubator</b> or accelerator, <b>and</b> which <b>incubator</b> or accelerator best meets their needs. In this article, five key factors that entrepreneurs should take into consideration about <b>incubators</b> <b>and</b> accelerators are offered.
