50|$|The novelization {{was written}} by Michael McDowell based on the {{screenplay}} by Jonathan Lynn. There was also a children's adaptation entitled, Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook written by Landis, Lynn, and Ann Matthews. Both adaptations were published in 1985, and differ from the movie in that they feature a fourth ending cut from the final film. In this ending, Wadsworth says that he killed Boddy {{as well as the}} other victims, and then reveals to the guests that he has poisoned them all so that there will be no witnesses and he will have committed the perfect crime. As he runs through the house to disable the phones and lock the doors, the chief detective - who had earlier been posing as an evangelist (Howard Hesseman) - returns, followed by the police, who disarm Wadsworth. Wadsworth then repeats the confession that he had given earlier to the guests, physically acting out each scene himself.

Gran Fury organized as an autonomous collective, describing themselves as a “...band of individuals united in anger and dedicated to exploiting the power of art to end the AIDS crisis.” The contribution of recycling historical images of homoerotic pleasure contributed to the pictorial landscape of the AIDS activist movement. By recycling the title of the Plymouth sedan used by New York Police Department, Richard Meyer writes “inscribed within the group’s name...” references “...both a subjective experience (rage) and a tool of State power (<b>police</b> <b>squad</b> <b>cars),</b> to both an internal sensation and an external force.” Action, not art, was the aim of the collective.

The police force is also supported by six canine teams: four dual-purpose patrol dogs, a single-purpose narcotics dog, and a single-purpose explosives-detection dog assigned to the Mall of America. The police department has one of only four bomb squads in Minnesota and a highly trained 20 member SWAT team.|$|R
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage <b>police</b> motorcycles, <b>squad</b> <b>cars,</b> a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|R
50|$|Though the October 8, 1969, {{rally in}} Chicago {{had failed to}} draw as many as the Weathermen had anticipated, {{the two or three}} hundred who did attend shocked police by rioting through the {{affluent}} Gold Coast neighborhood. They smashed the windows of a bank and those of many cars. The crowd ran four blocks before encountering police barricades. They charged the police but broke into small groups; more than 1,000 police counter-attacked. Many protesters were wearing motorcycle or football helmets, but the police were well trained and armed. Large amounts of tear gas were used, and at least twice <b>police</b> ran <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> into the mob. The rioting lasted about half an hour, during which 28 policemen were injured. Six Weathermen were shot by the police and an unknown number injured; 68 rioters were arrested.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, Moranis and Thomas {{were not}} going to direct or write the film but ended up doing both with the {{guidance}} of executive producer Jack Grossberg, who had produced films by Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. They were subsequently given a budget of $5 million. Before filming, all of the major breweries wanted the McKenzie brothers to appear in beer advertisements. The filmmakers had the promise of Molson's Brewery, but once the brewery found out that there was a joke in the film about putting a mouse in a beer bottle so that a complaint can be made in order to get free beer, they distanced themselves from the film. The filmmakers were also banned from filming in a Brewers Retail store, and from using the name [...] "Brewers Retail". The exterior shots of the store (now a Tim Hortons/Pizza Pizza) were shot in Scarborough, Ontario, at the corner of Eglinton and Midland Avenues. The KFC and Petro-Canada gas station seen in the background still exist. They ended up building a replica of the store at a cost of more than $45,000, and calling it [...] "The Beer Store". Ironically, Brewers Retail later changed the name of its stores to [...] "The Beer Store", and they continue to operate under that name. Filming also took place at the Old Fort Brewing Co. in Prince George, British Columbia. The emergency vehicles used during filming were all real Metropolitan Toronto <b>Police</b> <b>squad</b> <b>cars.</b> The Ambulances used briefly were on loan from Metropolitan Toronto Ambulance.|$|R

5000|$|The riot {{began to}} take shape as the game came to a close at 7:45 pm, with some spectators {{throwing}} bottles and other objects at the large screens in the viewing area.Boston Bruins flags and Canucks jerseys were set afire, and soon some rioters overturned a vehicle in front of the main post office. According to one eyewitness, a group who was heard chanting [...] "Let's go riot, let's go riot" [...] as early as the first period of the game were among those responsible for flipping the first car.Fist fights broke out when people standing on porta-potties fell when others tipped the porta-potties over. People began jumping on the car that had been first overturned; it was set afire at 7:46. With a crowd of onlookers chanting [...] "burn the truck", a second vehicle in the same area was lit ablaze. Firemen were able to put it out,but the truck was again set afire after it was overturned. In a nearby parking lot, two Vancouver <b>Police</b> <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> were later also set on fire.In total, 17 cars were burned, including police cars. Windows were smashed in a bank and various businesses along the West Georgia corridor, some of which were also looted. Riot police eventually managed to push the rioters away from Georgia, onto Granville Street and Robson Street, where the rioters then caused further substantial damage, breaking the windows of several shops and looting. Some of the stores affected were Future Shop, Sears and Chapters bookstore. One man was sent to hospital in critical condition after he attempted to jump from the Georgia Viaduct onto another platform and fell.|$|R
25|$|Finally, at 10:25p.m., Jeff Jones {{gave the}} pre-arranged signal over a bullhorn, and the Weatherman action began.

The mass of the crowd ran about four blocks before encountering police barricades. The mob charged the police but splintered into small groups, and more than 1,000 police counter-attacked. Although many protesters had—as J.J. did—motorcycle or football helmets on, the police were better trained and armed and nightsticks were expertly aimed to disable the rioters. Large amounts of tear gas were used, and at least twice <b>police</b> ran <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> full speed into crowds. After only a half-hour or so, the riot was over: 28 policemen were injured (none seriously), six Weathermen were shot and an unknown number injured, and 68 protesters were arrested.
