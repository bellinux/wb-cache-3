40|$|One of {{the early}} {{decisions}} facing a regulator {{in the context of}} an open access Next Generation Access networks (NGA) is the location <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to that NGA. This decision is one which needs to take into account the scope of the natural monopoly associated with an NGA and the extent to which there is the potential for competitive supply of transmission services (or backhaul) from access seeker <b>points</b> <b>of</b> presence to the NGA. The Australian NGA is called the National Broadband Network (NBN). This paper starts with the research question, where are the optimum sites for <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to the Australian NBN?. The paper commences by describing the architecture of the Australian NBN and considering some of the issues which arise from the fact that it is designed to be ubiquitous. The paper considers the issues that need to be considered in determining the extent to which there is a natural monopoly in transmission services as well as the effects on outcomes that arise from the existing deployment of infrastructure associated with the delivery of digital subscriber line broadband services based on unbundled local loops and line sharing services. The paper then moves to consider the requirements for consideration in the Australian regulatory context. This is summarised by the phrase long-term interests of end-users and the paper considers the interpretation of this phrase in the context of decisions on the number and location <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection.</b> There is a review of the nature and extent to which operators in Australia contributed to the deliberations of the Australian regulator in determining the location <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection.</b> In turn the paper then describes the actual approach taken in respect of the Australian NBN and the rationale behind those decisions. The final part of the paper describes the decision that was taken along with the rationale. It also examines the subsequent positions taken by stakeholders in respect <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interconnection</b> to the Australian NBN.

40|$|Abstract. Spatial messaging, or {{the fact}} of {{publishing}} virtual tags, is clearly not a new concept. In the GPS world, these tags are materialized through <b>POIs</b> (<b>Point</b> <b>Of</b> Interest) and they consist {{more or less in}} geo-referenced information. They are often classified in different categories. A typical use is to show on a map all the neighboring POIs of a certain category. But the only solution to trust the information is to get them from a reliable source. This paper presents a first approach to a generic way of presenting these virtual tags, and how to add trust information to them. Every user is therefore able to create virtual tags and the trust engine is responsible to return to a specific user only the ones that he is interested in. ...|$|R

We then a greedy algorithm named GD-Sweep and an approximation named BS-Sweep to solve M 3 SR.
