5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, <b>pointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

25|$|To {{test the}} neglect frame of reference, the two {{different}} arrays were carefully situated so that gap in the triangle fell {{on opposite sides of}} the allocentric field. In the SW-NE array, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric right of the object-centered axis along which the triangle <b>pointed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> SE-NW configuration, the gap in the triangle fell on the allocentric left of the object-centered axis. Furthermore, varying the position of the arrays with respect to the participant's trunk midline was used to test egocentric neglect. The arrays were therefore presented at 0° (i.e. in line with the participant's trunk midline), at −40° left, and at +40° right. Ultimately, varying the position of the array within the testing visual field allowed for the simultaneous measurement of egocentric neglect and allocentric neglect. The results of this experimental design showed that the spatial neglect patients performed more poorly for the allocentric left side of the triangle, as well as for objects presented on the egocentric left side of the body. Furthermore, the poor accuracy for detecting features of the object on the left side of the object's axis was more severe when the objects were presented on the contralesional side of the body. Thus, these findings illustrate that both allocentric and egocentric biases are present simultaneously, and that egocentric information can influence the severity of allocentric neglect.|$|E
25|$|Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") {{refers to}} {{definition}} from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead {{which is not}} found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by {{the help of a}} third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are <b>pointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; but if one part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.|$|E
25|$|Lovell {{continued}} {{his work on}} the production antenna design using klystrons and wrapped up this work on 22 July. The team then began adapting the various bits of equipment to work together as a single radar unit based on the magnetron. J. R. Atkinson and W. E. Burcham, both sent to the AIS team from the Cavendish Laboratory at University of Cambridge, produced a pulsed power source, and Skinner and A. G. Ward, also from Cavendish, worked on a receiver. At the time the team had no solution to switching the antenna from transmit to receive, so they initially used two antennas side-by-side, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver. On 8 August they were experimenting with this setup when they received a signal from a nearby fishing hut. With the antenna still <b>pointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction, they accidentally detected an aircraft which flew by the site at 6pm on 12 August. The next day, Dee, Watt and Rowe were on hand, but with no convenient aircraft available the team instead demonstrated the system by detecting the returns from a tin sheet being held by someone bicycling across a nearby cliff. With this demonstration of the radar's ability to reject ground returns and detect targets at basically zero altitude, interest in the 1.5m systems began to wane.|$|E

2500|$|The {{space of}} unoriented {{lines in the}} plane is {{diffeomorphic}} to the open Möbius band. To see why, let L(θ) denote the line through the origin at an angle θ to the positive x-axis. [...] For each L(θ) there is the family P(θ) of all lines in the plane that are perpendicular to L(θ). [...] Topologically, the family P(θ) is just a line (because each line in P(θ) intersects the line L(θ) in just one point). [...] In this way, as θ increases in the range , the line L(θ) represents a line's worth of distinct lines in the plane. But when θ reaches 180°, L(180°) is identical to L(0), and so the families P(0°) and P(180°) of perpendicular lines are also identical families. [...] The line L(0°), however, has returned to itself as L(180°) <b>pointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. Every line in the plane corresponds to exactly one line in some family P(θ), for exactly one θ, for , and P(180°) is identical to P(0°) but returns <b>pointed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction.
