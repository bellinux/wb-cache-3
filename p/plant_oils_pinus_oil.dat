40|$|<b>Plant</b> {{essential}} <b>oils</b> {{from eight}} <b>plant</b> species were tested for their insecticidal activities against the red imported fire ant,  Solenopsis invcita, {{by using a}} fumigation bioassay. This study reveals that the mortalities after treatment of the workers of red imported fire ants varied according to the classification of workers, oil type, dosage, and exposure time. Among the essential oils tested, strong insecticidal activity was observed with the essential oils of camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), artemisia annua (Artemisia annua), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus), mugwort (Artemisia argyi), and wintergreen (Ilex chinensis). Ant mortalities from chrysanthemum oil (Dendranthema indicum), turpentine <b>oil</b> (<b>Pinus</b> massoniana), and forsythia <b>oil</b> (Forsythia suspense) treatments were significantly lower than those from the previously mentioned five essential oil treatments.

Chapter 1 provides {{the introduction to the}} chemistry of polyurethanes, <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> and <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> based polyols. Chapter 2 focus on making oligomeric polyols from unsaturated <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> through epoxidation and subsequent epoxide ring opening oligomerization that yielded oligomeric polyols. The properties of these oligomeric polyols were influence by the level of unsaturation of the <b>plant</b> <b>oils.</b> In addition, catalyst loading, monomer concentration and reaction time play vital role in determining the properties of the oligomeric polyols. <b>Plant</b> <b>oil</b> based polyols were also prepared by epoxide ring opening with renewable polyhydric alcohols that provide a variety of <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> based polyols for polyurethane synthesis. Chapter 3 focus on the synthesis of polyurethanes (PU) from various types of <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> based polyols as well as the evaluation of the mechanical properties of these synthesized PU. The tensile test of the PU shows that the mechanical properties were related to the structure and functionalities of the <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> based polyols.

A comprehensive and up-to-date technical review of using both edible and non-edible <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> (either pure or as blends with fossil diesel) in CI engines, based on comparisons with standard diesel fuel, has been carried out. The properties of several <b>plant</b> <b>oils,</b> {{and the results of}} engine tests using them, are reviewed based on the literature. Findings regarding engine performance, exhaust emissions and engine durability are collated. The causes of technical problems arising from the use of various oils are discussed, as are the modifications to oil and engine employed to alleviate these problems. The review shows that a number of <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> can be used satisfactorily in CI engines, without transesterification, by preheating the oil and/or modifying the engine parameters and the maintenance schedule. As regards life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emission analyses, these reveal considerable advantages of raw <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> over fossil diesel and biodiesel.

Degradation and dissolution during burial alter fatty acid ratios and remove short-chain fatty acids, resulting in degraded <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> with similar fatty acid profiles to other degraded fats. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of delta C- 13 (18 : 0) and delta C- 13 (16 : 0), carried out by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS), has provided a means of distinguishing fish oils, dairy fats, ruminant and non-ruminant adipose fats, but <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> are rarely included in these analyses. For modern <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> where C- 18 : 1 is abundant, delta C- 13 (18 : 1) and delta C- 13 (16 : 0) are usually measured.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the work on}} detailed characterization of effervescent spray of Jatropha and Pongamia pure <b>plant</b> <b>oils.</b> The spray characteristics of these biofuels are {{compared with those of}} diesel. Both macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics at different injection pressures and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) have been studied. The particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique along with direct imaging methods are used for the purpose of spray characterization. Due to their higher viscosity, pure <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> showed poor atomization compared to diesel and a blend of diesel and pure <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> at a given GLR. Pure <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> sprays showed a lower spray cone angle when compared to diesel and blends at lower GLRs. However, the difference is not significant at higher GLRs. Droplet size measurements at 100 mm downstream of the exit orifice showed reduction in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) diameter with increase in GLR. A radial variation in the SMD is observed for the blend and pure <b>plant</b> <b>oils.</b> Pure oils showed a larger variation when compared to the blend. Spray unsteadiness has been characterized based on the image-to-image variation in the mean droplet diameter and fluctuations in the spray cone angle. Results showed that pure <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> sprays are more unsteady at lower GLRs when compared to diesel and blend. A critical GLR is identified at which the spray becomes steady. The three regimes of spray operation, namely ``steady spray,'' ``pulsating spray,'' and ``spray and unbroken liquid jet'' are identified in the injection pressure-GLR parameter space for these pure <b>plant</b> <b>oils.</b> Two-phase flow imaging inside the exit orifice shows that for the pure <b>plant</b> <b>oils,</b> the flow is highly transient at low GLRs and the bubbly, slug, and annular two-phase flow regimes are all observed.

A multi-cylinder water cooled IDI type CI engine {{has been tested}} with jatropha and karanj oils and comparisons made against fossil diesel. The {{physical and chemical properties}} of the three fuels were measured to investigate the suitability of jatropha and karanj oils as fuels for CI engines. The engine cooling water circuit and fuel supply systems were modified such that hot jacket water preheated the neat <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> prior to injection. Between jatropha and karanj there was little difference in the performance, emission and combustion results. Compared to fossil diesel, the brake specific fuel consumption on volume basis was around 3 % higher for the <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> and the brake thermal efficiency was almost similar. Jatropha and karanj operation resulted in higher CO 2 and NO x emissions by 7 % and 8 % respectively, as compared to diesel.
