5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her <b>pushing</b> <b>Link</b> over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting.

40|$|Abstract—Advances in optical {{networking}} technology are <b>pushing</b> internet <b>link</b> rates up to 100 Gbps. Such line rates demand a throughput of over 150 million packets per second at core routers. Along {{with the increase}} in link speed, the size of the dynamic routing table of these core routers is also increasing at the rate of 25 - 50 K additional prefixes per year. These dynamic tables require high prefix deletion and insertion rates. Therefore, quick prefix update without disrupting router operation has also emerged as a critical requirement. Furthermore, IPv 6 standard extends the current IPv 4 prefix length from 32 to 128 bits. Thus, it is a major challenge to scale the existing solutions to simultaneously support increased throughput, table size, prefix length and quick update. While the existing solutions can achieve high throughput, they cannot support large routing tables and quick update at the same time. We propose a novel scalable, high-throughput linear pipeline architecture for IP-lookup that supports large routing tables and single-cycle non-blocking update. Using a state-of-the-art Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) along with external SRAM, the proposed architecture can support over 2 M prefixes. Our implementation shows a throughput of 348 millions lookups per second, even when external SRAM is used. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Conventional robot motion {{teaching}} methods use a teaching pendant or a motion capture device {{and are not}} the most convenient or intuitive ways to teach a robot sophisticated and fluid movements such as martial arts motions. Ideally, a robot could be set up {{as if it were}} a clothing man-nequin that has light limbs and flexible yet frictional joints which can be positioned at desirable shape and hold all the positions. To do the same with a robot, an operator could pull or <b>push</b> the <b>links</b> with minor forces until the desired robot posture is attained. For this, a robot should measure the applied ex-ternal force by using torque sensors at the robot joints. However, torque sensors are bulky and expen-sive to install in every DOF joints while keeping a compact design, which is essential to humanoid ro-bots. In this paper, we use only motor current readings to acquire joint torques. The equations used to compensate for the effect of gravity on the joint torques and the self-calibration method to earn link pa-rameters are presented. Additionally, kinematic restrictions can be imposed on the robot’s arms to sim-plify the motion teaching. Here, we teach the Kendo training robot with this method and the robot’s learnt martial art motions are demonstrated...|$|R

We theoretically model and analyze how the content can be disseminated by both <b>pushing</b> via cellular <b>links</b> and sharing via Wi-Fi links, where handovers are modeled based on the multi-compartment model.

In contrast, problems of compressing type can often be solved exactly with pushing techniques ("pushing down", "pushing to the left" etc., see [14]).

The initial dislocation density is {{in a range of}} 10 {sup 6 } {approx} 10 {sup 7 } cm{sup - 2 }, and the dislocation structure is found to contain many grown-in superjogs along dislocation lines. The dislocation density increases to a range of 10 {sup 8 } {approx} 10 {sup 9 } cm{sup - 2 }, and the average jog height is also found to increase after compressing for a total strain of 1 %. It is proposed that the preexisting jogged screw dislocations can act as (multiple) dislocation multiplication sources when deformed under quasi-static conditions. The jog height can increase by stress-induced jog coalescence, which takes place via the lateral migration (drift) of superjogs driven by unbalanced line-tension partials acting on link segments of unequal lengths. The coalescence of superjogs results in an increase of both link length and jog height. Applied shear stress begins to <b>push</b> each <b>link</b> segment to precede dislocation multiplication when link length and jog height are greater than critical lengths.

50|$|The first British {{synchronizer}} gear {{was built}} by the manufacturer of the machine-gun {{for which it was}} designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers'. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle, as in Saulnier's design; a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally, on the port side of the forward fuselage, where it was readily accessible for adjustment.Unfortunately, when the gear was fitted to types such as the Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1½ Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun in front of the cockpit, the long <b>push</b> rod <b>linking</b> the gear to the gun had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to twisting and deformation (not to mention expansion and contraction due to temperature changes).

40|$|Abstract—Cellular radio {{interfaces}} on smartphones {{consume a}} significant amount of battery power, specially with growing number of network centric applications. With high bandwidth cellular access <b>links</b> <b>pushing</b> the bottleneck to the network core, the risk of poor bandwidth utilization of the access link increases, which leads to energy wastage as the radio interface must stay active longer. In addition, small sized packet transmissions from applications wake up the interface frequently, but do not require the entire bandwidth capacity. In this work, we improve the radio usage by aggregating packet transmission from multiple applications. We introduce different time delays while transmit-ting packets from foreground and background applications such that user experience is minimally impacted. Through empirical observations, we determine the impact of different types of traffic on bandwidth utilization. Naive attempts to improve bandwidth utilization lead to {{increase in the number of}} packets missing the deadline for dispatch. With these observations, we propose a technique that balances the bandwidth utilization and deadline misses. Simulation driven experiments using synthetic traces and real trace based on application usage on Android based smartphones show energy gain of around 10 % over other competing techniques. I...|$|R

Initially these were run by British business interests, but eventually transitioned to Norwegian companies.
