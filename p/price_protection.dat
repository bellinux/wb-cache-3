If one holds restricted stock and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a put), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the put {{is equal to the}} marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%. [...] However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside <b>price</b> <b>protection.</b> [...] A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or Single-stock futures, demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.|$|E

For example, if a customer buys a TV from for $300, and it drops in price by $100, they can go back to the retailer to ask for a price adjustment and get the difference returned to them, often in cash. Retailers with price adjustment policies include Macy's, Gap, and Staples.|$|E

Multiple-peril crop insurance is actually {{a product of a}} government partnership and 19 private insurance companies. In essence, the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency oversees the issuance of MPCI, along with mandating what rates can be charged and what kinds of crops are automatically covered {{in different parts of the}} country. The collection of private insurance companies that are allowed to sell MPCI handle the reinsurance and writing of the policies themselves, as well as adjusting and processing claims.|$|E
