The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided <b>prognostic</b> <b>data</b> both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means.

In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E

40|$|Bearing {{performance}} degradation assessment {{is of great}} significance for proactive maintenance and near-zero downtime. For this purpose, a novel assessment method is proposed based on lifting wavelet packet symbolic entropy (LWPSE) and support vector data description (SVDD). LWPSE is presented for feature extraction by jointing use of lifting wavelet packet transform and symbolic entropy. Firstly, the LWPSEs of bearing signals from normal bearing condition are extracted to train an SVDD model by fitting a tight hypersphere around normal samples. Then, the relative distance from the LWPSEs of testing signals to the hypersphere boundary is calculated as a quantitative index for bearing {{performance degradation}} assessment. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method were validated by the life-cycle data obtained from NASA’s <b>prognostics</b> <b>data</b> repository and the comparison with Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

40|$|The capacity/state-of-charge (SoC) and voltage of lithium–ion {{batteries}} are of prime importance in electric vehicles (EVs), so their condition-monitoring techniques are extensively studied. This study {{focuses on the}} application of the grey system theory to the parameters analysing and predicting behaviour during the discharge/charge cycles of the battery. First, Grey relation analysis is applied to study and analyse the relationship between capacity/SoC and various influencing factors. Second, the segment Grey prediction model is proposed in order to test and improve the accuracy of the capacity/SoC prediction.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether varying the format used to present <b>prognostic</b> <b>data</b> alters the perception of risk among surrogate decision makers in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This was a prospective randomized comparative trial conducted in a 23 -bed adult tertiary ICU. Enrolled surrogate decision makers were randomized to 1 of 2 questionnaires, which presented hypothetical ICU scenarios, identical other than the format in which <b>prognostic</b> <b>data</b> were presented (eg, frequencies vs percentages). Participants were asked to rate the risk associated with each prognostic statement. Results: We enrolled 141 surrogate decision makers. The perception of risk varied significantly dependent on the presentation format. For "quantitative data," risks were consistently perceived as higher, when presented as frequencies (eg, 1 in 50) compared with equivalent percentages (eg, 2 %). Framing "qualitative data" in terms of chance of "death" rather than "survival" led to a statistically significant increase in perceived risks. Framing "quantitative" data in this way did not significantly affect risk perception. Conclusion: Data format had a significant effect on how surrogate decision makers interpreted risk. Qualitative statements are interpreted widely and affected by framing. Where possible, multiple quantitative formats should be used for presenting prognostic information...|$|E

40|$|Filtration is a {{critical}} process in many industrial systems to obtain the desired level of purification for liquids or gas. Air, fuel, and oil filters {{are the most common}} examples in industrial systems. Filter clogging is the main failure mode leading to filter replacement or undesired outcomes such as reduced performance and efficiency or cascading failures. For example, contaminants in fuel (e. g. rust particles, paint chips, dirt involved into fuel while tank is filling, tank moisture rust) may lead to performance reduction in the engine and rapid wear in the pump. Prognostics has potential to avoid cost and increase safety when applied to filters. One of the main challenges of prognostics is the lack of failure degradation data obtained from industrial systems. This paper presents the process of design and building of an experimental rig to obtain <b>prognostics</b> <b>data</b> for filter clogging mechanism and data obtained from the rig. Two types of filters have been used during the accelerated filter clogging and 23 run-to-failure data have been collected. Flow rate and pressure sensors are used for condition monitoring purposes.

40|$|Lithium-Ion {{rechargeable}} batteries are widespread power sources with applications to consumer electronics, electrical vehicles, unmanned aerial and spatial vehicles, etc. The failure {{to supply the}} required power levels may lead to severe safety and economical consequences. Thus, {{in view of the}} implementation of adequate maintenance strategies, the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for monitoring the state of health of the batteries and predicting their remaining useful life is becoming a crucial task. Here, we propose a method for predicting the end of discharge of Li-Ion batteries, which stems from the combination of particle filters with radial basis function neural networks. The major innovation {{lies in the fact that}} the radial basis function model is adaptively trained on-line, i. e., its parameters are identified in real time by the particle filter as new observations of the battery terminal voltage become available. By doing so, the prognostic algorithm achieves the flexibility needed to provide sound end-of-discharge time predictions as the charge-discharge cycles progress, even in presence of anomalous behaviors due to failures or unforeseen operating conditions. The method is demonstrated with reference to actual Li-Ion battery discharge data contained in the <b>prognostics</b> <b>data</b> repository of the NASA Ames Research Center database...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{considerable}} {{research efforts}} have been applied {{in the field of}} fault prognostics. However, to the authors knowledge, there are few published works that address complete and systematic methods describing the steps required to develop data-driven prognostics approaches for complex systems. This paper presents a generic component-based prognostics methodology that can be customized for different applications and which can be useful for new researchers and engineers. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part provides a description of the procedures required before constructing data-driven prognostics, such as identifying critical components, selecting physical parameters to monitor, choosing monitoring sensors and defining the data acquisition system. The second part presents a novel data-driven prognostic method for direct remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. This method relies on two phases: offline and online. In the offline phase, a method for constructing health indicators (HI) from sensor data is presented. Such HIs can be used as offline models to display the deterioration evolution of components over time. In the online phase, similar HIs are constructed from the sensor data for a new component. Then, a discrete Bayesian filter is applied to estimate the current health status. Finally, the offline database is searched to find the closest group to the online HIs. The selected offline HIs can be used for estimating the RUL of the new component under operation. The performance of the method is demonstrated using two real data sets taken from the NASA Ames <b>prognostics</b> <b>data</b> repository. Index Terms—Data-driven prognostics, remaining useful life, health indicators construction, discrete Bayes filter, Gaussian process regression. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood and microarray gene expression profiling {{of the primary}} tumor are two promising new technologies able to provide valuable <b>prognostic</b> <b>data</b> for patients with breast cancer. Meta-analyses of several established prognostic breast cancer gene expression profiles in large patient cohorts have demonstrated that despite sharing few genes, their delineation of patients into "good prognosis" or "poor prognosis" are frequently very highly correlated, and combining prognostic profiles does not increase prognostic power. In the current study, we aimed to develop a novel profile which provided independent <b>prognostic</b> <b>data</b> by building a signature predictive of CTC status rather than outcome. Microarray gene expression data from an initial training cohort of 72 breast cancer patients for which CTC status had been determined in a previous study using a multimarker QPCR-based assay was used to develop a CTC-predictive profile. The generated profile was validated in two independent datasets of 49 and 123 patients and confirmed to be both predictive of CTC status, and independently prognostic. Importantly, the "CTC profile" also provided prognostic information independent of the well-established and powerful ' 70 -gene' prognostic breast cancer signature. This profile therefore {{has the potential to}} not only add prognostic information to currently-available microarray tests but in some circumstances even replace blood-based prognostic CTC tests at time of diagnosis for those patients already undergoing testing by multigene assays...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a data-driven prognostics method for {{the estimation of}} the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and the associated confidence value of bearings. The proposed method {{is based on the}} utilization of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) technique, and the Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models (MoG-HMM). The method relies on two phases: an off-line phase, and an on-line phase. During the first phase, the raw data provided by the sensors are first processed to extract features in the form of WPD coefficients. The extracted features are then fed to dedicated learning algorithms to estimate the parameters of a corresponding MoG-HMM, which best fits the degradation phenomenon. The generated model is exploited during the second phase to continuously assess the current health state of the physical component, and to estimate its RUL value with the associated confidence. The developed method is tested on benchmark data taken from the "NASA <b>prognostics</b> <b>data</b> repository" related to several experiments of failures on bearings done under different operating conditions. Furthermore, the method is compared to traditional time-feature prognostics and simulation results are given {{at the end of the}} paper. The results of the developed prognostics method, particularly the estimation of the RUL, can help improving the availability, reliability, and security while reducing the maintenance costs. Indeed, the RUL and associated confidence value are relevant information which can be used to take appropriate maintenance and exploitation decisions. In practice, this information may help the maintainers to prepare the necessary material and human resources before the occurrence of a failure. Thus, the traditional maintenance policies involving corrective and preventive maintenance can be replaced by condition based maintenance...|$|R
