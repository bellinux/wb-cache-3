40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} cost structures through a cost minimisation approach. Estimations reveal predicted u-shaped unit cost functions for three types of vessels participating in the Norwegian pelagic fisheries: coastal vessels, purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Interaction terms on defined vessel groups identify relative advantages in the unit cost {{of the most important}} species. Through a cost minimisation problem, we assess the potential for reductions in variable costs. The data origins from the profitability surveys conducted by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries in the period 2000 - 2014. The estimated cost functions take a polynomial form. Such a functional form is sufficiently flexible to estimate/fit a u-shaped unit cost function. OLS analyses reveal the predicted longrun cost curve for several of the species included in the estimation. For the coastal vessels, these are herring, capelin and cod and pollock. In the combined fleet of purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers,</b> we find the predicted non-linear specification of costs for blue whiting and capelin. For both fleets, a linear relationship describes the underlying structure between variable costs and output of mackerel in the final specification. This specification applies also to the output of herring in the case of purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> These differences in the predicted relationships seem consistent with the structure of the data. We find a potential reduction of variable costs of NOK 10. 5 billion in the optimal solution to the cost minimisation problem. This amount serves as an indication of the costs of certain regulations within the management system in the period. Our optimal solution disregards policy constraints such as redistribution of catches between vessel groups. nhhma...|$|E

A deterministic model is used to simulate the anchovy dynamics, with the fish stock consisting of two age groups, “young" and “old", while recruitment follows a Beverton Holt pattern. Two countries, France and Spain, harvest the resource, with two different types of gear, the purse seiner for Spain and the <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawler</b> for France. These technologies impact the different age-groups of anchovy at differing rates.

40|$|Research {{paper and}} presentationAlong the {{southern}} Sicilian coast (Central Mediterranean Sea), Sciacca harbor {{is the most}} important landing port for small pelagic fish species (manly anchovies and sardines) [1, 2]. This landing side accounts for about 2 / 3 of total catch in GFCM-FAO Geographical Sub-Area 16 (South of Sicily), where two operational units (OU) are presently active: purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> pair <b>trawlers</b> [3]. The GSA 16 fleet is composed from 46 units (31 purse seiners and 15 pelagic pair trawlers; Community Fishing Fleet Register, [URL] In both OUs, anchovy represents the main target species due to the higher market price. Although small pelagic fishes are locally quite appreciated for direct fresh consumption, landings are always totally absorbed by Sciacca transformation (canning) companies’ high demand. Consequently, local consumption of fresh fish is relatively low, also because small pelagic fish are considered “poor” when compared to the wide fish variety in Sciacca market.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the discard sampling programme of the Dutch <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawler</b> fleet in European waters in 2010. The <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawler</b> fishery targets <b>pelagic</b> species, namely herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), greater argentine (Argentina silus), and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). The annual landings of this fishery illustrates its seasonality; different species are targeted during different parts of the year. The total landings of the Dutch fleet were about 201, 000 tonnes in 2010. Horse mackerel and herring were the most abundant landed species. Overall, the discard percentage for the Dutch pelagic fleet in 2010, based on 8 sampled trips, is estimated at 6 % in weight. This is consistent with the discard percentages that have been found in previous years. However, in 2010 we did not succeed in sampling the fishery each quarter of the year; no trip was sampled in quarter 3. On board of the <b>pelagic</b> freezer <b>trawlers</b> two different discarding methods are observed, namely discarding after the catch is sorted and discarding prior to sorting. The latter includes catch that is discarded directly or via the conveyer belt from the cooling tanks, and catch that is slipped from the net. Due to practical limitations and safety issues {{it is not possible to}} sample these discards. The results show that the estimated amount of unsampled discards represent 30 % of the total estimated discards. Motivations for discarding unsampled catch can vary. Anecdotal information implies most incidents of discarding take place when more fish is caught than can be stored in the cooling tanks. In addition, fish-quality issues, unprofitable mixtures of species, or a lack in quota, could also be reasons for this discarding behaviour. The discard composition and length frequency data shown in this report are only based on routinely sorted discards. Discard percentages of target species herring, horse mackerel, and blue whiting are relatively low (1 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively). For mackerel the discard percentage is significantly higher (18 %). The present study therefore suggests that, with the exception of mackerel, this fishery is efficient, when it comes to targeting (marketable) fish...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. In multi-species fisheries, {{technical}} and social interactions between different {{components of the}} fisheries can {{make it difficult to}} maximize economic yield. Furthermore, the different fish stocks contributing to the overall catch may present different levels of natural variability leading to difficulties in determining optimal management strategies. Bio-economic performances of multi-species fisheries being subject to high levels of biological and economic uncertainty, successful fisheries management should identify and cope with risk when assessing management strategies. In this paper, bio-socio-economic performances of various management strategies under uncertainty are studied based on the French fisheries in the Gulf of Lion in the Mediterranean Sea. These multi-species and multi-gear fisheries is divided here into three main components, one including demersal trawlers exploiting especially hake (Merluccius merluccius), one including <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> used to be directed to the catch of small pelagic species (mainly anchovy Engraulis encrasicholus and sardine Sardina pilchardus) and recently reallocating effort on demersal species due to anchovy and sardine collapse and the other component consisting of small-scale fisheries. A multi-species, multi-gear bio-economic and stochastic model (Impact Assessment model for fisheries management, IAM) is used to explore the bio-socio-economic performances of the three different components of the fishery. Different management strategies are tested and compared in the context of change in fishing strategy of <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Taking into account the interactions between pelagic and demersal trawlers {{on the one hand and}} trawlers and small-scale fisheries on the other hand, the trade-offs between biological and socio-economic indicators are quantified for the different management strategies...|$|E

In order to assess the dynamics of both resource and intra-marginal rent generation, the model is evaluated under various assumptions with regard to price, cost, and discount rate. Potential total rents are measured at £ 90 - 91 million annually of which resource rent makes up about £ 89. 0 million with intra-marginal rent measured {{in the order of}} only £ 2. 0 million.

By-catch rates of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were 0. 0006 and 0. 0255 individuals per haul, respectively.

40|$|Abstract – Thirty French fleets fishing {{primarily}} in the Bay of Biscay were defined based on techno-economic input criteria: i) 18 fishing gear or gear combinations ii) the location of fishing grounds visited during a year (< 12 nautical miles from coast, beyond 12 nm or both) and iii) total vessel length (< 20 m for trawlers and other gears < 24 m). The fleets were then characterised in terms of horse power, economic dependence {{on a list of}} nine dominant commercial species (sole, Nephrops, sea bass, hake, monkfish, anchovy, cuttlefish, sardine and squid) and their contribution to the landings of these species from the Bay of Biscay. Most fleets derived the majority of their income from one or two among the nine species. Species dependencies changed little during the study period, except for those vessels targeting anchovy before the fishery restrictions starting in 2005. Fish community impacts were compared based on fleet landings’ profiles. Twelve landings profiles were determined using hierarchical cluster analysis. Fleets using similar gears had the same landings ’ profiles and therefore exercised similar pressures on the ecosystem, though not always in the same areas. The depletion of anchovy and the closure of the fishery lead to a change in landings profile for offshore <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> from anchovy dominance to one with a larger proportion of albacore and sea bass. During the study period, the overall vessel number decreased from 2163 to 1845.
