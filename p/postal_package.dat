40|$|Spatially offset Raman {{spectroscopy}} (SORS) is {{a powerful}} new technique for the non-invasive detection and identification of concealed substances and drugs. Here, we demonstrate the SORS technique in several scenarios {{that are relevant to}} customs screening, postal screening, drug detection and forensics applications. The examples include analysis of a multi-layered <b>postal</b> <b>package</b> to identify a concealed substance; identification of an antibiotic capsule inside its plastic blister pack; analysis of an envelope containing a powder; and identification of a drug dissolved in a clear solvent, contained in a non-transparent plastic bottle. As well as providing practical examples of SORS, the results highlight several considerations regarding the use of SORS in the field, including the advantages of different analysis geometries and the ability to tailor instrument parameters and optics to suit different types of packages and samples. We also discuss the features and benefits of SORS in relation to existing Raman techniques, including confocal microscopy, wide area illumination and the conventional backscattered Raman spectroscopy. The results will contribute to the recognition of SORS as a promising method for the rapid, chemically specific analysis and detection of drugs and pharmaceuticals. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|RIES is an {{evolving}} family of systems (RIES- 2004, RIES-KOA, RIES- 2008) for electronic elections via the Internet. It {{has been used}} in practice for medium scale elections for the Dutch District Water Control Boards and for expatriates in national parliament elections. We describe and analyze the security of RIES, based on the documentation made available to us. The aim is to make RIES easier to understand for all parties involved: policy makers, scientists, election officials, implementors, and the general public. This document makes explicit what the assumptions in RIES are, what kind of restrictions apply, what level of security is achieved, etc., focussing on the security aspects, both technical and organizational / procedural. RIES provides integration of Internet voting and voting by regular mail, and has been developed in that specific context. This has set the framework of requirements for the design of RIES to comparison with postal voting systems. Hence certain reasonable goals for elections (like vote freedom) have been out of scope from the start. Consequently, the general voting requirements formulated by the Korthals Altes Committee are not all satisfied: not only vote freedom but also vote integrity and confidentiality are not structurally guaranteed in the RIES design. RIES is built on certain cryptographic primitives, like one-time signatures. Keys for individual voters are generated centrally. There are no anonymous channels. The structural protection and safeguards offered by cryptography are therefore rather limited. Many of the guarantees in RIES thus rely on organizational controls, notably with respect to (voter) key generation, production of <b>postal</b> <b>packages,</b> insider attacks (especially at the server), integrity and authenticity of the software, and helpdesk procedures. RIES- 2008 is designed and built in an open spirit. Its source code and documentation will shortly be available openly for inspection and analysis. Additionally, the designers and organizers have put considerable effort in publicly explaining and discussing their system. The technical and organizational set-up seems carefully designed. There are however pragmatic elements in the system, {{such as the use of}} replacement packages, that are open to manipulation and abuse, notably by insiders. The RIES Internet election system also offers potentially dangerous ways for manipulation of elections, in principle applicable on a large scale and different from attacks on postal elections. One of the distinguishing aspects of RIES is that it allows independent recounts of the final outcome and individual checks to see if own votes have been included. This interesting and useful feature does however not compensate for the structural weaknesses. In a larger context we see RIES (esp. RIES- 2008) as a project that yields valuable hands-on experience and expertise on how to organize and run electronic elections. We do not think RIES- 2008 is a suitable system for use outside a context of postal elections, and in particular not for ‘general’ elections (like for national/European parliaments or local/regional councils). We do encourage further research, development and experiments to gain more experience in this area...|$|R
40|$|Detection of smuggled nuclear {{materials}} at transit points requires monitoring unknown samples in large closed packages. This review contends that high-confidence nuclear-material detection requires induced fission {{as the primary}} mechanism, with passive radiation screening in a complementary role. With the right equipment, even small quantities of {{nuclear materials}} are detectable with a high probability at transit points. The equipment could also be linked synergistically with detectors of other contrabond. For screening <b>postal</b> mail and <b>packages,</b> passive monitors are probably more cost-effective. When a suspicious item is detected, a single active probe could then be used. Until active systems become mass produced, this two-stage screening/interrogation role for active/passive equipment is more economic for cargo at border crossings. For widespread monitoring of nuclear smuggling, {{it will probably be}} necessary to develop a system for simultaneously detecting most categories of contraband, including explosives and illicit drugs. With control of nuclear materials at known storage sites being the first line of defense, detection capabilities at international borders could establish a viable second line of defense against smuggling...|$|R
40|$|Hub {{location}} problems (HLP) are synthetic optimization {{problems that}} appears in telecommunication and transportation networks where nodes send and receive commodities (i. e., data transmissions, passengers transportation, express <b>packages,</b> <b>postal</b> deliveries, etc.) through special facilities or transshipment points called hubs. In this paper, we consider a central mine {{and a number of}} hubs (e. g., factories) connected to a number of nodes (e. g., shops or customers) in a network. First, the hub network is designed, then, a raw materials transportation from a central mine to the hubs (i. e., factories) is scheduled. In this case, we consider only one transportation system regarded as single machine scheduling. Furthermore, we use this hub network to solve the scheduling model. In this paper, we consider the capacitated single allocation hub covering location problem (CSAHCLP) and then present the mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. Due to the computational complexity of the resulted models, we also propose two improved meta-heuristic algorithms, namely a genetic algorithm and a shuffled frog leaping algorithm in order to find a near-optimal solution of the given problem. The performance of the solutions found by the foregoing proposed algorithms is compared with exact solutions of the mathematical programming model...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{has been carried out}} in the field of depression and its relation to age and gender. This article reviews relevant literature in the field of depression, rumination and dependency and the relationships of these to age and gender. It has been shown in numerous studies that depression, rumination and dependency are related and exist in comorbidity with each other. This article also reviews some of the research that has been conducted on age and gender with relation to rumination and dependency. It has been found in relation to rumination, dependency and depression that women are more susceptible than men to these conditions in the general population. As well as the possibility that age may be the cause of difference found in the rates of depression, rumination and dependency {{research has}} found that physical illness plays a large role in predicting the occurrence of these conditions. This article looks extensively at the research on the older adult population in regards to depression, rumination and interpersonal dependency. This review also addresses the possible flaws of the studies reviewed and where future research can be focused. Depression has become a major focus in mental health in previous years and has been thought to be under-detected in an older adult population. Along with depression, maladaptive rumination and interpersonal dependency have also brought about large amounts of research in previous years but have received little attention in the older adult population. Objectives: This study looked at the relationships among depression, maladaptive rumination, adaptive rumination and interpersonal dependency in an older adult sample. It also aimed to determine whether gender differences exist across the combination of depression, maladaptive rumination, adaptive rumination and interpersonal dependency in the older adult population. Method: This study involved 116 participants over the age of 65 years. The participants responded to a <b>postal</b> questionnaire <b>package.</b> Results: The results found no significant difference in gender between the measures. The results found a strong relationship between depression and maladaptive rumination. It also found a strong relationship between depression and interpersonal dependency. Conclusions: The results suggest that gender is not a significant factor in determining depression, maladaptive rumination, adaptive rumination and/ or interpersonal dependency, in an older adult population...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in order to compare the effects of a cognitive-behavioural intervention, with a <b>postal</b> {{education}} <b>package,</b> on coping with osteoporosis. Thirty osteoporosis sufferers were divided into three groups. One group received an intervention programme consisting of education, relaxation techniques, and instruction in the use of coping strategies for pain and stress. A comparison group received an education booklet on osteoporosis sent to them through the postal system. The study also included a non-treatment control group. Measures of locus of control, depression, anxiety, pain, and disease knowledge, were taken pre-and post-intervention. lt was predicted that the intervention group would report a significant decrease in external locus of control (subdivided into chance happenings, and powerful doctor control beliefs), and an increase in internal locus of control, and in disease knowledge compared to the other two groups. A significant decrease in depression, anxiety, and pain ratings was also predicted for the intervention group compared to the comparison group and the control group. It was further predicted that their would be no relationship between the age of participants, and scores on any of the outcome measures. Analyses of variance carried out on the data revealed significant differences between the groups from baseline to follow-up on some of the measures. Depression and pain ratings decreased significantly for the intervention group compared to the other two groups. Although anxiety also showed a trend to decrease for the intervention group, this result was not significant. Both internal locus of control and disease knowledge increased significantly for the intervention group compared to the other two groups. No significant differences were found post-intervention between the groups for external locus of control. Correlational analysis revealed no significant relationship between the age of participants and any of the dependent measures. These results suggest that education delivered on an individual basis as part of a cognitive behavioural-intervention is more effective in increasing disease knowledge than an education package sent to osteoporosis sufferers through the postal system. The results further suggest that adaptation to osteoporosis can be facilitated by equipping sufferers with a repertoire of cognitive-behavioural coping strategies, and that older adults are just as likely to benefit from such an approach as their younger counterparts. The results are discussed in relation to previous research findings, and suggestions for future research are put forward. Cornwall Healthcare Trus...|$|R
