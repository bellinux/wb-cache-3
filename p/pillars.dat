5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three <b>pillars,</b> known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two <b>pillars</b> (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These <b>pillars</b> are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the <b>pillars</b> were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pillars</b> are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: <b>pillars</b> with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned <b>pillars.</b> The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some <b>pillars</b> were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in <b>pillars</b> with fine reflective properties such as the <b>pillars</b> in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pillars</b> of Eternity was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game uses {{a modified version of}} the Unity game engine made specifically for <b>Pillars</b> of Eternity. The game was directed by Josh Sawyer. There were multiple competing pitches for <b>Pillars</b> of Eternitys storyline within the studio, and the one worked on by Eric Fenstermaker and George Ziets ultimately won, after which Fenstermaker, who previously worked as a writer on the company's , was designated the game's lead narrative designer. Also involved in production were Adam Brennecke, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain. The audio director of <b>Pillars</b> of Eternity was Justin Bell, who also composed the game's score. Bell stated he was inspired by the music of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when composing the game's music.|$|E
40|$|By 1980, the U. S. mining {{community}} {{had reached a}} broad consensus regarding coal <b>pillar</b> design. The <b>pillar</b> load could be estimated from tributary area theory, and the <b>pillar</b> strength from empirical formulas and laboratory coal strength testing. Then the growth of longwall mining required new thinking. Recently, powerful design methods have emerged from analysis of large data bases of real-world <b>pillar</b> successes and failures. These include the Analysis of Retreat Mining <b>Pillar</b> Stability (ARMPS), the Analysis of Longwall <b>Pillar</b> Stability (ALPS), the Mark- Bieniawski rectangular <b>pillar</b> strength formula, and guidelines for preventing massive <b>pillar</b> collapses.

The results showed that averaging stress of horizontal <b>pillar</b> instability risk is 5. 57 ％, shear stress of horizontal <b>pillar</b> instability risk 4. 37 ％, failure ratio of horizontal <b>pillar</b> instability risk 8. 222 ％, The stability reliability of horizontal <b>pillar</b> is 82. 88 %, and the instability risk probability 17. 12 %.

The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols.

These slabs or <b>pillars</b> were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or <b>pillars</b> of the temple.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that finite-element modeling {{can be used}} to predict in situ coal <b>pillar</b> strength, especially under non ideal conditions where interface friction and roof and floor deformation are the primary controlling factors. Despite their differences in approach, empirical, analytical, and numerical <b>pillar</b> design methods have apparently converged on fundamentally similar concepts of coal <b>pillar</b> mechanics. The finite-element model results, however, are not intended to suggest a new <b>pillar</b> design criterion. Rather, they illustrate the site-specific and complex nature of coal <b>pillar</b> design and the value of using modeling procedures to account for such complex site-specific conditions. Because of the site-specific nature of coal <b>pillar</b> design, no single <b>pillar</b> design formula or model can apply in all instances. Understanding and accounting for the site-specific parameters are very important for successful coal <b>pillar</b> design. More work remains before the century-old problems related to <b>pillar</b> design are finally solved. Future research should focus on the cross-linkage of empirical, analytical, and numerical <b>pillar</b> design methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mine <b>pillar</b> design approach by combining finite element methods (FEMs), neural networks (NN) and reliability analysis.

The ore <b>pillar</b> {{had to be able}} to safely and effectively support a drilling room that occupied an open space of 3. 8 m high and 55 m long and 20 m wide and at a depth of 360 m below ground surface. Three-dimensional FEM was used to simulate the mining operations and to estimate average <b>pillar</b> compressive stress at each operation step. A <b>pillar</b> performance function was established in implicit form taking into account <b>pillar</b> strength and <b>pillar</b> dimension. NN was incorporated in the FEM to substantially reduce the number of finite element calculations in establishment of the relationship between <b>pillar</b> compressive stress and basic random variables. Trained NN was then used to generate a database for the implicit performance function. The database was used to determine the reliability index and failure probability for each trial <b>pillar</b> diameter. Relationship between <b>pillar</b> reliability index and each of the coefficients of variation of the basic random variables was used for optimal design of <b>pillar</b> diameter. The optimal <b>pillar</b> design was used in the mining construction and functioned well. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
