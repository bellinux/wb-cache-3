40|$|Although the {{wholesale}} electricity market <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> has been <b>in</b> operation {{for more than}} a decade, its functioning still remains largely unexplored in the western literature. This doctoral dissertation proposes a bottom-up model of the Russian electricity sector that enables the study of the behaviour of short-term electricity market prices and revenues of electric <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> under conditions of limited information about parameters and operational constraints of the actual electricity market. The modelling procedure covers identification of unobserved parameters of the Russian electricity system using available historical market data, modelling of generators’ offers, simulation of unit commitment and day-ahead energy market operation, and conducting a sensitivity analysis of the model results. The use of the developed market model is demonstrated by its application to study the impacts of the real-life market design and regulatory changes on profits of generators obtained from the day-ahead energy market <b>in</b> <b>Russia...</b>|$|R
