5000|$|Ayotte is {{especially}} {{well known for}} their resurrection and improvement of wooden drum hoops, developed as an aesthetic & acoustically pleasing alternative option in place of diecast zinc or flanged steel hoops, although Ayotte also still offers steel hoops. The company's tension mounts (a.k.a. [...] "lugs") assembly is also unique unusual. Using a cut-away lug housing, the traditional tension rod intersects perpendicular to a cylindrical nut (similar to rack-and-pinion) with a nylon <b>plug</b> <b>insert,</b> which once tightened with an Allen wrench makes movement of the tension rod virtually impossible, thus ensuring the drum will stay in tune longer. Ayotte's TuneLock tension system is guaranteed to be indestructible under normal use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract*The {{performance}} of six thoracic sampler types has been assessed against the CEN/ISO thoracic convention. Samplers tested included the CATHIA thoracic sampler, a modi"ed {{form of the}} SIMPEDS cyclone, the IOM thoracic sampler, the GK 2. 69 thoracic cyclone, a modi"ed IOM inhalable sampler with a foam <b>plug</b> <b>insert</b> and a modi"ed cowled sampler of the type usually used for sampling "bres. Penetration measurements were carried out using an aerodynamic particle sizer-based system with an e!ective operating range extending up to 20 km. Results of measurements on isolated samplers under calm air conditions showed the GK 2. 69 and modi"ed SIMPEDS cyclones to agree well with the thoracic convention. Measurements on internal separation e$ciency indicated that both the IOM thoracic sampler and modi"ed IOM inhalable sampler would operate close to the convention at wind speeds between 0. 5 and 4 m s~ 1. Penetration measurements on the CATHIA sampler showed it to oversample {{with respect to the}} thoracic convention, although there were small discrepancies between data from this study and measurements made elsewhere. The modi"ed cowled sampler measurements indicated that there would be signi"cant bias with respect to the thoracic convention for some lognormal aerosol distributions. However, the modi"cation was exceptionally cost e!ective, and may be worth developing further. Crown Copyright (1999 Published b...|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to isolate and purify primary murine endothelial cells from lung tissue (MLEC). The cells generated by this method were characterized by immuno-fluorescence detection and FACS analysis and expressed specific antigens including PECAM- 1, ICAM- 1, ICAM- 2, VCAM- 1 and VE-cadherin. Using this method, cells from wild-type and beta 3 -integrin-deficient animals were purified and {{used to determine the}} specificity of a novel potential anti-angiogenic drug. This study shows that tumstatin, a fragment of the alpha 3 chain of collagen IV, inhibits proliferation, inhibits total protein synthesis and specifically inhibits CAP-dependent protein synthesis in MLEC. These effects do not occur when beta 3 -null MLEC are treated with tumstatin or any of its derivatives. Nor do they occur in mouse embryonic fibroblasts which do express beta 3 integrin. The inhibition by tumstatin also occurs in in vivo angiogenesis assayed using a Matrigel <b>plug</b> <b>insert.</b> Similarly to in vitro assays, tumstatin failed to inhibit angiogenesis in beta 3 integrin-deficient animals. These results suggest that avf 33 integrin is necessary but not sufficient for the activity of tumstatin. Further studies are required to identify avf 33 integrin-associated factors in endothelial cells which determine tumstatin's endothelial cell specificity. Matrigel plug assays were also used to demonstrate that the loss of beta- 3 integrin enhanced VEGF-induced angiogenesis. Results also show that VEGF-induced angiogenesis was enhanced in aortic ring explants from beta 3 -null animals. These data suggest a new role for beta 3 integrin as a negative regulator of angiogenesis, both as a receptor for an endogenous inhibitory molecule and as an inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis. by Julie C.
