5|$|Holyoak {{provisionally}} {{placed the}} new {{species in the}} same genus as the broad-billed parrot, naming it Lophopsittacus bensoni; the name honours the English ornithologist Constantine W. Benson, {{for his work on}} birds from the Indian Ocean, and in classifying bird collections at Cambridge. Holyoak also mentioned the possibility that the remains could represent a small subspecies of Necropsittacus or a wide-beaked form of Mascarinus, but maintained that they were best considered as belonging to a distinct species. The holotype specimen is a mandibular symphysis, with the specimen number UMZC 577a. Other known remains include upper mandibles, a <b>palatine</b> <b>bone,</b> and tarsometatarsi. The species has since been excavated from the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius, from which subfossils of most of the other endemic bird species have been identified as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{hard palate}} {{is a thin}} {{horizontal}} bony plate of the skull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth. It is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla and horizontal plate of <b>palatine</b> <b>bone,</b> and spans the arch formed by the upper teeth.|$|E
25|$|The {{hard palate}} is {{formed by the}} palatine process of the maxilla and {{horizontal}} plate of <b>palatine</b> <b>bone.</b> It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth. On the anterior portion of {{the roof of the}} hard palate are the plicae, irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the larynx. This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate.|$|E

25|$|In {{the upper}} {{portion of the}} nose, the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone. Above and to the side (superolaterally), the paired nasal bones connect to the {{lacrimal}} bones, and below and to the side (inferolaterally), they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla (upper jaw). Above and to the back (posterosuperiorly), the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The vomer bone lies below and to the back (posteroinferiorly), and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx, (the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). The floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the <b>palatine</b> <b>bone,</b> {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|The Amargosa vole is {{recognized}} by the characteristic long, low profile of all voles. It has gray feet and whiskers, and its back is covered by dark, blackish fur. This subspecies has a bicolored tail that exhibits black {{on the top and}} gray on the underside. They are a sexually dimorphic species, in which the males are longer and heavier than the females of the subspecies. The dental formula of Amargosa voles is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3, meaning there is one incisor in each of the upper and lower quadrants, no canines or premolars, and three molars in each of the upper and lower quadrants. They are characterized by an opening in the <b>palatine</b> <b>bone</b> directly behind the incisors.|$|E
500|$|The type {{specimen}} is a partial skull, {{collected in the}} summer of 1884 from an outcrop of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation alongside the Red Deer River, in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the Geological Survey of Canada, led by the famous geologist Joseph Burr Tyrrell. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague Thomas Chesmer Weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species Laelaps incrassatus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892, although the name Laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to Dryptosaurus in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However, Lawrence Lambe used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of Laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904, a combination first coined by Oliver Perry Hay in 1902. Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that D. incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis, type species of Dryptosaurus, so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before. Both specimens (the holotype CMN 5600 and the paratype CMN 5601) are stored in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, Albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium, a [...] "dubious name" [...] that could only be used for the {{type specimen}} itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010, Thomas Carr established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the <b>palatine</b> <b>bone,</b> proving that Albertosaurus was a valid taxon.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>palatine</b> <b>bones</b> are {{situated}} at the back part of the nasal cavity between the maxilla and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{important}} foramina in the <b>palatine</b> <b>bones</b> that transmit nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine). The larger greater palatine foramen {{is located in}} the posterolateral region of each of the <b>palatine</b> <b>bones,</b> usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. The greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels. A smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. Both foramina are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, a {{cladistic}} analysis {{proposed a}} close relationship between pseudotooth birds and waterfowl (Anseriformes). These {{are not part of}} the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] but of the Galloanserae, a basal lineage of neognath birds. Some features, mainly of the skull, support this hypothesis. For example, the pelagornithids lack a crest on the underside of the <b>palatine</b> <b>bone,</b> while the Neoaves – the sister clade of the Galloanserae which includes the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] and the [...] "higher landbirds" [...] – have such a crest. Also, like ducks, geese and swans pelagornithids only have two and not three condyles on the mandibular process of the quadrate bone, with the middle condyle beakwards of the side condyle. Their basipterygoid articulation is similar to that of the Galloanseres. At the side of the parasphenoid , there is a wide platform as in Anseriformes. The bony-toothed birds' attachment of the coronoideal part of the external mandible adductor muscles was located at the midline, the rostropterygoid process had a support at its base and the mesethmoid bone had a deep depression for the caudal concha, just as in waterfowl.|$|E
