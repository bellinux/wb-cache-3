The index is calculated using mortgage financed transactions that are collected via the Regulated Mortgage Survey by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

It also includes analysis by region, type of buyer and type of dwelling.

We show that this measure is an upper bound for the benefit of reducing all consumption fluctuations.

To measure the marginal cost of fluctuations, we fit a variety of pricing kernels that reproduce key asset <b>pricing</b> <b>statistics.</b> We find that consumers {{would be willing to pay}} a very high price for a reduction in overall consumption uncertainty.

The report for Congress' Joint Economic Committee suggested that indexes be assigned to a federal statistical agency [...] "to obtain the attention and resources for these indexes that we believe are essential."

In their study, [...] "Price Competitiveness in World Trade," [...] Kravis and Lipsey outlined the need for such measures and the feasibility of producing them.

5000|$|Marx and Engels {{explicitly}} {{denied that}} in reality total product-value would {{be equal to}} the total of production prices (see prices of production). Such an [...] "accounting identity" [...] was ruled out {{in the real world}} by continual variations in labour productivity and because, at any time, no competitive force existed that could exactly cancel out the difference between goods sold above value and goods sold below value. It was also ruled out by the imperfections of the price-form itself, which, the fetishization of <b>price</b> <b>statistics</b> notwithstanding, permitted the expression of product-values only in an approximate way (see real prices and ideal prices). At best—Marx assumed—there was a reasonably close correspondence between total product-value and total production prices. He believed economic fluctuations implied that if some products were sold below their value, this necessarily meant that other products were sold above their value, and vice versa.The divergence between total product-values and total production prices on the whole was, Marx believed, probably not so very large, in an open, competitive market within the domestic economy, where enormous price-value discrepancies were ordinarily impossible to maintain commercially for any length of time.|$|E
5000|$|Presently, one of {{the main}} results of {{econophysics}} comprises the explanation of the [...] "fat tails" [...] in the distribution of many kinds of financial data as a universal self-similar scaling property (i.e. scale invariant over many orders of magnitude in the data), arising from the tendency of individual market competitors, or of aggregates of them, to exploit systematically and optimally the prevailing [...] "microtrends" [...] (e.g., rising or falling prices). These [...] "fat tails" [...] are not only mathematically important, because they comprise the risks, which may be on the one hand, very small such that one may tend to neglect them, but which - on the other hand - are not neglegible at all, i.e. they can never be made exponentially tiny, but instead follow a measurable algebraically decreasing power law, for example with a failure probability of only [...] where x is an increasingly large variable in the tail region of the distribution considered (i.e. a <b>price</b> <b>statistics</b> with much more than 108 data). I.e., the events considered are not simply [...] "outliers" [...] but must really be taken into account and cannot be [...] "insured away". [...] It appears that it also plays a role that near a change of the tendency (e.g. from falling to rising prices) there are typical [...] "panic reactions" [...] of the selling or buying agents with algebraically increasing bargain rapidities and volumes. [...] The [...] "fat tails" [...] are also observed in commodity markets.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{analysis}} of real estate markets has been intensified. Indeed, the demand for high quality statistics on national, euro area and EU real estate market supply and demand conditions has increased, in particular for changes in residential and commercial property prices over time. The considerable progress achieved in this area, both from the methodological and practical compilation point of view, addressed the basic requirements of availability of, residential property price indices. Similarly, work is in progress {{to set up the}} reference framework for the production of commercial property price indicators. Whilst real estate <b>price</b> <b>statistics</b> are relevant in their own, their usefulness is amplified when considering them in relation to other macroeconomic indicators such as national accounts (in particular sector accounts and financial accounts) and consumer <b>price</b> <b>statistics.</b> In addition, information on housing statistics in a broader sense encompasses other statistical sources than <b>price</b> <b>statistics</b> (national accounts, housing censuses, etc.).

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis raises important issues about {{the transmission of}} financial shocks across borders. In this paper, a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model is constructed to assess the relevance of international spillovers following a historical slowdown in U. S. equity prices. The GVAR model contains 27 country-specific models, including the United States, 17 European advanced economies, and 9 European emerging economies. Each country model {{is linked to the}} others by a set of country-specific foreign variables, computed using bilateral bank lending exposures. Results reveal considerable comovements of equity prices across mature financial markets. However, the effects on credit growth are found to be country-specific. Evidence indicates that asset prices are the main channel through which-in the short run-financial shocks are transmitted internationally, while the contribution of other variables-like the cost and quantity of credit-becomes more important over longer horizons.
