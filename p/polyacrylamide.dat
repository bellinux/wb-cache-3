5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|Bisacrylamide (N,N-Methylenebisacrylamide) (C7H10N2O2; mW: 154.17) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used cross linking agent for <b>polyacrylamide</b> gels. Chemically it {{can be thought of as}} two acrylamide molecules coupled head to head at their non-reactive ends. Bisacrylamide can crosslink two <b>polyacrylamide</b> chains to one another, thereby resulting in a gel.|$|E

30|$|High {{molecular}} weight <b>polyacrylamides</b> {{are commonly used}} friction reducers in hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. The large volumes of friction reducers (liquid volumes can {{be as high as}} four million gallons for one well), especially synthetic polymers such as <b>polyacrylamides,</b> are difficult to break and are proven to form membranes over shales and are associated with causing fracture and formation damage (Carman and Cawiezel 2007). Formation damage caused by the adsorption of <b>polyacrylamides</b> on the shale surface alters the surface properties. In this work, the study of the shale–polyacrylamide interaction focused {{on the extent to which}} <b>polyacrylamides</b> adhering to the shale can potentially cause formation damage.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>polyacrylamides,</b> gypsum, and their combination on improving {{the physical and}} chemical properties of a sodic soil was assessed in relation to the response of soybeans to such amelioration procedures. The results of a glasshouse study conducted in the 2002 - 03 summer season, clearly demonstrated that the <b>polyacrylamides</b> used either alone, or combined with gypsum, were effective in the amelioration of a sodic soil. It was also found that there was a significant beneficial effect on grain yield of soybeans when <b>polyacrylamides</b> and gypsum applications were combined. Soybean plants responded positively to such amelioration procedures. The application of <b>polyacrylamides</b> alone (10 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by 15 %, but when combined with gypsum (25 - 100 kg/ha), <b>polyacrylamides</b> increased the grain yield by 22 %. On the other hand, gypsum application alone (25 - 100 kg/ha) increased the grain yield by only 3 %. These findings suggest that sodic soils could be ameliorated with the application of a low quantity of gypsum (25 - 100 kg/ha) combined with <b>polyacrylamides</b> (10 kg/ha). This may have great impact on large-scale reclamation of sodic soils in Australia, and consequently could significantly increase crop production in these soils...|$|R

25|$|<b>Polyacrylamide</b> {{was first}} used in a {{laboratory}} setting in the early 1950s. In 1959, the groups of Davis and Ornstein and of Raymond and Weintraub independently published {{on the use of}} <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel electrophoresis to separate charged molecules. The technique is widely accepted today, and remains a common protocol in molecular biology labs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyacrylamide</b> gel {{electrophoresis}} (PAGE) {{is used for}} separating proteins {{ranging in size from}} 5 to 2,000 kDa due to the uniform pore size provided by the <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel. Pore size is controlled by modulating the concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide powder used in creating a gel. Care must be used when creating this type of gel, as acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin in its liquid and powdered forms.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are usually}} {{analyzed}} by {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), by native gel electrophoresis, by preparative gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE), or by 2-D electrophoresis.|$|E

25|$|Acrylamide {{has many}} other uses in {{molecular}} biology laboratories, {{including the use}} of linear <b>polyacrylamide</b> (LPA) as a carrier, which aids in the precipitation of small amounts of DNA. Many laboratory supply companies sell LPA for this use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyacrylamide</b> gel {{electrophoresis}} (PAGE), describes a technique {{widely used in}} biochemistry, forensics, genetics, molecular biology and biotechnology to separate biological macromolecules, usually proteins or nucleic acids, according to their electrophoretic mobility. Mobility {{is a function of}} the length, conformation and charge of the molecule.|$|E
25|$|For proteins, SDS-PAGE {{is usually}} the first choice as an assay of purity due to its {{reliability}} and ease. The presence of SDS and the denaturing step make proteins separate, approximately based on size, but aberrant migration of some proteins may occur. Different proteins may also stain differently, which interferes with quantification by staining. PAGE may {{also be used as}} a preparative technique for the purification of proteins. For example, quantitative preparative native continuous <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE) is a method for separating native metalloproteins in complex biological matrices.|$|E
30|$|In addition, Denys et al. (2001) {{proposed}} a bridging adsorption mechanism for cationic <b>polyacrylamides</b> when polymer macromolecules are stretched under high rates. This mechanism was further investigated by Chauveteau et al. (2002).|$|R
30|$|Zheng et al. (2000) {{proposed}} an empirical model to correlate {{the reduction of}} relative permeability with polymer adsorption. They found that the adsorption of hydrolyzed <b>polyacrylamides</b> on both water-wet and mild oil-wet cores induces a selective reduction of the relative permeability to water {{with respect to the}} relatively permeability to oil. In the mild oil-wet core case, wettability change was also considered to be another mechanism for the reduction of the relative permeability to water. Córdova et al. (2002) observed selective permeability reduction due to adsorbed nonionic <b>polyacrylamides</b> on mica; however, wettability alteration was not detected in this study.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyacrylamides</b> (PAM) {{are used}} in many {{countries}} {{for the improvement of}} soil physical properties. Interest among researchers in using <b>polyacrylamides</b> in Australian agriculture is steadily increasing over the past few years. Soils with hardsetting properties are widespread in Australia and render difficulties for the germination of seeds of many crops. Crop production in coarse-textured soils is limited due to low water holding capacity of these soils. Sodic soils in rice growing areas create turbidity of water that seriously affects the successful establishment of rice seedlings. This paper explores the possible applications of PAM to remedy these problems...|$|R
25|$|Traditional DNA {{sequencing}} {{techniques such}} as Maxam-Gilbert or Sanger methods used <b>polyacrylamide</b> gels to separate DNA fragments differing by a single base-pair in length so the sequence could be read. Most modern DNA separation methods now use agarose gels, except for particularly small DNA fragments. It is currently most often used {{in the field of}} immunology and protein analysis, often used to separate different proteins or isoforms of the same protein into separate bands. These can be transferred onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane to be probed with antibodies and corresponding markers, such as in a western blot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyacrylamide</b> gels are {{composed}} of a stacking gel and separating gel. Stacking gels have a higher porosity relative to the separating gel, and allow for proteins to migrate in a concentrated area. Additionally, stacking gels usually have a pH of 6.8, since the neutral glycine molecules allow for faster protein mobility. Separating gels have a pH of 8.8, where the anionic glycine slows down the mobility of proteins. Separating gels allow for the separation of proteins and have a relatively lower porosity. Here, the proteins are separated based on size (in SDS-PAGE) and size/ charge (Native PAGE).|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method is to perform a Western blot against the protein of interest—this gives information {{on the size of}} the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular lysate) is separated on a <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel, transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to horseradish peroxidase for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example proteolysis or ubiquitination, from changes in size.|$|E
30|$|Using high {{concentrations}} of TMAC is not recommended. TMAC prevents the adsorption of <b>polyacrylamides</b> and also causes excessive shrinkage of shale matrix, {{which can lead to}} a loss of mechanical strength in the wellbore.|$|R

25|$|Two-dimensional <b>Polyacrylamide</b> Electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) gels {{historically}} compared intensities from protease {{treated and}} untreated sample spots {{in order to}} identify possible candidate substrates. A more recent improvement of this technique, fluorescent 2D difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), attempts to control standardization between gels for relative quantification. Differentially labelling protease-treated and untreated samples with either Cy3 or Cy5, pooling said samples, and analyzing them together by 2D-PAGE allows substrate and cleavage products to be studied from the fluorescent gel. The spots corresponding to potentially substrate and cleavage products can be later elucidated using Mass Spectrometry or Edman Sequencing. The biggest drawbacks to using these techniques relate to the chemistry of the technique itself and its lack of sensitivity. As they rely on PAGE gels, extremely large, small, highly hydrophobic, acidic, or basic molecules will not be visualized.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, {{electrophoresis}} is {{a process}} which enables the sorting of molecules based on size. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) {{can be made to}} move through a gel made of agar or <b>polyacrylamide.</b> The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel, and a positive charge at the other end that pulls the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E
30|$|In practice, two {{commercial}} polymers, hydrolyzed <b>polyacrylamides</b> (HPAM) and xanthan gums, {{are commonly}} used in oil field applications. HPAM is a water-soluble polyelectrolyte with negative charges on the polymer chains. Xanthan gums, which are polysaccharides, show excellent viscosifying ability, high tolerance to salinity, and temperature (Guo et al. 1999).|$|R
40|$|High water {{turbidity}} levels affect the successful establishment of rice seedlings. A range of anionic <b>polyacrylamides</b> (PAM) were tested for {{their effect on}} turbidity, infiltration, germination and crop growth. Different PAM products had varying ability to reduce {{water turbidity}}. PAM {{at the rate of}} 5 kg/ha combined with gypsum at the rate of 25 kg/ha reduced turbidity below threshold levels. PAM used alone or with gypsum did not have any significant effect on infiltration through the treated soils. On the other hand, these treatments had a positive effect on the germination of soybean seeds. Plant growth rate was also improved by these treatments. Media summary Small amounts of <b>polyacrylamides</b> (PAM) in irrigation water and gypsum applied to the soil can overcome muddy water problems which seriously affect rice crop establishment in many rice growing areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} charge density of 5 {{cationic}} <b>polyacrylamides</b> (C-PAMs) and 3 anionic <b>polyacrylamides</b> (A-PAMs) in single and in dual treatments with a coagulant on the flocculation and removal of dissolved and colloidal material by {{dissolved air flotation}} (DAF) in papermaking has been studied. In single systems, good results were achieved both with low and high charge C-PAMs(1. 0 and 3. 0 – 3. 5 meq/g). In dual sy tems, high charge C-PAMs (3. 0 – 3. 5 meq/g) and A-PAMs (1. 5 meq/g), were the most efficient. Results show that monitoring flocculation by a {{focused beam reflectance measurement}} (FBRM) allows paermakers to optimize the chemical dosages to maximize the separation efficiency of DAF units either with single or dual systems, which is not always possible with traditional methods as charge titration...|$|R
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the functioning of proteins in a cell, the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes. In native <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel electrophoresis (native PAGE), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie Brilliant Blue or lithium dodecyl sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.|$|E
25|$|The analyte {{molecules}} {{in a sample}} can be partially ordered {{with respect to the}} external magnetic field of the spectrometer by manipulating the sample conditions. Common techniques include addition of bacteriophages or bicelles to the sample, or preparation of the sample in a stretched <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel. This creates a local environment that favours certain orientations of nonspherical molecules. Normally in solution NMR the dipolar couplings between nuclei are averaged out because of the fast tumbling of the molecule. The slight overpopulation of one orientation means that a residual dipolar coupling remains to be observed. The dipolar coupling is commonly used in solid state NMR and provides information about the relative orientation of the bond vectors relative to a single global reference frame. Typically the orientation of the N-H vector is probed in a HSQC like experiment. Initially, residual dipolar couplings were used for refinement of previously determined structures, but attempts at de novo structure determination have also been made.|$|E
25|$|Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphism {{was also}} {{put into practice}} during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used PCR to amplify DNA samples. It relied on variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a <b>polyacrylamide</b> gel using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by silver staining the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together {{at the top of}} the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of phylogenetic trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.|$|E
50|$|The first {{synthetic}} soil conditioners {{were introduced}} in the 1950s, when the chemical hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile was the most used. Because {{of their ability to}} absorb several hundred times their own weight in water, <b>polyacrylamides</b> and polymethacrylates (also known as hydroabsorbent polymers, superabsorbent polymers or hydrogels) were tested in agriculture, horticulture and landscaping beginning in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Polyacrylamides</b> {{are used}} in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) to improve the speed and amount of oil {{extracted}} from the reservoir. The techniques used to improve oil recovery can be straightforward polymer flooding (PF), surfactant polymer flooding (SP) or alkaline surfactant polymer flooding (ASP). The latter technique, when applicable, {{has been known to}} sweep the reservoir of 90% of the oil in place.|$|R
50|$|With {{the success}} of {{hydraulic}} fracturing, {{also referred to as}} slickwater fracturing, as a means of economically recovering unconventional gas reserves, use of polymeric friction reducers has become widespread. <b>Polyacrylamides</b> are used for their drag reducing properties on water to decrease frictional pressure losses, thereby maximizing bottom hole injection pressures allowing for a higher pressure from the same number of pump trucks.|$|R
