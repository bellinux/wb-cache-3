40|$|Important {{information}} concerning the multipolarity, spin, and <b>parity</b> <b>changes</b> in a nuclear transition may be obtained by comparing experimentally measured internal conversion coefficients with those theoretically predicted (1). In determining these conversion coefficients by taking {{the ratio of the}} number of internal conversion electrons emitted to the number of emitted gamma rays for a given transition, the gamma ray intensities usually have the largest error. Internal conversion line intensities may be measured using a magnetic spectrometer wit. h an error of one or two percent while the gamma-ray intensities are frequently in error from five to ten percent or more. Since the theoretical calculations of internal conversion coefficients are estimated to be accurate to about five percent, it is desirable to measure internal conversion coefficients with an error of not more than five percent for a meaningful comparison. Thus a means must be found to reduce the uncertainty in the gamma-ray intensity measurements. It is usually sufficient to measure relative intensities and then to compute relative internal conversion coefficients. ·By a suitable normalization procedure absolute internal conversion coefficients may be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Unequivocal {{signatures}} of Majorana zero energy modes in condensed matter systems and {{manipulation of the}} associated electron parity states are highly sought after for fundamental reasons {{as well as for}} the prospect of topological quantum computing. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a ring of Josephson coupled topological superconducting islands threaded by magnetic flux and attached to a quantum dot acts as an excellent parity-controlled probe of Majorana mode physics. As a function of flux threading through the ring, standard Josephson coupling yields a Φ_ 0 =h/(2 e) periodic features corresponding to 2 π phase difference periodicity. In contrast, Majorana mode assisted tunneling provides additional features with 2 Φ_ 0 (4 π phase difference) periodicity, associated with single electron processes. We find that increasing the number of islands in the ring enhances the visibility of the desired 4 π periodic components in the groundstate energy. Moreover as a unique characterization tool, tuning the occupation energy of the quantum dot allows controlled groundstate <b>parity</b> <b>changes</b> in the ring, enabling a toggling between Φ_ 0 and 2 Φ_ 0 periodicity.

Since gold-pegged countries traded extensively with economies operating more flexible monetary regimes and where <b>parity</b> <b>change</b> was a common adjustment device to systemic shocks, we show that such parity adjustments induced worldwide swings in nominal effective exchange rates.

40|$|Estrogen (E) {{influences}} the cognitive strategy used by female rats when solving a maze. Nulliparous rats {{with high levels}} of E tend to use an allocentric (place) strategy whereas rats with low E levels are biased towards an egocentric (response) strategy. Furthermore, striatal-dependent response learning is sensitive to dopamine (DA) transmission in that brain area, and E changes DA release in the striatum. Recent findings suggest that reproductive experience may alter how E affects DA transmission. Here the effects of E on cognitive strategy was explored in nulliparous and primiparous rats solving at-maze task, and striatal DA release was measured after administration of an indirect DA agonist (amphetamine; 0. 5 & 1 mg/kg) and an autoreceptor-activating dose of the DA agonist (apomorphine; 50 & 80 og/kg). As expected, ovariectomized (OVX) nulliparous rats receiving low 17 Ý estradiol (E 2) predominantly used a response strategy, whereas high E 2 OVX rats did not; this pattern changed in low E 2 primiparous rats. High E 2 rats receiving the lower AMPH dose exhibited greater DA release than low E 2 rats. Interestingly, there were also hemispheric differences in striatal DA response, which suggests possible lateralization in DA function.

40|$|Magnetic beta-ray spectrometers {{of several}} types {{have been used}} {{extensively}} to obtain information by the detection of low energy gamma-rays. The photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and atomic internal conversion have yielded information regarding nuclei energy level spacings, transition schemes, relative and absolute intensities of gamma radiation, and the multipole character of nuclear radiation. However, these processes have low cross sections for high energy gamma rays, so that some other process {{is necessary for the}} study of the high energy region. Pair production, unlike the secondary processes mentioned, is increasingly probable at higher gamma ray energies. Useful information can be gained by the study of the pairs produced in the external, internal, and nuclear pair formation processes. Most generally, the total energy and number of the pairs detected are used to determine energy level spacings in nuclei, and to find what gamma ray transitions occur as well as the probability for their occurrence. A potentially fruitful field of study is opened by studying internal and nuclear pairs. Information concerning the multipole character of the radiation and consequently the angular momentum and <b>parity</b> <b>changes</b> in nuclear transitions can possibly be gained by the study of internal pair formation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is single charge {{tunneling}} effects, especially parity effects, as they are manifested in quantum mechanical tunneling through a metallic island small enough to cause single electrons to block tunneling of other electrons due to Coulomb interaction. When the island is superconducting the ground state energy depends on the parity {{of the number of}} electrons on the island: outside of the condensate there will always be at least one electron contributing to the energy for an odd number of electrons and this will have observable consequences. In papers I and II a configuration with Cooper pair tunneling through an island between superconductors is studied. We show the emergence of a threshold behaviour {{at the point where the}} superconducting gap and the Coulomb energy are equal in size, as well as a change in the modulation of critical current by an external potential. These effects are results of <b>parity</b> <b>change.</b> The current from ballistic tunneling through a normally conducting metallic island is shown to be exponentially decaying with temperature. This is a manifestation of the mesoscopic nature of this kind of transport. Papers III, IV, and V all deal with a superconducting grain with normally conducting leads. The shot noise in the system is calculated in papers III and IV and we show that it is parity dependent. Noise measurements are suggested as a supplement to the study of I-V characteristics. Photon assisted tunneling is studied in paper V. We predict a <b>parity</b> <b>change</b> of the grain due to AC modulation of transport and gate bias.
