5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E

[...] The World Trade Center plans involved evicting these business owners, some of whom fiercely protested the forced relocation.

[...] On November 12, 1963, the United States Supreme Court refused to accept the case. Under the state law, the Port Authority was required to assist business owners in relocating, though many business owners regarded what the Port Authority offered as inadequate. Questions continued while the World Trade Center was constructed, as to whether the Port Authority really ought to take on the project, described by some as a [...] "mistaken social priority." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{police power}} {{is the basis for}} land-use {{planning}} authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> The court decision in the case Commonwealth v.

2500|$|The U.S. {{mortgage}} {{crisis of}} the late 2000s had a powerful impact on Richmond. Even by 2013, {{nearly half of all}} home mortgages in the city were [...] "underwater", with owners owing more than their houses were worth. On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes. McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at fair market value and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This {{case was}} {{appealed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States from a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in favor of the City of New London. The owners, including lead plaintiff Susette Kelo, sued the city in Connecticut courts, arguing that the city had misused its eminent domain power. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> is limited by the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Takings Clause reads: [...] "...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this limitation also applies to the actions of state and local governments. [...] The plaintiffs argued that economic development, the stated purpose of the taking and subsequent transfer of land to the New London Development Corporation, did not qualify as a public use under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{completion}} of the federally funded National Road in the 1810s and the state-funded Erie Canal in the 1820s (the latter of which cut transportation costs across New York by around 95%), continuing Democratic and Louisvillian opposition crippled attempts to fund a public canal in the Kentucky General Assembly. Instead, Charles Thurston of Louisville sponsored a bill to charter the private Louisville and Portland Canal Company. The charter established an initial toll of 20¢ per ton, permitted the company to operate the canal in perpetuity, and granted it <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> over land necessary to the canal's construction. The initial estimates in 1824 called for one year of construction at a cost of $300,000.|$|R

[...] Such blighted properties had been creating serious problems for returned New Orleanians, including infestations of rats and other vermin. [...] Similar actions to seize abandoned blighted property are in effect in other Louisiana parishes, as well as in Mississippi counties affected by the storm. However, as hundreds of thousands of locals were still waiting for promised insurance or Road Home money, many of the poor lacked resources to work on their houses.

If {{the goal of the}} government is to avoid costly (use of administrative resources) litigation it may have an incentive to over-appraise the residential properties. Such over-valuation would transfer the cost to taxpayers. We compare the appraised value of sixty properties taken through <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> in Clark County, Nevada to comparable properties sold in free market transactions. We find evidence of over-appraisal of the properties taken by <b>eminent</b> <b>domain.</b> By valuing individual property characteristics differently from the market, the government over-appraised properties by approximately seventeen percent. We also provide evidence that the government may use simple rules for appraising the properties, whereas the market employs more complex rules. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that the federal {{government}} and each state has the power of eminent domainthe power to take private property for [...] "public use". The Takings Clause, the last clause of the Fifth Amendment, limits the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> by requiring that [...] "just compensation" [...] be paid if private property is taken for public use. The just compensation provision of the Fifth Amendment did not originally apply directly to the states, but since Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago (1897), federal courts have {{held that the}} Fourteenth Amendment extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes [...] "public use". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.|$|E

In 1886, they dissolved their partnership and Sutherland formed a new one with Samuel Thurman, a future {{chief justice of the}} Utah Supreme Court. After running unsuccessfully as the Liberal Party candidate for mayor of Provo, Sutherland moved to Salt Lake City in 1893. There, he joined one of the state's leading law firms, and the following year was one of the organizers of the Utah State Bar Association.

The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>eminent</b> <b>domain</b> and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building.
