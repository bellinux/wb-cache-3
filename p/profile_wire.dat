50|$|A common way {{of setting}} the bristles, brush {{filament}}s, {{in the brush}} is the staple or anchor set brush in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against all of {{the walls of the}} hole and the portions of the staple nailed {{to the bottom of the}} hole. The staple can be replaced with a kind of anchor, which is a piece of rectangular <b>profile</b> <b>wire</b> that is anchored to the wall of the hole, like in most toothbrushes. Another way to attach the bristles to the surface can be found in the fused brush, in which instead of being inserted into a hole, a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface, giving the option to use different diameters of bristles in the same brush.|$|E

Both the simulation results and the measurements verify that the high impedance behaviour is successfully accomplished around the resonant frequency. In order to complete the study, return loss and radiation pattern of a horizontal dipole placed above the surfaces are analyzed. 1...|$|E
40|$|A 24  year old male {{arrived to}} our {{hospital}} after a motor cycle crash {{with evidence of}} a traumatic brain injury and in hemorrhagic shock not responsive to volume administration. Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) was performed {{in a timely fashion}} using a new, low <b>profile,</b> <b>wire</b> free device. This lead to rapid reversal of hypotension while his bleeding source was sought and controlled. Recently, REBOA has emerged as an adjunct in the hypotensive trauma patient with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. As first described, this procedure makes use of commonly available vascular surgery and endovascular products requiring large introducer sheaths (12 – 14 French) and long guidewires. Concerns regarding this technique center around the safety and feasibility of using such equipment in the emergency setting outside an angiography suite. This has likely limited widespread adoption of this technique. To address these concerns, newer products designed to be placed through a smaller sheath (7 French) and without the use of guidewires have been developed. Here we report on our first clinical use of such a device that we believe represents a significant advance in the care of the trauma patient. Keywords: REBOA, Resuscitation, Hemorrhage, Endovascula...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This study {{compared}} the mechanical properties of Profile Vortex, Profile Vortex Blue, and Race rotary files. Materials and Methods: The files {{were subjected to}} flexibility, rotating-bending (static and dynamic), and torsional resistance tests. Results: Analysis of the data obtained was performed using ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Significant difference in flexibility was observed between Profile Vortex Blue and the two other files tested (<b>Profile</b> Vortex M <b>Wire</b> and Race) (P 0. 05). In the rotatingbending tests (static and dynamic), Profile Vortex Blue presented significantly greater resistance than <b>Profile</b> Vortex M <b>Wire</b> and Race (P 0. 05). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in maximum torque among the instruments tested, as follows (in decreasing order) : Profile Vortex Blue > <b>Profile</b> Vortex M <b>Wire</b> > Race (P< 0. 05).

50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked coil rope and the full-locked coil rope always have a centre made of round wires. The locked coil ropes have one or more outer layers of <b>profile</b> <b>wires.</b> They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|R

40|$|When charged {{particles}} {{pass through a}} metal pipe, they are accompanied by an image current on the metal surface. With intense short bunches passing near or even into the metal surface, the peak image current density can be very high. This current may result in substantial temperature rise on the surface, especially in high peak current, multibunch operation. In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for the surface temperature rise due to this previously unrecognized pulsed heating effect and show that this effect dominates the proposed linear coherent light source collimator spoiler and wire scanner heating. Without proper account, it can result in component and instrument failures.

40|$|Solid {{state power}} modules are {{subjected}} to harsh environmental and operational loads. Identifying the potential design weakness and dominant failure mechanisms associated with the application is very critical to designing such power modules. Failure of the wedge-bonded wires {{is one of the}} most commonly identified causes of failures in power modules. This can occur when wires flex in response to a thermal cycling load. Since the heel of the wire is already weakened due to the ultrasonic bonding process, the flexing motion is enough to initiate a crack in the heel of the wire. Owing to the prevalence of this failure mechanism in power modules, a generalized first-order physics-of-failure based model has been developed to quantify these flexural/bending stresses. A variational calculus approach has been employed to determine the minimum energy <b>wire</b> <b>profiles.</b> The difference in curvatures corresponding to the <b>wire</b> <b>profiles</b> before and after thermal cycling provide the flexural stresses. The stresses/strains determined from the load transformation model are then used in a damage model to determine the cycles to failure. The model has been validated against temperature cycling test results. The effects of residual stresses, that are introduced during the loop formation, (on the thermal cycling life) of these wires also has been studied. It is believed that the ultrasonic wirebonding process renders the wires weaker at the heel. Efforts have been made to simulate the wirebonding mechanism using Finite element analysis. The key parameters that influence the wirebonding process are identified. Flexural stresses are determined for various heel cross-sectional profiles that correspond to different bond forces. Additional design constraints may prevent some of the wedge-bonded wires from being aligned parallel to the bond pads. The influence of having the bond pads with a non-zero width offset has been studied through finite element simulations. The 3 D minimum energy <b>wire</b> <b>profiles</b> used in the modeling has been obtained through a new energy minimization based model...|$|R
