40|$|Studies on {{osteosarcoma}} {{cell lines}} {{point to the}} potential importance of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) as an autocrine factor which controls the growth of human osteosarcomas. To define further the role of TGF beta isoforms in these neoplasms, a series of 27 osteosarcomas was studied using immunohistochemical, mRNA in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. All 14 central high-grade osteosarcomas, two telangiectatic osteosarcomas, and one high-grade surface osteosarcoma showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for TGF beta 1, - 2, and - 3. The expression of TGF beta 1 was moderate or diffuse in 14 cases (82. 3 per cent), while low expression was detected in only three cases (17. 7 per cent). For TGF beta 2 and - 3, only moderate or diffuse staining was observed. Low-grade <b>parosteal</b> and periosteal <b>osteosarcomas</b> showed low or undetectable levels of TGF beta 1, while TGF beta 2 and - 3 were moderately or diffusely expressed. Finally, three dedifferentiated <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> were diffusely positive for TGF beta 1, - 2, and - 3 in the high-grade component, while in the low-grade component, available for analysis in two of these cases, TGF beta 1 was demonstrated in a few neoplastic cells, and TGF beta 2 and - 3 maintained a diffuse distribution. Statistical analysis of these data showed that high-grade osteosarcomas had a significantly higher expression of TGF beta 1 than low-grade osteosarcomas, while levels of TGF beta 2 and - 3 were comparable {{in the two groups}} (p < 0. 001; p = 0. 3; p = 0. 3, respectively; Fisher's exact test). Similarly, mRNA levels of TGF beta 1 detected by in situ hybridization were significantly higher (p = 0. 04, Fisher's exact test) in high-grade osteosarcoma variants, while no differences were found for TGF beta 2 and - 3 mRNA (p = 1. 0; p = 0. 2, respectively; Fisher's exact test). In addition, mRNA analysis performed by RT-PCR in seven cases (five high-grade and two low-grade osteosarcomas) confirmed the presence of high levels of TGF beta 1 in high-grade osteosarcomas, while low-grade tumours had low or absent mRNA expression. In conclusion, this positive association suggests that TGF beta 1 may be involved in determining the aggressive clinical behaviour of high-grade osteosarcomas...|$|R
40|$|A polypoid fibro-osseous nodule {{arising from}} the soft tissues of a toe of a 17 yr old man is described. Initial partial {{excision}} of the nodule led to a wrong diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma. The mistaken diagnosis was based on finding an extensively ulcerated polypoid nodule with a core of fibrovascular tissue which resembled granulation tissue.

The rare lesion {{is an example of}} fibro-osseous pseudotumor of the digits, sometimes described as pseudomalignant osseous tumor of the soft tissues. It is curable by complete local resection.

40|$|Osteosarcoma, a {{bone cancer}} most {{commonly}} seen in {{adolescents and young}} adults, is usually a high-grade malignancy characterized by a very high risk {{for the development of}} pulmonary metastases. High-grade osteosarcomas are usually treated by preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy and surgery, with a very limited number of active agents available. Rarer lower-grade variants such as <b>parosteal</b> and periosteal <b>osteosarcoma</b> or low-grade central osteosarcoma are treated by surgery only. Imaging to search for possible metastases focuses on the lung. Computed tomography is the most sensitive method but cannot reliably distinguish small metastases from benign lesions. Advances of local imaging and surgical reconstruction now allow the use of limb-salvage in an ever-increasing proportion of patients. While still troubled by complications, non-invasive endoprosthesis-lengthening mechanisms have led to an increased uptake of limb-salvage, even for young, skeletally immature patients. Radiotherapy is employed when osteosarcomas cannot be removed with clear margins, but very high doses are required, and both proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy are under investigation. Unfortunately, the past 30 years have witnessed few, if any, survival improvements. Novel agents have not led to universally accepted changes of treatment standards. In patients with operable high-grade osteosarcomas, the extent of histological response to preoperative chemotherapy is a significant predictive factor for both local and systemic control. Attempts to improve prognosis by adapting postoperative treatment to response, recently tested in a randomized, prospective setting by the European and American Osteosarcoma Study Group, have not been proven to be beneficial. Many agree that only increased knowledge about osteosarcoma biology will lead to novel, effective treatment approaches and will be able to move the field forward...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the imaging findings in cases of <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> dedifferentiated into telangiectatic osteosarcoma. <b>Parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> is a low-grade well-differentiated malignant tumor. Dedifferentiation into a more aggressive lesion is frequent and usually visible on imaging as a central lytic area in a sclerotic mass. Only one case of differentiation into a telangiectatic osteosarcoma has been reported. As it has practical consequences, with a need for aggressive chemotherapy, we looked for this rather typical imaging pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of 199 cases of surface osteosarcomas (including 86 parosteal, of which 23 were dedifferentiated) revealed lesions suggesting a possible telangiectatic osteosarcoma on imaging examinations in five cases (cavities with fluid). Histology confirmed three cases (the two other only had hematoma inside a dedifferentiated tumor). There were three males, aged 24, 28, and 32. They had radiographs and CT, and two an MR examination. RESULTS: Lesions involved the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. The <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> was a sclerotic, regular mass, attached to the cortex. A purely lytic mass, partially composed of fluid cavities was easily detected on CT and MR. It involved the medullary cavity twice, and remained outside the bone once. Histology confirmed the two components in each case. Two patients died of pulmonary metastases and one is alive. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of this highly suggestive pattern should help guide the initial biopsy to diagnose the two components of the tumor, and guide aggressive treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective <b>Parosteal</b> <b>{{osteosarcoma}}</b> is a well-differentiated {{variant of}} osteosarcoma {{that affects the}} surface of the bone. The imaging pattern is very typical. We report two cases mimicking an osteochondroma, radiologically and histologically and propose an explanation. Material The review of 86 parosteal osteosarcomas of bone revealed this atypical pattern only once. A consultation case was received in the same time, and added to ours. Patients were 28 years old and 56 years old females. Imaging studies included two radiographs, two CTscans, one MRI examination and one bone scan and the results were compared to histology. Results On imaging, both lesions presented as ossified lobulated masses attached with a broad base to the underlying cortex. No radiolucent cleft separated the masses and the host bone and cortex continuity between the mass and the femur was seen, with medullary communication. The marrow of the mass had a different density and intensity compared to normal marrow. So, there were features of an osteochondroma (cortex and medullary continuity) and of a <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> (ossified marrow). Pathological assessment on the final specimen confirmed the presence of low-grade parosteal osteosarcomas, after an erroneous diagnosis of osteochondroma on the initial biopsy. Conclusions <b>Parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> can be rarely confused with osteochondroma. A radiologic-pathologic correlation is essential. Cortex continuity is the most misleading imaging feature that may occur in parosteal osteosarcomas. A knowledge of this misleading pattern will help diagnose the lesion from the beginning. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background:Parosteal {{osteosarcoma}} is rare low-grade malignancy which arises on {{the surface}} of the metaphysis of long bones;it has a low propensity to metastasize. Different surgical treatment options including marginal resection, wide resection and amputation were recommended for the tumor. The purpose of the study was to assess the results of different surgical treatment of the lesion. Methods: Thirty five consecutive patients with <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> were   managed with four surgical techniques (Marginal resection, wide resection and prosthesis, wide resection and allograft application, and amputation) between 1378 - 1387, and the results were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age of the patients when the surgery was performed was 30. 37 (range, eleven to seventy one years), and the mean duration of postoperative follow - up was 51 months (range, eight months to ten years). Results: The mean time between the onset of symptoms and initial physician encounter was 15. 98 months (range, 1. 5 months to 60 months). None of the patients had metastasis preoperatively while three pulmonary metastases were detected postoperatively. Six patients had regional tumor recurrence postoperatively. The mean time of the recurrence postoperatively was 18. 8 months (range, nine months to forty eight months). Three of thirty five patients assessed in the study died of pulmonary metastasis. All had dedifferentiated grading with different staging (Two patients had a stage of IIB and one with IIA). Medullary invasion was seen in one of them. One of   the three patients was treated with Indomethacin for two years due to the misdiagnosisof myositis ossificans.

We applied these techniques to primary osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma of bone using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database for all cases of osteosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma of bone from 1993 through 2010. Secondary neoplasms were excluded. The age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, and anatomic location were collected. The time (xt) of the insult/triggering event was calculated using the best fit frequency distribution of age at diagnosis. There were 4, 356 patients with osteosarcoma and 1, 832 patients with Ewing’s sarcoma.

Results: Seven patients were male (38. 9 %) and 11 were female (61. 1 %) with mean age of 25 years (range from 16 to 55 years). Eleven lesions were in the femur and 7 in the tibia. We identified 11 <b>parosteal</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> (six of them were dedifferentiated), 3 periosteal osteosarcoma and 4 high grade surface osteosarcoma. Six patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and all lesions had surgical resection. Margins were wide in 15 cases and intra lesional in 3 cases.

Six patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and all lesions had surgical resection. Margins were wide in 15 cases and intra lesional in 3 cases. Histological response to chemotherapy was poor in all cases. The mean follow up was 34. 5 months. Six patients (33. 3 %) presented local recurrence and 8 patients (44. 4 %) presented lung metastases. Six patients (33. 3 %) died from the disease after a mean follow up of 12 months (6 – 30 months); all of them had high grade lesions. ConclusionHistological grade of malignancy is the main point to assess in surface osteosarcoma since it determines treatment and prognosis. Low grade lesions should be treated by wide resection, while high grade lesions need more aggressive surgical approach associated to post operative chemotherapy...|$|E
