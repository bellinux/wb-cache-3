40|$|A {{competing}} {{market model}} with a polyvariant profit function that assumes "zeitnot" stock behavior of clients is formulated within the banking portfolio medium and then analyzed {{from the perspective of}} devising optimal strategies. An associated Markov process method for finding an optimal choice strategy for monovariant and bivariant profit functions is developed. Under certain conditions on the bank "promotional" parameter with respect to the "fee" for a missed share <b>package</b> <b>transaction</b> and at an asymptotically large enough portfolio volume, universal transcendental equations - determining the optimal share package choice among competing strategies with monovariant and bivariant profit functions - are obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{suggests}} {{a method for}} marshalling floating point numbers in network computing based on the bit-level converting subroutines. Such subroutines are building blocks of hybrid conversion protocols. The method provides speed that is required by real time and transaction applications. A library of conversion subroutines is implemented that could be linked to different applications on different computers. The library is incorporated in commercial <b>transaction</b> <b>packages.</b> Key words: marshaling, floating point conversio...|$|R
50|$|The Robin Hood tax {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a <b>package</b> of financial <b>transaction</b> taxes (FTT) proposed by a campaigning group of civil society non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Campaigners have suggested the tax could be implemented globally, regionally or unilaterally by individual nations. Conceptually similar to the Tobin tax, it would affect {{a wider range of}} asset classes including the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, commodities, unit trusts, mutual funds, and derivatives such as futures and options. The Tobin tax was proposed for foreign currency exchange only.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{considers}} {{the problems in}} providing real-time decision ­support to managers using our observations of the distribution process in {{a case study of}} a multinational manufacturing firm. This firm is characterised by its ­reliance on an ERP (enterprise resource planning) <b>package</b> for <b>transaction</b> ­processing, but is also known for its use of more complex technical architectures for ­decision support. Our observations reveal that, despite the existence of a ­standardised and centralised ERP architecture, aligning this real-time transaction processing system with the reality of doing business is subject to constraints arising from both the business and virtual context of the firm. We explain the gradual and inevitable emergence of gaps between the inflexible ERP system and the decision support needs of managers. On the basis of the case studied, we conclude with a theoretical framework for the relationship between real-time transaction processing and decision support, differentiating between an information processing level and a decision process level...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of his}} September State of the Union speech, President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso officially {{proposed}} an upgraded <b>package</b> of <b>transaction</b> taxes for adoption by the EU, now projected to raise up to €55bn ($75bn) per year. Also in September, Bill Gates presented his preliminary findings to the 2011 IMF & World Bank meeting {{in support of the}} Robin Hood tax. Gates's proposal is for a set of taxes which could raise between $48-250bn per year. Unlike Barroso's proposal, Gates is advocating the tax be adopted on a G20 wide bases rather than for just the EU, and Gate's plan is geared more towards raising funds for aid and development rather than for regular public spending and repairing government finances. Various British business, banks and economists such as Howard Davies have attacked the EU proposal saying it would be bad for growth and would harm the economy. Mark Lawson for the Robin Hood campaign responded to developments by saying [...] "Game on!".|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} design and {{implementation}} of a suite of functions for solving symmetric indefinite linear systems associated with mixed approximation of systems of PDEs. The novel feature of our iterative solver is the incorporation of error control in the natural "energy" norm in combination with an a posteriori estimator for the PDE approximation error. This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated {{as soon as the}} algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a "proof of concept" MATLAB implementation of this algorithm and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) <b>package</b> (cf. ACM <b>Transactions</b> on Mathematical Software 33, Article 14, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} multiple-site {{acquisitions}} by international terminal operators (ITOs). A multiple-site acquisition is an external growth strategy {{focusing on the}} simultaneous take-over of an entire terminal portfolio {{as part of a}} unique transaction. The paper presents a theoretical framework about how spatial and temporal dimensions of foreign expansion are influenced by these multiple-site acquisitions. It also analyses the impact of multiple acquisitions on the sustainable growth of firms by focusing on the <b>transaction</b> <b>package</b> problem, the locational diversity problem and the irregular growth path problem. The proposed theoretical arguments are illustrated and supported by an analysis of a comprehensive global terminal-specific dataset related to the 1997 - 2010 period, and case studies on strategic market entry behaviour of two major ITOs...|$|R
40|$|Gold {{loans or}} {{deposits}} are undertaken by monetary authorities {{to obtain a}} non-holding gain return on gold. The physical stock of gold is "lent to " or "deposited with " a financial institution (such as a bullion bank) or another party in the gold market (such as an intermediary for a gold dealer or gold miner with a temporary shortage of gold). In return, the borrower may provide the monetary authority with high quality collateral, but no cash, and will make a series of payments, known as lease payments. The party who borrows the gold from a monetary authority may in turn "lend " the gold to a dealer or miner. This ability to on-lend indicates that, while the <b>package</b> of <b>transactions</b> which makes up a gold loan is clearly very different from an outright sale of the gold, the rights and privileges associated with ownership of the gold have changed from the monetary authority to the borrower. The loan or deposit may be placed on demand or for a fixed period. The amount of gold to be returned {{is based on the}} volume initially lent, regardless of any changes in the gold price. The security and liquidity aspects of the monetary authority's gold loan claims on the depository corporations are regarded as a substitute for physical gold, such that the loan values ar...|$|R
40|$|LifeCode ™ (patent pending) is a Natural Language Processing and Expert System that {{extracts}} {{demographic and}} clinical information from free-text clinical records. The initial application of LifeCode {{is for the}} Emergency Medicine clinical specialty. An application for Diagnostic Radiology is now in beta-test. A pilot program for performing data mining on acute care clinical records has been completed. The LifeCode NLP engine uses {{a large number of}} specialist readers whose particular outputs are combined at various levels to form an integrated picture of the patient’s medical condition(s), course of treatment and disposition. The LifeCode Expert System performs the tasks of combining complementary information, deleting redundant information, assessing the level of medical risk and level of service represented in the clinical record and producing an output that is appropriate for input to an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system or a billing system. Because of the critical nature of the tasks, LifeCode has a unique “self-awareness ” feature that enables it to recognize the limits of its competence and thus ask for assistance from a human expert when faced with information that is beyond the bounds of its competence. The LifeCode NLP and Expert Systems are wrapped as DCOM servers and reside in various delivery <b>packages</b> including On-Line <b>Transaction</b> Processing (OLTP), a web-browser interface and an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) interface...|$|R
40|$|INSTANT is the INL's next {{generation}} neutron transport solver to support high-fidelity multi-physics reactor simulation INSTANT is in continuous development {{to extend its}} capability Code is designed {{to take full advantage}} of middle to large cluster (10 - 1000 processors) Code is designed to focus on method adaptation while also mesh adaptation will be possible. It utilizes the most modern computing techniques to generate a neutronics tool of full-core transport calculations for reactor analysis and design. It can perform calculations on unstructured 2 D/ 3 D triangular, hexagonal and Cartesian geometries. Calculations can be easily extended to more geometries because of the independent mesh framework coded with the model Fortran. This code has a multigroup solver with thermal rebalance and Chebyshev acceleration. It employs second-order PN and Hybrid Finite Element method (PNHFEM) discretization scheme. Three different in-group solvers - preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, preconditioned Generalized Minimal Residual Method (GMRES) and Red-Black iteration - have been implemented and parallelized with the spatial domain decomposition in the code. The input is managed with extensible markup language (XML) format. 3 D variables including the flux distributions are outputted into VTK files, which can be visualized by tools such as VisIt and ParaView. An extension of the code named INSTANTHPS provides the capability to perform 3 D heterogeneous transport calculations within fuel pins. C 5 G 7 is an OECD/NEA benchmark problem created to test the ability of modern deterministic transport methods and codes to treat reactor core problems without spatial homogenization. This benchmark problem had been widely analyzed with various code <b>packages.</b> In this <b>transaction,</b> results of the applying the INSTANT-HPS code to the C 5 G 7 problem are summarized...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} main claims to unwind {{substantive}} transactions that could unjustly enrich some creditors' {{at the expense}} of others. First, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 declare every transaction void which is entered after the presentation of a winding up petition, unless approved by a court. In Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd Buckley LJ held that courts would habitually approve all contracts that were plainly beneficial to a company entered into in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The predominant purpose of the provision is to ensure unsecured creditors are not prejudiced, and the company's assets are not unduly depleted. However, in Re Gray's Inn because a host of transactions honoured by the company's bank, in an overdrawn account, between the presentation and the winding up petition were being granted, this meant unprofitable trading. So, the deals were declared void. In Hollicourt (Contracts) Ltd v Bank of Ireland, the Court of Appeal held that a bank itself which allows overpayments will not be liable to secondarily creditors if transactions are subsequently declared void. It took the view that a bank is not unjustly enriched, despite any fees for its services the bank may receive. Second, under IA 1986 section 238, transactions at an undervalue may be avoided regardless of their purpose, but only up to two years before the onset of insolvency. For example, in Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd the liquidators of an insolvent company, AJ Bekhor Ltd, claimed rescind the transfer of assets to a subsidiary, whose shares were then purchased by the investment management house Brewin Dolphin for £1. The only other consideration given by Brewin Dolphin was the promise to carry out a lease agreement for computers, which itself was likely to be unwound and therefore worthless. The House of Lords held that the total <b>package</b> of connected <b>transactions</b> could be taken into account to decide whether a transaction was undervalued or not, and held that this one was.|$|R
