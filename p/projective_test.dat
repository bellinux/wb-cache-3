25|$|In the 1960s, {{research}} by psychologists Loren and Jean Chapman showed {{that at least}} some of the apparent validity of the Rorschach was due to an illusion. At that time, the five signs most often interpreted as diagnostic of homosexuality were 1) buttocks and anuses; 2) feminine clothing; 3) male or female sex organs; 4) human figures without male or female features; and 5) human figures with both male and female features. The Chapmans surveyed 32 experienced testers about their use of the Rorschach to diagnose homosexuality. At this time homosexuality was regarded as a psychopathology, and the Rorschach was the most popular <b>projective</b> <b>test.</b> The testers reported that homosexual men had shown the five signs more frequently than heterosexual men. Despite these beliefs, analysis of the results showed that heterosexual men were just as likely to report these signs, which were therefore totally ineffective for determining homosexuality. The five signs did, however, match the guesses students made about which imagery would be associated with homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|The House-Tree-Person test (HTP) is a <b>projective</b> <b>test</b> {{designed}} to measure aspects of a person's personality. [...] The test {{can also be used}} to assess brain damage and general mental functioning. By virtue of being a <b>projective</b> <b>test,</b> the results of the HTP are subjective and open to interpretation by the administrator of the exam. HTP was designed by John Buck and was originally based on the Goodenough scale of intellectual functioning. Buck included both qualitative and quantitative measurements of intellectual ability in the HTP (V). A 350-page manual was written by Buck to instruct the test-giver on proper grading of the HTP, which is more subjective than quantitative.

50|$|Interpretations of all <b>projective</b> <b>tests</b> {{should be}} made with caution, and the {{limitations}} of <b>projective</b> <b>tests</b> should be considered. It is generally {{a good idea to}} use <b>projective</b> <b>tests</b> as part of an overall test battery. There is little professional support for the use of figure drawing, so the examples that follow should be interpreted with caution. In particular, in forensic situations, the use of the KFD and other <b>projective</b> <b>tests</b> may be unethical or illegal depending on the jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Projective</b> <b>testing</b> {{became a}} growth {{industry}} {{in the first half}} of the 1900s, with doubts about the theoretical assumptions behind <b>projective</b> <b>testing</b> arising in the second half of the 1900s. Some <b>projective</b> <b>tests</b> are used less often today because they are more time consuming to administer and because the reliability and validity are controversial.|$|R
25|$|<b>Projective</b> <b>tests</b> assume {{personality}} is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how {{they respond to}} an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. <b>Projective</b> <b>tests</b> have been in use for about 60 years {{and continue to be}} used today.

2500|$|The Rorschach inkblot test uses pareidolia in {{an attempt}} to gain insight into a person's mental state. The Rorschach is a <b>projective</b> <b>test,</b> as it {{intentionally}} elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are [...] "projected" [...] onto the ambiguous inkblot images.

2500|$|Skinner {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} criticized for his supposed animosity towards Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis, and psychodynamic psychology. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, {{and that he}} was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of defense mechanisms, such as repression. To study such phenomena, Skinner even designed his own <b>projective</b> <b>test,</b> the [...] "verbal summator" [...] described above.|$|E
2500|$|The Rorschach test is a {{psychological}} test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test {{to examine a}} person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where [...] patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly. The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. In the 1960s, the Rorschach was {{the most widely used}} <b>projective</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

2500|$|When {{interpreted}} as a <b>projective</b> <b>test,</b> results are poorly verifiable. The Exner system of scoring (also known as the [...] "Comprehensive System") is meant to address this, and has all but displaced many earlier (and less consistent) scoring systems. It makes heavy use of what factor (shading, color, outline, etc.) of the inkblot leads {{to each of the}} tested person's comments. Disagreements about test validity remain: while the Exner proposed a rigorous scoring system, latitude remained in the actual interpretation, and the clinician's write-up of the test record is still partly subjective.|$|E
2500|$|Rorschach never {{intended}} the inkblots {{to be used}} as a general personality test, but developed them as a tool for the diagnosis of [...] schizophrenia. It was not until 1939 that the test was used as a <b>projective</b> <b>test</b> of personality, a use of which Rorschach had always been skeptical. Interviewed in 2012 for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Rita Signer, curator of the Rorschach Archives in Bern, Switzerland, suggested that far from being random or chance designs, each of the blots selected by Rorschach for his test had been meticulously designed to be as ambiguous and [...] "conflicted" [...] as possible.|$|E

5000|$|An {{objective}} test is a psychological test that measures an individual's characteristics independent of rater bias or the examiner's own beliefs, usually {{by the administration}} of a bank of questions marked and compared against exacting scoring mechanisms that are completely standardized, much {{in the same way}} that examinations are administered. Objective tests are often contrasted with <b>projective</b> <b>tests,</b> which are sensitive to rater's or examiner's beliefs. <b>Projective</b> <b>tests</b> are based on Freudian Psychology (Psychoanalysis) and seek to expose the unconscious perceptions of people. Objective tests tend to have more validity than projective tests; however, they are still subject to the willingness of the examinee to be open about his/her personality and as such can sometimes be badly representative of the true personality of the subject. <b>Projective</b> <b>tests</b> purportedly expose certain aspects of the personality of individuals that are impossible to measure by means of an {{objective test}}, and are much more reliable at uncovering [...] "protected" [...] or unconscious personality traits or features.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the single}} most {{successful}} methods for accessing personality disorders by researchers of normal personality functioning is the self-report inventory following up with a semi-structured interview. There are some disadvantages with the self-report inventory method that with histrionic personality disorder there is a distortion in character, self-presentation, and self-image. This cannot be assessed simply by asking most clients if they match the criteria for the disorder.
