Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (<b>Podicipedidae)</b> and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{describe}} the first occurrence in {{the fossil record}} of an aquatic avian twig-nest with five eggs in situ (Early Miocene Tudela Formation, Ebro Basin, Spain). Extensive outcrops of this formation reveal autochthonous avian osteological and oological fossils that represent a single taxon identified as a basal phoenicopterid. Although the eggshell structure is definitively phoenicopterid, the characteristics of both the nest and the eggs {{are similar to those}} of modern grebes. These observations allow us to address the origin of the disparities between the sister taxa <b>Podicipedidae</b> and Phoenicopteridae crown clades, and traces the evolution of the nesting and reproductive environments for phoenicopteriforms. Methodology/Principal Findings: Multi-disciplinary analyses performed on fossilized vegetation and eggshells from the eggs in the nest and its embedding sediments indicate that this new phoenicopterid thrived under a semi-arid climate in an oligohaline (seasonally mesohaline) shallow endorheic lacustine environment. High-end microcharacterizations including SEM, TEM, and EBSD techniques were pivotal to identifying these phoenicopterid eggshells. Anatomical comparisons of the fossil bones with those of Phoenicopteriformes and Podicipediformes crown clades and extinct palaelodids confirm that this avian fossil assemblage belongs to a new and basal phoenicopterid. Conclusions/Significance: Although the Podicipediformes-Phoenicopteriformes sister group relationship is now wel...|$|E
40|$|Remarkable {{changes in}} waterbird numbers were {{recorded}} in South Bohemia during the 1980 s. The decline in numbers of most duck species and many other aquatic bird species (such as <b>Podicipedidae,</b> Rallidae,, Larus ridi-bundus) was obviously the most important change recorded on South Bohemian fishponds during the irst half of the 1980 s.

Increasing mortality (due to botulism) was recorded in many waterfowl species, and an increase of the non-breeding component {{of the population was}} found in ducks, but no changes {{were recorded in}} reproductive parameters (brood size, clutch size, breeding success). A shift to field habitats was recorded in breeding waders. Possible causes affecting the abundance of particular waterbird species are discussed: these include changes in management of surrounding landscape, drainage of wetlands in the vicinity of fishponds (ducks, waders), changes in littoral stands (ducks, waders, passerines), water level fluctuation (Anser anser, waders, passerines), gradual coverage of islets by shrubs and trees (ducks), increase of fish stock (ducks).

40|$|A parsimony {{optimization}} of {{the presence}} of high-frequency flapping flight onto a phylogeny of 29 species of birds shows that this is a derived character state that has been acquired at least four independent times: by the last common ancestor of Alcidae, that of <b>Podicipedidae,</b> that of Anatidae, and that of Rallidae. Cineradiographic analysis has shown that the furculae of birds underwent extraordinary deformations during the wingbeat cycle. Cyclical deformations are known to produce microfractures in the bone tissue, which may be a stimulus for Haversian remodelling, a mechanism of resorption and reconstruction of bone tissue that may repair bone microdamage. In the present study, we performed a comparative analysis in a phylogenetic context to test the effect of the frequency of cyclical deformations and body mass on the rate of Haversian remodelling in the furculae of birds. A variation partitioning analysis showed that the type of flight (high-frequency flapping flight vs. other kinds of flight of lower wing beat frequency) and body mass explained a significant portion of Haversian bone density (the outcome of Haversian remodelling) and that the phylogeny also explained a significant part of this variation. This phylogenetic signal on Haversian bone density variation may be the outcome of phylogenetic signal on the proximate causes producing Haversian remodelling...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} seasonal water level changes on two foraging guilds of water-related bird species in a remnant coastal wetland of central Italy. Data were obtained by point count method. During the seasonal water-level decrease in wetland channels, the Diversity Index and Species Richness of the entire assemblage dropped significantly between May and July. A significant {{decrease in the number}} of species was observed in the middle of May, attributed to decreasing water levels related to natural (climatic) and anthropogenic (local fish farming) causes, and the subsequent drying of surrounding marshes and meadows. A first phenological threshold was observed in May, when the water level decreased to 70 cm in channels. A high species turnover occurred in the entire assemblage during this period. The herbivorous-omnivorous species (Anatidae and Rallidae) and zoophagous species (Ardeidae and <b>Podicipedidae)</b> during the study period exhibited opposite trends in the diversity index values. The diversity index progressively decreased for the herbivorous-omnivorous species in the late spring, while increasing for the zoophagous species, due to a greater availability of food (increased fish density due to decreased water level). These contrasting results are a consequence of ecological and phenological (sedentary vs. migrants) traits of the species belonging to these guilds. These data represent useful information for elaborating management strategies focused on the water level regime in Mediterranean small wetlands in which fish-farming activities also occur...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} so called "land-bridge island" or "nested-subsets" theory to test the {{resilience}} of a highly fragmented and perturbated waterbird metacommunity, after legal protection of 18 wetlands in the western Mediterranean. Sites were monitored during 28 years and two seasons per year. The metacommunity was composed by 44 species during breeding and 67 species during wintering, including shorebirds, ducks, herons, gulls and divers (<b>Podicipedidae).</b> We identified a strong nested pattern. Consistent {{with the fact that}} the study system was to a large extent a spatial biogeographical continuous for thousands of years, fragmented only during the last centuries due to human activities. Non-random selective extinction was the most likely historical process creating the nested pattern, operated by the differential carrying capacity (surface-area) of the remaining sites. We also found a positive temporal trend in nestedness and a decreasing trend in species turnover among sites (β-diversity), indicating that sites are increasingly more alike to each other (i. e. increased biotic homogenization). This decreasing trend in β-diversity was explained by an increasing trend in local (α) diversity by range expansion of half the study species. Regional (γ) diversity also increased over time, indicating that colonization from outside the study system also occurred. Overall our results suggest that the study metacommunity is recovering from historical anthropogenic perturbations, showing a high long-term resilience, as expected for highly vagile waterbirds. However, not all waterbird groups contributed equally to the recovery, with most breeding shorebird species and most wintering duck species showing no geographical expansion...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} length {{proportions of}} the three bony elements of the pelvic (femur, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus) and pectoral (humerus, ulna and manus) limbs of the early Cretaceous bird Gansus yumenensis, a well-represented basal ornithuromorph from China, are investigated and compared to those of extant taxa. Ternary plots show that the pectoral limb length proportions of Gansus are most similar to Apodiformes (swifts and humming-birds), which plot away from all other extant birds. In contrast, the pelvic limb length proportions of Gansus fall within the extant bird cluster and show similarities with the neornithine families <b>Podicipedidae</b> (grebes), Diomedeidae (albatross) and Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants). Although it does {{have some of the}} pelvic limb features of grebes and cormorants, the femur of Gansus is more gracile and is thus more consistent with an albatross-like shallow-diving mode of life than a strong foot-propelled diving movement pattern. The position of Gansus in pectoral limb ternary morpho-space is largely due to its elongated manus. In contrast to apodiformes, where the humerus and ulna are short and robust, an adaptation, which provides a stiff wing for their demanding fast agile and hovering flight(respectively), the wing-bones of Gansus are slender, indicating a less vigorous flapping flight style. The suite of characters exhibited by Gansus mean it is difficult to completely interpret its likely ecology. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest that it is probable that this bird was both volant and capable of diving to some degree using either foot-propelled or, perhaps, both its wings and its feet for underwater locomotion...|$|E
40|$|We {{dissected}} carcasses of neonates {{belonging to}} {{ducks and geese}} (Anatidae; 8 species), shorebirds (Charadriidae and Scolopacidae; 12 species), gulls and terns (Laridae; 3 species), and nonanseriform water birds (<b>Podicipedidae</b> and Rallidae; 2 species) ranging in yolk-free lean wet body mass from 2. 5 to 70 g. We have fitted allometric relationships between the lean wet mass of each component and the lean wet yolk-free neonatal body mass. The exponents of the relationships of the brain mass (0. 73) or head mass (0. 85) to neonatal body mass were significantly lower than 1. The exponents {{did not differ significantly}} from 1 for the heart, whole leg, leg bone, liver, intestines, pectoral muscles, skin, stomach, wings, feathers, yolk (wet and dry), and remainder of the body. The exponent for leg muscle mass (1. 18) was significantly higher than 1. This suggests that larger chicks may have a higher potential for thermogenic heat production. At a given body mass, no differences could be detected with respect to the lean fresh leg muscle mass among ducklings, shorebirds, and the nonanseriform water birds. However, the high fractional lipid-free dry lean matter content of the leg muscles of ducklings (which might represent a high amount of contractile proteins in these muscles) could explain their observed high thermogenic heat production in response to cold stress. The exponents of feather mass and lean wet skin mass to body mass were significantly higher than 0. 67 (i. e. surface-to-volume relationship of a sphere), in accordance with our previous finding that large neonates have a relatively lower minimal thermal conductance per unit surface area than smaller chicks...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © The Natural History Museum 2007 Abundant fossil bird {{bones from}} the lower Bannockburn Formation, Manuherikia Group, an Early-Middle Miocene {{lacustrine}} deposit, 16 – 19 Ma, from Otago in New Zealand, reveal the “St Bathans Fauna” (new name), a first Tertiary avifauna of land and freshwater birds from New Zealand. At least 23 species of birds are represented by bones, and probable moa, Aves: Dinornithiformes, by eggshell. Anatids dominate the fauna with four genera and five species described as new: a sixth and largest anatid species is represented by just one bone. This is the most diverse Early-Middle Miocene duck fauna known worldwide. Among ducks, two species of dendrochenines are most numerous in the fauna, but a tadornine is common as well. A diving petrel (Pelecanoididae: Pelecanoides) is described, so extending the geological range of this genus worldwide from the Pliocene to the Middle Miocene, at least. The remaining 16 taxa are left undescribed but include: a large species of gull (Laridae); two small waders (Charadriiformes, genus indet.), the size of Charadrius bicinctus and Calidris ruficollis, respectively; a gruiform represented by one specimen similar to Aptornis; abundant rail (Rallidae) bones, including a common flightless rail and a rarer slightly larger taxon, {{about the size of}} Gallirallus philippensis; an ?eagle (Accipitridae); a pigeon (Columbidae); three parrots (Psittacidae); an owlet nightjar (Aegothelidae: Aegotheles sp.); a swiftlet (Apodidae: Collocalia sp.); and three passerine taxa, of which the largest {{is a member of the}} Cracticidae. The absence of some waterbirds, such as anserines (including swans), grebes (<b>Podicipedidae)</b> and shags (Phalacrocoracidae), among the abundant bones, indicates their probable absence from New Zealand in the Early-Middle Miocene.

INTRODUCTION During the years preceding his sudden death in Januari 1962, my predecessor, Dr. G. C. A. Junge, was engaged in a broad study of the birds of Java. This study was mainly based on the excellent Bartels collection, purchased not long before, but Junge included other material and also used the manuscripts and diaries of M. E. G. Bartels, which had been received with the collection. In his accustomed meticulous way, strictly following the "Peters" sequence, Junge has measured and studied every specimen, from the <b>Podicipedidae</b> to the Columbidae, measured their eggs, and noted particulars of breeding, moult, food, etc. Unfortunately, the manuscript {{as a whole is}} too incomplete to justify its publication: it {{is in the form of}} rough notes and they are evidently no more than a basis from which later a definitive text was to be compiled. Also, the publication of large series of localities and measurements of common species, about which there is no systematic problem requiring such detailed information, would be of little interest. Information on eggs contained in the Bartels collection and on breeding-seasons as deduced from them, has in the meantime been published separately by Hellebrekers & Hoogerwerf (1967) ...|$|E
