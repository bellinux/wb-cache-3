500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal <b>problems.</b> <b>You</b> haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E
