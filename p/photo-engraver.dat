2500|$|In school, Jackson {{expressed}} {{no interest}} in sports. His classmates also remember him wearing a duffle coat with [...] "an obsession verging on religious". He had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing, special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error. As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author J. R. R. Tolkien after watching The Lord of the Rings (1978), an animated film by Ralph Bakshi that was a part-adaptation of Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working full-time as a <b>photo-engraver</b> for a Wellington newspaper, The Evening Post. For the seven years he worked there, Jackson lived {{at home with his}} parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment.

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1884 Reich emigrated to the United States in a family group {{consisting}} of his parents, one brother, and two sisters.

When their father died, their mother and one sister returned to Europe to live in Budapest.In 1889 Reich travelled to France and then to England. In the Hilary term of 1890 he gave four lectures at Oxford, published later that year as Graeco-Roman Institutions, in which his thesis was that Darwinian concepts did not apply to solving sociological problems. He then went to live in France, where in 1893 he married Céline Labulle, a Frenchwoman. After their marriage they settled permanently in Great Britain. Reich lectured at Oxford and Cambridge and in London, and he also taught candidates for the Civil Service. Following the Venezuela-Guiana boundary crisis of 1895, the British government employed him to help Sir Richard Webster with the preparation of the case for recognition of the British claims.Reich was taken up by Lord Acton, who applauded him as a [...] "universal specialist" [...] and commissioned him to write on [...] "Hungary and the Slavonic Kingdoms" [...] for The Cambridge Modern History volume on the Renaissance. In his lectures on [...] "Fundamental principles of evidence" [...] and in The Failure of the Higher Criticism of the Bible (1905), Reich disputed the methodology of biblical criticism. His Hungarian Literature (1897) was very successful and went into a second edition in 1906. In his A General History of Western Nations from 5000 BC to 1900 AD (1902), Reich emphasised the geopolitical, economic, and environmental aspects of history, and indeed {{he was one of the}} first writers to use the term [...] "geopolitical" [...] in English.|$|E
50|$|In June 1872, {{two months}} later, Moss {{dissolved}} the Actinic Engraving Company and started over without Duignan.

50|$|In {{the face}} of active {{opposition}} by wood engravers and the yawning indifference of publishers, Moss and his wife struggled in their home-workshop under penurious circumstances for eight years, attracting few clients, until they finally found several backers willing {{to invest in a}} new company devoted to <b>photo-engraving.</b>|$|R
50|$|John Moss {{was born}} in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in 1838. At age 17 he became an {{apprentice}} to a Philadelphia printer. At 19, he married Mary A.

50|$|John Calvin Moss (January 5, 1838—April 8, 1892) was an American {{inventor}} {{credited with}} developing the first practicable <b>photo-engraving</b> process in 1863.

50|$|He {{was born}} in Burton-on-Trent the son of Rev Henry Day who was {{headmaster}} of the Grammar School.Originally adopting a life in the brewing industry (typical of Burton-on-Trent, and having moved to Edinburgh to pursue that career, his religious views led him to abandon this in the 1890s and instead pursue a new use for his chemical skills.
