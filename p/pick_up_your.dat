Dylan's original demo of [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] contained the lyric [...] "Pick up your money, pack up your tent", which was mistakenly altered in The Byrds' version, by guitarist and singer Roger McGuinn, to [...] "Pack up your money, <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> tent". Dylan expressed mock-annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 {{recording of}} the song, singing [...] "Pack up your money, put up your tent McGuinn/You ain't goin' nowhere." [...] McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new {{recording of the}} song included on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's [...] album, adding the word [...] "Dylan" [...] after the same [...] "Pack up your money, <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> tent" [...] lyric. McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 recording of the song, which also featured The Byrds' former bass player Chris Hillman, was released as a single and peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1989, as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by RPM. In spite of {{the involvement of the}} Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone.|$|E
