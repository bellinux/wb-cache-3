5|$|A District Superintendent of Police, {{better known}} as a Superintendent of Police, heads the District Police {{organisation}} of West Bengal Police. This is as per the Police Act of 1861, which is applicable to the whole of India. The Superintendents of Police are officers of the Indian Police Service. For every subdivision, there is a Subdivision Police, headed by a Police officer of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of <b>Police</b> <b>or</b> Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under subdivisions, there are Police Circles, each headed by an Inspector of Police. A Police Circle consists of Police Stations, each headed by an Inspector of <b>Police,</b> <b>or</b> in case of rural areas, by a Sub-Inspector of Police.|$|E
5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, <b>police,</b> <b>or</b> government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve this the {{military}} commander's staff was divided into military and administrative branches, and he was allocated personnel to form four area commands and about ten district commands, which reported to {{the chief of the}} administrative staff, and the military staff allocated the troops of the four local defence battalions across the area commands. The first military commander in the occupied territory was General der Flieger Helmuth Förster, a Luftwaffe officer, appointed on 20 April 1941, assisted by the chief of his administrative staff, SS-Brigadeführer and State Councillor, Dr. Harald Turner. Outside of the military commander's staff, there were several senior figures in Belgrade who represented key non-military arms of the German government. Prominent among these was NSFK-Obergruppenführer Franz Neuhausen, who had been initially appointed by Göring as plenipotentiary general for economic affairs in the territory on 17 April. A further key figure in the initial German administration was SS-Standartenführer Wilhelm Fuchs, who commanded Einsatzgruppe Serbia, which consisted of Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service, or SD) and Sicherheitspolizei (Security <b>Police,</b> <b>or</b> SiPo), and Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State <b>Police,</b> <b>or</b> Gestapo) detachments, and controlled the 64th Reserve Police Battalion of the Ordnungspolizei (Order <b>Police,</b> <b>or</b> Orpo). While he was formally responsible to Turner, Fuchs reported directly to his superiors in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Police {{officers}} are not armed with firearms during patrolling, but have weapons locked {{down in the}} patrol cars. Arming of the locked-down weapons requires permission from the chief of <b>police</b> <b>or</b> someone designated by him. The police use Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 semi-automatic pistols. The Emergency Response Unit uses Diemaco C8 assault rifles. Norwegian police officers do not use electroshock weapons.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by <b>police</b> <b>or</b> other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by <b>police</b> <b>or</b> other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E

A group of 19 JNA officers, including Perišić and Mladić, were tried in absentia and convicted by a Croatian court for war crimes against the civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents were poorly armed, and {{eventually}} were {{overwhelmed by the}} tsarist regular military. Most of the barricades fell by 24 June; {{the last of the}} barricades (in the Źródliska park and Wschodnia street) were captured by Russian troops by the end of 24 June or by midday on 25 June (sources vary), but unrest—including occasional shots at <b>police</b> <b>or</b> military patrols—would continue for days afterwards.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by {{only two or three}} <b>police</b> (<b>or</b> civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia led directly to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without <b>police</b> <b>or</b> administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner {{took control}} of the police organs that had {{formerly}} been under the control of Turner, grouped as Einsatzgruppe Serbia, consisting of Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service, or SD) and Sicherheitspolizei (Security <b>Police,</b> <b>or</b> SiPo), as well as the 64th Reserve Police Battalion. These had been commanded by SS-Standartenführer (SS-Colonel) Wilhelm Fuchs, who had overseen the shooting of many Serbian and Jewish males and others, mainly by Wehrmacht units, between August 1941 and the end of that year. Meyszner's deputy was SS-Standartenführer Emanuel Schäfer {{and the head of the}} Belgrade Gestapo was SS-Sturmbannführer (SS-Major) Bruno Sattler. The head of the Gestapo Jewish Section was SS-Untersturmführer (SS-Lieutenant) Fritz Stracke.|$|E
5|$|Other {{vernacular names}} applied include shepherd's {{companion}} (because it accompanied livestock), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale.

In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara word is tjintir-tjintir(pa). Among the Kamilaroi, it is thirrithirri. In Bougainville Island, it is called tsiropen in the Banoni language from the west coast, and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is maneka. In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the polis (<b>police)</b> <b>or</b> pris (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring.|$|E

5|$|The PDSA Gold Medal is {{an animal}} bravery award that {{acknowledges}} the bravery and devotion to duty of animals. It {{was created by}} the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 2001, and is now recognised as the animal equivalent of the George Cross. An animal can be awarded the PDSA Gold Medal if it assists in saving human or non-human life when its own life is in danger or through exceptional devotion to duty. The medal can also be awarded to animals in public service, such as <b>police</b> <b>or</b> rescue dogs, if the animal dies or suffers serious injury while carrying out its official duties in the face of armed and violent opposition.|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret <b>police</b> <b>or</b> prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E

5|$|After the Liberation of Bulgaria and the {{establishment}} of the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia in 1878, Mutkurov settled in Eastern Rumelia, where he joined the provincial <b>police</b> <b>or</b> militia. He served first with the 1st Plovdiv Battalion and thereafter with the general staff. As an eminent man of arms in Eastern Rumelia, Mutkurov {{was one of the main}} leaders of the Bulgarian unification on 6 September 1885, the bloodless revolution that united the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. Mutkurov joined the Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Central Committee which stood behind the unification. At the time a captain, along with Dimitar Rizov he was envoyed to the Bulgarian monarch Prince Alexander of Battenberg. The two were received by the prince in Shumen, where they notified him of the forthcoming events and requested his approval. The prince did not wish to be publicly involved in an anti-Ottoman revolution, and is unclear whether he at all believed a revolution was likely to break out in Eastern Rumelia so soon. During the revolution, Mutkurov commanded some of the troops that surrounded the residence of the provincial governor Gavril Krastevich and demanded his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order <b>Police</b> <b>or</b> Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.|$|E
