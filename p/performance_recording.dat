5|$|Breed {{differences}} {{are expected to}} have reduced since the USMARC studies in the 1980s and 1990s because of the wide-scale introduction and use of <b>performance</b> <b>recording</b> and genetic improvement programmes. The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly a result of the loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US purebred population, which would be an expected result of the purebred grading up process practiced there. Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E

25|$|Ethnic {{folk music}} from other {{countries}} also had a boom during the American folk revival. The most successful ethnic performers of the revival were the Greenwich Village folksingers, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, whom Billboard Magazine listed as the eleventh best-selling folk musicians in the United States. The group, which consisted of Paddy Clancy, Tom Clancy, Liam Clancy, and Tommy Makem, predominantly sang English-language, Irish folk songs, {{as well as an}} occasional song in Irish Gaelic. Paddy Clancy also started and ran the folk-music label Tradition Records, which produced Odetta's first solo LP and initially brought Carolyn Hester to national prominence. Pete Seeger played the banjo on their Grammy-nominated 1961 album, A Spontaneous <b>Performance</b> <b>Recording,</b> and Bob Dylan later cited the group as a major influence on him. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem also sparked a folk-music boom in Ireland in the mid-1960s, illustrating the world-wide effects of the American folk-music revival.|$|E
500|$|... "The Long and Winding Road" [...] {{became a}} staple of McCartney's post-Beatles concert repertoire. On the 1976 Wings Over the World Tour, where {{it was one of}} the few Beatles songs played, it was {{performed}} on piano in a sparse arrangement using a horn section. On McCartney's 1989 solo tour and since, it has generally been performed on piano with an arrangement using a synthesiser mimicking strings, but this string sound is more restrained than on the Spector recorded version. The live <b>performance</b> <b>recording</b> of the Rio de Janeiro concert in April 1990 is on the album Tripping the Live Fantastic. McCartney also played the song to close the Live 8 concert in London.|$|E
