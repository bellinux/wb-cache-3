40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{experiences}} of African American female community college students who <b>stop</b> <b>out,</b> and interpret how their gender and race have influenced these lived experiences. Based on the research questions, a constructivist, narrative analysis was used to capture the experiences of the participants of this study as well as analyze the environment of their personal lives as the institution in which they have all attended. A total of six participants were interviewed. Three semi-structured interviews were held to provide a clear understanding of each participant 2 ̆ 7 s experiences. When combined and analyzed, the narratives of the six participants revealed that students do not all have the same experience when attending college. African American female students who were currently enrolled at a large multi-campus community college in the Midwest, and have <b>stopped</b> <b>out</b> were invited to participate in this study. For the participants in this study, family, work or the lack there of, had a tremendous effect on their decision to <b>stop</b> <b>out.</b> All of the students had experiences with a job that either caused them to <b>stop</b> <b>out</b> or to return to school after losing that job. Future research could be done on African American male students who have <b>stopped</b> <b>out</b> of community college to gain a better understanding of serving all African American students. The study could compare and contrast the experiences of the females from this study as well as males to see if there are any similarities in their experiences...|$|R

40|$|Inquiries {{have been}} made by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education and the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to {{determine}} how colleges and universities could meet the financial crisis now being faced. One of the recommendations made by both agencies {{as a result of their}} investigations was that curriculum planners at these institutions provide students with opportunities to have off-campus experiences, preferably in their chosen career areas, before they are graduated to determine whether they want to pursue their studies in that area or reorient themselves to other options. These planned stopouts, they suggested, would curtail drifting or hanging on as well as enable students to gain practical experiences at various stages in their training. There is a lack of information in the literature to justify immediate response to the suggestions made by the private and public bodies mentioned. Time does not permit officials to conduct longitudinal studies based on an experimental design which would provide a basis to accept or reject these recommendations. This study represents an effort to investigate the effects of <b>stopping</b> <b>out</b> on former students. Admittedly it has limitations, particularly those inherent in ex post facto research, but does provide some results which may assist administrators and faculties as they make decisions in light of the crisis now facing them. The results of this study indicate that students who have <b>stopped</b> <b>out</b> are more likely to change their academic major than students who have not <b>stopped</b> <b>out.</b> Also, there are indications that <b>stopping</b> <b>out</b> does not affect academic standing. However, it was found that for most students grades get higher as they progress through school whether they <b>stop</b> <b>out</b> or stay in. This finding is in agreement with findings from previous studies reported in the literature...|$|R
