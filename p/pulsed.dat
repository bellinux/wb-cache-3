5|$|The spray-arc {{transfer}} variation {{was developed}} in the early 1960s, when experimenters added small amounts of oxygen to inert gases. More recently, <b>pulsed</b> current has been applied, giving rise to a new method called the <b>pulsed</b> spray-arc variation.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short <b>pulsed</b> electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, there was little development in electrical welding until Auguste de Méritens developed a carbon arc torch that was patented in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a <b>pulsed</b> squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the <b>pulsed</b> squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|Clicks {{are quick}} {{broadband}} burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the <b>pulsed</b> calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ~35–50 milliseconds, {{and in general}} these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, <b>pulsed</b> laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
5|$|Like all cetaceans, {{killer whales}} depend heavily on {{underwater}} sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce {{three categories of}} sounds: clicks, whistles, and <b>pulsed</b> calls. Clicks {{are believed to be}} used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.|$|E
5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, <b>pulsed</b> laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. <b>Pulsed</b> current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple <b>pulsed</b> field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the <b>pulsed</b> squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
25|$|Groups of large, {{specially}} constructed, low-inductance high-voltage capacitors (capacitor banks) {{are used}} to supply huge pulses of current for many <b>pulsed</b> power applications. These include electromagnetic forming, Marx generators, <b>pulsed</b> lasers (especially TEA lasers), pulse forming networks, radar, fusion research, and particle accelerators.|$|E
25|$|Steady {{background}} noise facilitates the startle response, while <b>pulsed</b> background produces inhibition.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{scientists}} at the Z <b>Pulsed</b> Power Facility announced the creation of metallic deuterium.|$|E
25|$|The use of topical rapamycin as {{an adjunct}} to <b>pulsed</b> dye laser may improve results.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, a small {{project in}} <b>pulsed</b> {{microwave}} transmission {{was started by}} W. Delmar Hershberger. The SCL called this technique radio position-finding (RPF). Lacking success with microwaves, Hershberger visited the NRL (where he had earlier worked) and saw their 200-MHz <b>pulsed</b> set. Back at the SCL, he and Robert H. Noyes built an experimental set with a 110-MHz (2.73-m) <b>pulsed</b> transmitter and a receiver patterned on {{the one at the}} NRL. A request for project funding was turned down by the War Department, but, with the backing of the Chief Signal Officer, Maj. Gen. James B. Allison, $75,000 for support was diverted from a previous appropriation for a communication project.|$|E
25|$|In {{pulmonary}} haemorrhage, {{high doses}} of cyclophosphamide with <b>pulsed</b> methylprednisolone may be used, or alternatively CYC, steroids, and plasma exchange.|$|E
25|$|In case of organ-threatening disease, <b>pulsed</b> {{intravenous}} cyclophosphamide with steroids is recommended. Once remission {{has been}} achieved, azathioprine and steroids {{can be used}} to maintain remission.|$|E
25|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{responds to the}} <b>pulsed</b> GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into {{the blood of the}} general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.|$|E
25|$|High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators These {{modulators}} {{consist of}} a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a pulse forming network, and a high voltage switch such as a thyratron. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually <b>pulsed)</b> into microwaves. This technology is known as <b>pulsed</b> power. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|E
25|$|When using a <b>pulsed</b> radar, the {{variation}} between {{the phase of}} successive returns gives the distance the target has moved between pulses, and thus its speed can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Continuous wave - In {{these the}} {{transformer}} {{is driven by}} a feedback oscillator, which applies a sinusoidal current to the transformer. The primary tuned circuit serves as the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which generate a <b>pulsed</b> output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices instead of transistors {{because they are more}} robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces lower output voltages from a given input power than <b>pulsed</b> excitation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of quantum computing, <b>pulsed</b> EPR is used to control the state of {{electron}} spin qubits in materials such as diamond, silicon and gallium arsenide.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review of case reports and case series {{concluded that the}} limited available data suggest <b>pulsed</b> dye laser therapy is a safe and effective treatment for molluscum contagiosum and is generally well-tolerated by children. Side effects seen with <b>pulsed</b> dye laser therapy included mild temporary pain {{at the site of}} therapy, bruising (lasting up to 2–3 weeks), and temporary discoloration of the treated skin (as long as 1–6 months). No cases of permanent scarring have been reported. As of 2009, however, there is no evidence for genital lesions.|$|E
25|$|A good {{overview}} of the different missions of the Z machine {{can be found in}} the 2002 Trivelpiece committee report which reviewed the <b>pulsed</b> power activities at Sandia.|$|E
25|$|Full radar {{evolved as}} a <b>pulsed</b> system, {{and the first}} such {{elementary}} apparatus was demonstrated in December 1934 by the American Robert M. Page, working at the Naval Research Laboratory. The following year, the United States Army successfully tested a primitive surface-to-surface radar to aim coastal battery searchlights at night. This design {{was followed by a}} <b>pulsed</b> system demonstrated in May 1935 by Rudolf Kühnhold and the firm GEMA in Germany and then another in June 1935 by an Air Ministry team led by Robert A. Watson-Watt in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|For autoclaving, {{cleaning}} is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can {{be achieved}} through physical scrubbing, sonication, ultrasound or <b>pulsed</b> air.|$|E
25|$|Carry-over {{toxicity}} {{as well as}} {{delayed effects}} can be simulated, whether the carry-over toxicity is due to TK or TD or both. In this way, TKTD models can quantify risks from <b>pulsed</b> or fluctuating exposures.|$|E
25|$|Coherent {{emission}} from a laser dye-doped tandem SM-OLED device, excited in the <b>pulsed</b> regime, {{has been}} demonstrated. The emission is nearly diffraction limited with a spectral width {{similar to that}} of broadband dye lasers.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the US Army {{published}} {{a report on}} the decommissioning of the Aurora <b>Pulsed</b> Radiation Simulator. This report is useful in understanding ties between nuclear arms testing and inertial fusion energy research.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulsed</b> laser {{deposition}} (PLD) is {{a physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) technique where a high-power <b>pulsed</b> laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material {{that is to be}} deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or {{in the presence of a}} background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully oxygenate the deposited films.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pulsed</b> laser {{irradiation}} {{is commonly}} used against diatoms. Plasma pulse technology is effective against zebra mussels and works by stunning or killing the organisms with microsecond duration energizing of the water with high voltage electricity.|$|E
25|$|When using <b>pulsed</b> fluoroscopy, {{radiation}} dose is only applied in prespecified intervals of time, thus less dose {{is used to}} produce the same image sequence. For the time in between, the last image stored is displayed.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{properties}} of the light source (superluminescent diodes, ultrashort <b>pulsed</b> lasers, and supercontinuum lasers have been employed), optical coherence tomography has achieved sub-micrometer resolution (with very wide-spectrum sources emitting over a ~100nm wavelength range).|$|E
25|$|The simple {{laser diode}} structure, {{described}} above, is extremely inefficient. Such devices require {{so much power}} that they can only achieve <b>pulsed</b> operation without damage. Although historically important and easy to explain, such devices are not practical.|$|E
25|$|Operated by Sandia National Laboratories, it gathers data {{to aid in}} {{computer}} modeling {{of nuclear weapons and}} eventual nuclear fusion <b>pulsed</b> power plants. The Z machine is located at Sandia's main site in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Epilation is {{the removal}} of the entire hair, {{including}} the part below the skin. Methods include waxing, sugaring, epilation devices, lasers, threading, intense <b>pulsed</b> light or electrology. Hair is also sometimes removed by plucking with tweezers.|$|E
