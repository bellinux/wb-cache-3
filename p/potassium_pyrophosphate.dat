Several mixtures with raw materials of known composition (wheat flour, dog food) were composted. First, it was studied the influence of mild solvents, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> in the yield and characteristics of extracted HS-like, {{as well as in the}} coextraction of heavy metals from compost. Secondly, it was assessed the influence of raw materials, presence of bulking agent and initial C/N ratio on the humification during composting. Third, commercial composts were used as HS-like source. In all phases, composts and HS-like were characterized using the conventional physical, chemical, stability and maturity parameters. The fractionation of heavy metals was also determined. Results showed that <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> can be used advantageously for the HS-like extraction. During composting the HS-like content were influenced by presence of carbon rich raw materials and the initial C/N ratio, being their production independently of the composts quality. The HS-like produced from commercial composts showed low level of co-extracted heavy metals, however, the presence of Cu, Cr and Pb can influence negatively their composition...|$|E

The fertilizers with microelements supply to the plant the needed nutritive substances, which doesn’t exist or are insufficient in soil [1]. In the present paper were studied the conditions establishment of the double pyrophosphate of zinc and potassium obtaining, respective of copper and potassium from solutions of zinc and cooper sulfate and <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate.</b> In this way was followed the variation of the mass reaction pH, electric conductance and zinc and copper separation degree, versus the molar ratio Me 2 +: P 2 O 74 - and versus temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{rotational}} motion of rigidly spin-labeled myosin heads of glycerinated myofibrils {{as reflected in}} saturation-transfer EPR spectra behaves to a first approximation as though the heads consist of two populations with different {{rotational motion}}s. An immobilized fraction has a correlation time (tau 2) of approximately 0. 5 ms, {{comparable to that of}} spin-labeled subfragment- 1 (S 1) bound to thin filaments, while a mobile fraction has a tau 2 of 10 microseconds, comparable to that of the heads of purified myosin filaments. The effects of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (PPi), or adenylyl imidodiphosphate, Ca 2 +, temperature, or ionic strength on the spectra can be analyzed in terms of the fraction of myosin heads immobilized by attachment to thin filaments, without requiring changes in the motion of either attached or detached heads...|$|E

40|$|The {{condensed}} phosphates such as ammonium <b>pyrophosphate,</b> <b>potassium,</b> metaphosphate, ammonium polyphosphates {{are among the}} newest achievements {{in the domain of}} fertilizers (5, 6). Results of various experiments have shown that these fertilizers increase the yield in wheat, barley, maise, potato, sugar beat, bean and others (2, 3, 5). However, experiments in this field are few (3). In Lolium multiflorum the reactions of these forms of phosphorus were not illustrated in many cases, because the experiments had been carried out with salts of NH 4, K and Ca, where the effect was combined. The objective of this report is to present results of a series of greenhouse pot experiments...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Schlesinger and Coon's {{report that}} {{crystalline}} yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, {{in addition to}} its known ability to hydrolyze inorganic pyrophosphate in the presence of Mg ions, is also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP in the presence of Zn ions was confirmed. A systematic study showed that the ratio of 370 of PPase-,Mg over ATPase-Zn activities per milligram protein in various preparations of pyrophosphatase obtained in the course of isolation of crystalline pyrophosphatase from baker's yeast was nearly identical in all the preparations, independent of their purity. The course of hydrolysis of ATP by crystalline pyrophosphatase in the presence of Zn was carried out with the aid of ion exchange on Dowex 1. The finding of Schtesinger and Coon that the hydrolysis proceeds from ATP to ADP and then slowly to AMP was confirmed. The kinetics of {{the first phase of the}} reaction was found to depend on the molar ratio of Zn/ATP in the reaction mixture. Mg ions in the presence of Zn ions have an accelerating effect on the rate of hydrolysis of ATP. This suggests strongly that both activities [...] ATPase and PPase [...] are manifestations of the same active group in the protein molecule of crystalline pyrophosphatase. Crystalline yeast pyrophosphatase isolated in 1952 (1) was found to act as a powerful catalyst for the hydrolysis of sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> into orthophosphate ions in the presence of magnesium ions, and also to a lesser degree in the presence of other metallic ions such as Mn ++ or Co ++. On the other hand, organic pyrophosphates such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were not affected by comparative concentrations of crystalline pyrophosphatase, either in the presence or in the absence of Mg ++ ions. In a recent publication, however, Schlesinger and Coon (2) reported that ATP and several other organic pyrophosphates were hydrolyzed by relatively high concentrations of crystalline pyrophosphatase provided magnesium ion...|$|E
40|$|The first {{successful}} attempt to electrodeposit ZnMn alloy coatings from alkaline bath was made {{only a few}} years ago. In this kind of solution, <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> (K 4 P 2 O 7) serves both as a complexing agent and as the basic electrolyte. The aim of this work was to study the electrodeposition process and properties of ZnMn alloy coatings deposited from pyrophosphate solution, with a new kind of alkaline pyrophosphate bath. Namely, chloride salts were used as the source of metal ions and ascorbic acid was used as reducing agent. The composition of the plating solution was as follows: 1 mol dm- 3 K 4 P 2 O 7 + 0. 017 mol dm- 3 ascorbic acid + 0. 05 mol dm- 3 ZnCl 2 + 0. 05 mol dm- 3 MnCl 2 • 4 H 2 O. Cathodic processes during the alloy electrodeposition were investigated using linear voltammetry. The influence of addition of small amounts of ascorbic acid on the cathodic processes was established. It was shown that this substance inhibits hydrogen evolution and increases the current efficiency of alloy deposition. The current efficiency in the plating bath examined was in the range of 25 and 30 %, which was quite higher as compared to the results reported in the literature for electrodeposition of ZnMn alloy from pyrophosphate bath. Electrodeposition of ZnMn alloys was performed galvanostatically on steel panels, at current densities of 20120 mA cm- 2. The coatings with the best appearance were obtained at current densities between 30 and 80 mA cm- 2. The surface morphology studies, based on atomic force microscopy measurements, showed that morphology of the deposits is highly influenced by deposition current density. ZnMn coating deposited at 30 mA cm- 2 was more compact and possessed more homogeneous structure (more uniform agglomeration size) than the coating deposited at 80 mA cm- 2. Such dependence of morphology on the current density could be explained by the high rate of hydrogen evolution reaction during the electrodeposition process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of organic amendments distribution on different fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) and the knowledge of processes controlling the temporal evolution of organic matter (OM) in the first layer of a calcareous soil of two adjacent plots, one control and one treated with 3 kgm- 2 of organic amendment. An appropriate fractionation procedure of SOM, consisting in sequential extractions by water, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and <b>potassium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> extractions, was applied. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV and fluorescence spectroscopic properties of organic matter reveal quantitative and qualitative aspects. Spectral indexes such as SUVA 254 (specific UV absorbance), E 2 /E 3 and FI (fluorescence index) were used to examine annual changes of SOM in the different fractions. Extractions with pyrophosphate, and in a lesser amount with sodium hydroxide, represented the major part of DOC, for both control and treated soils. Yields of sequential extractions ranged from 16. 1 % to 16. 4 % of TOC for these two soils. Compost inputs resulted in evolution of quantitative and qualitative results, especially for water extractable organic matter (WEOM) and pyrophosphate extracts mainly during the first 3 months of this field experiment. Study of annual changes of DOC, SUVA 254 and E 2 /E 3 index values in treated soil indicated a priming effect during the weeks after compost spreading, in relation with a revitalizing effect of microbial activity. Contributions of organo-mineral interactions and rainfall regulated WEOM amount throughout the year, and the activity of microbial communities in soil seemed to {{play a significant role}} on WEOM production. FI index values demonstrated microbial origin for WEOM, and for OM extracted either with acid or with sodium hydroxide. At the contrary, pyrophosphate extracts revealed that OM came essentially from terrestrial origin, which corresponds to the most complex and aromatic compounds. It was found that sodium hydroxide extracted less aromatic SOM, but higher molecular weight compounds. 3 D fluorescence spectra revealed the presence of four main types of fluorophores according to the different extracts: humic, fulvic and marine-like compounds (A, C and M) common to all extracts, and lignin-like compounds (H) specific to pyrophosphate extracts only in treated soil {{at the beginning of the}} experiment due to initial compost effect. PCA on quantitative and qualitative data for WOEM fraction revealed essentially that meteorological aspects, with temperature and precipitation variations, were an important parameter over the year of experimentation, and that compost input impacted significantly WEOM amounts at the beginning of the experiment...|$|E
