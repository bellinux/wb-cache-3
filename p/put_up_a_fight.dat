5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Late in the night, Thảo and Phát {{met with}} Kỳ {{in a meeting}} {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted that Khanh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between midnight and dawn, anti-coup forces swept into the city; it was generally thought that the rebels did not <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> after being assured that Khánh would be ousted. Early in the morning, Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, proposed a motion within the junta to remove Khánh and force him into exile, and the final vote was unanimous—Khanh was absent from the meeting. Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu then became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát as a civilian front, although General Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E
5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight,</b> but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast to their health, in the hope that a full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to Southampton in June {{where it was}} visited by King Henry. In August the fleet sailed for Brest where it encountered a joint, but ill-coordinated, French-Breton fleet {{at the battle of}} St. Mathieu. The English with one of the great ships in the lead (according to Marsden the Mary Rose) battered the French ships with heavy gunfire and forced them to retreat. The Breton flagship Cordelière <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>fight</b> and was boarded by the 1,000-ton Regent. By accident or through the unwillingness of the Breton crew to surrender, the powder magazine of the Cordelière caught fire and blew up in a violent explosion, setting fire to the Regent and eventually sinking her. About 180 English crew members saved themselves by throwing themselves into the sea and only a handful of Bretons survived, only to be captured. The captain of the Regent, 600 soldiers and sailors, the High Admiral of France and the steward of the town of Morlaix were killed in the incident, making it the focal point of several contemporary chronicles and reports. On , the English burnt 27 French ships, captured another five and landed forces near Brest to raid and take prisoners, but storms forced the fleet back to Dartmouth in Devon and then to Southampton for repairs.|$|E

What Moore did not anticipate was the lack of concern for his legal rights in ownership of the land Skagway sat upon.
