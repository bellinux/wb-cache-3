50|$|In 1947 the Department of Industries in Ceylon {{agreed to}} meet the {{electricity}} demand of the Jaffna peninsula, which at that time stood at only 370 kW, from the power station at Kankesanthurai cement factory. From 1950 the peninsula was supplied by an isolated Medium Voltage (MV) power transmission network operated by the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings. At the time Jaffna was the only major town on the peninsula with electricity supply. Demand for electricity in the peninsula grew as other towns were connected to the electricity network and with increasing demand from industries, such as Kankesanthurai cement factory, and from agriculture. By the mid 1950s demand on the <b>peninsula</b> <b>stood</b> at 1,500 kW and was expected to increase to 2,000 kW. Jaffna peninsula was not connected to the national grid and as such could not benefit from Ceylon's growing hydroelectric generation.|$|R

25|$|The {{caves in}} the Rock of Gibraltar that the Neanderthals {{inhabited}} have been excavated and have revealed {{a wealth of}} information about their lifestyle and the prehistoric landscape of the area. The <b>peninsula</b> <b>stood</b> {{on the edge of a}} fertile coastal plain, now submerged, that supported a wide variety of animals and plants which the Neanderthals exploited to provide a highly varied diet. Unlike northern Europe, which underwent massive swings in its climate and was largely uninhabitable for long periods, the far south of Iberia enjoyed a stable and mild climate for over 125,000 years. It became a refuge from the ice ages for animals, plants and Neanderthals, who survived there for possibly several thousand years longer than anywhere else. Around 24,000 years ago, however, the climate underwent abrupt changes which would have greatly disrupted the Gibraltar Neanderthals' food supply and may have stressed their population beyond recovery, leading to their final extinction.|$|R
6000|$|I have {{described}} the brook as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the sixteenth of an acre. On this <b>peninsula</b> <b>stood</b> a dwelling-house--and when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, [...] "etait d'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre," [...] I mean, merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety--in a word, of poetry--(for, than in the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract, a more rigorous definition)--and I do not mean that merely outre was perceptible in any respect.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{biogeography}} {{of butterflies}} within the monsoon tropical biome of northern Australia is reviewed {{in terms of}} patterns of species richness, endemism and area relationships. Available data indicate that the region supports a relatively rich fauna, comprising 265 species (~ 62 % of the total Australian fauna), but endemism is low (6 %). No genera are endemic to the monsoon tropics, but two (Neohesperilla, Nesolycaena) are characteristic components, embracing a total of seven species in the region, of which five are endemic. Three ecological specialists (Neohesperilla senta, Elodina walkeri, Candalides delospila), each associated with different vegetation types, appear to be characteristic elements of the monsoon tropics. Of 67 range-restricted species in the monsoon tropics, 15 (mostly associated with savanna) are endemic to the region, while 52 (mostly associated with rainforest) are non-endemic, occurring also in south-east Asia and/or mainland New Guinea. A pronounced attenuation in species richness from Cape York Peninsula across the Top End to the Kimberley is evident. Within the monsoon tropics, Cape York <b>Peninsula</b> <b>stands</b> out as an area of exceptional biodiversity, with 95 % of the butterflies (251 species; 7 endemic species, 31 endemic subspecies/geographical forms) recorded from the entire region, compared with the Top End (123 species; 3 endemic species, 17 endemic subspecies/geographical forms). In contrast, the Kimberley has a comparatively depauperate fauna (85 species; 1 endemic species, 0 endemic subspecies) without strong Indonesian affinities, and contains only two range-restricted species. A sister-area relationship between Cape York Peninsula and the Top End–Kimberley is evident in one clade, Acrodipsas hirtipes (northern Cape Yor...|$|R

50|$|Takla Lake is {{the fifth}} largest natural lake in British Columbia, Canada. It is a deep fjord-like lake with the Swannell Ranges to the east, the Driftwood River flowing into it from the north, and the Middle River {{draining}} it. It is the terminus of the early Stuart-Takla sockeye salmon run, and noted for its large rainbow trout, lake trout and Dolly Varden. The peninsula {{is the home of}} Mount Blanchet Provincial Park. Also on the peninsula is a herd of collared woodland caribou, and the winter range of grizzly bears. Two special features are Takla Lake Marine Park, and an Ecological Reserve on the <b>peninsula,</b> a <b>stand</b> of very northerly Douglas Fir. Takla Lake is also the origin of both of Canada's national airlines, both Russ Baker and Grant McConachie running bush plane routes out of Takla Lake. It is a popular canoe route from the top end down to Fort St. James.|$|R

Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie. The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends, weather permitting (see presqueislelighthouse.org). A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie Waterworks on the Presque Isle Bay side of the <b>peninsula.</b> Today it <b>stands</b> in the ferry landing for the Presque Isle Water Taxi service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.|$|R
5000|$|Grays Harbor is an estuarine bay located 45 mi {{north of}} {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River, on the {{southwest}} Pacific coast of Washington state, in the United States of America. It is a ria, which formed {{at the end of the}} last ice age, when sea levels flooded the Chehalis River. The bay is 17 mi long and 12 mi wide. [...] The Chehalis River flows into its eastern end, where the city of Aberdeen stands at that river's mouth, on its north bank, with the somewhat smaller city of Hoquiam immediately to its northwest, along the bayshore. Besides the Chehalis, many lesser rivers and streams flow into Grays Harbor, such as Hoquiam River and Humptulips River. A pair of low peninsulas separate it from the Pacific Ocean, except for an opening about two miles (3 km) in width. The northern peninsula, which is largely covered by the community of Ocean Shores, ends in Point Brown. Facing that across the bay-mouth is Point Chehalis, at the end of the southern <b>peninsula</b> upon which <b>stands</b> the town of Westport.|$|R
50|$|Ionia was {{of small}} extent, not {{exceeding}} 150 km in length {{from north to}} south, with a breadth varying from 60 to 90 km, but to this must be added the peninsula of Mimas, together with the two islands. So intricate is the coastline that the voyage along its shores was estimated at nearly four times the direct distance. A great part of this area was, moreover, occupied by mountains. Of these the most lofty and striking were Mimas and Corycus, in the <b>peninsula</b> which <b>stands</b> out to the west, facing the island of Chios; Sipylus, {{to the north of}} Smyrna, Corax, extending to the south-west from the Gulf of Smyrna, and descending to the sea between Lebedus and Teos; and the strongly marked range of Mycale, a continuation of Messogisin the interior, which forms the bold headland of Trogilium or Mycale, opposite Samos. None of these mountains attains a height of more than 1200 m. The district comprised three extremely fertile valleys formed by the outflow of three rivers, among the most considerable in Asia Minor: the Hermus in the north, flowing into the Gulf of Smyrna, though at some distance from the city of that name; the Caster, which flowed under the walls of Ephesus; and the Maeander, which in ancient times discharged its waters into the deep gulf that once bathed the walls of Miletus, but which has been gradually filled up by this river's deposits. With the advantage of a peculiarly fine climate, for which this part of Asia Minor has been famous in all ages, Ionia enjoyed the reputation in ancient times of being the most fertile of all the rich provinces of Asia Minor; and even , though very imperfectly cultivated, it produces abundance of fruit of all kinds, and the raisins and figs of Smyrna supply almost all the markets of Europe.|$|R

A <b>peninsula,</b> on which <b>stands</b> the pa called Taumaihi, juts out into the centre of the lake. The waters are beautifully clear, and very deep. There is no apparent outlet to this lake. Its vent consists of an underground stream, which is hidden for about half a mile, and then makes its appearance, looking like a fountain, gushing through a heap of rocks and square stones of a basaltic formation, whence it makes its way in a small stream to Tarawera, the level of which is about sixty feet lower than that of Okareka, and into which the water falls down a declivity of twenty feet, forming a beautiful cascade, surrounded and overshadowed by a clump of karaka and other evergreen trees." ...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{comprehensive}} literature review and new {{data in this}} study it states {{that the number of}} species of caddisflies registered in Andalusia amounts to 136, included in 53 genera and 17 families. This number accounts for around 38 % of the species recorded in the Iberian Peninsula. Catagapetus mclachlani and Oxyethira falcata are new records for Andalusia, as well as Beraea genera. Moreover, the presence of Stenophylax permistus has been confirmed. Besides a new species of Hydropsyche, another of Helicopsyche, and a possible new species of Agapetus are recorded. The most abundant families are Hydroptilidade (18 %), Limnephilidae (17 %), Leptoceridae (13 %) and Hydropsychidae (13 %). This update lists 86 new provincial records, significantly improving the inventory of the provinces of Granada, Jaén, Málaga and Seville. The caddisflies in the provinces of Huelva and Almería are barely known, especially the first. The biogeographical study conducted among the eight geographical units shows three distinct domains: Sierra Morena, Betic system and the Guadalquivir River Valley. However, the fauna of the Serranía de Ronda and Campo de Gibraltar seems to depart from this model, showing greater similarity to the Sierra Morena. The Andalusian fauna of caddisflies is mainly composed of elements of European origin (over 50 %) and endemism (42 %), of which 60 % are unique to Andalusia. These data show that, within the Iberian <b>Peninsula,</b> this region <b>stands</b> out as an important area of refuge and speciation center for caddisflies...|$|R
