25|$|For {{decades the}} New Deal was {{generally}} held in very high regard in the scholarship and the textbooks. That {{changed in the}} 1960s when New Left historians began a revisionist critique that said the New Deal was a bandaid for a patient that needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place, and lift up workers, women and minorities.

While we can identify in broad terms what these are, there is no unique mapping between markets and the non-market institutions that underpin them. The paper emphasizes the importance of &quot;local knowledge, &quot; and argues that a strategy of institution building must not over-emphasize best-practice &quot;blueprints &quot; at the expense of experimentation. Participatory political systems are the most effective ones for processing and aggregating local knowledge. Democracy is a meta-institution for building good institutions.

25|$|The New Deal's record {{came under}} attack by New Left historians in the 1960s for its pusillanimity in not attacking {{capitalism}} more vigorously, nor helping blacks achieve equality.

They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy,</b> and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.|$|E
25|$|After the 2005 local election, {{in which}} the PCP regained the {{presidency}} of 7 municipalities, the party holds the leadership of 32 (of 308) municipalities, {{most of them in}} Alentejo and Setúbal and holds the leadership of hundreds of civil parishes and local assemblies. The local administration by PCP is usually marked by concern about such issues as preventing privatization of the water supply, funding culture and education, providing access to sports, and promoting health, facilitating <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy,</b> and preventing corruption. The presence of the Greens in the coalition also keeps an eye on environmental issues such as recycling and water treatment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} and scope of schools self-classified as [...] "free schools" [...] and their associated movement were never clearly delineated, and as such, there was a wide variation between schools. The movement did not subscribe to a single ideology, but its [...] "free schools" [...] tended {{to fall into the}} binaries of either utopian cultural withdrawal from external concerns, or direct political address of social injustices. Some schools practiced <b>participatory</b> <b>democracies</b> for self-governance. The [...] "free schools" [...] movement was also known as the [...] "new schools" [...] or [...] "alternative schools movement". Author Ron Miller defined the free school movement's principles as letting families choose for their children, and letting children learn at their own pace.|$|R

The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the Federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.|$|E

Influential figures that had come out against Keynesian policy, even from left of center politics, include the UK Labour Party's Maurice Glasman, whose favorite economist is Hayek, and the diplomat Carne Ross, who asserted that no form of centralized authority can meet the problems of the modern world, arguing for an anti-statist form of <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy</b> instead.|$|E

25|$|Liberal {{opponents of}} both fascism and the Bolsheviks {{argue that there}} are various {{similarities}} between the two, including that they believed in {{the necessity of a}} vanguard leadership, had disdain for bourgeois values and it is argued had totalitarian ambitions. In practice, both have commonly emphasized revolutionary action, proletarian nation theories, one-party states and party-armies. However, both draw clear distinctions from each other both in aims and tactics, with the Bolsheviks emphasizing the need for an organized <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy</b> and an egalitarian, internationalist vision for society while the fascists emphasize hyper-nationalism and open hostility towards democracy, envisioning a hierarchical social structure as essential to their aims.|$|E
25|$|Due to the party's {{numbers in}} the Senate, both Liberal and Labor governments {{required}} {{the assistance of the}} Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably {{in the case of the}} Howard Government's goods and services tax (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as centrists, occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The party had no single base, instead drawing on the support of a sometimes uneasy coalition of political moderates, disaffected major-party voters, civil libertarians, and social activists (including environmentalists and anti-war campaigners). Commonalities included an almost uniform social liberalism and an emphasis on <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy.</b> Within the parliamentary party there was frequent internal conflict, with several senators leaving the party at various stages to sit as independents or to join other parties. After Don Chipp's retirement in 1986, only one subsequent leader (Cheryl Kernot) served for more than four years.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Self-help {{agencies}} (SHAs) are consumer-operated {{service organizations}} managed as <b>participatory</b> <b>democracies</b> involving members in all management tasks. Hierarchically organized board- and staff-run consumer-operated service programs (BSR-COSPs) are consumer man-aged, but they afford members less decision-making power.

This can be done, he claims, by breaking the constant threat of stasis and institutionalization of politics and parties through five institutional innovations. First, increase collective engagement through the public financing of campaigns and giving free access to media outlets. Second, hasten the pace of politics by breaking legislative deadlock through the enabling of {{the party in power}} to push through proposals and reforms, and for opposition parties to be able to dissolve the government and call for immediate elections. Third, the option of any segment of society to opt out of the political process and to propose alternative solutions for its own governance. Fourth, give the state the power to rescue oppressed groups that are unable to liberate themselves through collective action. Fifth, direct <b>participatory</b> <b>democracy</b> in which active engagement is not purely in terms of financial support and wealth distribution, but through which people are directly involved in their local and national affairs through proposal and action.|$|E

40|$|During {{election}} campaigns {{political parties}} compete to inform voters about their leaders, the issues, {{and where they}} stand on these issues. In that sense, election campaigns {{can be viewed as}} a particular kind of information campaign. Democratic theory supposes that <b>participatory</b> <b>democracies</b> are better served by an informed electorate rather than an uninformed one. But do all voters make equal information gains during campaigns? Why do some people make more information gains than others? And does the acquisition of campaign information have any impact on vote intentions? Drawing on the combined insights from political science research, communications theory and social psychology, we develop specific hypotheses about these campaign information dynamics. These hypotheses are tested with data from the 1997 Canadian Election Study, which includes a rolling cross-national campaign component, a post-election component, and a media content analysis. The results show that some people do make more information gains than others; campaigns produce a knowledge gap. Further, the intensity of media signals on different issues has an important impact on who receives what information and information gains have a significant impact on vote intentions...|$|R
