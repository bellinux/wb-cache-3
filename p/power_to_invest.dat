Estates also {{had access to}} credit and, without this, few smallholders could buy enough fertilizer, {{even when it was}} subsidised.

A complete withdrawal of these subsidies prevented 75% of smallholders buying fertilizer in 1988/89: a 25% subsidy was restored for 1989/90 and 1990/91 but removed in 1991/92. A temporary 11% subsidy was provided from 1992/93 to 1994/95 only.|$|E

The case contemplated by Dodwell became a fact when the death of Bishop Lloyd on 1 January 1710 was followed by the resignation of Bishop Ken, and accordingly Brokesby, Dodwell and Nelson returned to the communion of the established church, and attended service at Shottesbrooke Church on 28 February. A letter from S. Parker of Oxford, dated 12 November, appears to have called forth a reply dated 18 November, in which Brokesby shows that 'the new bishops' were merely suffragans, that no synodical denunciation had invested them with independent authority after the deaths of the deprived diocesans, that the 'deprived fathers' had no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> them with such authority, and that therefore they were not diocesan bishops.

Both the impacts and the awareness are particularly acute among native peoples throughout North America due to their closeness to the earth.

First, tribes are working to lessen their already relatively modest carbon footprint, with efforts ranging from equipping tribal housing with solar <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>investing</b> in wind energy (Native Winds, Inc.) and growing trees for carbon sequestration, hoping to generate marketable carbon credits (Nez Perce Tribe). Second, tribes are working to develop ways of adapting to the reality of global warming, both for themselves and for the wildlife which are endangered by climate change.

40|$|Authorised trustee {{status is}} a legal concept which has {{economic}} implications; {{one of the major}} implications is that it assists in the direction of investment funds into particular securities and areas of the economy. The concept of authorised trustee status, while attempting to achieve specific outcomes for the beneficiaries of trusts cannot be relied upon to secure these results.

The trustee as portfolio manager is required to maintain a review of decisions make under <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> trust assets.

Agency theory views modern corporations as contractual relationships between shareholder and management and asserts that agency problem arises when the desires or goals of shareholder and management conflict due to the separation of ownership and control (Jensen and Meckling 1976). The divergence of interests between shareholders and management hence requires adequate monitoring to discipline managers and ensure they work in the shareholders’ interests instead of their own.
