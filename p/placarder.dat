60|$|One would hope, this Tribunal of the Seventeenth is swifter than most. Already on the 21st, {{while our}} Court is but four days old, Collenot d'Angremont, 'the Royal enlister' (crimp, embaucheur) dies by torch-light. For, lo, the great Guillotine, wondrous to behold, now stands there; the Doctor's Idea has become Oak and Iron; the huge cyclopean axe 'falls in its grooves like the ram of the Pile-engine,' swiftly {{snuffing}} {{out the light}} of men?' 'Mais vous, Gualches, what have you invented?' This?--Poor old Laporte, Intendant of the Civil List, follows next; quietly, the mild old man. Then Durosoy, Royalist <b>Placarder,</b> 'cashier of all the Anti-Revolutionists of the interior:' he went rejoicing; said that a Royalist like him ought to die, of all days on this day, the 25th or Saint Louis's Day. All these have been tried, cast,--the Galleries shouting approval; and {{handed over to the}} Realised Idea, within a week. Besides those whom we have acquitted, the Galleries murmuring, and have dismissed; or even have personally guarded back to Prison, as the Galleries took to howling, and even to menacing and elbowing. (Moore's Journal, i. 159-168.) Languid this Tribunal is not.|$|E
5000|$|After 1989 {{he worked}} as a {{freelance}} composer for theater, television and radio at home and abroad. Since the same year Bentgens conducts the Heidelberg HardChor and 1. FC Heidelberg. With the clown trio [...] "Extra Nix" [...] he toured in the 90's together with Rosemie Warth and Thomas Nigl at renowned festival stages in Europe and Canada. During this time he worked with various orchestras, such as the Stuttgart Philharmonic, the orchestra of the Hessian radio, the Saarland Radio Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra of Freiburg and Hamburg Symphony Orchestra and composed the music for the German TV series 'Der Plakatierer' (literally The <b>Placarder).</b>|$|E
6000|$|For the rest, {{it is too}} clear our Successive Loan is not filling. As indeed, in such circumstances, a Loan {{registered}} by expunging of Protests was not the likeliest to fill. Denunciation of Lettres-de-Cachet, of Despotism generally, abates not: the Twelve Parlements are busy; the Twelve hundred <b>Placarders,</b> Balladsingers, Pamphleteers. Paris is what, in figurative speech, {{they call}} 'flooded with pamphlets (regorge de brochures);' flooded and eddying again. Hot deluge,--from so many Patriot ready-writers, all at the fervid or boiling point; each ready-writer, now in the hour of eruption, going like an Iceland Geyser! Against which what can a judicious friend Morellet do; a Rivarol, an unruly Linguet (well paid for it),--spouting cold! ...|$|R
