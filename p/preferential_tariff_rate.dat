40|$|Exports {{concentration}} in a reduced number of economic sectors has been always {{a concern for}} trade policy makers, mostly in developing countries. According to the economic theory and some recent empirical evidence, market access in international trade is improved through free trade agreements and <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> programs which could affect positively export diversification.  Following a similar approach used by Debaere and Mostashari (2005) and Volpe and Gómez (2007), this paper estimates the effects on Colombia’s export diversification induced by the lower tariffs offered by Mexico and the broader preference margin vis-à-vis third countries in the Mexican market derived from the G 3 Free Trade Agreement (FTA). For this purpose, dynamic Probit and dynamic Poisson models are estimated using an unbalanced panel data available from 1995 –year when the G 3 FTA entry into force– to 2010, the latest year available. Moreover, this paper also attempts to estimate the effects of Venezuela’s withdrawal from G 3 in 2006 {{and the effects of}} the bilateral crisis between Colombia and Venezuela {{in the second half of}} 2000 s.  In general, results show that lower tariffs faced by Colombian products in Mexico are associated with higher export diversification but this impact is sensitive to the economic cycle and a negative impact on diversification can arise depending on the specification of the model. Also, broader preferential margins in Mexico induce higher export diversification for Colombian products. However, there exists a strong dependence of export diversification in Colombia on the initial conditions and the past of the export portfolio offered to Mexico. On the other hand, Venezuela’s withdrawal from G 3 FTA in 2006 had no effect on export diversification from Colombia to Mexico meanwhile the bilateral crisis showed –in some specifications– positive effects on the export diversification to Mexico, the latter revealing a trade deviation pattern. Macroeconomic control variables –including the real exchange rate– showed to be irrelevant to the model.

40|$|On June 21, 2000, Israel and {{the member}} states of the European Union (EU) signed a trade {{agreement}} for products from Israel to be imported into the EU-countries at a <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rate.</b> Theoretically, this agreement only applied to products of Official Israeli origin. Thus, products of firms operating in the West Bank were not intended {{to take advantage of}} the agreement. But soon after it was established, many firms located in the West Bank still labelled their products as being of Israeli origin. In response to this problem, the European Commission (EC) issued a technical arrangement to Protocol 4 in the EU-Israel Trade Agreement whereby Israeli firms would have to acquire a certificate of origin for their products. Specifically, this meant that exporters would have to provide a proof of the precise location of the production facilities in order to claim the associated trade benefits. In addition, retailers in the EU selling Israeli products originating from the West Bank were expected to distinguish these products from products originating from Official Israel. This was implemented in all EU member countries, including the UK, from February 1, 2005. The policy had two main effects on the profitability of Israeli producers operating in the West Bank. First, consumers in the EU-countries gained knowledge about the true origin of the products. This may have had an influence on demand and affected consumption choices. Second, because of the differentiation in place-of-origin (between Official Israel and the West Bank), the products were no longer qualified {{to take advantage of the}} EU-Israel Trade Agreement. This was, in effect, the same as imposing a tariff on the products. This thesis investigates the impact of these effects on Israeli vegetable producers exporting to the UK. It finds that although the value of their exports decreased after the implementation of the amendment to Protocol 4, the negative impact on the profitability of exporters may in part have been counteracted by a more beneficiary subsidization policy of the Israeli Government. Furthermore, the impact of political perceptions on consumption is questionable (due to both the asymmetrical impact of consumers with different political perceptions and the unverified relationship between perceptions and consumption). As a result, it is believed that a large share of the decrease in the value of exports is due to the direct effect of expulsion from the Trade Agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of rapidly increasing trade openness with sharp exchange-rate appreciation formed {{the context in}} which Argentine industry had to carry out its production restructuring process from 1991 on.

5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|R

This report discusses (1) the volume of U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preferential trade, (2) the U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal trade preferences, (3) the tariff preferences offered by the U.

GAO found that the volume of imports receiving <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> under U.

S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal preferential trade have evolved in similar ways since their inception in the early 1970 s. U. S. and EU programs have included increasingly more products, particularly to the poorest countries, and have, over time, relaxed customs requirements that specify where and how products can be made. Despite some program differences, the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preference arrangements offer relatively similar tariff preferences on average. On the whole, EU programs cover more products than do U. S. programs, but U. S. beneficiary countries use more of their available tariff preferences than do EU beneficiaries. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in <b>preferential</b> or discriminatory <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential <b>tariff</b> <b>rates.</b> The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide <b>tariff</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) {{has entered}} into many free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) that contain special provisions—outward processing (OP) provisions—that extend {{the benefit of}} <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> to the products manufactured or processed in the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC). OP refers to the temporary exportation of goods for additional processing and the KIC is an outward processing zone in the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea) where South Korean companies are allowed to establish manufacturing plants and to employ North Korean labor. As “temporary” indicates, the finished goods are always imported back to South Korea for domestic consumption or permanent exportation. Currently, South Korea does not impose any tariff on North Korean products because the South Korean government regards inter-Korean trade as “trade within a nation. ” Other countries, however, do not consider the two Koreas as one customs territory and treat products that have been processed in the KIC as North Korean goods. This treatment of products that have been processed in the KIC as originating in North Korea harms the exporters of goods processed in the KIC because North Korea is {{not a member of}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) and therefore products originating in North Korea are not entitled to most-favored nation (MFN) rates of duty. In order to solve this problem, South Korea has included OP provisions in its FTAs with other nations. These OP provisions explicitly stipulate that goods that undergo processing in the KIC originate in South Korea, and are thus afforded the preferential rates under the FTAs. This article addresses the main concern with regard to these OP provisions: whether South Korea’s FTA partners have violated the MFN principle by applying the OP provisions to products processed in the KIC, reducing tariffs on Kaesong products, while not offering similar benefits to the products undergoing OP in other countries. This article argues that a WTO member nation could file a successful complaint against South Korea’s FTA partners because the South Korean OP provisions are discriminatory, and thus in violation of the MFN principle.

40|$|Historically, the diversified {{nature and}} role that {{regional}} and multilateral trade agreements have in global trade {{have been widely}} discussed. One side argues that trade agreements are building blocks for strategic alliances at both a country- and a company-specific level. A different side argues that trade agreements, especially free trade agreements, can result in failure for global multilateral trade entities, as overlapping trade agreements can result in complex import and export rules. Preferential trade agreements have seen exponential development during the last century and as a result, {{there has been a}} proliferation of free trade agreements around the world. In connection to this, countries have created free trade zones for companies to facilitate temporary import and export activities without generating duty and value-added tax costs. As a result, companies from developed countries have offshored manufacturing activities to developing countries. However, the profusion of free trade agreements has indirectly created discrimination against certain countries’ trade picture and import and export activities. At an industry level, it affects companies’ manufacturing and supply chain operations due to higher <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> when importing or exporting products in comparison to companies located in countries with preferential trade agreements. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how companies whose manufacturing is located in disfavored countries can develop their manufacturing and supply chain activities so that their manufactured goods can be included in a preferential trade agreement, even though the companies and the country are not. A case study is presented on how the company Krusell Thailand can import semi-finished plastic cases from suppliers in China to a free trade zone warehouse in Thailand, where it will undergo value-added processes. By means of these value-added processes, the origin of the plastic cases can be changed from Chinese to Thai so they are eligible for the <b>preferential</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> that Thailand and the EU have agreed upon. As a result of the changed origin, the duty costs will be reduced when plastic cases are exported to the EU, as compared to exports from China. The analysis illustrates that the proposed value-added processes at the free trade zone warehouse are sufficient to change the plastic cases’ country of origin. Moreover, the analysis shows that the proposal creates financial benefits at a specific break-even point where the quantity of plastic cases in an export shipment exceeds a certain volume. As a result, the reduction of duty mitigates the increased transport costs associated with the proposal. However, due to the proliferation of free trade agreements, the trade picture between Southeast Asia and the European Union is volatile. Thus, the proposal might prove to be more or less beneficial in the near future. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Many {{development}} experts {{worry that}} continuing reductions of tariff levels in high-income countries will limit trade flows from developing countries that benefit from preferential trade programs because of “preference erosion. ” Using {{a panel of}} U. S. import data between the years of 1997 and 2005, I find that reductions in preference margins will significantly diminish imports of some products, particularly from lowermiddle and low income countries; for example, a one percent reduction in the U. S. tariff on a product that is currently imported duty-free from developing countries will decrease imports of that product from lowermiddle countries {{by an average of}} 2. 6 percent. However, many products produced by developing countries fail to qualify for <b>preferential</b> <b>tariffs,</b> thus a gradual reduction in all U. S. <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> is expected to have only a modest impact on trade flows from developing countries.

40|$|The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), {{the program}} instituted in 1976 that allows {{developing}} countries to export thousands of products to the United States duty-free, is {{an important element of}} U. S. efforts to promote economic growth in the developing world. However, since the program's inception U. S. <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> have fallen significantly, thus potentially reducing the ability of the GSP program to encourage U. S. imports from beneficiary countries. This paper estimates the impact of U. S. tariff reductions on imports from the developing world using a panel of import data from 76 countries and 2, 389 GSP-eligible products between 1998 and 2001. It finds that reductions in U. S. <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> have diminished imports from developing countries significantly, although some countries have been impacted more than others.

30|$|The ASEAN {{heads of}} the {{government}} and state decided to sign a trade agreement (ASEAN Free Trade Area—AFTA) in 1992 to increase the ASEAN region’s competitive advantage as a production base geared toward the world market. AFTA was formed in 1993 by Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s it expanded to incorporate Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia. The main step was the liberalization of trade among member countries through the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers. In addition, economic integration of ASEAN gives consumers wider choice and better quality consumer products. The trade liberalization under AFTA is a Common Effective <b>Preferential</b> <b>Tariff</b> scheme, which has been in force since January 1993. The Common Effective <b>Preferential</b> <b>Tariff</b> (CEPT) Agreement for AFTA requires that <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> levied on a wide range of products traded within the region are reduced to 0 – 5 % (ASEAN website). The tariff reduction consisted of a schedule, to be implemented progressively until 2008. Quantitative restrictions and other non-tariff barriers are to be eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) within the global {{structure}} of overlapping regional trade agreements (RTAs) using a modified gravity equation. First, it examines {{the effects of}} the Trade Liberalization Program which started in 2006. SAFTA would have a minor effect on regional trade flows and the impact on custom duties would be a manageable fiscal shock for most members. Second, the paper ranks the trade effects of other potential RTAs for individual South Asian countries and SAFTA: RTAs with North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the European Union (EU) dominate one with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
