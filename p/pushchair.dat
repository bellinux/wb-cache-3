25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain <b>pushchair.)</b> It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E

In addition to its combination prams, Silver Cross also produces infant car seats (that combine with the pram travel systems), as well as lightweight umbrella-fold pushchairs, nursery furniture collections, nursery bedding and decor items, and a range of toys and gifts including classic teddy bears and traditional rag dolls.
