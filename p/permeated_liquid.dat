Briefly, the membrane was assembled in the flow cell, and the nitrogen provided the required pressure to drive the liquid through the membrane. Transport behavior of water, ethanol, hexane, and kerosene were measured, and all the measurements were carried out at a constant temperature. For measurements of different liquids on the same membrane, the sample is dried in air for 12 h. The weight of the liquid permeating through the membrane was measured at intervals of 1 h {{over a period of}} 12 h. And then the volume of <b>permeated</b> <b>liquid</b> was determined based on the weight difference.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of up to}} 30 mol% zirconia doping on microstructure, liquid permeability, thermal and chemical stability of mesoporous composite titania/zirconia membranes was investigated. It was demonstrated that zirconia retards the phase transformation of anatase until at least 700 °C. The pore size decreased gradually to 3. 6 nm by addition of up to 20 mol% zirconia, while nitrogen sorption experiments showed that the porosity, BET surface area and pore connectivity increased. Chemical stability tests showed that undoped titania and composite titania/zirconia materials were stable in the pH range 1 – 13 at room temperature. The mechanical strength of titania membranes was significantly improved by addition of zirconia. The permeability of titania and titania/zirconia composite membranes was eight times larger than that of γ-alumina. The permeability was not affected by the level of zirconia doping or {{by the nature of}} the <b>permeating</b> <b>liquid...</b>|$|R

Both systems were operated in a closed loop and in both of them all the cells that were transferred with the foam were recycled back into the bioreactor by pumping: either the <b>permeate</b> <b>liquid</b> flowing from the adsorption column or collapsed foam. Analysis shows no difference in biomass enrichment between the two fermentation setups.

Foam collapse occurred within few minute and the cells were robust enough to suffer the anaerobic conditions for short time, which was necessary to transfer the collapsed cell-containing broth by pumping into the bioreactor. A loss of 0.5 % was observed in the very stable foam phase which was calculated from a mass balance of the volume of slowly collapsed foam, a bacterial enrichment, and total cell mass produced in the system.|$|R

But so far the parameter for expressing the {{stability of}} SiO 2 sol cannot be characterized by a proper measurement. In this paper, a new method, <b>liquid</b> <b>permeating</b> method, was introduced, by which the stability of SiO 2 sol was characterized {{and the effects of}} additive, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and MgO were presented. The results show that with the amount of DMF increasing, the gel-time of SiO 2 sol became longer; and that with the amount of MgO increasing, the gel-time became shorter. The results obtained by this new method are as same as that from the traditional tedious viscometer measurement method, which indicate that this <b>liquid</b> <b>permeating</b> method is a reliable method for characterizing the stability of SiO 2 sol. Besides, this <b>liquid</b> <b>permeating</b> method is also simple, time-saving and low-cost for evaluating SiO 2 sol stability...|$|R
40|$|Both {{cracks in}} clay liner and the complex {{composition}} of landfill leachate might have {{effects on the}} hydraulic conductivity of a compacted clay liner. In this study, the hydraulic conductivities of natural clay and bentonite-modified clay with and without desiccation cracks were measured, respectively, using three types of <b>liquids</b> as <b>permeating</b> liquid: 2   500  mg/L acetic acid solution, 0. 5  mol/L CaCl 2 solution, and tap water. When tap water was adopted as the <b>permeating</b> <b>liquid,</b> desiccation cracks resulted in increases in the average value of hydraulic conductivity: a 25 -fold increase for the natural clay and a 5. 7 -fold increase for the bentonite-modified clay. It was also {{found out that the}} strong self-healing capability of bentonite helped to reduce the adverse impact of cracks on hydraulic performance. In contrast to tap water, simulated leachates (acetic acid and CaCl 2 solutions) show no adverse effect on the hydraulic conductivities of natural and bentonite-modified clays.

40|$|Contaminant {{transport}} in non-reactive porous media {{depends on}} soil and pore fluid properties. In {{the case of}} fine soils, chemical reactions, electrostatic interactions and biomediated reactions can modify the physical properties of the porous media. This work evaluates mass transport through reactive barriers, showing {{the relative importance of}} particle-fluid interactions and microorganism growth on contaminants displacement. Compacted soils samples were tested with arsenic solutions and landfill leachate as <b>permeating</b> <b>liquids.</b> The addition of clay decreased the hydraulic conductivity and delayed the contaminant displacement due to electrostatic attraction between the charged soil particles and counter ions. Microorganisms were responsible for pore clogging due to the increase of biomass with permeation time. These two effects were simultaneously considered by implementing a 1 D-mass transport equation to simulate the behaviour of reactive barriers. Obtained results are of fundamental importance for the design of “smart ” barriers for the remediation of contaminated groundwater.

50|$|In air-gap MD, the {{evaporator}} channel {{resembles that}} in DCMD, whereas the permeate gap lies between the membrane and a cooled walling and {{is filled with}} air. The vapour passing through the membrane must additionally overcome this air gap before condensing on the cooler surface. The advantage of this method is the high thermal insulation towards the condenser channel, thus minimizing heat conduction losses. However, the disadvantage is that the air gap represents an additional barrier for mass transport, reducing the surface- related permeate output compared to DCMD. A further advantage towards DCMD is the fact, that volatile substances with a low surface tension such as alcohol or other solvents can be separated from diluted solutions, {{due to the fact}} that there is no contact between the <b>liquid</b> <b>permeate</b> and the membrane with AGMD.|$|R

Intracellular lipid bodies associate with the chloroplast and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but show no evidence of being secreted.

Additionally the fouth layer, due {{to the failure of}} retaining it in the absorption column in spite of various manipulations attempted, was collected as a gravity flow effluent. 2) Distribution of the total iron was different with respective layer and reacting time, but there was iron which would not dissolve in water due its remaining in the absorption column unber ionic combination and with increased with the reaction progress. 3) Total iron in the first layer was very small i. e. traceable degree and the greater part of it was easily split off iron. Biliverdin was undetectable therefore absorption curve worth mentioning was obtainable. 4) Conversely with the hourly decrease of total iron in the second layer, easily split off iron increased with the reaction progress. The amount of Biliverdin was highest at the end of four hours. In the absorption curve the peak absorptions of 610 mμ was observed right after the initiation of reaction and after one hour which was believed to be due to pyridine-hemichromogen being absorbed. 5) Total iron of the third layer was exceedingly small and most part of it was easily split off iron. The quantity of Biliverdin was highest at the end of fourth hour. Absorption curve was not obtainable. 6) For the fourth layer total iron showed the peak at the end of four hours but the value for the easily split off iron was relatively high throughout and little deflection was observed for all reaction progress. Biliverdin content was highest in this layer and highest at the fourth hour. With reference to the absorption curve at the initial reaction stage 3 maximum peaks of 656, 530 and 500 mμ were observed.

Typical choices of impurity gas are hydrogen deuteride, deuterium, nitrogen, neon and argon, or a mixture of these. These solids consist of individual impurity atoms and molecules as well as clusters of impurity atoms and molecules covered with layers of solidified helium. The clusters have an imperfect crystalline structure and diameters ranging up to 90 angstroms, depending somewhat on the choice of impurity. Immediately following formation the clusters aggregate into loosely connected porous solids that are submerged in and completely <b>permeated</b> by the <b>liquid</b> helium. Im-He solids are extremely effective at stabilizing high concentrations of free radicals, which can be introduced by applying a high power RF dis- charge to the impurity gas mixture just before it strikes the super fluid helium.

Suwannee River water was selected to systematically {{study the effects of}} critical SPE variables such as loading mass, concentration, flow rate, and up-scaling on the extraction selectivity of the PPL sorbent. High-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy were performed to interpret the DOM chemical space of eluates, as well as <b>permeates</b> and wash <b>liquids</b> with molecular resolution. Up to 89 % dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recovery was obtained with a DOC/PPL mass ratio of 1 : 800 at a DOC concentration of 20 mg/L. With the application of larger loading volumes, low proportions of highly oxygenated compounds were retained on the PPL sorbent. The effects of the flow rate on the extraction selectivity of the sorbent were marginal. Up-scaling had a limited effect on the extraction selectivity with the exception of increased self-esterification with a methanol solvent, resulting in methyl ester groups. Furthermore, the SPE/PPL extract exhibited highly authentic characteristics in comparison with original water and reverse osmosis samples. These findings will be useful for reproducibly isolating DOM with representative molecular compositions from various sources and concentrations and minimizing potential inconsistencies among interlaboratory comparative studies...|$|R

40|$|Acidic {{groundwater}} {{resulting from}} the poorly planned use of acid sulfate soils {{has become a major}} environmental issue in coastal Australia over the last several years. Use of permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) designed to generate alkalinity by promoting sulfate reduction has recently become popular as an alternative solution to this problem. However, recent studies have also revealed that the long-term performance of such PRBs can be significantly undermined by chemical precipitation and clogging of pore space, which would decrease the buffer capacity and hydraulic conductivity of the reactive material. This study seeks to explore the feasibility of using bentonite in addition to lime and fly ash to form mixtures with a high buffer capacity and permeability that would enable groundwater flow through PRBs over a substantial period of time. A series of laboratory experiments, including buffer capacity and leaching tests, were performed on different mixtures of fly ash with lime and bentonite using acidic fluids of low pH. It was found that the ability of such mixtures to neutralize acidic fluids was mostly controlled by the content of lime. Laboratory data also showed that an addition of bentonite to lime-fly ash mixtures could decrease the buffer capacity of soil. Compaction tests indicated that the presence of bentonite would increase the dry density of mixtures at the optimum moisture content. A series of hydraulic conductivity tests were carried out to study changes in the coefficient of permeability of lime-fly ash mixtures with different contents of bentonite <b>permeated</b> with acidic <b>liquids.</b> The obtained results revealed that the coefficient of permeability of the specimens tended to increase over a period of time, likely due to the changes in the diffuse double layer of bentonite particles.

40|$|The Forward Osmosis Bag (FOB) is a {{personal}} water purification device for recovery of potable liquid from almost any non-potable water source. The FOB experiment was flown as a sortie mission on STS- 135 /ULF 7 using flight-certified materials and a design based on the X-Pack(TradeMark) from Hydration Technology Innovations (Albany, OR). The primary objective was to validate the technology for use under microgravity conditions. The FOB utilizes a difference in solute concentration across a selectively permeable membrane to draw water molecules from the non-potable water while rejecting most chemical and all microbial contaminants contained within. Six FOB devices were tested on STS- 135 {{for their ability to}} produce a potable <b>liquid</b> <b>permeate</b> from a feed solution containing 500 mL potassium chloride (15 g/L) amended with 0. 1 % methyl blue dye (w:v) tracer against an osmotic gradient created by addition of 60 mL of concentrate containing the osmolytes fructose and glucose, and 0. 01 % sodium fluorescein (w:v) tracer. Three FOB devices were physically mixed by hand for 2 minutes by a crewmember after loading to augment membrane wetting for comparison with three unmixed FOB devices. Hydraulic flux rate and rejection of salt and dye in microgravity were determined from a 60 -mL sample collected by the crew on orbit after 6 hours. Post-flight analysis of samples collected on orbit demonstrated that the Forward Osmosis Bag achieved expected design specifications in microgravity. The hydraulic flux rate of water across the membrane was reduced approximately 50 % in microgravity relative to ground controls that generated an average of 50 mL per hour using the same water and osmolyte solutions. The membrane rejected both potassium and chloride at > 92 % and methyl blue dye at > 99. 9 %. Physical mixing of the FOB during water recovery did not have any significant effect on either flux rate or rejection of solutes from the water solution. The absence of buoyancy-driven convection in microgravity suggests that mass transport was dominated by diffusion, slowing the rate of permeate production across the membrane. It is possible that a predicted reduction in concentration polarization at the membrane surface that may have acted to increase the rate of permeate production in microgravity was negligible under the described test conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} {{channel configuration}} {{consists of a}} condenser channel with inlet and outlet and an evaporator channel with inlet and outlet. These two channels are separated by the hydrophobic, micro porous membrane. For cooling, the condenser channel is flooded with fresh water and the evaporator e.g. with salty feed water. The coolant enters the condenser channel at a temperature of 20 °C. After passing through the membrane, the vapour condenses in the cooling water, releasing its latent heat and leading to a temperature increase in the coolant. Sensible heat conduction also heats the cooling water through {{the surface of the}} membrane. Due to the mass transport through the membrane the mass flow in the evaporator decreases whilst the condenser channel increases by the same amount. The mass flow of pre-heated coolant leaves the condenser channel at a temperature of about 72 °C and enters a heat exchanger, thus pre-heating the feed water. This feed water is then delivered to a further heat source and finally enters the evaporator channel of the MD module at a temperature of 80 °C. The evaporation process extracts latent heat from the feed flow, which cools down the feed increasingly in flow direction. Additional heat reduction occurs due to sensible heat passing through the membrane. The cooled feed water leaves the evaporator channel at approximately 28 °C. Total temperature differences between condenser inlet and evaporator outlet and condenser inlet and evaporator outlet are about equal. In a PGMD module, the permeate channel is separated from the condenser channel by a condensation surface. This enables the direct use of a salt water feed as coolant, since it does not come into contact with the permeate. Considering this, the cooling-or feed water entering the condenser channel at a temperature T1 can now also be used to cool the permeate. Condensation of vapour takes place inside the <b>liquid</b> <b>permeate.</b> Pre-heated feed water that was used to cool the condenser can be conducted directly to a heat source for final heating, after leaving the condenser at a temperature T2. After it has reached temperature T3 it is guided into the evaporator. Permeate is extracted at temperature T5 and the cooled brine is discharged at temperature T4.|$|R
