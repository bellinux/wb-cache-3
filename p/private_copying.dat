25|$|Whether or not sharing files over a {{peer-to-peer}} network {{falls within the}} scope of this prohibition has been controversial. Some groups, such as the Audionautes, have contended that the act of receiving copyrighted works from Internet sites or {{peer-to-peer network}}s is an act of <b>private</b> <b>copying,</b> which is a valid exemption from copyright rules, following from CPI L122-5. Courts have ruled in both directions, some convicting peer-to-peer users, others acquitting them.|$|E
2500|$|December 2006Copyright Amendment Act is passed. [...] Effective January 2007, the Act (a) {{strengthens}} criminal infringement provisions, (b) adds new exceptions including for parody or satire, and <b>private</b> <b>copying,</b> (c) strengthens anti-circumvention law {{to make it}} {{more like}} the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (as required by the Australia–US FTA), and (d) makes some changes to provisions affecting libraries and educational institutions.|$|E
2500|$|The Act also {{introduced}} {{a series of}} new exceptions into Australian copyright law. [...] The best known are the <b>private</b> <b>copying</b> exceptions, which follow on from proposals by former Attorney-General Philip Ruddock {{to allow people to}} record most television or radio program at home to watch at a later time with family or friends, and to format-shift their music (make copies from CDs onto personal computers and portable music players). [...] Unlike some countries in Europe, or Canada, there is no fee or licence payment on players to compensate copyright owners for these private copies, although the exceptions are narrowly defined and do not allow, for example, making copies for friends or family. [...] The Act {{also introduced}} a copyright exception allowing parody and satire, and an exception to allow certain non-commercial use by public sector institutions like universities, schools, art galleries and archives, provided that an Australian court decides an exception would be consistent with the Berne three-step test.|$|E
2500|$|While Bill C-60 did {{not alter}} {{the right to make}} <b>private</b> <b>copies</b> of copyrighted material, it {{introduced}} limitations on the use of these <b>private</b> <b>copies.</b> In particular, the bill sought to make selling, renting, trading, distributing, and communicating legally-made <b>private</b> <b>copies</b> of a copyrighted work an infringement of copyrights. This implied that if downloads via peer-to-peer were [...] "for personal use, and not redistributed, there will be no infringement." ...|$|R

His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a [...] "reduced copyright" [...] and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that [...] "fairly successful non-stars" [...] receive a greater share than they do now (compare with <b>private</b> <b>copying</b> levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous micropayment system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies {{should be considered a}} copyright violation. He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde.|$|E
2500|$|As {{applied by}} rabbinic jurists, the rule against {{acting like a}} Sodomite gives rise to three {{possible}} limitations on copyright, even assuming that copyright is property. First, if an author has created and disseminated his work with no intention of profiting from it, he suffers no economic loss even if another benefits from his work without paying for it, and thus such an author might be acting like a Sodomite were he to insist upon payment after the fact. Second, the rule against Sodomite behavior supports the view of some rabbinic jurists that <b>private</b> <b>copying</b> is permitted {{so long as the}} copier would not have otherwise purchased the copy and thus causes the author no loss. Third, the rule might be the basis for limiting copyright’s duration for published works. In his seminal ruling rejecting a perpetual, proprietary copyright while conceding that authors have an exclusive right to print their unpublished manuscripts, [...] Yitzhak Schmelkes [...] reasoned that copying causes the author no damage (as distinct from foregone profit) once the first edition has been sold, and thus that the rule against Sodomite behavior negates any continuing claim the author might have to enforce an exclusive right to print following the first edition.|$|E

50|$|Levies {{are often}} {{considered}} a compensation for illegal file sharing. This is debatable, however: levies {{could be seen}} as not being an advance for fines, but rather, only intended to compensate for <b>copies</b> in the <b>private</b> sphere that are legally allowed in many jurisdictions. A notable exception in Europe is the UK, that does not allow <b>private</b> <b>copies.</b> But generally legislators allow <b>private</b> <b>copies</b> for two reasons: firstly, because otherwise the enforcement would be unfeasible for private reasons, and secondly because the administrative burden would be disproportional.|$|R

Since 1999, these <b>private</b> <b>copying</b> levies on blank audio recording media (such as audio cassettes, CDs and CD-Rs) have raised {{millions of dollars for}} songwriters, recording artists, music publishers and record companies who partake in the industry system. In exchange, and subject to certain exceptions, the act of copying music onto an audio recording medium for the private use of the person who makes the copy does not constitute copyright infringement.

50|$|The <b>private</b> <b>copying</b> levy has {{traditionally}} {{been seen as a}} compensation for the original authors, transferring payment from analog media to digital media.

Ireland, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus do not recognize the right to <b>private</b> <b>copying,</b> so no fee is charged. Other countries have opted to compensate the authors directly. This is the case of Norway, where 40 million euros were spent for this purpose during 2010.

The Copyright Board gave the opinion that <b>Private</b> <b>Copying</b> of copyrighted sound recordings for one's personal use was legal, irrespective {{of the source of}} that material. Users of P2P networks were thus clear of liability for copyright violations for any music file downloading activity.
