He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod {{was involved in the}} intelligence department, he was appointed <b>Political</b> <b>Agent</b> for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of the}} East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as <b>Political</b> <b>Agent</b> and returned to England.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{was born}} in Wales to Anglo-Irish parents. In 1817, after holding several ranks in the army, he became the equerry of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Edward died two years later, leaving a widow and infant daughter. Holding the {{position}} of comptroller of the Duchess of Kent's household for the next nineteen years, Conroy also acted as her confidant and <b>political</b> <b>agent,</b> among other roles. Together, they designed the Kensington System, an elaborate and strict system of rules for the upbringing of young Victoria, designed to render her weak-willed and utterly dependent upon them {{in the hope of}} allowing them one day to wield power through her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a <b>political</b> <b>agent</b> of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E

The Internet allows <b>political</b> <b>agents</b> to filter and redistribute the political news of the day to counter the perceived bias they see in the mass media. Bias Collection Sites are one avenue that <b>political</b> <b>agents</b> use to present their filtered version of the news of the day. In this study, I examine how two bias collection sites, commondreams. org and rightwingnews. com, used the already produced news to discuss immigration, environmental issues, and the Iraq War during January 2007. What emerges from my analysis is four distinct ways each side discusses the issues I selected. My analysis reveals that <b>political</b> <b>agents</b> select and manipulate self-serving news stories to reaffirm their already existing political standpoints. The broader explications of my study are that despite the dominate structure of the media. Personal agency can subvert the larger structure of the media...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Current {{proposals}} for strengthening policy ownership in reforming economies are fundamentally flawed. Modeling the reform {{process as a}} prisoners’ dilemma demonstrates that <b>political</b> <b>agents</b> must overcome this conflict of interests before present {{proposals for}} bolstering ownership will work. A politically autono-mous mass media is one important mechanism enabling <b>political</b> <b>agents</b> to do this. Reforming countries without free media face an uphill battle overcoming {{the problems associated with}} transition. We test our theory by investigating the rela-tionship between media freedom, foreign aid, and economic development in 26 post-socialist transition countries.
