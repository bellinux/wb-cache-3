5|$|What is now Route 147 was an {{unimproved}} {{road back}} in 1927. When the 500-series county routes {{were established in}} the 1950s, this road {{became a part of}} County Route 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of U.S. Route 9) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of County Route 18, which continued west <b>past</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 9 to Route 47. In 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. As a result of a bridge replacement over the Grassy Sound, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.|$|E

For the 2003 Championship, qualification {{was limited to}} the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz. Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players, the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple-choice quiz (a score of 80% or better was required to advance); followed by an online five-question essay test; followed by a two-game online tournament at Pogo.com. The process was to have produced a field of 23 plus one: Matt McNally, the 2003 national champion, who received a bye and was not required to qualify. However, {{at the end of the}} online tournament, there was an eleven-way tie for the last six spots. The decision was made to invite all of those who had tied for said spots.

500|$|The {{second phase}} of SR52 from I-805 to [...] <b>past</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 395 (which became I-15 in 1974) was {{projected}} to cost $29.4million (about $ in [...] dollars). The new freeway was {{to provide access to}} Tierrasanta and reduce the traffic on I-8. The U.S. Navy was consulted in the planning process due to the road's proposed routing through MCAS Miramar that would provide a delineation against further urban development. There were no concerns expressed at the public hearing on November17, 1970; however, construction did not begin for more than ten years, as California governor Jerry Brown stalled the construction of SR52 from Santo Road to SR67. In 1977, the county supervisor, a San Diego City councilman, and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to Brown to ask for the construction of this portion of SR 125 and other freeways, due to concerns about the types of congestion seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the possible deletions; in response, Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed, and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram, calling it [...] "intemperate". In 1984, Leo Trombatore, the Caltrans Director under California governor George Deukmejian, requested to the California Transportation Commission (CTC) that [...] "formal studies toward this end be initiated immediately.
