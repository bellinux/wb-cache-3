The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{absorption}} {{refrigeration cycle}} device using a plate type generator {{in order to}} improve the start-up process to reduce the time to reach the steady state condition. A conventional absorption refrigeration cycle device using a shell&tube generator places a rectifier above the generator to remove absorbent from generated refrigerant vapor and to raise concentration of refrigerant vapor. However the replacement of a shell&tube type generator by a plate type generator makes it difficult to include the rectifier within an absorption refrigeration system. Therefore, the cycle proposed in the present study introduced a <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> instead of a rectifier. Refrigerant vapor in the <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> is cooled by coolant so that only absorbent within the generated vapor condenses by utilizing the difference of boiling temperature. Then, the analytical model was formulated in order to investigate the effectiveness of the plate type generator.

40|$|We {{minimize}} the total entropy {{production of a}} process designed for dehydrogena-tion of propane. The process consists of 21 units, including a plug-ow reactor, a <b>partial</b> <b>condenser,</b> two tray distillation columns {{and a handful of}} heat exchangers and compressors. The units were modeled in a manner that made them little sen-sitive to changes in the molar ow rates, to make the optimization more exible. The operating conditions, and to some degree the design of selected units, which minimized the total entropy production of the process, were found. The most important variables were the amount of recycled propane and propylene, conver-sion and selectivity in the reactor, as well as the number of tubes in the reactor. The optimal conversion, selectivity and recycle ows were results of a very clear trade-off among the entropy produced in the reactor, the <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> and the two distillation columns. Although several simplifying assumptions were made for computational reasons, this shows for the rst time that it is also meaningful to use the entropy production as an objective function in chemical engineering pro-cess optimization studies...|$|E
5000|$|One {{reason for}} an {{efficiency}} drop {{is because the}} design and/or implementation of the heating system gives return water (heat transfer fluid) temperatures at the boiler of over 55°C (131°F), which prevents significant condensation in the heat exchanger. Better education of both installers and owners {{could be expected to}} raise efficiency towards the reported laboratory values. Natural Resources Canada also suggests ways to make better use of these boilers, such as combining space and water heating systems. Some boilers (e.g. Potterton) can be switched between two flow temperatures such as 63°C (145°F) and 84°C (183°F), only the former being [...] "fully condensing." [...] However, boilers are normally installed with higher flow temperature by default because a domestic hot water cylinder is generally heated to 60°C (140°F), and this takes too long to achieve with a flow temperature only three degrees higher.

40|$|Fatty acid synthase from {{lactating}} rat {{mammary gland}} is rapidly and irreversibly inhibited by S-(4 -bromo- 2, 3 -dioxobutyl) -CoA. Of the seven partial reactions catalysed by the enzyme, the inhibition {{of the overall}} catalytic activity is closely paralleled only by inhibition of the beta-oxoacyl synthase (<b>condensing)</b> <b>partial</b> reaction. Three partial reactions. Beta-oxoacyl reductase, beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase and enoyl reductase, are inhibited to a modest degree. The three partial reactions known to involve an acyl-CoA/CoA-binding site, acetyl acyltransferase, malonyl acyltransferase and palmitoyl thioesterase, are not inhibited by S-(4 -bromo- 2, 3 -dioxobutyl) -CoA. The modification process does not cause the enzyme to dissociate into catalytically incompetent monomers. Stoichiometric studies suggest that approx. 6 mol of reagent are incorporated per mol of totally inhibited enzyme (dimer). The formation of acylated enzyme from either acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA protects the enzyme equally well against S-(4 -bromo- 2, 3 -dioxobutyl) -CoA. Also, pretreatment of the enzyme with 5, 5 '-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid), a thiol-specific reagent reported to block essential thiol groups in the <b>condensing</b> <b>partial</b> reaction, protects against inhibition by the reagent. On the other hand, the presence of up to 770 microM-S-acetonyl-CoA or dethio-CoA does not protect the enzyme from irreversible inhibition.

For the recovery of lactic acid, two reactions, esterification and hydrolysis, are involved and hence, an apparatus with two distillation columns was developed and operated in a batch mode to ensure enough residence time in the reboiler and column.

In this work, it is studied the control structure {{selection of}} a deethanizer distillation column from Mongstad/Statoil. This is a multicomponent distillation column with a <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> and a vapor distillate flow. Having a very small distillate flow rate (1 % of the feed flow rate), this column presents some difficulties for pressure control. The simulations are done in ASPEN Plus and ASPEN Dynamics. The main objective is to find a structure that minimizes the effect of the disturbances and implementation error (noise and bias) in the top and bottom compositions (indirect composition control). The results show that it is better to control temperatures in the top section where the gains are higher and, as this is a multicomponent column, the two-point temperature control does not improve the control system performance, confirming the results obtained by Hori and Skogestad (2007 b). As the most important disturbance for this column is the feed flow rate, the results also show that we should ratio the available manipulated variables with feed flow to improve the control performance.

When using ground source for low-temperature heat source, heat production costs increases by about 10 %, while <b>partial</b> use of <b>condensed</b> flue gasses for low-temperature heat source results in an 8 % cost reduction. Furthermore, the analysis shows that when a large-scale HP is integrated with an existing CHP plant, the projected spot market situation in The Nordic Power Exchange (Nord Pool) towards 2025, which reflects a growing share of wind power and heat-supply constrained power generation electricity, further reduces the operational hours of the CHP unit over time, while increasing the operational hours of the HP unit. In result, an HP unit at half the heat production capacity as the CHP unit in combination with a heat-only boiler represents as a possibly financially feasible alternative to CHP operation, rather than a supplement to CHP unit operation. While such revised operational strategy would have impacts on policies to promote co-generation, these results indicate that the integration of large-scale HP may jeopardize efforts to promote co-generation. Policy instruments should be designed to promote the integration of HP with lower than half of the heating capacity of the CHP unit. Also it is found, that CHP-HP plant designs should allow for the utilization of heat recovered from the CHP unit’s flue gasses for both concurrent (CHP unit and HP unit) and independent operation (HP unit only). For independent operation, the recovered heat is required to be stored. ...|$|R

It is of significant importance – {{both in terms of}} economic competence and environmental concern – that these washing effluents are treated for recovering the components. The objective of this work was to develop and optimise the separation processes of the recovery section of a catalyst manufacturing plant. The methods proposed in the initial design were proven suitable for the purposes. It was shown that it is possible and highly economical to recover the valuable components from the motherliquor and washing effluents. It was also proven, that these components can be efficiently reused in the washing stages without harmfully affecting the catalyst properties. The recovery efficiency of a continuous evaporator was proven high: over 90 % of the most valuable component, titanium tetrachloride, was recovered. The evaporator was most feasible when operated at reduced pressures. The separation of the key components via distillation was proven economically feasible. However, the toluene column condenser is proposed to be a <b>partial</b> <b>condenser</b> instead of total. The accumulation of light components in the toluene recovery cycle can be effectively avoided via bleeding the vapour from this condenser out from the process. The accuracy of modelling the separation units was increased via regression of the binary interaction parameters of the key components.

Via these experiments it was also proven that there are no azeotropes within the studied binary mixtures and hence conventional distillation is possible. The effects of the impurities in the washing liquids were shown to have practically no effect on the catalyst composition, morphology or polymerisation properties.
