The adsorption of fibrinogen and lysozyme on these SAM surfaces under different ionic strengths and pH values is studied using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. It is shown that variations in ionic strength have little effect on the adsorbed amount of fibrinogen and lysozyme on these SAMs at a fixed pH value. Analysis of the effect of pH on protein adsorption at a fixed ionic strength shows that charge interactions are a significant component of protein adsorption. These studies provide insights into the role of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic <b>interactions</b> in <b>protein</b> adsorption. 1...|$|R

However, accurate residue details of ligand induced protein binding and unfolding on an interface were still unknown by the current ensemble of protein structure characterizations. Here, a hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) approach coupled with analysis of NMR TOCSY spectra and the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was designed to enable residue level understanding of lysozyme adsorbed at a phenyl-ligand modified surface. Results showed that the binding sites and unfolding of lysozyme molecules on phenyl-agarose microspheres demonstrated significant ligand-density dependence and protein-coverage dependence. Either increasing ligand density or decreasing adsorption coverage would lead to more binding sites and unfolding of the protein molecules. With the multipoint adsorption strengthening, the protein molecule changed from lying end-on to side-on. Finally, Molecular Dock simulation was utilized to evaluate the NMR determined binding sites based on energy ranking of the binding.

40|$|Competitive {{adsorption}} {{of three}} human plasma proteins: albumin (HSA), fibrinogen (Fgn), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) from their ternary solution mixtures onto a sulfhydryl-to-sulfonate gradient surface was investigated using spatially-resolved {{total internal reflection}} fluorescence (TIRF) and autoradiography. The concentration of each protein in the ternary solution mixture was kept at an equivalent of 1 / 100 of its physiological concentration in blood plasma. The three proteins displayed different adsorption and desorption characteristics. Each protein adsorbed less to the sulfonate region than to the sulfhydryl region of the gradient. The adsorption-desorption kinetics revealed large differences in the adsorption and desorption rates of three proteins. By fitting the experimental data to a simple model of competitive protein adsorption, the affinity of each protein to the surface at the gradient center position was ranked as: Fgn > HSA >> IgG.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of biomaterials covers {{a growing number of}} biomedical applications. The use of biomaterials in biological environment is associated with a number of problems, the most important of which is biocompatabUity. If the implanted biomaterial is not compatible with the environment, it will be rejected by the biological site. This may be manifested in many ways depending on the environment in which it is used. Adsorption of proteins takes place almost instantaneously when a biomaterial comes into contact with most biological fluids. The eye is a unique body site for the study of <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> with <b>biomaterials,</b> because of its ease of access and deceptive complexity of the tears. The use of contact lenses for either vision correction and cosmetic reasons or as a route for the controlled drug delivery, has significantly increased in recent years. It is relatively easy to introduce a contact lens Into the tear fluid and remove after a few minutes without surgery or trauma to the patient. A range of analytical techniques were used and developed to measure the proteins absorbed to some existing commercial contact lens materials and also to novel hydrogels synthesised within the research group. Analysis of the identity and quantity of proteins absorbed to biomaterials revealed the importance of many factors on the absorption process. The effect of biomaterial structure, protein nature in terms of size. shape and charge and pH of the environment on the absorption process were examined {{in order to determine the}} relative up-take of tear proteins. This study showed that both lysozyme and lactoferrin penetrate the lens matrix of ionic materials. Measurement of the mobility and activity of the protein deposited into the surface and within the matrix of ionic lens materials demonstrated that the mobility is pH dependent and, within the experimental errors, the biological activity of lysozyme remained unchanged after adsorption and desorption. The study on the effect of different monomers copolymerised with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) on the protein up-take showed that monomers producing a positive charge on the copolymer can reduce the spoilation with lysozyme. The studies were extended to real cases in order to compare the patient dependent factors. The in-vivo studies showed that the spoilation is patient dependent as well as other factors. Studies on the extrinsic factors such as dye used in colour lenses showed that the addition of colourant affects protein absorption and, in one case, its effect is beneficial to the wearer as it reduces the quantity of the protein absorbed...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{duplication}} provides {{much of the}} {{raw material}} from which functional diversity evolves. Two evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed that generate functional diversity: neofunctionalization, the de novo acquisition of function by one duplicate, and subfunctionalization, the partitioning of ancestral functions between gene duplicates. With <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> as a surrogate for protein functions, evidence of prodigious neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization has been identified in analyses of empirical <b>protein</b> <b>interactions</b> and evolutionary models of <b>protein</b> <b>interactions.</b> However, we have identified three phenomena that have contributed to neofunctionalization being erroneously identified as {{a significant factor in}} <b>protein</b> <b>interaction</b> network evolution. First, self-interacting proteins are underreported in interaction data due to biological artifacts and design limitations in the two most common high-throughput <b>protein</b> <b>interaction</b> assays. Second, evolutionary inferences have been drawn from paralog analysis without consideration for concurrent and subsequent duplication events. Third, the theoretical model of prodigious neofunctionalization is unable to reproduce empirical network clustering and relies on untenable parameter requirements. In light of these findings, we believe that protei...|$|R
