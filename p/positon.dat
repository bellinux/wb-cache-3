At Corinth, John Griffith {{was promoted to}} Lieutenant Colonel, commanding what was now a battalion-sized 17th Arkansas. Under Lieutenant Colonel Griffith's leadership, the unit performed so well at the Battle of Corinth that General Hebert wrote, in his after-action report: [...] "Under my personal supervision no one faltered, no one hesitated to meet the foe, even in hand-to-hand conflict if required. I must, however, put into the <b>positon</b> sic of brave and true men the small numbers of the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Arkansas Regiments of Infantry, of the Second Brigade, upon whom past circumstances had cast a doubt.

[...] Another account stated: [...] "All the duties in camp, on the march, and in the field the regiment has so promptly performed and are unsurpassed in any service for good breeding, soldierly deportment, description, drill, bravery, and patriotism. The officers are pattern gentlemen, brave soldiers, and noble patriots." [...] Clearly, the 17th Arkansas had left the cloud of Pea Ridge behind them.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we compare}} <b>positon</b> capture and photo-beta {{disintegration}} probabilities in several stellar conditions. We {{show that the}} second process can be neglected {{with regard to the}} first one in strongly endothermic nuclear transitions, whereas photo-beta disintegration can be competitive with <b>positon</b> capture and even can have a greater likelihood than the latter process in weakly endothermic and exothermic transitions. In the range of temperature we consider here (T ≈ 109 °K), it appears that the lifetime ratio τ(ph) τ(ec+) against photo-beta disintegration and <b>positon</b> capture is the smallest for densities in the neighbourhood of 106 g/cm 3. Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that the photo-beta process can {{play a role in the}} synthesis of two "p" elements at least, 62144 Sm and 80196 Hg, for which the ratios τ(ph) τ(ec+) are close to 10 and 20, respectively, in the most favourable stellar conditions. © 1967.

Therefore this exploratory study sought to understand how women approach their career decisions, within the context of their lived realities, by focussing on the research question “what factors or circumstances influence women middle managers career planning and advancement decisions? “. Eight women were interviewed who held middle management <b>positons</b> for at least 5 years. From analysis of the interview text five interconnected themes emerged: Trial and error, Mentorship, Self-confidence, Value alignment and Perceived organisational value. These themes add insight to the existing literature addressing how women approach their careers and lives. Furthermore the findings of this research indicate actions that can be considered by organisations to support the retention and development of women’s career pathway towards senior management.

30|$|Recently, {{generalized}} Wronskian (Casorati) determinant {{solutions are}} constructed for continuous and discrete soliton equations [33 – 39]. Besides soliton solutions, a broader class of solutions such as rational solutions, negatons, <b>positons</b> and complexitons solutions are {{obtained from the}} generalized Wronskian (Casorati) determinant solutions [33 – 38]. In [39], a general Casoratian formulation is presented for the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation from which various examples of Casoratian type solutions are derived. It is interesting for us to construct the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation with self-consistent sources having a generalized Casorati determinant solution via the source generation procedure. This will bring us a broader class of solutions such as negatons, <b>positons,</b> and complexiton type solutions of the two-dimensional Toda lattice equation with self-consistent sources.|$|R

40|$|We give a {{systematic}} classification and a {{detailed discussion of}} the structure, motion and scattering of the recently discovered negaton and <b>positon</b> solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. There are two distinct types of negaton solutions which we label [S n] and [C n], where (n + 1) is {{the order of the}} Wronskian used in the derivation. For negatons, the number of singularities and zeros is finite and they show very interesting time dependence. The general motion is in the positive x direction, except for certain negatons which exhibit one oscillation around the origin. In contrast, there is just one type of <b>positon</b> solution, which we label [˜ Cn]. For positons, one gets a finite number of singularities for n odd, but an infinite number for even values of n. The general motion of positons is in the negative x direction with periodic oscillations. Negatons and positons retain their identities in a scattering process and their phase shifts are discussed. We obtain a simple explanation of all phase shifts by generalizing the notions of “mass ” and “center of mass ” to singular solutions. Finally, it is shown that negaton and <b>positon</b> solutions of the KdV equation can be used to obtain corresponding new solutions of the modified KdV equatio...|$|E
