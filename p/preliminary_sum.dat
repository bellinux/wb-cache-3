His hall was filled with lackeys and footmen, in the most splendid liveries; the interior apartments, with the gentlemen and pages of his household, arrayed as persons of the first quality, and, in that respect, rather exceeding than falling short of the Duke in personal splendour. But his antechamber, in particular, might be compared to a gathering of eagles to the slaughter, were not the simile too dignified to express that vile race, who, by a hundred devices all tending to one common end, live upon the wants of needy greatness, or administer to the pleasures of summer-teeming luxury, or stimulate the wild wishes of lavish and wasteful extravagance, by devising new modes and fresh motives of profusion. There stood the projector, with his mysterious brow, promising unbounded wealth to whomsoever might choose to furnish the small <b>preliminary</b> <b>sum</b> necessary to change egg-shells into the great arcanum. There was Captain Seagull, undertaker for a foreign settlement, with the map under his arm of Indian or American kingdoms, beautiful as the primitive Eden, waiting the bold occupants, for whom a generous patron should equip two brigantines and a fly-boat. Thither came, fast and frequent, the gamesters, in their different forms and calling. This, light, young, gay in appearance, the thoughtless youth of wit and pleasure--the pigeon rather than the rook--but at heart the same sly, shrewd, cold-blooded calculator, as yonder old hard-featured professor of the same science, whose eyes are grown dim with watching of the dice at midnight; and whose fingers are even now assisting his mental computation of chances and of odds. The fine arts, too--I would it were otherwise--have their professors amongst this sordid train. The poor poet, half ashamed, in spite of habit, of the part which {{he is about to}} perform, and abashed by consciousness at once of his base motive and his shabby black coat, lurks in yonder corner for the favourable moment to offer his dedication. Much better attired, the architect presents his splendid vision of front and wings, and designs a palace, the expense of which may transfer his employer to a jail. But uppermost of all, the favourite musician, or singer, who waits on my lord to receive, in solid gold, the value of the dulcet sounds which solaced the banquet of the preceding evening.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{construction}} projects, {{plans and}} cost estimates are usually drawn {{to ensure that}} the work is carried out to the desired quality, within time and budget. The construction industry is inherently uncertain due to nature of the industry itself which often times makes accurate cost of project near impossible thereby given rise to the inclusion of contingencies in order to meet project objectives. Therefore, the study assessed the relationship between contingency sum and client objectives (cost, time and quality) in order to ensure effective project delivery in the renovation of public school facilities in Abuja. This was done through the self-administration of 331 structured questionnaires and historical data from 100 renovated projects between 2001 and 2011. It was discovered that location of the project, the level of dilapidation, type of project, volume of work and duration of the project determine the percentage addition of <b>preliminary</b> <b>sum</b> to the total cost of renovation work. Based on this, actual contingency sum should always be considered bearing in mind these factors in renovated work...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{generalization}} of the classical sum formula of Bruggeman and Kuznetsov to the upper half-space H 3. The derivation of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>sum</b> formula involves computation of the inner product of two specially chosen Poincar´e series in two different ways: the spectral description where the Fourier coefficients CV of cusp forms on H 3 appear and the geometric description where the sums of Kloosterman sums appear. An extension of the classical Lebedev transformation will be the building block for the Poincar´e series used. Our main result, the spectral sum formula, is obtained by extending the class of test functions in its preliminary version using the method of Miatello and Wallach. As an application, we obtain weighted density results concerning the cuspidal automorphic representations in L 2 (SL 2 (O) 2 (C)) with eigenvalue not exceeding X and prescribed spectral parameter pV. A one-sided inversion of the Bessel transformation occurring in the spectral sum formula allows us to prove the sum formula in a reversed form, so called Kloosterman sum formula...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study of the}} CO 2 storage potential of Italian geological reservoirs based on the interpretation of deep well data F. Moia, E. Rondena, G. Locatelli -CESI RICERCA SpA- Milano F. Quattrocchi, M. Buttinelli, B. Cantucci, M. Procesi (*) – INGV Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma 1, (*) now PhD Roma tre University Abstract Several technological options have been proposed to stabilize and reduce the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) among which, the most promising for Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEFFPP European Platform), are the CCS technologies (Carbon Capture and Storage). The remedy proposed for large stationary CO 2 sources as thermoelectric power plants is to separate the flue gas capturing CO 2 and to store it into deep subsurface geological formations (more than 800 meters of depth). In order to support the identification of potential CO 2 storage reservoirs in Italy, a detailed reworking of available geological, geophysical, geochemical and seismological data is under development by our partnership, {{in the framework of}} the project “Identification of Italian CO 2 geological storage sites”. This research started from the study of the 7575 wells drilled on Italian territory during the last 50 years for gas/oil and geothermal exploration. Among the data-set as a whole, a selection of 1688 wells deeper than 800 m was accomplished. Only 1290 of these wells have a public-available stratigraphy and fit with the basic prerequisites for further deepening of their CO 2 reservoir potential, mostly as saline aquifers. The wells data have been extracted and organized into a geological data base, that contains information about the nature and the thickness of geological formations, the presence of fresh, saline or brackish water, brine, gas and oil, the underground temperature, the seismic velocity and electric resistance of geological materials from different logs, the permeability, porosity and geochemical characteristics. The most important parameter to be considered to classify the selected wells into different “caprock quality” classes, is the caprock thickness and lithology (alias permeability), covering the saline aquifer/s. To quantify the quality of the caprock of a single well, we clustered 5 different classes of “Impervious Factor Reliability” (Fbp= Fattore Bontà Pozzo, in italian), function of the estimated permeability. A second variable has been assigned to each well named “Aquifers Availability”, sub-divided in 5 “trapping factor reliability” as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>sum</b> of all the parameters considered...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{burdensome}} legacies of the Soviet era is widespread environmental pollution. The worst offender in this regard was the Soviet army. Across military installations covering more than 800 km² of Estonian territory, the army dumped {{hundreds of thousands of}} tons of jet fuel into the ground, improperly disposed of toxic chemicals, and discarded outdated explosives and weapons in coastal and inland waters. In the 1990s, during the army's withdrawal from Estonia, extensive damage was done to discarded buildings and equipment. In October 1993, the Estonian Ministry of Environment issued a <b>preliminary</b> report <b>summing</b> up part of the degradation it had surveyed thus far. The report described the worst damage as having been done to Estonia's topsoil and underground water supply by the systematic dumping of jet fuel at six Soviet army air bases. At the air base near Tapa, site of the worst damage, officials estimated that six square kilometers of land were covered by a layer of fuel; 11 square kilometers of underground water were said to be contaminated. The water in the surrounding area was undrinkable, and was sometimes set fire by locals to provide heat during the winter. With Danish help, Estonian crews began cleaning up the site, although they estimated the likely cost to be as much as 4 million EEK. The Ministry of Environment assigned a monetary cost of more than 10 billion EEK [...] to the damage to the country's topsoil and water supply. However, the ministry was able to allocate only 5 million EEK in 1993 for cleanup operations.|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} UHE neutrinos {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} fields in astroparticle physics. The experimental techniques proposed to identify cosmic neutrino signatures are mainly three: the detection of Cherenkov blue light originated by charged leptons (electrons, positrons, muons and tauons) from neutrino interaction in water or ice; the detection of acoustic waves produced by neutrino energy deposition in water, ice or salt; the detection of radio pulses following neutrino interaction in ice or salt. Due to the expected neutrino fluxes (approximate to 10 (- 8) E(2) Gev/cm(2) s sr) and due to their extremely low interaction cross-section (approximate to 10 (- 32) cm(2) at 10 (20) eV). huge target volumes (approximate to km(3)) are required to detect them. Acoustic detection of neutrino is a very suitable technique since the sound attenuation length, at the frequency of interest, is of the order of km. Due to the small amplitude of the expected neutrino bipolar signal (approximate to 10 mPa), it is mandatory to develop an effective algorithm that increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In the present work a combination of matched filter, applied to each single hydrophone, and a beam-forming technique applied to a small array of hydrophones is proposed. The matched filter is a well-known technique of signal processing that maximizes the SNR in the presence of white noise. Beam forming is a signal-processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional analysis; the signals from different sensors are combined in such a way that pressure waves arriving from a specific direction are coherently <b>summed.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> results on simulated data will be shown.

40|$|Abstrakt 023 This {{observational}} {{study sought to}} improve our understanding of {{factors that contribute to}} risky sexual behavior among women seeking treatment for alcohol and other substance use disorders. Women were recruited at the start of outpatient (n= 236) or inpatient (n= 166) treatment. At intake, a Timeline Follow-back interview was used to obtain retrospective reports of daily drinking, drug use, and sexual behavior for a 90 -day pre-treatment baseline period. Additional interview and questionnaire measures also were obtained. Measures were re- administered at four 90 -day follow-up interviews. Among women who reported sex with a primary partner during baseline (n= 261), 15 % reported consistent condom use for all events with this partner, whereas 80 % reported no condom use with this partner. Among women who reported sex with a non-primary partner (n= 159; doesn’t include commercial sex trading), 26 % reported consistent condom use and 45 % reported no condom use with such partners. Significant correlates of non-use of condoms included negative beliefs and attitudes and low self-efficacy regarding condom use and AIDS prevention, as well as psychological distress, sexual impulsiveness and sensation seeking, history of severe assault by a male partner, and (with primary partners) negative partner attitudes toward condom use. Some of these correlates also predicted unprotected sex with a primary partner during the first 90 days after treatment entry, after controlling for baseline. However, unsafe sex with a non-primary partner during follow-up was most notably associated with follow-up levels of substance use, i. e., more drinks per drinking day and greater frequency of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use. In <b>sum,</b> <b>preliminary</b> analyses of baseline and follow-up data indicate a high prevalence of unprotected sex in this population. Identification of factors related to baseline and follow-up levels of risky behavior may suggest targets for future intervention development...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} design {{does not seem}} to shift from the {{paradigm}} that design process is a complex and seems similar to the nature of a black box system. It is a process which can be viewed solely in terms of its input and output, without a detail prescription of the process to produce that output. The complex nature of design process, and architecture design in particular have been explained by experts (Alexander 1964, Anderson 1966 to name a few), but this thesis underlines the work around of the rigid clear box system of computing to get a reliably working non-wired-in process to support the notion of architecture design as a complex system. The clear box nature of computing process is a fundamental characteristic of computing, so the process to be proposed has to work within this framework. The process would have to be prescribed or otherwise it cannot be executed. Many machines which given the same input and the same process, will all result in the same output. A single machine which given the same input and the same process to execute for many times will all result in the same output each time. However, the development of computing has enabled the processing of multiple inputs. The significant of parallel computing is that it seems to provide a window of epistemic autonomy within a process. There is a large philosophical and theoretical discussion behind the notion of epistemic autonomy which this thesis tried to introduce a <b>preliminary</b> summary, and <b>sums</b> it into the following description. A system consists of one single bird and a process of how to fly may result in a bird flying. Given many birds and implementing flying process synchronously to all the birds could result in a swarm of birds. There is not much different to see one bird or many birds flying in the sky, except that in many birds that each are using the same flying process would result in an underlying flying configurations. The underlying flying configuration {{is not part of the}} system; it is an emergence of the system. So the emergence structure of flying bird was enabled by a window of epistemic autonomy which comes from the use of many flying birds as opposed to a single flying bird. A window of epistemic autonomy seems to have been created in the programming experiments with the implementation of a basic Agent-Based Model (ABM) as ABM is inherently an autonomous non-wired in process (Cilliers, 1993). The coding is based on a system introduce by Reynolds (1987) which a program was already built and modified many times in projects within CECA – UEL. To put simply, the inputs are multiple copies of one type of entity placed in using randomizing code, and the process synchronously applied to all these copies are to move towards the closest out of other three neighboring entities. The utilization of ABM into the programming experiment seems parallel with the findings in the literature review where it proposes a summary of a production of space by way of using a binary approach known to be brought up by Lefebvre (1974). Lefebvre seems to suggest that the very basis of spatial production is that space consists of either a moving or a non-moving social entity. Thus the criteria above since then been adapted to accommodate a simple social relations and this is called Social Preference Matrix (SPM). SPM is an original contribution in the form of coding that comes out of this thesis’s programming experiment. To put simply, SPM enables the identification of heading towards the nearest out of three neighboring entities only when it is the specific entity it relates to in the SPM. When this is triggered, both entities i. e. the one moving towards to and the designated entity both will eventually within a specific constant distance with each other, and these will stay in a loop of attract and repel, which is perceived as simulation of these being stop moving. The development of the programming experiment have found that when all entities are identified as occupying entities, eventually all entities will loop in attract and repel, i. e. all eventually will be non-moving. When introduce with non-occupying entities, i. e. those not identified and included in the SPM, then the possibility to have similar characteristic to what is known in the Configurational Theory as the movement space appears. The specific of architectural production may be seen as an opposite of the dynamics seen in an underlying configuration of bird swarm. Architectural subjects particularly regarding spatial configurations seems to be required to be static; there is not known liquid or ever-changing spatial configurations. Thus instead merely producing a system of moving around entities in space, this then had to be translated into some static versions of events. In this programming experiment, these were built on the basis of notations provided by the Configurational Theory (Hillier, 1996). Interestingly, he also stated in his previous work (Hillier, 1978) that there is a production of space where a larger space is being divided into smaller space. There is a body of research into programming headed by Mitchell, et. al (1976), which stretches for about three decades afterwards. However as far as the literature investigation went, none has seemed to explore the notion of epistemic autonomy in the production of spatial configurations. Following this finding, the programming experiment then added in a program called Voronoi Diagram (version coded in the programming experiment is as prescribed by Akl and Lyons, 1993) which enables several significant developments in producing spatial configurations by way of dividing space. Firstly, the production of space by way of dividing space is based on an emergence of underlying configuration out of possible social relations between entities occupying the space. Secondly, the division is based on maximum arrangement of occupiable space between all occupying and non occupying entities, because Voronoi Diagram divided space equally in between all of the identified entities. Thirdly; a part from an emergence spatial relations by way of utilization of SPM within the ABM, the employment of Voronoi Diagram also enables the emergence of shapes and dimensions out of the divided space. At the end of this study, the programming experiment has resulted in a programming framework named Spatial Languaging. A part from that there seems to be a promising field of research into programming under the notion of epistemic autonomy specifically develops for architectural systems, because there are numerous methods of parallel processing and many different media of implementing ABM. More importantly, the notion of structural emergence seems applicable to many aspects of architecture and all worth exploring...|$|R
