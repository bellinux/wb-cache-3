40|$|M. Phil. (Industrial Psychology) <b>Psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> in South Africa faces many {{challenges}} at present. Among these challenges {{is the fact}} that many individuals utilising <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> are not professionally registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa. The key objective of this qualitative study was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the contemporary ethical challenges in <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> in South Africa. A total of ten industrial psychologists participated in the study, and content analysis was used to interpret the data. Findings indicated that ethical conduct based on specific ethical values and principles are expected of the testing practitioner within the testing process. An exploratory conceptual framework was produced, which outlines the possible ethical challenges inherent in <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing.</b> The conceptual framework may be applied by industrial psychologists, regulatory bodies, and test-takers during testing engagements. Awareness and understanding of the ethical challenges could inform and promote ethical behaviour in testing practices, as well as encourage testing practitioners to strive for the highest standards of professionalism and ethical excellence. The present project thus aimed to contribute to the continued development of the field of <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> in South Africa. It was envisaged that the information gathered in the process would not only document the most prominent ethical challenges in testing practices, but also form the basis for generating suggestions regarding the agenda that needs to be established to guide and enhance testing practices in South Africa.

It may seriously impair the patient&#x 2032;s daily functioning and quality of life. Prevalence of abnormal <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> after the clinical recovery of overt encephalopathy has not been studied. Materials and Methods: Consecutive 80 patients (age, 44. 5 &# 177; 9. 8 yr; M: F 66 : 14) with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) who recovered and met inclusion criteria were evaluated for abnormal <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> (> 2 SD) and critical flicker frequency (CFF 2 SD) was seen in 58 (72. 5 &#x 0025;) patients.

40|$|Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} as a {{cause of}} hepatic encephalopathy is still debated. This study focused on the relationship between H. pylori, plasma ammonia levels, and intellectual function in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: Forty-seven cirrhotics with latent or mild hepatic encephalopathy were enrolled in the study, upon H. pylori assessment at endoscopy. Plasma ammonia level determinations and <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> were performed at entry in all patients. Patients with H. pylori infection received a 2 -wk standard dual therapy and bacterial eradication was assessed at endoscopy 6 - 8 wk later. On this occasion, plasma ammonia levels and psychometric assessments were repeated. Patients without H. pylori infection at entry were also studied after 6 - 8 wk for ammonia level assessment and <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing,</b> as a control group. Patients receiving lactulose therapy and those without therapy were grouped separately for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among 21 patients without lactulose therapy (group A), basal plasma ammonia levels and <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> scores did not significantly differ between 13 infected and eight uninfected patients. Similarly, among 26 patients undergoing lactulose therapy (group B), basal plasma ammonia concentration and <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> scores did not significantly differ between 13 infected and 13 uninfected patients. Moreover, in group B, both the prevalence of previous overt hepatic encephalopathy episodes and the mean daily dose of lactulose therapy were similar between infected and uninfected patients. In addition, no significant reduction in the plasma ammonia concentrations and in <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> scores emerged in both groups A and B after bacterial eradication. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to find a relationship between H. pylori, plasma ammonia levels, and <b>psychometric</b> <b>testing</b> scores in cirrhotic patients with latent or mild hepatic encephalopathy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe linear {{mixed model}} (LMM), which is {{routinely}} {{used to describe}} change in outcomes over time and its association with risk factors, assumes that a unit change in any predictor {{is associated with a}} constant change in the outcome. When it is used on <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests,</b> this assumption may not hold. Indeed, <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> usually suffer from ceiling and/or floor effects and curvilinearity (i. e., varying sensitivity to change). The authors aimed to determine the consequences of such misspecification when evaluating predictors of cognitive decline. As an alternative to the LMM, they considered 2 mixed models based on latent processes that handle discrete and bounded outcomes. Model differences are illustrated here using data on 4 <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> from the Personnes Agées QUID (PAQUID) Study (1989 - 2004). The type I error of the Wald test for risk-factor regression parameters was formally assessed in a simulation study. It demonstrated that type I errors in the LMM could be dramatically inflated for some tests, such that spurious associations with risk factors were found. In particular, confusion between effects on mean level and effects on change over time was highlighted. The authors recommend use of the alternative mixed models when studying <b>psychometric</b> <b>tests</b> and more generally quantitative scales (quality of life, activities of daily living) ...|$|R
