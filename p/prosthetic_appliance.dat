The character is a cancer sufferer who is incarcerated in Litchfield federal prison because she committed armed bank robberies. Rosenblat {{did not want to}} shave her head for the role and a make-up artist was hired to fit a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance</b> to her head creating the character's baldness. The application process took three hours, meaning that the actress had to arrive on set earlier than other cast members. Initially there was no character biography created for Miss Rosa and it was Rosenblat who implemented a Hispanic background and accent.

The character is described as having superhuman strength and durability. The molybdenum steel sound generator {{that serves as a}} <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance</b> on Klaw's right wrist is able to transform ambient sound to perform a series of functions, including the projection of intense high-volume sonic waves and blasts of concussive force and the creation of mobile sound/mass constructs. The sound converter was invented by Klaw and later improved by AIM scientists and technicians. Klaw can also sense his surroundings using sonar. When he fought Volcana while trying to abduct Molecule Man he demonstrated the ability to create [...] "cohesive sound". This was essentially an entangling/crushing construct that absorbed ambient noise to increase its size and strength. The noise from the target's struggles to remove the construct would make it larger and stronger. Volcana was only able to escape it by changing into her ash form.|$|E

40|$|Premature loss {{of teeth}} in {{children}} {{may lead to}} both functional and esthetic problems. Missing teeth in both anterior and posterior regions may cause malfunctions in mastication and proper pronunciation. If the missing teeth are not replaced, further complications may occur, including adjacent tooth migration, loss of alveolar bone, and irregular occlusion. Considering the sensitive nature of children, loss of teeth may cause the development of insecurities and low self esteem problems. Due to dynamic nature of growth in children and adolescents, <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliances</b> must not hinder development of orofacial system, and must meet adequate esthetic and functional standards.

30|$|In addition, it also {{remains to}} be {{demonstrated}} how a potential compensatory mechanism might work, {{with one of the}} options being osseoperception [2, 18 – 23]. In this context, {{it is also important to}} consider the adaptation time needed after oral rehabilitation. Some studies have performed longitudinal evaluations of masticatory function for more than 3  years [24, 25]. However, there are limited data available on short-term adaptation to mastication, especially in the first months after being fitted with a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance.</b> Although approximately 2  months are generally required for adaptation to a new removable denture, the time needed to adapt to a new implant-supported prosthesis has not been established [26]. Furthermore, adaptation is likely to be more difficult with full fixed implant prostheses [27].|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study the peculiarities of the combination of zirconia and ceramic occlusal surfaces when constructing aesthetic fixed prosthetic appliances. Materials and methods. The study included 70 patients with zirconia and ceramic occlusal surfaces of aesthetic fixed dental prostheses. Group I included 24 patients {{with a combination of}} zirconia and ceramic occlusal surfaces. Group II included 30 patients with a combination of ceramic occlusal surfaces. Group III included 16 patients with a combination of zirconia occlusal surfaces. All the patients were observed 12 and 24 months after prosthetic repair. Results. 12 and 24 months after prosthetic repair, the occlusal contact surface area was the largest in Group II (8. 18 ± 0. 16 mm 2 and 9. 17 ± 0. 1 mm 2, respectively). In Group I, where only one occlusive surface was made of zirconium dioxide, significantly reduced levels of abrasion were observed as compared to Group II – 8. 07 ± 0. 21 mm 2 and 8. 65 ± 0. 23 mm 2, respectively. 36 months after denture wearing, in Group III, the smallest contact surface area – 7. 84 ± 0. 15 mm 2 as well as the lowest growth of the surface area was observed – 8. 07 ± 0. 13 mm 2. Conclusions. Dental prostheses with at least one ceramic occlusal surface exhibit a strong tendency to abrasion and, consequently, to an increase in the occlusal surface area resulting in an excessive load on <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance.</b> Moreover, functional and aesthetic values of prosthetic prosthesis sharply decrease. Therefore, we recommend to produce zirconia occlusal surface or at least to combine the same materials, as it will increase the longevity of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance...</b>|$|E

40|$|As aging on a {{demography}} continues even today, geriatric dentistry {{responsive to}} the times is demanded. The greatest concern of elderly individuals is health, and eating {{is very important in}} order to maintain and promote quality of life in the elderly. Prosthetics in the future should not end with the treatment of tooth loss and defect of oral tissue; rather, it must pursue a shift to prevention of age-attendant decline in feeding function, which consists of masticatory function and swallowing function. Aging is not a factor that directly influences mastication performance, whereas masticatory performance is greatly influenced by tooth loss, and associated with occlusal force, hyposalivation and oral stereognostic ability. For swallowing function, it is suggested that denture wearing and occlusal support bring about a good deglutition, but the relation between swallowing function, ageing and prosthetic appliances is not clear enough. In order that a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance</b> may improve feeding function, our eyes should be turned to decline of muscle strength, salivary flow and stereognostic ability. In elderly people, although the relation between aging and mulnutrition has been a problem, in order to improve malnutrition, it seems that it is required to prevent the tooth loss and muscular malfaunction and to the evaluate sensation susceptibility and the relation of nutrition status and prosthetic appliances. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Considering an {{increase}} in elderly population in recent years, it has become necessary {{to pay attention to}} this group so that they can have a higher quality of life (QoL). Oral health is one of the factors affecting the QoL of the elderly. Aims: The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of oral health on the QoL of the elderly population in Babol, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used the multi-stage cluster sampling technique to select 300 elderly subjects, over 65 years of age, living in Babol. Oral health-related QoL was evaluated by the Persian version of oral health impact profile (OHIP- 14) questionnaire. Data were collected on gender, age, occupation, education, the date of the last dental visit, use of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliances,</b> and dental treatment needs, including the periodontal, prosthetic, and surgical needs, by interview and examination. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed with SPSS software program using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 71. 4 ± 5. 6 years, with 183 males (61 %) and 117 females (39 %). The mean score of OHIP- 14 questionnaire was 22. 4 ± 8. 2, with a range of 5 ‒ 50. The highest score was achieved on the psychological discomfort domain. There was no significant difference in OHIP- 14 scores according to gender, with significantly lower scores in subjects with academic education. The subjects wearing <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliances</b> had lower OHIP- 14 scores compared to those who did not wear <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliances.</b> OHIP- 14 scores were lower in the dentate individuals compared to the edentulous individuals.

The main goal {{of this type of}} activity is to improve the dental health by preventing dental diseases. It includes the treatment and rehabilitation using various ways of replacement of the lost integrity of the dentition and restoration of the teeth using a prosthetic. In order to do this, it is necessary to prepare the teeth and the pulp of the oral cavity for prosthetics. The sequence of preparatory activities includes a series of steps carried out in sequence: preventive, hygienic, therapeutic (including periodontal), surgical and orthopedic (including orthodontics). Each of these stages includes a series of manipulations, the sequence and number of which is determined by the individual dental status of each patient. The inspection and preparation of a comprehensive plan for the treatment involves a sequence of all these actions carried out by a team of experts in agreement with the patient, evidenced by the «informed consent» subscription. After the preparatory activities, it is possible to go to the final stage, that is to make a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance</b> to the patient. The total duration of all phases of preparatory activities preceding the prosthetics depends on the complexity of the steps themselves, and is determined by the severity of the related dental diseases.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of inadequately supported occlusion on the incidence of TMJ osteoarthritis and to investigate the reversibility of the cardinal features of the disease after restoring the occlusion by construction of the appropriate <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance.</b> Two groups of male patients were selected in this study being already affected by TMJ osteoarthritis. The patients of the first group (20 patients) had an inadequately supported occlusion i. e. three or more functional molars were missing, improperly restored or badly decayed. The patients in the second group (20 patients) had an adequately supported occlusion, clinical and radiographic surveys were carried out. It {{was found that the}} incidence of both the clinical and radiographic findings of TMJ osteoarthritis were higher in the first group, for whom the occlusion has then been restored by properly constructed removable prosthetic appliances. One year after restoration of occlusal support the patients were reexamined. Most of the clinical findings improved especially crepitation, muscle tenderness and pain. The radiographic findings did not show significant improvement except for restoration of the joint space. It was concluded that the inadequately supported occlusion is associated with TMJ osteoarthritis and that restoring the relation and function of the TMJ avoid the excessive load that may result in its degeneration. Conservative treatments such as counseling, behavioral modification, physical therapy and pharmacotherapy should be applied in association with the treatments which lead to correction of occlusion.

Since {{the introduction of}} the disposable gnathometer (Procter & Gamble), facilitating simple measurement of bite-force at dislodgement of the denture, it seems relatively easy to measure the maximum bite-force of maxillary dentures. The gnathometer has a scale ranking from 1 to 10. It measures the pressure which a patient can apply to the front teeth until dorsally dislodgement of the maxillary denture. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the intra-examiner reliability of gnathometers. In each of 5 university dental clinics (Rotterdam, Groningen, Athens, Gent, and Istanbul) 5 patients who had received a new conventional complete maxillary denture less than one month previously, were selected. These patients had a stable natural dentition or <b>prosthetic</b> <b>appliance</b> in the mandible, e. g. an overdenture attached on natural or implant abutments, a partial natural dentition with a stable partial chromcobalt denture, etc. In the first session the maximum bite-force was measured by one experienced prosthodontist for each patient using three different gnathometers, successively three times with each gnathometer. If the result was between 2 ranking points, the lowest was registered. The 9 measurements were conducted with three-minute breaks in order to enable the patient to reposition the dentures comfortably and habitually. One week later at the same time of the day, these measurements were repeated with the same three gnathometers, respectively for each patient, as used in the first session. Intra-examiner reliability was very good. Paired sample correlations were 0. 91, with overall measurement error of 0. 7 on the ranking scale...|$|E
