5|$|The Black Hawk War {{gave the}} young captain Abraham Lincoln his brief {{military}} service, although he never {{participated in a}} battle. Other <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> later became famous included Winfield Scott, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson Davis. The war gave impetus to the U.S. policy of Indian removal, in which Native American tribes were pressured to sell their lands and move west of the Mississippi River and stay there.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese {{units that}} participated in the battle took heavy losses in their failed attempt to destroy the Viet Cong forces. South Vietnamese {{casualties}} included 83 killed in action and at least 100 wounded. The American <b>participants,</b> <b>who</b> included advisors and aircrews, counted three dead and eight wounded. Of the 15 American helicopters sent to support the operation, only one escaped undamaged, and five were downed or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{internship}} {{program is}} designed to prepare its <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> generally would be students near the end of their studies, for a graduate position at UBS. In addition, UBS also offers around the world opportunities for students to get to know UBS early in their academic career. At the same time, these programs may often lead the potential candidates to participation in the summer internship program and the Graduate Talent Programs.|$|E

5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male <b>participants,</b> <b>who</b> wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different <b>participants,</b> <b>who</b> as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E

Main sponsor VAKKO supported the festival while other partners included Pegasus Airlines, EDITION Hotel and the Turkish Ministry of Tourism and Culture.|$|E
5|$|NVC {{has also}} been {{reported}} as effective in reducing domestic violence. Male <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent recidivism within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years {{as reported by the}} Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the Duluth Model, said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence recidivism rate.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{units were}} to be capped in number and {{were to be}} {{allocated}} to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> could pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as exporters with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E

Only ONE answer per participant per question is allowed and he/she must provide the answer in an acceptable format (i.e. simplified to lowest terms) and within 3 seconds after being called upon. The opponent may continue working while an answer is provided and if the answer of the first <b>participant</b> <b>who</b> buzzes is incorrect the opponent may use the remainder of the 45 seconds to buzz and be called to provide an answer.

5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) have {{hundreds}} or thousands of <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> are usually split into competing character factions camped separately around a large venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means that they have a significant influence on local LARP culture and design. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often more tightly planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were {{motivated}} by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} are ranked {{based on their}} individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly {{fewer than half of}} them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. <b>Participants</b> <b>who</b> do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} studies specifically use expertise as {{the method}} of grouping students. In contrast to the studies above, where participants were all from the same course or year level at the university, participants were recruited for these studies from known expert and novice groups.

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> did not have that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Nashville sit-in campaign, sit-ins were staged at {{numerous}} stores in the central business district. Sit-in <b>participants,</b> <b>who</b> consisted mainly of black college students, were often verbally or physically attacked by white onlookers. Despite their refusal to retaliate, over 150 students were eventually arrested for refusing to vacate store lunch counters when ordered to do so by police. At trial, the students were represented by a group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby. On April 19, Looby's home was bombed, although he escaped uninjured. Later that day, nearly 4000 people marched to City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West about the escalating violence. When asked if he believed the lunch counters in Nashville should be desegregated, West agreed that they should. After subsequent negotiations between the store owners and protest leaders, an agreement was reached {{during the first week of}} May. On May 10, six downtown stores began serving black customers at their lunch counters for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{atomic bombs}} were {{developed}} by the wartime Manhattan Project. This {{was carried out in}} secret, lest its discovery induce the Axis powers, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects, or undertake covert operations against the project. The military and scientific leaders of the Manhattan Project anticipated a need to release details of their wartime accomplishments, principally as a form of recognition for the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> had labored in secrecy. Press releases were prepared in advance of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and an official account, known as the Smyth Report after its author, the physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth, was commissioned in April 1944 to provide a history of the project for public release. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie Groves, his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman, and Smyth agreed that information could be publicly released if it was essential for an understanding of the project, or was already generally known or deducible, or had no significance to the production of atomic bombs. The first copies went on sale on August 12, 1945.|$|E

The country's male Olympic football team failed to qualify after being defeated by New Zealand 10-0 in their last group stage match in the OFC Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Along with the three athletes, the country's delegation was led by its chef de mission Ahongalu Fusimalohi. Fonwa {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Lui held it at the closing ceremony. Fusimalochi said in June 2012 that the team hoped ten athletes would be qualified, but after that did not occur, he expected that the competitor's performance in London will inspire <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> wanted to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
