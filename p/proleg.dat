50|$|The abdomen of the {{caterpillar}} {{has four}} pairs of <b>prolegs,</b> normally {{located on the}} third to sixth segments of the abdomen, and a separate pair of <b>prolegs</b> by the anus, which have a pair of tiny hooks called crotchets. These aid in gripping and walking, especially in species that lack many <b>prolegs</b> (e. g. larvae of Geometridae). In some basal moths, these <b>prolegs</b> may be on every segment of the body, while <b>prolegs</b> may be completely absent in other groups, which are more adapted to boring and living in sand (e. g., Prodoxidae and Nepticulidae, respectively).|$|R
5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called <b>prolegs.</b> The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The <b>prolegs</b> contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their <b>prolegs.</b> Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of <b>prolegs</b> or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack <b>prolegs</b> altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced <b>prolegs,</b> while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prolegs</b> of {{lepidopteran}} larvae have a {{small circle}} of gripping hooks, called [...] "crochets". The arrangement of the crochets {{can be helpful in}} identification to family level. Although the point has been debated, <b>prolegs</b> are not widely regarded as true legs, derived from the primitive uniramous limbs. Certainly in their morphology they are not jointed, and so lack the five segments (coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus) of thoracic insect legs. <b>Prolegs</b> do have limited musculature, but much of their movement is hydraulically powered.|$|R
25|$|The larvae are {{typically}} very flattened, {{and instead of}} <b>prolegs,</b> they have suckers. The thoracic legs are reduced, but always present, and they move by rolling waves rather than walking with individual <b>prolegs.</b> They even use a lubricant, a kind of liquefied silk, to move.|$|R

50|$|Larvae are slender, elongate, {{cylindrical}} or somewhat flattened, {{with relatively}} hard bodies, somewhat resembling mealworms. The {{three pairs of}} legs on the thoracic segments are short and the last abdominal segment is, as is frequently the case in beetle larvae, directed downwards and {{may serve as a}} terminal <b>proleg</b> in some species. The ninth segment, the rearmost, is pointed in larvae of Agriotes, Dalopius and Melanotus, but is bifid due to a so-called caudal notch in Selatosomus (formerly Ctenicera), Limonius, Hypnoides and Athous species. The dorsum of the ninth abdominal segment may also have sharp processes, such as in the Oestodini, including the genera Drapetes and Oestodes. Although some species complete their development in one year (e.g. Conoderus), wireworms usually spend three or four years in the soil, feeding on decaying vegetation and the roots of plants, and often causing damage to agricultural crops such as potato, strawberry, corn, and wheat. The subterranean habits of wireworms, their ability to quickly locate food by following carbon dioxide gradients produced by plant material in the soil, and their remarkable ability to recover from illness induced by insecticide exposure (sometimes after many months), make it hard to exterminate them once they have begun to attack a crop. Wireworms can pass easily through the soil on account of their shape and their propensity for following pre-existing burrows, and can travel from plant to plant, thus injuring the roots of multiple plants within a short time. Methods for pest control include crop rotation and clearing the land of insects before sowing.|$|E
