Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights.

40|$|Mice were immunized subcutaneously {{with either}} killed cells or a ribosome-containing {{fraction}} (RF) obtained from Vibrio cholerae Ogawa 41. At appropriate time intervals, these mice or their progeny were challenged with uniformly lethal doses of Ogawa or Inaba serotype. Half of the offspring born to mice immunized with 20 μg of RF were protected against homologous challenge at 7. 5 weeks of age, and significant <b>protection</b> <b>was</b> observed up to 15 weeks of age.

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E

50|$|The first {{application}} of cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>was</b> to HMS Samarang in 1824. Sacrificial anodes made from iron {{attached to the}} copper sheath of the hull below the waterline dramatically reduced the corrosion rate of the copper. However, {{a side effect of}} the cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>was</b> to increase marine growth. Copper, when corroding, releases copper ions which have an anti-fouling effect. Since excess marine growth affected the performance of the ship, the Royal Navy decided that it was better to allow the copper to corrode and have the benefit of reduced marine growth, so cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>was</b> not used further.|$|R
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> typical of Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, {{as well as}} financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E

30|$|Localization of <b>protections</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related}} to whether primary {{equipment}} is held indoors. For indoor GIS station and substations with some primary indoor equipment, the localized installation of <b>protections</b> <b>is</b> not so difficult, and <b>protection</b> devices may <b>be</b> installed locally in the collective control cabinet or independent control cabinet near indoor GIS equipment. For 10 – 35 kV equipment bays of switch cabinet type, <b>protection</b> devices shall <b>be</b> installed in the switch cabinet. For unattended outdoor open AIS or outdoor GIS substations, <b>protections</b> may <b>be</b> installed in secondary equipment integration module (a special container) or control cabinet with temperature and humidity adjustment functions (called intelligent control cabinet).|$|R
5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the national park and the <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> based on the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which takes its mandate from the requirements in the Svalbard Treaty {{to protect the environment}} of the archipelago. The overall responsibility for protection lies with the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated management to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of Svalbard. The latter performs all day-to-day practical management, including registration and inspection. In aspects related to cultural heritage, the Governor reports to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and in issues relating to pollution, to the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. While it has no authority, the Norwegian Polar Institute performs monitoring, mapping and research.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> upheld by {{guarding}} against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August 2008, Rockstar {{announced}} that a Microsoft Windows version of Grand Theft Auto IV was in development by Rockstar North and Rockstar Toronto.

It contains expanded features, including traffic density control, draw distance configurations and a replay editor.

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species <b>protection</b> <b>is</b> the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
