40|$|GOALS:: The {{goals of}} this study were to {{investigate}} the role of a new probiotic preparation (Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475) in Helicobacter pylori infection. BACKGROUND:: Specific probiotic strains play a role in H. pylori infection for their ability to decrease bacterial load and gastritis, prevent antibiotic-associated side effects, and increase the eradication rate. STUDY:: This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in a tertiary care setting. A total of 100 H. pylori-positive naive patients received either L. reuteri combination (2 × 10 Colony Forming Units) or placebo during a 3 -phase study (<b>pre-eradication,</b> eradication, and follow-up). All underwent C urea breath test (C-UBT), blood assessments of gastrin- 17 (G 17), endoscopy, and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale.

40|$|SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa {{infection}} {{is associated with}} poorer outcomes in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. It is unknown whether early eradication improves outcomes. This retrospective study assessed clinical and microbiological outcomes of eradication therapy following initial Pseudomonas infection. All patients undergoing Pseudomonas eradication therapy from 2004 to 2010 were identified retrospectively and assessed for microbiological eradication, exacerbation frequency, hospital admissions, clinical symptoms and lung function. 30 patients were identified with median follow-up time 26. 4 months. Eradication therapy involved intravenous antibiotics (n =  12), intravenous antibiotics followed by oral ciprofloxacin (n =  13) or ciprofloxacin alone (n =  5), combined with 3 months of nebulised colistin. Pseudomonas was initially eradicated from sputum in 24 patients (80. 0 %). 13 / 24 patients remained Pseudomonas-free and 11 / 24 were subsequently reinfected (median time 6. 2 months). Exacerbation frequency was significantly reduced from 3. 93 per year <b>pre-eradication</b> and 2. 09 post-eradication (p =  0. 002). Admission rates were similar, at 0. 39 per year <b>pre-eradication</b> and 0. 29 post-eradication (p = NS). 20 / 30 patients reported initial clinical improvement, whilst at one-year follow up, 19 / 21 had further improved or remained stable. Lung function was unchanged. This study demonstrates that Pseudomonas can be eradicated from {{a high proportion of}} patients, which may lead to prolonged clearance and reduced exacerbation rates.

We do not observe improvements in income for women, suggesting that observed effects are likely driven by increased labor market productivity.

40|$|Congo Cay, U. S. Virgin Islands, {{has high}} value for {{breeding}} seabirds {{and is a}} potential reintroduction site for the endangered Virgin Islands tree boa (Epicrates monensis granti). However, introduced ship rats (Rattus rattus) undermine its conservation value. Three unsuccessful eradication attempts have been conducted since 1990, with the latest in 2006; rats were trapped 1. 5 years later. We examined microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA sequences of ship rats from Congo Cay and three other nearby cays to determine if rats found after the most recent eradication effort were surviving individuals or reinvaders from neighboring cays; we had no <b>pre-eradication</b> samples. Only one mitochondrial haplotype was present, implying that historically there was a single invasion or if multiple invasions, rats came from a single source with limited haplotype diversity. Low genetic variation on Congo Cay suggested either a population bottleneck resulting from survivors or a founder event resulting from invaders. FST estimates, cluster distances, migrant detections, and factorial correspondence analysis indicated low but meaningful levels of gene flow between Congo and Lovango Cays and between Mingo and Grass Cays. Except for two alleles, all other alleles found on Congo were also present on Lovango. Without <b>pre-eradication</b> samples we could not eliminate the possibility of survivors from a failed eradication. However, our data suggest reinvasion from Lovango Cay was likely and that future eradication efforts should consider both pairs of cays as eradication units. Cay juxtaposition and orientation along with ocean currents may explain rat movement, or lack thereof, among these cays...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} entomological and {{epidemiological criteria}} for establishing {{the absence of}} tsetse and trypanosomosis associated with tsetse eradication programmes. The sampling goal is simple - to maximize the probability of detecting tsetse flies in the field or trypanosomes in hosts, if they exist. Sampling strategies cannot guarantee the absence of tsetse and trypanosomes {{but they can be}} used to estimate the probability of their eradication. Because tsetse eradication programmes are targeted at defined areas, geographical information system (GIS) tools are very useful in guiding spatial sampling strategies. Two approaches to assess tsetse used. The second combines information on <b>pre-eradication</b> tsetse trapping and the proportion of time during which no tsetse have been trapped, assuming either a stable or declining (preferred) <b>pre-eradication</b> tsetse population. For establishing the absence of trypanosomosis in host populations, there are standard sampling techniques that can be adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the trypanosome detection methods used. Required sample sizes can be calculated for both direct trypanosome detection methods of 100 percent specificity or indirect tests with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. For the latter, both the sample size and the number of reactors (assumed to be false positive) are estimated for the required confidence level. These enotomological and epidemiological methods were then applied to assess the eradication of tsetse and trypanosomosis from Unguja Island of Zanzibar using the sterile insect technique (SIT). Pre- and post-eradication data collected were sufficient to establish with 95 percent confidence that both tsetse and trypanosomosis were eradicated...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of malaria on {{educational}} attainment by exploiting geographic variation in malaria prevalence in India prior to a nationwide eradication program in the 1950 s. Malaria eradication resulted in gains in literacy and primary school completion rates of approximately 12 percentage points. These estimates imply that the eradication of malaria can explain about half of the gains in these measures of educational attainment between the pre- and post-eradication periods in areas where malaria was prevalent. The effects are not present in urban areas, where malaria was not considered to be a problem in the <b>pre-eradication</b> period. The results cannot be explained by convergence across areas. We find gains {{for both men and women}} as well as for members of scheduled castes and tribes, a traditionally disadvantaged group. ...|$|E
40|$|Eradications of {{invasive}} alien species have generally benefited biodiversity. However, without sufficient planning, successful eradications can have unexpected and unwanted consequences for native species and ecosystems. In particular, the “surprise effect” is the rapid increase of hitherto unnoticed species following the sudden removal of an invasive alien that was exerting an ecological force on those species (predation, competition or herbivory, for example). The only way to prevent these undesired outcomes is to adapt the control programme following the characterization of the trophic relationships between the {{invasive alien species}} and the invaded communities, that is, to view the control with a holistic perspective. Here, we illustrate this point with {{the study of the}} role of the ship rat (Rattus rattus), which invaded a tropical pacific atoll, Surprise Island, New Caledonia.

40|$|The malaria {{eradication}} campaign {{that started in}} Sri Lanka in the late 1940 s virtually eliminated malaria transmission on the island. I use the <b>pre-eradication</b> differences in malaria endemicity within Sri Lanka to identify the effect of {{malaria eradication}} on fertility and child survival.

The effect of malaria on the transition time to higher order births is inconclusive. Malaria could directly or indirectly affect survival probabilities of live births. I exploit the particular epidemiology of malaria that causes more severe sequelae during an initial pregnancy. I find differential changes in survival probabilities by birth order that are most likely due to the direct in utero effects of malaria. The increase in population growth after malaria eradication reconciles the contradictory findings in the macroeconomic and microeconomic literatures: the increased productivity and education from malaria eradication will only appear in aggregate measures like GDP per capita after a delay because of the initial increase in the population size. malaria, fertility, disease eradication...|$|E

The {{success of the}} Southeast Boll Weevil Eradication Program has {{played a major role}} in the recent revival of Georgia’s cotton industry. The boll weevil first appeared in Thomasville in 1915, and cotton production began declining rapidly, from a historical high of 2. 8 million bales in 1914 to 600, 000 bales in 1923. Aerial applications of calcium arsenate dust began in the early 1920 s. This helped increase yields somewhat, but the industry never really recovered, and overall production continued declining steadily for another 60 years. In 1983 Georgia produced only 112, 000 bales on 115, 000 harvested acres. The active treatment and trapping phase of the eradication program began in 1987 and was completed in 1990. Since then, cotton production has increased dramatically each year.

40|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} Cory's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea borealis at its important Atlantic colony on Selvagern Grande has been monitored periodically at two study plots since 1982. A successful eradication programme was implemented to remove two alien invasive mammals, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and house mice Mus musculus, {{from the island}} during 2002. The availability of long-term breeding data for Cory's shearwaters on Selvagern Grande provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study the effects of the removal of rabbits and mice on seabird breeding. Annual observation of approximately 400 Cory's nests showed that significantly more birds fledged from both study sites in the five breeding seasons after the eradication than in the 13 seasons prior to it for which reliable breeding data were available. The numbers of young birds present at the time of fledging were an average of 47 and 23 % greater than <b>pre-eradication</b> numbers at the two study sites. The eradication of rabbits and mice was simultaneous and, therefore, it was impossible to attribute the increased breeding success of Cory's shearwaters to the removal of one or other species. However, both are known to have adverse impacts on the breeding of nesting seabirds. These observations provide important justification for the implementation of further programmes for the removal of alien invasive mammals from oceanic islands...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} strong links between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric adenocarcinoma. Recent studies suggest that cell-mediated immunity influences the outcome of infection, including the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The T-cell response can be characterized {{in terms of the}} secreted cytokine profile, which in turn influences the B-cell response including the balance of IgG subclass antibody. Methods: Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies were studied by ELISA in subjects with benign gastric diseases, gastric dysplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma. Results: The distribution patterns of IgG subclass anti-H. pylori antibody varies significantly between H. pylori-linked benign and malignant disease in subjects infected with H. pylori. Significantly lower IgG 2 levels were found in subjects with gastric adenocarcinoma compared with those with reflux esophagitis, chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and peptic ulcer, while IgG 1 antibody remained at similar levels in both benign and malignant disease. A limited study of seropositive subjects with premalignant change was consistent with the fall in IgG 2 antibody pre-dating malignant change, although <b>pre-eradication</b> results are needed to validate these data. Conclusions: These studies indicate that subjects with low levels of IgG 2 anti-H. pylori antibody are at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, and that the previously described linkage between gastric adenocarcinoma and low total IgG antibody does not simply reflect reduced gastric colonization. The diagnostic value of this assay for pre-endoscopy screening is attractive...|$|E
40|$|Background: Efficacy of Helicobacter pylori stool antigen enzyme {{immunoassay}} (HpSA) and stool PCR was evaluated, {{before and after}} treatment, {{in a country with}} a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. Methodology: A total of 52 patients with dyspeptic symptoms were included in the study. Antral biopsy was collected during pre- and post-therapy periods for rapid urease test (RUT) and PCR. Similarly stool specimens for PCR and HpSA test were collected during both the periods from all 52 patients. Biopsy, PCR and RUT results together were considered the "gold standard. " Results: On the basis of gold standard tests, 40 / 52 patients were H. pylori positive. The sensitivity and specificity of HpSA test were 80 % and 83. 3 % respectively in untreated patients. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of stool PCR in untreated patients were 72. 5 % and 100 % respectively. After eradication therapy, the results of both RUT and biopsy PCR were negative in 87. 5 % and positive in 12. 5 % of the patients. Although post treatment sensitivity of HpSA and stool PCR was equal (60 %), specificity of HpSA and stool PCR were 68. 6 % and 97. 1 % respectively. Conclusion: The H. pylori stool tests represent a non-invasive concept for diagnosis of infection.

40|$|Background and Aim: The PyloriTek Test Kit (a 1 -h rapid urease test) was {{developed}} for the rapid diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) during endoscopy. Most studies were performed in Western populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the PyloriTek test for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in Chinese population. Methods: Eligible patients without prior treatment or who had had recent eradication of H. pylori were recruited. During endoscopy, biopsies were taken from the antrum and corpus for an in-house rapid urease test (RUT), histology and for the PyloriTek test (one antral and one corpus biopsy). Results of the PyloriTek test were compared with the gold standard (RUT and histology). Results: Analysis of PyloriTek test results from the antrum alone (101 patients before eradication and 52 patients after eradication) showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96. 3, 97. 9, and 97. 0 %, respectively, for cases before eradication, and an accuracy of 100 % for cases after eradication. The benefit of an additional body biopsy was marginal and only occurred in the <b>pre-eradication</b> group. Conclusion: The PyloriTek test was highly accurate for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection before and after eradication therapy, with a final result available at 1 h, which is unmatched by any invasive test so far. It enhances clinical decision-making by allowing the clinicians or endoscopists to start therapy on the same day of an endoscopy visit.

We prospectively evaluated the effect of H. pylori eradication on meal-associated changes in serum ghrelin and leptin levels, and body weight. Methods Veterans referred for upper GI endoscopy were evaluated at baseline and ≥ 8 weeks after endoscopy, and H. pylori status and body weight were ascertained. During the first visit in all subjects, and during subsequent visits in the initially H. pylori -positive subjects and controls, blood was collected after an overnight fast and 1 h after a standard high protein meal, and levels of eight hormones determined. Results Of 92 enrolled subjects, 38 were H. pylori -negative, 44 H. pylori -positive, and 10 were indeterminate. Among 23 H. pylori -positive subjects who completed evaluation after treatment, 21 were eradicated, and 2 failed eradication. After a median of seven months following eradication, six hormones related to energy homeostasis showed no significant differences, but post-prandial acylated ghrelin levels were nearly six-fold higher than <b>pre-eradication</b> (p = 0. 005), and median integrated leptin levels also increased (20 %) significantly (p H. pylori -positive individuals, but was not significantly changed in those who were H. pylori -negative or indeterminant at baseline.

The data presented here, are the results of a pilot study that preceded a project encompassing for UBT and PCR in monitoring a larger dyspeptic patient population. The 16 S rRNA PCR amplified Helicobacter DNA (39 %) in stool samples, being the most widely used method for detection of H. pylori in clinical specimens. However, the glmM gene PCR is the most sensitive and specific for the detection of H. pylori in gastric biopsy specimens Lu et al. (1999). The presence of H. pylori DNA was found in stool samples (21 %). The results show that to some extent the glmM gene for detection of H. pylori DNA by PCR may be useful for the diagnosis of H. pylori from stool. In comparison with UBT as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity was 42.6 % and 100 %, respectively. The sensitivity is low. In a related study by Aktepe et al. (2011); using five methods of detection of H. pylori, the stool-PCR had the lowest sensitivity (21 %). However, Makristathis et al. (1998) developed a semi-nested PCR assay, targeted to a species-specific protein antigen which is present in all strains of H. pylori, for detection and follow-up of H. pylori infected patients and the sensitivity was as high as 93.7 % and the specificity was 100 %. Another study by Mishra et al. (2008) corroborated the high sensitivity of stool-PCR in both <b>pre-eradication</b> and post-eradication to be 72.5 % and 97.1 % and the authors concluded that stool-PCR was better indicator than HpSA test in post-eradication assessment of infection.

40|$|Our {{ability to}} respond {{appropriately}} to infectious diseases is enhanced by identifying differences in the potential for transmitting infection between individuals. Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i. e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [0 < R eff < 1) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis {{is based on a}} branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, <b>pre-eradication</b> smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that R eff has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in R eff, suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the causes}} of a failed {{eradication}} of a pest species {{is important because it}} enables an argued adjustment of the methodologies used and the improvement of the protocols for future attempts. We examined how molecular monitoring can help distinguish between the two main reasons for an eradication failure (i. e., survival of some individuals vs. recolonization after eradication). We investigated genetic variation in seven microsatellite loci in ship rat (Rattus rattus) populations from four islets off the Martinique coast (French Caribbean). In 1999 an eradication attempt was conducted on the four islets. Three years later rats were observed again on two of them. We compared the genetic signatures of the populations before and after the eradication attempt. On one of the islands, the new rat population was likely a subset of the <b>pre-eradication</b> population. A weak genetic differentiation was found between them, with almost no new alleles observed in the new population and moderate F-ST values (0. 15). Moreover, assignment procedures clustered the two populations together. In contrast, on the other islet, many new alleles were observed after the eradication attempt, resulting in an increase in genetic diversity (from 2. 57 to 3. 57 mean number of alleles per locus) and strong F-ST values (0. 39). Moreover, genetic clustering clearly separated the two samples (i. e., before and after the eradication attempt) in two different populations. Thus, to achieve long-term eradication on these islets, it seems necessary to redevelop the eradication procedure to avoid individuals surviving and to prevent reinvasion, probably from the mainland, by installing permanent trapping and poisoning devices and conducting regular monitoring. We strongly encourage wildlife managers conducting eradication campaigns to integrate molecular biological tools in their protocols, which can be done easily for most common invasive species...|$|E
40|$|Non-indigenous {{invasive}} species {{are a major}} threat to native species diversity and ecosystem function and have been called the single worst threat of natural disaster of this century. Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees (Lehmann lovegrass), a tufted perennial bunchgrass native to southern Africa, is one such problematic species in Arizona, USA. This dissertation research is a mix of predictive modeling and field experiments designed to inform management decisions based on greater understanding of this nonnative species, with emphasis on the potential for spread and the impacts of removal. The modeling studies in this dissertation aimed to predict the potential distribution of E. lehmanniana in the southwestern United States under current and potential future climate conditions. The first portion of study addressed a common assumption in predictive modeling of nonnative species: data from the species' native range are necessary to accurately predict the potential distribution in the invaded range. The second portion of this study predicted the distribution of E. lehmanniana under 28 different climate change scenarios. Results showed the distribution of E. lehmanniana progressively shrinking in the southeastern and northwestern portions of the state and increasing in the northeastern portion of the state with increasing temperatures and precipitation. Key shifts occurred under scenarios with increases in summer and winter precipitation of 30 % or more, and increases in summer maximum and winter minimum temperatures of at least 2 oC. The field experiment served as a <b>pre-eradication</b> assessment for E. lehmanniana and indicates how semi-desert grassland communities in southeastern Arizona may respond to the removal of this species. This study suggested that plant community response to removal of an introduced species is mediated by precipitation variability (timing and amount), local site history, and edaphic conditions. The response observed on a site previously farmed for decades was to subsequently become dominated by other nonnative annual species. However, the two other sites with histories of livestock grazing responded more predictably to the removal, with an increase in annual ruderal species (2 to 10 times the amount of annual cover recorded on control plots) ...|$|E
40|$|Background For > 100 years cattle {{production}} in the southern United States has been threatened by cattle fever. It is caused by an invasive parasite-vector complex that includes the protozoan hemoparasites Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, which are transmitted among domestic cattle via Rhipicephalus tick vectors of the subgenus Boophilus. In 1906 an eradication effort was started and by 1943 Boophilus ticks had been confined to a narrow tick eradication quarantine area (TEQA) along the Texas-Mexico border. However, {{a dramatic increase in}} tick infestations in areas outside the TEQA over the last decade suggests these tick vectors may be poised to re-invade the southern United States. We investigated historical and potential future distributions of climatic habitats of cattle fever ticks to assess the potential for a range expansion. Methods We built robust spatial predictions of habitat suitability for the vector species Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus across the southern United States for three time periods: 1906, present day (2012), and 2050. We used analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to identify persistent tick occurrences and analysis of bias in the climate proximate to these occurrences to identify key environmental parameters associated with the ecology of both species. We then used ecological niche modeling algorithms GARP and Maxent to construct models that related known occurrences of ticks in the TEQA during 2001 - 2011 with geospatial data layers that summarized important climate parameters at all three time periods. Results We identified persistent tick infestations and specific climate parameters that appear to be drivers of ecological niches of the two tick species. Spatial models projected onto climate data representative of climate in 1906 reproduced historical <b>pre-eradication</b> tick distributions. Present-day predictions, although constrained to areas near the TEQA, extrapolated well onto climate projections for 2050. Conclusions Our models indicate the potential for range expansion of climate suitable for survival of R. microplus and R. annulatus in the southern United States by mid-century, which increases the risk of reintroduction of these ticks and cattle tick fever into major cattle producing areas.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:The Comoros are an {{archipelago}} {{located in}} the Indian Ocean between the eastern coasts of Africa and north of Madagascar. Malaria transmission appeared late in the 19 th century due to the intensification of human migration. The story of malaria transmission for the past century is depicted to provide useful lessons for the future. Currently, malaria transmission occurs differently on each island; thus, control strategies must be adapted for each particular island. Tentative malaria control in Comoros {{has a long history}} of success and failure. This study reviews the data available as a basis for recommendations for the future. RESULTS:There has been much effort to reach a <b>pre-eradication</b> state in Anjouan and Moheli, but only control steps have been taken in the Great Comoro. To date, the primary strategy used is mass treatment of the population using artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which is similar to the strategy deployed during the 1950 s in other countries. ACT appears efficient in two of the three islands; however, the sustainability of the strategy is unknown. This sustainability is compromised by (i) the huge level of uncontrolled exchange between the Comoro Islands and their neighbours, increasing the risk of introducing ACT-resistant strains, (ii) the use of large quantities of pesticides for agriculture usually associated with the resistance of mosquitoes, and (iii) the cost of the actions themselves. CONCLUSIONS:In view of the history of malaria in this area, the first recommendation is to enhance the training of health workers and the population. The second step is to establish a national strategy to assess malaria and related factors, which is currently lacking. A survey to assess the drug sensitivity of the parasites is particularly important in a context of low transmission associated with mass treatment of the population. The last point should be to secure financial support, which is not obvious in a context of pre-elimination. The Comoro Islands are thus a living laboratory to experiments with strategies for elimination, but the future is complex...|$|E

In this regard the example of malaria eradication elsewhere in the world bears remembering; the elation of early success too frequently gave way to frustration in eliminating residual foci of disease, to discouragement of interest and relaxation of effort. As a result some countries, once close to malaria eradication have suffered a resurgence of malariato <b>pre-eradication</b> levels. The same need not occur with smallpox eradication. In the West and Central African Regional Smallpox Eradication and Measles Control effort, rapid and effective mass vaccination campaigns have begun to reap gratifying reductions in the occurrence of both diseases. However intensified disease surveillance, case detection, and outbreak containment concurrently with continuing mass vaccination efforts must play an increasingly predominate role if the objectives of smallpox eradication and measles control are to be reached.
