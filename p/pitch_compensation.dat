40|$|The two {{distinct}} sound sources comprising voiced frication, voicing and frication, interact. One effect {{is that the}} periodic source at the glottis modulates the amplitude of the frication source originating in the vocal tract above the constriction. Voicing strength and modulation depth for frication noise were measured for sustained English voiced fricatives using high-pass filtering, spectral analysis in the modulation (envelope) domain, and a variable <b>pitch</b> <b>compensation</b> procedure. Results show {{a positive relationship between}} strength of the glottal source and modulation depth at voicing strengths below 66 dB SPL, at which point the modulation index was approximately 0. 5 and saturation occurred. The alveolar [z] was found to be more modulated than other fricatives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an improved stereovision {{system for the}} anticipated detection of car-to-pedestrian accidents. An improvement of the previous versions of the pedestrian-detection system is achieved by compensation of the camera’s pitch angle, since it results in higher accuracy in {{the location of the}} ground plane and more accurate depth mea-surements. The system has been mounted on two different prototype cars, and several real collision-avoidance and collision-mitigation experiments have been carried out in private circuits using actors and dummies, which represents one of the main contributions of this paper. Collision avoidance is carried out by means of deceleration strategies whenever the accident is avoidable. Likewise, collision mitigation is accomplished by triggering an active hood system.

40|$|The Topsat {{mission is}} {{designed}} to demonstrate the capabilities of small satellites for classically high value remote sensing missions. Conceived by the UK’s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), it will produce 2. 5 m resolution panchromatic imagery and 5 m resolution multispectral imagery in three visible wavebands and allow direct transmission of the image data to a local mobile ground station. The Topsat programme is jointly funded by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and by the British National Space Centre’s Mosaic small satellite initiative and includes provision for the spacecraft, ground segment, commercial launch and one year of planned operations. The mission will meet the national needs of the UK in two areas. The UK MoD will use Topsat to investigate the utility and issues of providing data acquisition and tasking resources to local command levels. BNSC are supporting the programme as a demonstration of an enhanced capability for UK small satellites leading to sales of similar systems and to allow the development of lower cost markets for remote sensing products producible from such systems. The Topsat mission is a collaboration between four UK partners. DERA are leading the mission and providing the data handling unit, high rate downlink, mobile ground station and operations. Surrey Satellites (SSTL) are providing the spacecraft bus and command and telemetry links. Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) are developing a near diffraction limited wide field of view camera which, when combined with a <b>pitch</b> <b>compensation</b> manoeuvre, allows the highly demanding optical performance characteristics to be achieved.

40|$|The airbrakes {{are part}} of high {{performance}} aircraft and its location is arrived at based on wind tunnel experiments and in actual practice it is a compromise between the x 2018;desiredx 2019; location, which gives the least pitching moment and the best x 2018;availablex 2019; location on aircraft x 2018;near to the desired onex 2019;. The requirement is such that on deployment of airbrakes the drag should increase without any decrease in lift.

40|$|Conventional wind {{turbines}} are built with a mechanical transmission system, and all components are therefore situated {{on top of}} the wind turbine. By replacing the mechanical drive shaft and gear with a hydraulic transmission line, most of these components can be relocated {{at the bottom of the}} wind turbine. Especially for off-shore floating {{wind turbines}}, this is important, as this will make the floating structure more easy to control. For off-shore applications, the reliability of the wind turbines is also essential. The turbines are towed several kilometres from land, and maintenance takes both time and is dangerous. A wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line will give a much more reliable system, as no mechanical gear is included in the design. The hydraulic transmission line enables the turbine and generator to be operated at different velocities. This creates the possibility of using a synchronous generator at constant speed together with a turbine operated at changing speed. By varying the displacement of the motor, the volumetric flow can be adjusted so that the turbine spins with an optimal rate. The advantage of using a synchronous generator in preference to an asynchronous one, is the removal of heavy and expensive frequency conversion equipment. The synchronous generator can deliver its power directly to the power grid, because its frequency never changes. At the same time, the turbine is rotated at an optimal rate, maximizing the effectiveness of the wind turbine. This thesis is concerned with the modeling, analysis and control design for a wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. The transmission line is divided into a high pressure and low pressure side, where the dynamics of the high pressure side are interesting. The high pressure transmission line is built up of a hydraulic motor converting mechanical power into fluid power. Then, the fluid is carried through a transmission line system with an accumulator alongside it, before the fluid power is reconverted into mechanical power by a hydraulic motor. The hydraulic pump and motor will be supplied by H&# 228;gglunds Drives, but they do not yet exist because of their large sizes. However, scaled parameters from existing pumps and motors are used instead for modeling and simulation purposes. The transmission line is modeled as a chain of helmholtz-resonators linked together. By dividing the transmission line into an admittance model and a hybrid model, two state space representations are found. This split is made because of the accumulator model situated half way down the transmission line. The accumulator is modeled by the movement of the accumulator piston, and the pressure of the compressed gas, which results in a non-linear model with three states. The dynamic parts of the system are analysed, that is the transmission line and the accumulator. Transfer functions for the two transmission line models are found, and the natural frequencies of the model are determined. A transfer function is also found for the accumulator, by first linearizing the accumulator model, and then finding the stationary state values. The accumulator is shown to include very fast dynamics, giving us a maximum step size when running simulations. The helmholtz-resonator models reveals that there exists a pressure wave in the transmission line, which is reflected at the transmission line ends. It also reveals, that when several resonators are linked together, unnatural higher frequencies develop, which act like noise during simulations. A control design is carried out for the wind turbine with a mechanical transmission line, to gain insight in the controller functionality. The controller is used as <b>pitch</b> <b>compensation</b> when wind speeds are above rated. A similar approach is taken when designing a controller for the wind turbine with a hydraulic transmission line. A pitch controller featuring both feed forward and feedback terms is developed, so that the pressure in the transmission line is kept at a certain maximum. Additionally, a wind speed estimator is developed, as wind speed measurements at the nacelle often are very contaminated with noise from the rotating propeller blades. Simulations are made of the accumulator, the transmission line, and the hydraulic pump and motor separately, before running simulations with the whole system connected together. Different motor configurations are tested with the hydraulic transmission line removed. This is because of the small step size imposed by the accumulator model. The different motor configurations include a single large displacement unit, a single high speed unit with small displacement, several small displacement units, and a single large variable displacement unit. Power delivered from the turbine is compared to the power delivered to the generator, and pressure is compared to the set point given to the pitch controller. The results are satisfactory, showing that there will be considerable losses from the hydraulic pump and motor. A turbine power output of 5 MW will yield a generator power input of approximately 4. 3 MW. However, because the transmission line pressure currently is 80 % of what it can handle (300 bar), the turbine power output could be increased. The total power fed to the generator would then be i order of 5 to 6 MW. The advantages by using a hydraulic transmission line, like lower maintenance and longer lifetime expectancy, seem to make up for the increased losses in the transmission line. </p...|$|E

The roll maneuvers, called ROTOs (Roll Only Targeting Opportunities), rolled the spacecraft left or right from its ground track to shoot images as much as 30° from nadir. It was possible for a pitch maneuver {{to be added to}} compensate for the relative motion between the spacecraft and the planet. This was called a CPROTO (<b>Compensation</b> <b>Pitch</b> Roll Targeting Opportunity), and allowed for some very high resolution imaging by the onboard MOC (Mars Orbiting Camera).|$|R

The imaging spectrometer is flying on PROBA, a small agile satellite, which was launched in October 2001. The main purpose of the instrument is to provide images of land areas. The platform provides pointing in both across-track and along-track directions, for target acquisition and multi-angle observations, particularly for measurement of the Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) properties of selected targets.

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} accuracy {{test standard}} for machining centers (ISO 10791) is being revised {{in order to}} add a test method for five-axis machining centers. In the revised part of the standard (ISO 10791 - 6), simultaneous three-axis interpolation motion accuracy tests for two linear axes and one rotary axis are proposed as an interpolation accuracy test for five-axis machining centers. These tests enable the measurement of the motion error in three directions, e. g., X, Y, and Z. Two devices {{can be used as}} the measurement instrument in these tests. One is a ball bar device, and the other is a combination of a ball and a displacement sensor. An R-test device that incorporates three displacement sensors has been designed for the latter. Using the ball bar device, measurement in three directions can be performed independently, and the radii of circular interpolations for each measurement are different. Using the R-test device, time is shortened by measuring three measurement directions at once, and the acquired data can be analyzed in various ways. The original goal of the measurement method using the R-test device was to measure the dynamic accuracy of the rotary axes. In the present study, the R-test device was actually prototyped and several machines were measured. In addition to the dynamic error of the rotary axes, incorrect <b>pitch</b> error <b>compensation</b> settings for the numerical controller, straightness, or squareness of the linear axes can be well detected...|$|R
40|$|A Simrad EM 300 multibeam sonar {{was used}} to attempt to resolve small (- 5 m high) targets in 450 m of water. The targets had {{previously}} been surveyed using a deeply towed 59 kHz sidescan sonar. Using multisector active yaw, <b>pitch</b> and roll <b>compensation,</b> together with dynamically altering angular sectors, the sonar is capable of maintaining sounding densities of as tight as 10 m spacing in these water depths. This is significantly smaller than the largest dimension of the projected beam footprints (1 6 - 64 m). The observed {{data suggest that the}} targets are intermittently resolved. The field results compare well to the output of a numerical model which reproduces the imaging geometry. Possible variations in the imaging geometry are implemented in the model, comparing equiangular and equidistant beam spacings, differing angular sectors and all the different combinations of transmit and receive beam widths that are available for this model of sonar. While amplitude detection is significantly aliased by targets smaller than the across track beam footprint, under conditions where the signal to noise ratio is favorable, phase detection can be used to reduce the minimum size of target observed to about the scale of the across track beam width. Thus having the beam spacing at the scale is justifiable. The phase distortion due to smaller targets, however, is generally averaged out...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{operational}} {{area of the}} robots started to extend and new functionalities are planned for them in our daily environments. As the human-robot interaction is being improved, the robots can provide support in elderly care, human assistance, rescue, hospital attendance and many other areas. With this motivation, an intensive research is focused around humanoid robotics {{in the last four}} decades. However, due to the nonlinear dynamics of the robot and high number of degrees of freedom, the robust balance of the bipedal walk is a challenging task. Smooth trajectory generation and online compensation methods are necessary to achieve a stable walk. In this thesis, Cartesian foot position references are generated as periodic functions with respect to a body-fixed coordinate frame. The online adjustment of these parameterized trajectories provides an opportunity in tuning the walking parameters without stopping the robot. The major contribution of this thesis in the context of trajectory generation is the smoothening of the foot trajectories and the introduction of ground push motion in the vertical direction. This pushing motion provided a dramatic improvement in the stability of the walking. Even though smooth foot reference trajectories are generated using the parameter based functions, the realization of a dynamically stable walk and maintenance of the robot balance requires walking control algorithms. This thesis introduces various control techniques to cope with disturbances or unevenness of the walking environment and compensate the mismatches between the planned and the actual walking based on sensory feedback. Moreover, an automatic homing procedure is proposed for the adjustment of the initial posture before the walking experiments. The presented control algorithms include ZMP regulation, foot orientation control, trunk orientation control, foot <b>pitch</b> torque difference <b>compensation,</b> body <b>pitch</b> angle correction, ground impact compensation and early landing modification. The effectiveness of the proposed trajectory generation and walking control algorithms is tested on the humanoid robot SURALP and a stable walk is achieved...|$|R
