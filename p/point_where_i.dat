During this time I was {{obviously}} at the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself.

And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life.

40|$|Recently, P. J. Cameron {{introduced}} {{a new class of}} block designs which generalises the class of t-designs, and also includes orthogonal arrays, resolved 2 -designs, and other classes of combinatorial designs. The main idea is that the set of points of the design is structured by an ordered partition of that set, and the blocks of the design and t-subsets of the point-set also have structure with respect to this pointset partition. There is now the prospect that techniques, theorems and bounds for one class of combinatorial designs may be generalised to many classes of designs at once, via these generalised t-designs. In this paper, we investigate the parameters of generalised t-designs, providing some strong necessary conditions for the existence of certain types of such designs. We show that the t-design constants λi (the number of blocks containing an i-subset of the <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>i</b> ≤ t) and λ j i (the number of blocks containing an i-subset I of the points and disjoint from a j-subset J of the <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> ∩ J = ∅ and i + j ≤ t) have natural counterparts for generalised t-designs. We also generalise N. S. Mendelsohn’s concept of “intersection numbers of order r ” for t-designs, and show that analogous equations to those of Mendelsohn hold for generalised t-designs.

40|$|Recently, P. J. Cameron {{studied a}} class of block designs which generalises the classes of t-designs, α-resolved 2 -designs, {{orthogonal}} arrays, and other classes of combinatorial designs. In fact, Cameron’s generalisation of t-designs (when there are no repeated blocks) is a special case of the “poset t-designs ” in product association schemes studied ten years earlier by W. J. Martin, who further studied the special case of “mixed block designs”. In this paper, we study Cameron’s generalisation of t-designs {{from the point of}} view of classical t-design theory, in particular investigating the parameters of these generalised t-designs. We show that the t-design constants λi (the number of blocks containing an i-subset of the <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>i</b> ≤ t) and λ j i (the number of blocks containing an i-subset I of the points and disjoint from a j-subset J of the <b>points,</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> ∩ J = ∅ and i + j ≤ t) have very natural counterparts for generalised t-designs. Our main result places strong restrictions on the block structure of Cameron’s t-(v, k, λ) designs, an important subclass of generalised t-designs. We also generalise N. S. Mendelsohn’s concept of “intersection numbers of order r ” for t-designs, and show that analogous equations to those of Mendelsohn hold for generalised t-designs.
