6000|$|By this trivial {{example the}} perversions of old customs at Oxford are illustrated. To {{appreciate}} {{the life of}} the place, then, we must glance for a moment at the growth of the University. As to its origin, we know absolutely nothing. That Master Puleyn began to lecture there in 1133 we have seen, and it is not likely that he would have chosen Oxford if Oxford had possessed no schools. About these schools, however, we have no information. They may have grown up out of the seminary which, perhaps, was connected with St. Frideswyde's, just as Paris University may have had some connection with [...] "the School of the Palace." [...] Certainly to Paris University the academic corporation of Oxford, the Universitas, owed many of her regulations; while, again, the founder of the college system, Walter de Merton (who visited Paris in company with Henry III.), may have compared ideas with Robert de Sorbonne, the founder of the college of that name. In the early Oxford, however, of the twelfth and most of the thirteenth centuries, colleges with their statutes were unknown. The University was the only corporation of the learned, and she struggled into existence after hard fights with the town, the Jews, the Friars, the Papal courts. The history of the University begins with the thirteenth century. She may be said to have come into being as soon as she possessed common funds and rents, as soon as fines were assigned, or benefactions contributed to the maintenance of scholars. Now the first recorded fine is the payment of fifty-two shillings by the townsmen of Oxford as part of the compensation for the hanging of certain clerks. In the year 1214 the Papal Legate, {{in a letter to his}} [...] "beloved sons in Christ, the burgesses of Oxford," [...] bade them excuse the [...] "scholars studying in Oxford" [...] half the rent of their halls, or hospitia, for the space of ten years. The burghers were also to do penance, and to feast the poorer students once a year; but the important point is, that they had to pay that large yearly fine [...] "propter suspendium clericorum"--all for the hanging of the clerks. Twenty-six years after this decision of the Legate, Robert Grossteste, the great Bishop of Lincoln, organised the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of the fine, and founded the first of the CHESTS, the chest of St. Frideswyde. These chests were a kind of Mont de Piete, and to found them was at first the favourite form of benefaction. Money was left in this or that chest, from which students and masters would borrow, on the security of pledges, which were generally books, cups, daggers, and so forth.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a profile of}} forest-related conflict in Indonesia 1997 to June 2003, based on a survey of national and provincial newspaper articles and six case studies in Sumatera, Kalimantan and Java. The report shows that conflict increased most rapidly in 2000 during the transition to decentralization, and has generally stayed at higher levels than during the New Order period. Reports of conflicts were highest in East Kalimantan, followed by Sumatera and Central Java. The causes of conflict were primarily differences in perceptions about boundaries, rights to use of forest, compensation <b>payments</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> of benefits from forests. Although media reports focus on the escalation of conflict after the reform period, the case studies demonstrated complex histories of latent conflict and conflict resolution through compensation payments that proved unsuccessful in reducing long-run conflict. The study recommends that (i) conflict management be considered an element of forest management, (ii) forest conflicts should be monitored {{to learn more about}} their incidence, causes and ways of managing them and (iii) alternative methods for managing conflict should be explored...|$|R

This is not the case in Japan, where Internet usage and electronic commerce in business-to-consumer markets is mainly promoted by mobile phones and con-venience stores. Japanese e-commerce models are products of the regional urban structure and lifestyles. Distinct features of Japan’s urban areas favouring the use of mobile Internet are traffic jams and long com-muting times. They explain why entertainment services are the most popular among mobile Internet con-tents, since they seem to be most suitable to bridge waiting time in an entertaining way. Another typical feature of Japanese cities are the ubiquitous convenience stores.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – Music can be copied and {{distributed}} almost without cost via the internet, while <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> technologies are reducing the transaction costs of its commercial exchange. In {{the case of}} MP 3 the cost of swapping music files is negligible, for both the supplier uploading the file and the receiver who is downloading the music. In light of these developments, this paper seeks to put forward {{the proposition that the}} main barrier to entry in the music sector has been the ownership and protection of artistic content in the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – The paper focuses on a review of the concepts relating to “barriers to entry”, since entry into the music industry is central to the explanation of the incumbents’ strategic responses. The pre- and post-web supply chains are also assessed from a “barrier to entry” perspective. Findings – This paper argues that the internet is destabilising the supply chain for music by challenging the pre-web role and domination of the music industry supply chain; and by changing the primary entry barrier in the sector from the incumbents exploiting their ownership of copyright to one of trying to protect it. Originality/value – The paper contributes to understanding the strategic responses of music industry incumbents, as well as presenting some of the implications for consumer welfare...|$|E
40|$|In an Article {{published}} in the April 1987 issue of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, I urged that the three major components of this nation 2 ̆ 7 s retirement income system—Social Security, and income tax preferences for both employer-sponsored pension plans and individual retirement savings—be analyzed as a comprehensive national retirement income security program. I demonstrated that such an integrated view of this tripartite retirement security system reveals serious problems both with Social Security and with the generally applauded 2 ̆ 2 tax expenditure 2 ̆ 2 provisions for private pensions and individual savings. Viewing the three elements as a unified retirement security arrangement demonstrates that the core unfairness of this nation 2 ̆ 7 s retirement security program is the regressivity of its taxing structure and the incapacity of low- and moderate-wage earners to maintain post-retirement their prior standard of living. Significantly, this conclusion contradicts directly the contentions of many critics of social security who complain about its failure to replicate the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> structure of an 2 ̆ 2 actuarially fair 2 ̆ 2 insurance system. In the May 1988 issue of this law review, Professor Nancy J. Altman criticized my analysis. She complains that my 2 ̆ 2 limited focus 2 ̆ 2 is grounded 2 ̆ 2 solely 2 ̆ 2 in 2 ̆ 2 the perspective of tax policy, 2 ̆ 2 asserts that I 2 ̆ 2 would inadvertently weaken the long-run stability of Social Security by transforming it from a social insurance program to a welfare program, 2 ̆ 2 and presents her 2 ̆ 2 defense 2 ̆ 2 of tax expenditures for employer-sponsored pension plans. Ultimately, she embraces the status quo {{on the ground that}} the various components of our retirement income system 2 ̆ 2 demonstrate an over-arching logic, despite the incremental and fragmented way in which the system has developed. 2 ̆ 2 My purpose here is to reply to Professor Altman 2 ̆ 7 s Article...|$|E

We investigate the key features of such analyses as regards their analytical and methodological approach and we identify emerging lessons from PES practice, leading to a new suggested research agenda.

40|$|Complaints {{about the}} {{unfairness}} {{of the social security}} pension system have become common. There are many variations on this theme, but the core of the unfairness claim is the failure of social security pensions to replicate the <b>payment</b> <b>and</b> benefit <b>distribution</b> structure of an 2 ̆ 2 actuarially fair 2 ̆ 2 insurance scheme. Middle- and high-income individuals would do better in such a private system. In this Article, I will argue that there is, indeed, unfairness in the social security tax <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> scheme, but that it is very nearly the opposite of the problem identified by private insurance advocates. Viewed from the perspective of overall retirement security, particularly when one considers how income tax expenditures (the revenue losses attributable to special federal income tax provisions) now shape that policy, the real fairness problems with social security are the regressivity of its tax structure and its modest capacity to maintain the standard of living of low and moderate wage earners. Moreover, an integrated view of both social security and income tax expenditures for employer-provided pensions and individual retirement savings reveals serious problems of relying on these generally applauded tax expenditures to implement national retirement security policies. At the same time, these tax expenditure provisions may place important tax policy concerns at risk...|$|R
