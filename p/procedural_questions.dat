Towards the end of the debate, Zoi Konstantopoulou, the Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament, raised so many <b>procedural</b> <b>questions</b> and objections that Tsakalotos missed the 9:30am vote to catch a flight to Brussels. More than 40 Syriza MPs voted against the plans, and it was suggested that Tsipras may resign, bringing the prospect of another snap election in September. In Brussels later that day, final negotiations were concluded for the Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a {{first draft of}} a model for curriculum development designed in the conceptual framework of the hyper- rationalistic pedagogy. Therefore, our idea to build a model of curriculum development is staked on two theoretical concepts: theory into practice and mereologic reasoning. We used the Posner's questions (1998) to analyze the curriculum development models: <b>procedural</b> <b>question,</b> descriptive question and conceptual question. Based on this conceptual question, we have analyzed several widely known and used curriculum development models. Consequently, was made a first draft of the hyper- rationalistic model of curriculum development. This paper presents that draft {{but in order to}} complete the model, our project provides another two research steps. These two steps consist in the implementation process of a randomized-block pedagogical experiment on two similar independent groups, made of 120 participants.

The commitment of the House to the principle of stare decisis in its procedural practice - the idea that fidelity to precedent cultivates levels of consistency and predictability that, in turn, foster fairness in the resolution of questions of order - depends implicitly on the compilation of precedents. Being rigorous about what constitutes actual legal precedent and striving to apply pertinent precedent to each <b>procedural</b> <b>question</b> engenders consistency, and therefore predictability, in procedural practice and, consequently, enhances the perceived legitimacy and fairness, and therefore the integrity, of the proceedings of the House.|$|R

40|$|A {{question}} {{is very important}} to measure whether or not the students can achieve the objective of the subjects. The comment reason the teacher asked the questions to the students is in order to check students’ understanding toward the instruction to increase the effectiveness of the lesson, and evaluate the lesson effectively. However, to get the effectiveness on teaching learning process the teacher should know the kinds of question and should know the feedbacks that will be produced by the students. Therefore, the researcher wants to describe the kinds of teacher’s questions and to describe the teacher’s feedback on the students’ answers from the teacher’s question. This research was descriptive qualitative in which, to describe the teacher’s question and teacher’s feedback on students’ answer. The subjects of this research are the teacher and the students of B class of the second grade. The data were obtained by using observation and interview to the teacher. The observation was used to collect the data concerning the real situation directly about the kinds of teacher’s question and the teacher’s feedback related to the students’ answers and the interview was used to check the validity of the data. The finding of this research indicates that there were three kinds of questions that were used by the teacher; they are (1) <b>Procedural</b> <b>question</b> in which it was used to manage classroom climate. It often employed in the beginning of teaching learning process, (2) Convergent question, it was used to check students’ comprehension with the short answer, and (3) Divergent question, in which it was used by the teacher to check students’ comprehension too, but this question needs long answer with their own ideas. The teacher used the convergent question more because that kind of question needs short answer related to the students in which they mostly have limited vocabulary. The teacher’s feedbacks are; (1) the critical feedback. The researcher here assumes that the teacher gave critical words or sentences in managing class. This feedback mostly found in <b>procedural</b> <b>question,</b> (2) the praising, modifying or no feedback. This case shows that the teacher gave just little appraisal, little modified or sometimes did not give feedback to the students’ answers. This feedback mostly produced by the teacher in convergent and divergent question. It is fact that the teacher should ask more divergent question because it needs long answer even with students own ideas and involve the praising and modifying feedbacks. Moreover, give positive feedback even the students not answers to the questions...|$|R

A comprehensive survey and analysis of the cases that have been decided under the Australian, British and Canadian lex loci delicti regimes suggests that courts in these countries do betray a homing instinct, but one that has actually been tightly restrained by appeal courts. Where application of the lex fori was formally allowed by use of a 'flexible exception' in Canada and the United Kingdom, this has been contained by courts of first appeal.
