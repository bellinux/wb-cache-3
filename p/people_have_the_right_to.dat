5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> defend their country from foreign occupiers, and <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{moved to}} dismiss the indictments {{on the grounds that}} federal {{obscenity}} statutes violated the constitutional guarantees of privacy and liberty that were protected by the due process clause. Referencing Lawrence v. Texas and Stanley v. Georgia the defense argued there is a fundamental right to sexual privacy which includes the right to possess and view sexually explicit material in one's own home. The defense argued that this right was not affected {{by the fact that the}} material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> possess, they were unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that {{it would be good for}} princes to be persuaded that their <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E

She has often voiced her support for same-sex marriage, advocating all <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> fall in love. In 2008, Jackson appeared in a public service announcement sponsored by the Logo television network and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) {{in response to the}} E.O.

His position at the university assured him studio space. In 1979 he had two solo shows and participated in three AFRICOBRA exhibitions. His work continued to be socially and politically aware with paintings like Festival #1 (1978) showing brilliant Senufo figures, a work supporting South Africans at war. African imagery became more apparent in his paintings with zigzag patterns and lizards appearing, representing [...] "that Africans, as the first <b>people,</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> speak on their own behalf," [...] as seen in Midnight Poet at 125th Street & Lenox (1979). In 1979 Jarrell received grant money to create a 52 x 31 foot mural at the East Athens Community Center.

Indeed, with fear and terror I imagine the time, when those dark iconoclasts come to power: with their raw fists they will batter all marble images of my beloved world of art, they will ruin all those fantastic anecdotes that the poets loved so much, they will chop down my Laurel forests and plant potatoes and, oh!, the herbs chandler will use my Book of Songs to make bags for coffee and snuff for the old women of the future – oh!, I can foresee all this and I feel deeply sorry thinking of this decline threatening my poetry and the old world order – And yet, I freely confess, the same thoughts have a magical appeal upon my soul which I cannot resist ....
