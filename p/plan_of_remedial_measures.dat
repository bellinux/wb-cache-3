40|$|The Water {{damage in}} {{buildings}} and building components because of leaking pipes {{and more and}} more because of floods and severe weather require professional help. Methods for analysing the cause of damage have to be developed or improved as well as repair and remediation techniques. Therefore, large scale laboratory tests with four rooms with three types of masonry walls and typical floors for intermediate storeys with insulation have been performed within a climate simulator. Artificial water damage was provoked through watering the floors, and the dispersion of water in the floors and the rising damp in the walls was measured. In the follow-up to the watering of the floors, a company which is specialized in drying wet buildings installed different drying systems for under-floor drying and wall drying. The drying process of the different components and layers of the floor construction and walls was monitored by a measuring system with more than 300 sensors for moisture content, relative humidity and temperature accompanied by thermography. After providing an initial contamination that is typical for construction sites, the microbial load (mould infestation) within the wet components was monitored at different times by experienced biologists. The aim of the research was to gain more confidence in selecting appropriate drying procedures and systems and to assess success control methods that identify the moment for terminating the drying process by on-the-spot-checks of exhaust air humidity and other parameters. At the same time the research delivers a lot of useful data for the validation of computer simulations reproducing the hygrothermal behaviour of wet building components at ambient conditions representative for water damage occurrence and subsequent technical drying. This leads the way to more accurate <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> by applying hygrothermal simulation tools...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of multi-hazard risk requires {{the use of}} models that are very data demanding. Data is needed of the areas that might be affected and the characteristics of the hazard, but also of the elements at risk that might be impacted, and their vulnerability. In the framework of two European projects (FP 6 -PEOPLE- 2006 -ITN Marie curie Mountain risks and FP 7 SafeLand) a training package has been developed on the use of spatial information for the assessment and management of mountain risks. This training package explains the procedures to collect, analyze and evaluate spatial information for risk assessment from natural hazards in a mountainous environment. It aims at researchers and practitioners that have to carry out risk assessments at a medium scale, and use the risk information in disaster risk reduction planning. The training package guides the participants through the entire process of risk assessment, {{on the basis of a}} case study of an area exposed to multiple hazards in Barcelonnette, France. In order to achieve maximum applicability the training package is made for use with Open Source software. Three-dimensional stereoscopic image interpretation using images downloaded from Google Earth is used to familiarize the participants with the hazard phenomena. These are then used in either a statistical or heuristic approach for modelling the initiation areas for landslides, debris flows, snow avalanches and rockfalls. The source areas are used for run-out modelling on a medium scale using a routing-spreading model and the results are converted into impact maps. Flood hazard assessment is done using a 1 D- 2 D flood propagation model and flood impulse is calculated for different return periods. The source maps and run-out maps for mass movements and the flood maps are then used in a quantitative multi-hazard risk assessment, by calculating the exposed elements at risk, the temporal and spatial probability and the vulnerability of the elements at risk. Also emphasis is given to the evaluation of uncertainty in the risk assessment process. A qualitative method for multi-hazard risk assessment is also included, using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation, in which a hazard index and a vulnerability index are generated. The final part of the training package deals with the use of risk information for disaster risk management, e. g. by incorporating the risk information in preparedness planning, cost-benefit analysis for the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures,</b> and land use zoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{escalating}} {{pollution of}} the environment {{has been one of}} the greatest concerns of science in recent years. Industrial advances in agriculture, expansion of chemical industries and a general change in lifestyle all over the world has lead to release of a variety of pollutants into the environment, thus contaminating the atmosphere, water bodies and many soil environments. In general, other than some natural processes, soils are increasingly being contaminated by anthropogenic sources such as leakages from waste containment facilities, accidental spills and industrial operations. Apart from affecting biotic components of the ecosystem, these pollutants greatly affect the performance, behavior and stability of the soil ecosystem, these pollutants greatly affect the performance, behavior and stability of the soil systems, thus causing severe damage to structures founded on them. The hydraulic and/or chemical alterations which allow these polluting substances to move within soil pores lead to physico-chemical decomposition processes, chemical alterations, leaching and ion exchange reactions. Such reactions could also result from natural processes such as weathering; but the effects caused by pollutants occur at faster rates. Soils are composed of clays, silts and sands. Due to charged nature of the particles and their large specific surface, engineering properties of clays are greatly affected by pollutants. The magnitude of these effects can vary significantly depending on the type of soil, the type and concentration of contaminant, duration of interaction and the environmental conditions. Hence, an understanding of contaminant-clay interactions is important for prevention of geotechnical features, if possible, or at least for <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures.</b> Understanding these effects and <b>planning</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> requires measurement <b>of</b> the affected properties of polluted soils. This may involve the modification of standard test procedures or the development of new test procedures. The main types of contaminants include inorganic acids, alkalis, sulphates, organic contaminants, toxic or phytotoxic metals and combustible substances. All of these are widely used in industries. While the adverse effects of presence of sulphate in alkaline conditions is well known, little information is available on the effect of sulphate in natural soils under acidic environments. Sulphuric acid is widely employed in the production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, pigments, rayon, film, iron, steel, explosives, paper and paper industry. It is also used in cleaning, etching, petroleum refining, electroplating, metallurgy, and in lead-acid batteries. Due to its widespread but often improper usage and the difficulty in safe storage, sulphuric acid is often found as a contaminant in natural soils. Sulphuric acid is also generated in natural soils by oxidation by pyrites in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Hence, an attempt has been made in this thesis to study the behavior of soils containing different clay minerals during acid-sulphate interaction. The effect of sulphate on soils containing calcite, whose presence is quite common, has also been studied. A review of literature suggests that most common geotechnical failures due to contamination occur due to significant changes on the volume change behavior. Also, it is known that severe changes that occur in soil properties can essentially be attributed to mineralogical changes that occur during interaction with pollutants. Therefore, volume change behavior of soil and detailed mineralogical changes and the consequent morphological changes that occur in soils with acid sulphate are studied...|$|R

40|$|Many {{natural and}} {{man-made}} slopes close to buildings or infrastructure do not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety {{with respect to}} their stability. Nonetheless, it is a requirement from society that the environment we live in is safe. Many slope stability investigations are therefore performed every year so that the risk of slope failure can be evaluated and corrective action applied, where appropriate. Numerous <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> are designed and carried out according to Swedish industry recommendations and practice. In a traditional slope stability analysis where limit equilibrium methods are used, one critical assumption is that a constant degree of shear strength mobilisation applies along the critical shear surface. This assumption implies that the entire shear surface is subject to equal levels of shear strain. It is therefore difficult to isolate the effect <b>of</b> different <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> on specific parts of the slope. Also, as the traditional design <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> only accounts for the change in overall factor of safety, {{it is not possible to}} state which part of the slope exhibits the least favourable stress condition and which <b>remedial</b> <b>measure</b> is most suitable and will improve the stress condition the best. An optimised design is therefore not achieved. The work presented herein proposes a method for achieving an optimised design <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>measures,</b> based on evaluation of the degree of shear strength mobilisation within a slope. Using numerical methods and observing the stress changes taking place within the slope allows evaluation of the effect <b>of</b> the <b>remedial</b> work by demonstrating whether the shear strength mobilisation is reduced in the most critical areas. The method presents a feasible engineering approach which may be implemented using existing tools which are widely available in the industry. The selection <b>of</b> optimised <b>remedial</b> <b>measures</b> with a focus on critical unfavourable stress concentrations provides a more sustainable approach to society. In addition to the development of the new methodology, the work summarises different definitions of shear strength mobilisation and evaluates the important challenges when working with slope stability modelling, especially when using numerical tools. Two specific issues addressed are the creation of in situ stress conditions and selecting the relevant strength parameters. The work also describes the potential effects that future climate change may have on the stability of slopes...|$|R
