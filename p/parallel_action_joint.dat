40|$|What enables {{individuals}} to act together? Recent discoveries {{suggest that a}} variety of mechanisms are involved. But something fundamental is yet to be investigated. In <b>joint</b> <b>action,</b> agents represent a collec- tive goal, or so it is often assumed. But how, if at all, are collective goals represented in <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> and how do such representations impact performance? To investigate this question we adapted a bimanual paradigm, the circle-line drawing paradigm, to contrast two agents acting in parallel with two agents per- forming a <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> Participants were required to draw lines or circles while observing circles or lines being drawn. The findings indicate that interpersonal motor coupling may occur in <b>joint</b> but not <b>parallel</b> <b>action.</b> This suggests that participants in <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> can represent collective goals motorically...|$|R

In this paper, we attempt to classify the types of parallel algorithms from the viewpoint of the composition of <b>actions</b> executable in <b>parallel</b> (we call them <b>parallel</b> <b>actions</b> in short). Three types of them are as follows. 1) the number of <b>parallel</b> <b>actions</b> is known from the source program. 2) some <b>parallel</b> <b>actions</b> are created or deleted depending on the execution of one action. 3) the number of the <b>parallel</b> <b>actions</b> is changeable dynamically depending on some processing in the past. From this classification we can derive some suggestion concerning the programming language suitable to parallel algorithms and the multi-processor system being able to execute these algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Humans {{are social}} beings {{and they often}} act jointly {{together}} with other humans (<b>joint</b> <b>actions)</b> rather than alone. Successful <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> requires the understanding and the coordination of ones own actions with another persons actions. The research attempts to advance our knowledge about <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination by extending existing research in two novel and important ways. First, prominent theories of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> agree on visual information being critical for successful <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination but are vague about the exact source of visual information being used during a <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> However, in a real life interaction several sources of visual information exist which inform an interaction partner about the ongoing course of the interaction (e. g. visual information about objects, tools, other persons). Knowing which sources of visual information are used, however, is important {{for a more detailed}} characterization of the functioning of <b>action</b> coordination in <b>joint</b> <b>actions.</b> Second, previous studies investigating the role of visual information in social settings often constrain the experimental tasks to artificial laboratory settings. To examine <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> mechanisms under realistic conditions I devised experimental tasks that allowed a close-to-natural <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> As a result the perceptual and motor components of the experimental tasks were less constrained allowing for a more natural interaction compared to previous studies. The current research examines the importance of different sources of visual information on <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination under realistic settings. In three studies I examined the influence of different sources of visual information (Study 1), the functional role of different sources of visual information (Study 2), and the effect of social context on the use of visual information (Study 3) in a table tennis game. The results of these studies revealed that (1) visual anticipation of the interaction partner and the interaction object is critical in natural <b>joint</b> <b>actions,</b> (2) different sources of visual information are critical at different temporal phases during the <b>joint</b> <b>action,</b> and (3) the social context modulates the importance of different sources of visual information. In sum, this work provides important and new empirical evidence about the importance of different sources of visual information in close-to-natural <b>joint</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Young {{children}} not {{only need to}} learn how to perform isolated actions, but also temporally and spatially coordinated actions such as using a knife and fork. Routes to learning such coordinated actions include imitation and participation in <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> However, little is known about the mechanisms guiding transmission of coordinated actions through observation and <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> performance. This paper reports an experiment comparing children's tendency to imitate multiple, coordinated actions following demonstration by a single model acting bimanually (Bimanual Observation condition), two models performing the same actions jointly with one performing each hand <b>action</b> (<b>Joint</b> Observation condition) and a condition in which the child actively takes part in the <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> demonstration by performing one part in coordination with a partner (<b>Joint</b> <b>Action</b> condition). When children were subsequently left alone to perform the task independently, they were more likely to imitate both coordinated actions in the two observation conditions than in the <b>Joint</b> <b>Action</b> condition, with no difference between performance in Bimanual and Joint Observation conditions. It is argued that this is due to children being more able to form a global representation of both actions and the relations between the two when observing from a distance than when actively involved in the task...|$|R

40|$|Many every-day life {{situations}} require {{two or more}} {{individuals to}} execute actions together. Assessing brain activation during naturalistic tasks to uncover relevant processes underlying such real-life <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> situations has remained a methodological challenge. In the present study, we introduce a novel <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> paradigm that enables the assessment of brain activation during real-life <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> tasks using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We monitored brain activation of participants who coordinated complex actions with a partner sitting opposite them. Participants performed table setting tasks, either alone (solo action) or in cooperation with a partner (<b>joint</b> <b>action),</b> or they observed the partner performing the task (<b>action</b> observation). Comparing <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> and solo action revealed stronger activation (higher [oxy-Hb]-concentration) during <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> {{in a number of}} areas.

Previous research has shown that in adults the involvement of one’s own motor system is enhanced during observation of an action partner as compared to during observation of an individual actor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether similar motor system involvement is present at early stages of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> development and whether it is related to <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> performance. In an EEG experiment with 3 -year-old children, we assessed the children’s brain activity and performance during a joint game with an adult experimenter. We used a simple button-pressing game in which the two players acted in turns. Power in the mu- and beta-frequency bands was compared when children were not actively moving but observing the experimenter’s actions when (1) they were engaged in the <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> game and (2) when they were not engaged. Enhanced motor involvement during action observation as indicated by attenuated sensorimotor mu- and beta-power was found when the 3 -year-olds were engaged in the <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> This enhanced motor activation during action observation was associated with better <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> performance.

Using a simple turn-taking game, we assessed 2 -year-old toddlers' <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> coordination, focusing on timing variability and turn-taking accuracy. In two additional tasks, we examined their action prediction capabilities with an eye-tracking paradigm and examined their inhibitory control capabilities with a classic executive functioning task (gift delay task).

Toddlers who showed more precision in their action predictions were less variable in their action timing during the joint play. Furthermore, toddlers who showed more inhibitory control in an individual context were more accurate in their turn-taking performance during the <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> On the other hand, no relation between timing variability and inhibitory control or between turn-taking accuracy and action prediction was found.
