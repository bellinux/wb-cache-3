25|$|Psychoactive {{substances}} {{are used}} by humans {{for a number of}} different purposes to achieve a specific end. These uses vary widely between cultures. Some substances may have controlled or illegal uses while others may have shamanic purposes, and still others are used medicinally. Other examples would be social drinking, nootropic, or sleep aids. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substance,</b> but unlike many others, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to a <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substance</b> {{can cause}} {{changes in the}} {{structure}} and functioning of neurons, as the nervous system tries to re-establish the homeostasis disrupted {{by the presence of}} the drug (see also, neuroplasticity). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become more responsive to neurotransmitters; this is called sensitization. Conversely, overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called desensitization or tolerance. Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a single exposure. These processes are thought {{to play a role in}} drug dependence and addiction. Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) is often referred to simply as depression, antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.|$|E

We explored sources of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> in public secondary schools and the means through which adolescents obtain those substances.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of risky behavior is characteristic in adolescence. Of {{all forms of}} risky behavior in adolescence, the use of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> - cigarettes, alcohol and illegal <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> particularly stand out, because of the frequency and degree of prevalence of use, {{and because of the}} impact that they have on youth development in this sensitive stage of growing up. Unfortunately, today we are witnessing the fact that such behavior in adolescents has gained an increasingly epidemic character mainly due to the characteristics of the social context in which young people are growing up. The main objective of this research, conducted in the framework of the doctoral dissertation of the author, was determining relations between relevant sociodemographic factors: gender, age, school success, financial status and place of residence of respondents, with the appearance and intensity of use of three types of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> - cigarettes, alcohol and illegal <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> among the general population of adolescents. The sample represents non-clinical young population, and it consists of 529 adolescents, students of the 2 nd and 4 th class of secondary school (17 and 18 years old). The data was collected by using Scale use of PAS (<b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances)</b> in adolescents, which was designed {{for the purpose of this}} research, as well as using a set of questions intended for the registration of socio-demographic variables. Respondents filled in questionnaires in groups, during the school lessons. The data show a relationship between the three studied socio-demographic variables with the occurrence and degree of use of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> in the adolescence period, such as gender, age and school success of the respondents. As regards gender of respondents associated with the occurrence and degree of alcohol and illegal substance use in adolescents, male adolescents more likely use alcohol and illegal <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances.</b> Age of respondents associated with the use of all three types of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> in adolescence, found that older adolescents were more likely to use cigarettes, alcohol and illegal <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances.</b> School success of the respondents is associated with the occurrence and degree of use of all three tested categories of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> - cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, and the obtained findings indicate that with the decline in school success, the prevalence of all three types of <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substances</b> increases in adolescence.

2500|$|Drugs, in {{the context}} of prohibition, are any of a number of psychoactive {{substances}} whose use a government or religious body seeks to control. What constitutes a drug varies by century and belief system. What is a <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substance</b> is relatively well known to modern science. Examples include a range from caffeine found in coffee, tea, and chocolate, nicotine in tobacco products; botanical extracts morphine and heroin, and synthetic compounds MDMA and Fentanyl.

Mr Howlett's fellow Tory MP Crispin Blunt declared that he has used and currently uses poppers. Manufacturers expressed concern over loss of business and potential unemployment. In March 2016, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs stated that, because alkyl nitrites do not directly stimulate or depress the central nervous system, poppers do not fall within the scope of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Inhaling the vaporized gas form of {{substances}} into the lungs {{is a quick}} and very effective way of delivering drugs into the bloodstream (as the gas diffuses directly into the pulmonary vein, then into the heart {{and from there to}} the brain) and affects the user within less than a second of the first inhalation. The lungs consist of several million tiny bulbs called alveoli that altogether have an area of over 70 m² (about the area of a tennis court). This can be used to administer useful medical as well as recreational drugs such as aerosols, consisting of tiny droplets of a medication, or as gas produced by burning plant material with a <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substance</b> or pure forms of the substance itself. Not all drugs can be smoked, for example the sulphate derivative that is most commonly inhaled through the nose, though purer free base forms {{of substances}} can, but often require considerable skill in administering the drug properly. The method is also somewhat inefficient since not all of the smoke will be inhaled. The inhaled substances trigger chemical reactions in nerve endings in the brain due to being similar to naturally occurring substances such as endorphins and dopamine, which are associated with sensations of pleasure. The result is what is usually referred to as a [...] "high" [...] that ranges between the mild stimulus caused by nicotine to the intense euphoria caused by heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines.|$|E

Therefore, the WHO sees gender empowerment as key in achieving fair distribution of health. The rate at which girls and women die relative to men is higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. [...] "Globally, girls missing at birth and deaths from excess female mortality after birth add up to 6 million women a year, 3.9 million below the age of 60. Of the 6 million, one-fifth is never born, one-tenth dies in early childhood, one- fifth in the reproductive years, and two-fifths at older ages. Excess female deaths have persisted and even increased in countries immensely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, like South Africa. In South Africa, excess female mortality between 10 and 50 years of age rose from close to zero to 74,000 deaths per year in 2008. In impoverished populations, there are pronounced differences in the types of illnesses and injuries men and women contract. According to Ward, poor women have more heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and infant mortality. Poor women also have significant comorbidity, or existence of two ailments, such as psychiatric disorders with <b>psychoactive</b> <b>substance</b> use. They are also at greater risk for contracting endemic conditions like tuberculosis, diabetes, and heart disease.
