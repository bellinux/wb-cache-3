5|$|In November, rapidly {{weakening}} Tropical Cyclone Alison {{moved from}} the Australian basin and dissipated immediately upon entering the south-west Indian Ocean on November13. On December4, short-lived Tropical Disturbance A3 was classified by MFR, subsequently drifting into the Australian region. Possibly related to the <b>previous</b> <b>system,</b> Tropical Cyclone Cathy {{moved from the}} Australian basin into the basin on December28, quickly dissipating.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic wars of the 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the <b>previous</b> <b>system,</b> except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the <b>previous</b> <b>system</b> of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.|$|E

50|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>systems</b> {{were all}} real-mode systems with no {{hardware}} support for protection and separation {{of programs and}} the operating system. While there had been support for multiprogramming in <b>previous</b> <b>systems,</b> it was limited to running one user job concurrently with multiple supporting functions known to be well-behaved, such as the card reader, printer, and card punch spoolers.|$|R

5|$|He {{arranged}} {{a new system}} to appoint judges. Instead of simply proposing a new judge candidate to the Congress, the presidency first released names {{of a number of}} potential candidates, who were then evaluated by several non-governmental organizations, who assessed if the candidate was suitable as a judge. The ministry of justice compiled all the support and criticism, and the president then decided which candidate would be proposed to the Congress, which made the final decision, as under the <b>previous</b> <b>system.</b> Raúl Zaffaroni, a former FREPASO politician, was the first judicial appointment under the new system. He was followed by Elena Highton de Nolasco, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court. The appointment of Carmen Argibay (another female judge) was controversial, since Argibay was an atheist and a supporter of legal abortion. The judges held liberal views on criminal justice, countering social demands for harsher, pro-victim policies after the murder of Axel Blumberg. However, the new Supreme Court had little political power, as the national government ignored all rulings that were not favorable.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix formula {{was changed}} again in 1938, abandoning the <b>previous</b> <b>system</b> of weight {{restrictions}} and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz' new car, the W154, proved its abilities at the French Grand Prix, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang {{to make it}} a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the 1938 season: the Swiss Grand Prix and the Coppa Acerbo; finished second in three: the French, German and Pau Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and Italian Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead {{for the rest of the}} race, despite losing the visor on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by tyres of the many lapped cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the <b>previous</b> <b>system</b> of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E

50|$|ATFLIR is 72 in (183 cm) long, weighs 420 lb (191 kg), {{and has a}} {{slant range}} of 40 mi (64.3 km), said to be useful at {{altitude}} of up to 50,000 ft (15,240 m). It has fewer parts than many <b>previous</b> <b>systems,</b> which is intended to improve serviceability (although early examples, in service with VFA-115 'Eagles' in 2003 experienced problems). Crews indicate that it offers much greater target resolution and image accuracy than <b>previous</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the <b>previous</b> <b>system</b> worked.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatise}} Tractatus of Glanvill, {{which is}} traditionally attributed to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, {{and to which}} Osbert himself may have contributed, names only seven judges, including Osbert. He {{was one of a}} group of royal justices that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, used by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England during Richard's reign, and chosen for their ability rather than any familial ties. This group replaced the <b>previous</b> <b>system</b> of using mostly local men, and represent the first signs of a professional judiciary. In 1194 Osbert was one of the collectors of the carucage in eastern England, along with Barre and de Warrene.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the <b>previous</b> <b>system.</b> Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} modularity of {{the system}} combined with its step-by-step (hence the alternative name) selection process and an almost unlimited potential for expansion gives the Strowger system its technical advantage. <b>Previous</b> <b>systems</b> had all been designed for a fixed number of subscribers to be switched directly {{to each other in}} a mesh arrangement. This became quadratically more complex as each new customer was added, as each new customer needed a switch to connect to every other customer. In modern terminology, the <b>previous</b> <b>systems</b> were not [...] "scalable".|$|R
