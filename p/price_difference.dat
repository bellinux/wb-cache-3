This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale <b>price</b> <b>difference</b> between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

Although considerable {{progress has been made}} in the past years in harmonization of the pharmaceutical markets, the pricing decisions or systems have continued to be operated on a national basis, which results in <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> across the member states. These <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> create opportunity for parallel trade which, in combination with the EU single market principle calling for the free movement of goods, could lead to reduction in <b>price</b> <b>differences.</b> Among the harmonization efforts by the European Commission, national decisions on pricing and controls, plus parallel trade dilemma, we attempt to analyze the bilateral drug <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> using a sample of countries that represent from strict to relatively less pharmaceutical regulations. Almost all member countries regulate pharmaceutical prices, either directly or indirectly, in the EU, which creates less or more <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> despite market integration. This paper is simply aimed at analyzing <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> in the European pharmaceutical market, employing annual 1994 – 2003 IMS Health Data from five EU countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain) on prices of molecules used to treat cardiovascular disease. The analysis includes a two step approach. First, we calculate the common use of Laspeyres and Paasche weighted price and quantity indices to make comparisons for both bilaterally matched molecules (considering Spain as the base country) and diffused molecules that are available for five countries. Second, we adopt a hedonic price regression to control observable quality and market characteristics and then re-analyze price differentials. The study concludes that <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> still exist, but are decreasing over time. Even though the results are sensitive to sample and methods used, we found implicit evidence that harmonization efforts by the European Commission may ease reducing <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> in the long run, but it should not be interpreted as moving toward complete elimination of <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> due to complexities in this industry...|$|R

Three research questions are posed: 1) what {{have been the}} explaining factors of the area <b>price</b> <b>differences,</b> 2) what have been the historic probabilities and sizes of the area <b>price</b> <b>differences,</b> and 3) what have been the quantitative effects of different factors to the area <b>price</b> <b>differences.</b> A regression model is laid out to explain the area <b>price</b> <b>differences.</b> The chosen factors seek to capture the main sources {{of change in the}} Finnish-Swedish power balances.

All the factors turn out to be highly statistically significant. For instance, the drastic increase in the area <b>price</b> <b>differences</b> from fall 2011 onwards could be primarily attributed to changes in the temperature difference and the clean dark spread of which the latter reflected the exceptionally wet circumstances. The residuals of the regression are autocorrelated which may be a reflection of the autocorrelation in the factors themselves.

Internally, VAM suffered problems with several customer's confusing the Rally SST and the three-door Lerma models and became undecided on which car to buy. Also, the Lerma's high price and relatively plain looks for a high-end luxury model (intended to become VAM's new flagship since the departure of the Matador-based Classic line) meant poor sales that ended way below VAM's expectations for the year. In terms of luxury, VAM gave priority to the Lerma and the high trim American (Concord) models over the Rally line. The Lerma for 1982 was changed from being a single version to two different versions to create a <b>price</b> <b>difference.</b> The final flagship of the company was available as the semi-equipped Lerma 610 and the fully equipped Lerma 620, both in three and five doors. Externally, a set of misguided moves from the Mexican government took their toll on the whole auto industry. First, the legal exemption of up to 500 automobile engines without emission certification was revoked, affecting directly the high performance 4.6/X engine of the Rally GT models. This was followed by a decree banning the importation of automotive luxury accessories affected the whole auto industry. The only way for the auto makers to keep on offering those accessories was to have them either produced or sourced locally, some found a replacement while others did not. In the VAM Rally's case, the list of accessories that were lost included the bullet-shaped sports remote mirrors, power door locks, power windows, electric trunk release, rear spoiler, analog tachometer, rear defroster, the Quartz digital clock, and the center console with armrest and rear ashtray.|$|E
