Methods The present study was a descriptive, retrospective and cross-sectional study. The data of the study were obtained by retrospectively reviewing records of written complaints to <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> units and on-site solutions between 2004, the year of establishment of these units, and 2008. Results The incidence of written and verbal complaints were calculated to be 23. 1 in 100 000 and 137. 9 in 100 000, respectively. The increase was 102. 2 % for on-site solutions, whereas it was calculated as 97. 8 % for written applications. It was noticed that the rate of violation judgements was high (42. 5 % (17 / 40)) in the first year the Edirne State Hospital <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> committee was established. Conclusions Possible problems encountered during the presentation of health services can be solved by the implementation of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> under the legislative guarantee. The implementation of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> should be considered as reflections of a socialised government on health services. The focus of <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> is to provide health services to individuals using their health rights under circumstances that are in conformity with human rights.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine awareness and observation of <b>patients</b> <b>right</b> in hospitals affiliated with medical universities in Tehran. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2009 in hospitals affiliated with medical universities in Tehran. A total of 601 patients were randomly selected from 11 hospitals affiliated with three medical universities in Tehran. Data were collected using a 50 -item questionnaire the validity and reliability of which had been confirmed. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. The software used was SPSS. 17. Results: The mean age of the patients (59 % females and 41 % males) was 43. 3 (SD= 18. 5) years and the average length of hospitalization 7. 1 (SD= 7. 4) days. Data analysis showed that the proportions of the patients with a poor, intermediate and desirable <b>patients</b> <b>rights</b> awareness were 71. 5 %, 22. 0 % and 5. 8 %, respectively. Observation of <b>patients</b> <b>rights</b> was good in 13. 8 % of the cases, medium in 82. 9 % of the cases and poor in 3. 3 % of the cases. There was a significant statistical relationship between observation of <b>patients</b> <b>rights</b> on the one hand and the hospital ward and length of stay on the other hand (p= 0 / 007).

This charter aims to elucidate rights of recipients of health services as well as observing ethical standards in medicine. This paper presents the Iranian <b>patient's</b> <b>rights</b> charter. Based on a study done from 2007 to 2009, the charter has been finalized through an extensive consultation involving all stakeholders, patients, physicians, nurses, lawyers, patient associations and health policy makers. The developed charter was adopted by the Ministry of Health in December 2009.

40|$|Summary Objective: <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> {{are defined}} as the rules of conduct between the people who benefit from health {{services}} and the health institutions and personnel who provide them.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the acquaintance and attitudes of working nurses in Corum/Turkey regarding <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> and to create the basis for a planned educational program. Methods: sample selection was not performed in this study, but all nurses (n= 939) who were working in the course of this study constituted the sample. Survey forms were used as data collection tools. Results: the study revealed that 92. 3 % had received education about <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> 2. 2 % had never heard anything about this term and 86. 6 % became aware of it through sources from outside of school. It was established that the attitudes of nurses regarding <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> differ for every patient and that this rate ranges from 35. 8 to 98. 1 %. Conclusion: there is a requirement for more studies on the subject of <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> as they play an important role in the development of health services.

40|$|Background: Nowadays, <b>patient</b> <b>rights,</b> {{particularly}} receiving favorable {{health care}} based on modern knowledge, informed consent, and privacy, are important issues {{in health care}} delivery systems. Organizational learning is considered an important factor influencing health care quality and <b>patient</b> <b>rights.</b> However, {{there is little evidence}} regarding this issue. Objective: The present study was conducted to explore the role of organizational learning in <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> from clinical nurses’ viewpoint. Design: This qualitative study was conducted through conventional content analysis. In total, 18 nurses who met the inclusion criteria participated in this study through purposive sampling with maximum variation. Data were gathered through 20 in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation was achieved. Data collection also included constant and simultaneous comparative analyses. Results: Data analysis led to four major themes: conservation of patient safety, providing favorable care, being the patient's advocate, and informing the patients. All the participants believed that organizational learning could {{play a vital role in}} respecting <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> and interests. Conclusions: Participants believed that their efforts to conduct organizational learning, tried to improve respecting the <b>patient</b> <b>rights</b> via conservation of patient safety, trying to improve quality of care, being an advocate, and informing the patient.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contents of <b>Patient’s</b> <b>Rights</b> Charter with those of the Holy Quran and Ahadith. Methods: To conduct this library, descriptive study, first, the principles of the Charter were drawn and then the Quran and relevant literature indexed in different databases were reviewed. Then, the points in question were written down, classified, and compared to those of the Charter. Results: In general, the principles of the Charter represented in nine terms which were consistent with several verses of the Quran and Ahadith.

However, not only the awareness the <b>patient</b> <b>right</b> is important but also moral sensitivity to ethical decision-making is crucial. This study aimed to determine the relationship between moral sensibility and attitude towards patients' rights. A descriptive-analytic study was used and 194 nurses working in intensive care units in hospitals affiliated to medical university of South Khorasan province were selected by convenience sampling method. The data collected through a questionnaire consisting of three parts: 1) demographics 2) the moral sensitivity questionnaire (Korean version), and 3) a questionnaire survey of nurses' attitudes towards the patients’ rights. Data collected by the software SPSS version 16, and were analyzed descriptive and analytical statistical tests. The results showed that there is a significant direct relationship between average moral sensibility and nurses' attitudes towards patients’ rights (r= 0. 6, P= 0. 03). The average nurse's ethical sensitivity has been reported 3. 05 ± 0. 68 0 f the total score (0 - 4). The average attitude towards the patients’ rights was 4 ± 0. 8 of the total score (1 - 5). The relationship between moral sensitivity whit the years of service and age of the participants was significant (P< 0. 05). There was also a significant relationship between the attitudes of nurses towards patients' rights with gender and years of service (P< 0. 05). In conclusion it is necessary to provide more moral education to increase nurse’s moral sensitivity towards patients’ rights.

Methods Seven patients who suffered from non small cell lung cancer concomitant arrhythmia, unstable angina and recent history of myocardial infarction had been carried out simultaneous radical lobectomy and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Preoperative 6 patients had been confirmed to be misfit for either coronary arterioplasty or stent implanting by performing the coronary angiography. One patient had undergone stenting before the lung cancer had been diagnosed.
