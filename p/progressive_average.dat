The objectives of the present study were to demonstrate the presence of Naþ/KþATPase in bovine sperm and to investigate its role in the regulation of bovine sperm capacitation. The presence of Naþ/KþATPase in sperm from mature Holstein bulls was demonstrated by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody developed in mouse against the beta 1 polypeptide of Naþ/KþATPase. Binding of ouabain to Naþ/KþATPase inhibited motility (decreased <b>progressive</b> motility, <b>average</b> path velocity, and curvilinear velocity) and induced tyrosine phosphorylation and capacitation but did not increase intracellular calcium levels in spermatozoa. Furthermore, binding of ouabain to Naþ/ KþATPase induced depolarization of sperm plasma membrane.

40|$|Overall, {{the federal}} tax system is <b>progressive.</b> On <b>average,</b> {{households}} with higher incomes pay taxes that are {{a larger share of}} their income. But barring legislative action, the numerous sunsets and phase-ins that Congress has written into the tax code will result in a tax system that {{is in a state of}} flux over the next few years. As a result, current law dictates significant changes in the degree of progressivity in {{the federal tax}} system between now and 2012. Almost all of the provisions included in the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts passed during the Bush administration are set to expire at the end of 2010, resulting in large scheduled increases in effective tax rates across the income spectrum. Because the Bush tax cuts were regressive, the largest increases will occur at the top of the income distribution and so the tax system will become more progressive in 2011 unless Congress acts. The stimulus legislation passed by Congress in the early months of the Obama administration contains several measures that reduce effective tax rates for low-income households making the system slightly more progressive. Those measures, including the Making Work Pay (MWP) tax credit, are in effect for 2009 and 2010 only, although the Obama administration proposes to make them permanent. If they are allowed to expire—as scheduled under current law—lower-income households will face large increases in their effective tax rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} research aims at developing {{more efficient}} replicable extension strategies for income generating innovations. The basic concept, theoretically founded, {{is to change}} the target groups for the extension service. Traditionally most progressive farmers are being approached to become first adopters of an innovation. The large majority of farmers (less progressives) is reached by a very slow diffusion process only and often the diffusion process completely leaves out {{a major part of the}} farmers. If less <b>progressives</b> (below <b>average)</b> are approached to become the first adopters, the diffusion process from them to the top progressives is very quick and the diffusion process among the target group itself is quicker and reaches more. This is founded on communication - and social stratification factors. The practical problem, however, seems to be the greater difficulty in making less, progressives first adopters. This problem could be solved by an appropriate package extension method already successfully tested in the "Tetu Project”. The only major problem with "Tetu", the very limited number of farmers which can be reached by this extension method, could be solved by taking the training out of the FTCs to the field and by approaching the farmers in groups. Summing up, the research therefore aims at: a) further testing of the new strategy, b) developing and evaluating methods of approaching farmers in groups, c) improving the replicability of the more efficient extension strategies and methods, and d) promoting their replication...|$|R

This study aimed to identify the healthcare costs of Taiwan's National Health Insurance program on behalf of diabetic patients with stable or progressive retinopathy. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 4, 988 medication-using diabetic retinopathy subjects ≥ 40 years of age under National Health Insurance Program coverage between 2000 and 2004. Study cohort subjects were recorded as having diabetic retinopathy according to ICD- 9 -CM codes. States of diabetic retinopathy were strategically divided into stable and progressive categories according to subjects' conditions at follow-up in 2004.

Here, we report a sequence variant in DEFB 126 that has a two-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame, which generates an abnormal mRNA. The allele frequency of this variant sequence was high in both a European (0. 47) and a Chinese (0. 45) population cohort. Binding of the Agaricus bisporus lectin to the sperm surface glycocalyx was significantly lower in men with the homozygous variant (del/del) genotype than in those with either a del/wt or a wt/wt genotype, suggesting an altered sperm glycocalyx with fewer O-linked oligosaccharides in del/del men. Moreover, sperm from del/del carriers exhibited an 84 % reduction {{in the rate of}} penetration of a hyaluronic acid gel, a surrogate for cervical mucus, compared to the other genotypes. This reduction in sperm performance in hyaluronic acid gels was not a result of decreased <b>progressive</b> motility (<b>average</b> curvilinear velocity) or morphological deficits. Nevertheless, DEFB 126 genotype and lectin binding were correlated with sperm performance in the penetration assays. In a prospective cohort study of newly married couples who were trying to conceive by natural means, couples were less likely to become pregnant and took longer to achieve a live birth if the male partner was homozygous for the variant sequence. This common sequence variation in DEFB 126, and its apparent effect of impaired reproductive function, will allow a better understanding, clinical evaluation, and possibly treatment of human infertility.

IRJs are regarded as sources of excitation for the passage of loaded wheels leading to high impact forces; these forces in turn cause dips, cross levels and twists to the railroad geometry {{in close proximity to}} the sections containing the IRJs in addition to the local damages to the railhead of the IRJs. Therefore, a systematic monitoring of the IRJs in railroad is prudent to mitigate potential risk of their sudden failure (e. g., broken tie plates) under the traffic. This paper presents a simple method of periodic recording of images using time-lapse photography and total station surveying measurements to understand the ongoing deterioration of the IRJs and their surroundings. Over a 500 day period, data were collected to examine the trends in narrowing of the joint gap due to plastic deformation the railhead edges and the dips, cross levels and twists caused to the railroad geometry due to the settlement of ties (sleepers) around the IRJs. The results reflect that the <b>average</b> <b>progressive</b> settlement beneath the IRJs is larger than that under the continuously welded rail, which leads to excessive deviation of railroad profile, cross levels and twists...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} {{choice of}} which “taxation regime ” to select (centralized versus decentralized, state taxes versus city taxes, European taxes versus national taxes, etc.) {{may affect the}} location decision and distribution of disposable income of consumers and producers, and may in turn {{be affected by the}} perceived mobility and by the initial conditions in terms of relative power of the various classes. In the case of the European Union, the increased mobility of citizens and the recent expansion of the union have effects on the taxation systems of the various states, and in turn the new conditions in terms of distribution of incomes and classes affect the likelihood of further integration steps. We are used to thinking that the level of progressivity of a tax system is mainly a political choice, reflecting the ideology and the preferences of the class(es) holding power. 1 On the other hand, we are used to thinking of the institutional choice “state versus federal taxes, ” “city versus state taxes, ” or “property taxes versus centralized funding of schools ” as mainly due to efficiency or freedom to choose considerations. This paper challenges the view that this issue can be separated, demonstrating that even if taxes are always chosen “optimally ” on the basis of standard utilitarian 1 Taxation is called <b>progressive</b> when the <b>average</b> tax rate (not necessarily the marginal rate) increases with income...|$|R

It also protects the fetus from the maternal immune response. Due to its role at the feto-maternal interface, the placenta is subject to many environmental exposures that can potentially alter its epigenetic profile. Previous studies have reported gene expression differences in placenta over gestation, as well as inter-individual variation in expression of some genes. However, the factors contributing to this variation in gene expression remain poorly understood. Results In this study, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of gene promoters in placenta tissue from three pregnancy trimesters. We identified large-scale differences in DNA methylation levels between first, second and third trimesters, with an overall <b>progressive</b> increase in <b>average</b> methylation from first to third trimester. The most differentially methylated genes included many immune regulators, reflecting the change in placental immuno-modulation as pregnancy progresses. We also detected increased inter-individual variation in the third trimester relative to first and second, supporting an accumulation of environmentally induced (or stochastic) changes in DNA methylation pattern. These highly variable genes were enriched for those involved in amino acid and other metabolic pathways, potentially reflecting the adaptation of the {{human placenta}} to different environments. Conclusions The identification of cellular pathways subject to drift in response to environmental influences {{provide a basis for}} future studies examining the role of specific environmental factors on DNA methylation pattern and placenta-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{different}} freezing systems (Styrofoam box and Mini Digitcool ZH 400) and storage volumes (0. 5 - and 0. 25 -mL straws) {{were compared with}} regard to sperm kinetics and plasma membrane integrity of frozen and thawed semen. For that, three ejaculates from four animals were frozen in Styrofoam box and Mini Digitcool ZH 400 machine. The 0. 5 -mL straws were thawed at 46 °C for 20 seconds, and the 0. 25 -mL straws were thawed at 46 °C for 12 seconds. Statistical analysis was performed using program R of descriptive analysis box plot, followed by analysis of variance using PROC MIXED of SAS 9. 1 package. Variances of 5 % were considered as different. There was no interaction between the straw sizes and volumes; however, statistical differences were observed between the semen storage volumes. The 0. 5 -mL straws had higher total motility (%), <b>progressive</b> motility (%), <b>average</b> path velocity (μm/s), straight-line velocity (μm/s), curvilinear velocity (μm/s), and rapid sperm percentage (%) than the 0. 25 -mL straws. However, plasma membrane integrity analysis did not differ between the two straws. Thus, {{it is possible to}} conclude that equine sperm cryopreserved in 0. 5 -mL straws has better sperm kinetics than when stored in 0. 25 -mL straws. Additionally, it is possible to conclude that automated systems that enable faster freezing rates result in a seminal quality that is similar to the one obtained by the conventional system using Styrofoam boxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{validity}} of magnetic granulometric estimates {{relies heavily on}} the ability to distinguish ultrafine particles from coarser grains. For example, populations with dominantly superparamagnetic (SP) or multidomain (MD) grains both are characterized by low remanence and coercivity, and distinguishing these endmembers may provide valuable clues to the origin of magnetization in the intervening stable single domain (SD) size range. The natural grain size variations associated with variable cooling rates in submarine lavas provide a rare opportunity for examining <b>progressive</b> changes in <b>average</b> magnetic grain size, from SP–SD mixtures in submarine basaltic glass to SD–MD mixtures in flow interiors. Based on microanalysis and rock magnetic measurements on pillow basalt samples dredged from the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ages < 1 Ma to 70 Ma), a model of preferential dissolution with time of the finest-grained titanomagnetites has recently been suggested as the major process contributing to long-term temporal changes in remanent intensity of mid-ocean ridge basalts. We evaluated the local and long-term temporal trends in effective magnetic grain size predicted by this model using hysteresis data from a large number of submarine basalt samples which span a range of ages from 0 to 122 Ma. Specimens were systematically taken along transects perpendicular to the chilled margin of each sample. The large number of data (750 loops) and the inferred progressive change in grain size approaching the chilled margin allow recognition of mixing trends between MD and SD grains and between SD and SP grains on a Day-plot.

40|$|The community’s {{knowledge}} and understanding of climate change is fragmented and confused by a myriad of conflicting information and political posturing. This appears to be largely driven by commercial interests about climate change and its causes. What is needed is a readable objective synopsis of the available evidence to date and an evaluation of the likely impacts to the community, industry and the environment. The reason why this information is now needed is that many parts of the eastern sea board of Australia have in the past 50 years recorded a significant and <b>progressive</b> decline in <b>average</b> rainfall e. g. Mackay 80 mm per decade (25 % reduction based on historical metrological records). Projected declines include a further 15 % reduction by 2030 and a further 40 % reduction by 2070. Annual average temperature has also risen at rates higher than previously recorded changes. Implications of this decline in rainfall include risk and reliability in water supply, land use changes, health issues for the aged, energy use, agricultural productivity, industry restructuring, infrastructure planning, conservation and biodiversity, and pest and disease issues. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to provide a practical and objective overview of what is known about climate change in Australia (with specific reference to Queensland) and what it will mean for business, the community and the environment. This pragmatic approach deals with the actual changes that are being recorded and the implications of these trends...|$|R
40|$|The life {{expectancy}} {{and the proportion}} of elderly is increasing worldwide and also in Slovenia. In this undergraduate dissertation, we concentrated on communication changes especially in people with dementia that result from normal aging processes. The changes themselves that result from normal aging usually do not have an influence on communication skills with the environment, except in patients with dementia where verbal and language changes may manifest themselves as the first signs of disease. With a decline in verbal ability the communication becomes more and more nonverbal in character, which is often misinterpreted by the environment. The research in this dissertation has been carried out using the Edinburgh functional communication profile (EFCP) by taking verbal and nonverbal samples in determining qualitative and quantitative communication characteristics in patients with progressive dementia. Eleven patients with progressive dementia from CSS Škofja Loka participated in creating the profile through unique individual meetings. A comprehensive analysis of the profiles showed that patients with <b>progressive</b> dementia on <b>average</b> communicate effectively, extend interaction, express themselves through verbal and nonverbal modalities and show a variety of communication functions. However, all of this is dependent on the stimuli and incentives that we give to each individual according to his or her characteristics. Taking into account that is that the same functional characteristics of communication do not necessarily mean the same approaches to therapy, we developed guidelines for approaches to speech therapy. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, it was {{frequently}} demonstrated that fertility of sows after artificially inseminated {{is lower than}} after mating. This {{is associated with a}} reduced fertilization capacity of overdiluted insemination doses. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sperm motility in the semen samples, forming from the ejaculates with high or low protein content, stored in vitro on 17 oC for 3 days. Progressive motility was significantly higher (p< 0. 01) in the ejaculates with high, compared to the ejaculates with low protein content (82 % vs. 76 %). After 3 days of storage, in the 1 : 4 dilution proportion, the <b>average</b> <b>progressive</b> motility was significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased in relation to this value in native semen from the boars with high (82 % to 64 %), as well from the boars with low protein content in seminal plasma (76 % to 48 %). However, the <b>average</b> diluted semen <b>progressive</b> motility was significantly greater (p< 0. 01) in the boars with high (64 %), compared to the boars with low protein content in seminal plasma (48 %). The number of good diluted semen samples (≥ 65 % progressive motility), was also significantly (p< 0. 01) greater in the boars with high (41 %), compared to the boars with low protein content in seminal plasma (12 %). These results show that seminal plasma proteins play an important role in maintaining the sperm progressive motility of diluted semen in vitro stored for 3 days...|$|R
