50|$|The band kept up {{the high}} pace and went into a frenetic {{rehearsal}} mode In January {{to prepare for the}} recording of their second album, which peaked with a show at Copenhagen Jazzhouse where Afenginn presented new material. ’Akrobakkus’ was recorded during February (read more about the recording here) and was released in April. The album was richly orchestrated and featured, among others, the cult actor Zlatko Buric as well as the gypsy cimbalon virtuoso George Mihalache. The basic tracks were recorded in Sweet Silence in Copenhagen, and after a week there the band moved on to the studio collective at Vibevej where Denmark’s most famous guitarist Aske Jacoby also came and went as part of the collective. Meanwhile, the bass player, Andrzej Krejniuk, decided to focus on his studies at the conservatory and left the band, and at a hectic time the band started looking for a replacement for the rather demanding bass role. One day, Aske was hanging around in the studio and was asked whether he knew a good bass player. He promptly answered: “Ask me!”. They thought about it, went for the offer and welcomed Aske as a new Afenginn member in April 2006. ’Akrobakkus’ got rave reviews and the band went on an extensive release tour visiting Denmark, Switzerland, Faroe Islands and Estonia. Later in the summer, they were invited to play festivals in Sweden and the big Dranouter Festival in Belgium. A big festival gig was a new experience for the relatively young band. It was a great success... until the <b>power</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> Fortunately, this happened in the sing-along part of “Andante Mobile”, putting the band at work directing the audience from the stage until the power came back on. When this happened, the scream from the audience was overwhelming, sending the band into a moment of communal ecstasy. After the concert, Kim presented the other members with his ideas for the band’s third album. This would be a concept album featuring the Finnish poet Timo Haapaniemi’s abstract syntax error poems in a home-made language, referred to as “street latin”. This would be sung by a male choir and orchestrated for Afenginn, obviously, and a brass band. In November, the long anticipated movie “Elgen kommer” (“The Moose comes”) by Jacob Remin premiered in Filmhuset in Copenhagen with Afenginn responsible for the music and some of the hype surrounding this poor creature.

40|$|The {{transmission}} line (TL) tower {{is an important}} component in electrical network system. These towers consist of members (angle sections) and connections (bolted connections) plus foundation, which act together to resist externally applied loads. The latticed towers are used to support conductors in transmission network for transmission and distribution of electricity. These towers are constructed in large numbers all over the world. The connections in electric TL classical latticed towers are peculiar compared to other types of bolted connections in buildings and bridges because (i) the angle members are connected directly or through gusset plates with bolts, (ii) the eccentric application of load due to the non-coincidence of centroid axes of angle members near the connection and (iii) members are designed as beam column element to sustain tensile or compressive forces. Bearing type bolts are used in TL towers in preference to friction type bolts, because they (i) connect thin walled angle members, (ii) are easy to use for erection at all heights, (iii) can be galvanized, (iv) erosion of galvanizing can be remedied and (v) do not require skilled personnel for installation. However, these connections are subjected to reversal of stresses due to wind load. Damage in the bolted connections generally occur due to loosening of bolts due to stress reversals (Feenstra et al. (2005) [23). The damage induced after extreme wind and earthquake may lead to collapse of the whole tower. The failure of a TL tower results in <b>power</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down,</b> which has huge impact on national economy. Hence, the structural safety and reliable performance of these towers are extremely important. The design of TL tower is based on minimum weight philosophy. The TL towers are highly repetitive and therefore, their designs need to be commercially competitive. The TL tower design has the following deficiencies such as misappropriate design assumptions, deficit detailing, defects in material, errors in fabrication, force fitting of members during erection, variation in grade of bolts, improper gusset plate detailing, notch cutting of member, vocalization of bolt holes, etc. Hence, to check the design and detailing aspects of members along with bolted connections and to study the behavior of tower under complex loading conditions, the prototype testing of tower is made mandatory requirement in many countries throughout the world. The structural behavior of TL tower is determined from its deflection response. Thus, the full scale testing of the towers is the only way that one can counteract the un conservatism due to structural analysis. The premature failure of TL towers occurs during prototype testing due to deficiencies in joint detailing, uncertainties in framing eccentricity, force fitting of members, unequal force distribution in bolts and gusset plate connections, etc. To have better structural response of TL tower to be tested, there is need to develop reliable model for bolted connections in TL towers. The bolted connection model {{plays an important role in}} determining the deflection response and predicting the premature member buckling failure of TL towers. The issues related to prototype testing of full scale TL towers such as fabrication errors, force fitting and notch cutting of members, application of loads, joint and crossarm detailing are discussed. The need to develop bolt slip model to simulate the actual behaviour of bolted connection in TL towers is also discussed. The bolted connections in TL towers play an important role in determining its structural behavior. The angle members used in TL towers are subjected to bi-axial bending in addition to axial load. The slip will occur in the bolted connections, due to the provision 1. 5 mm bolt hole clearance. In the conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the bolted connections are modeled as pin joint assuming the axial load transfer. The deflection predicted from pin joint analysis in TL towers generally does not match with experimental results. The analytical and experimental deflection value varies in the range of 30 to 50 %. Hence, there is need to develop model to account bolt slip for accurate deflection and dynamic characteristic prediction of TL towers. Experimental and analytical investigations have been carried out to develop and validate bolt slip model for bolted connections in TL towers. All six degrees of freedom (both translational and rotational) have been considered to simulate the exact behaviour of bolted connections in TL towers. The model is developed based on experimental results of Ungkurapinan’s bolt slip model for axial stiffness. The rotational stiffness is formulated based on the component level experiment conducted on lap joint made of steel angle with single and double bolt subjected to tensile loading. The axial and rotational stiffness for different stages of bolt tightening is also formulated based on component level experimental investigation on lap joint. The proposed model is validated by comparing with experimental results at sub-structural level on full scale king post truss subjected to tensile loading. Further the bolt slip model is validated for different bolt tightening and failure prediction of TL tower sub panel subjected to tensile loading. Finally the proposed model is also validated for full scale TL tower for deflection prediction. NE NASTRAN, a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) software is used for analytical simulation and the load-deflection predictions, which are compared with the corresponding experimental results. The experimental and analytical results are in good agreement with each other. The steel pole structures are replacing the conventional lattice towers, because they have smaller plan dimension and occupy less space, when compared to lattice towers. The steel pole structures are dynamically sensitive structures and the determination of their natural frequency is extremely important. For the calculation of wind load through gust factor method, the preliminary estimation of natural frequency is required. Hence, the primary step involved in dynamic analysis is the evaluation of its natural frequency. Hence, a simplified model is proposed based on model order reduction technique for the evaluation of natural frequency of TL towers and steel pole structures. For the development of base line model to detect damage in TL towers, the natural frequency has to be updated. A semi empirical approach is proposed based on the deflection by using the proposed bolt slip model. The proposed approach of updating natural frequency is validated for different cases of member damage in TL tower sub panel, such as removal of tension, compression and hip bracing members. The transmission pole structures accumulate damage during their service life. Damage in these structures will cause a change in stiffness of the system and the physical properties of these structures, such as modal frequencies and mode shapes. Hence in the present study, the damage localization study based on modified modal strain energy approach is carried out for steel pole structures and the location of damage is identified correctly. To prevent premature failure of towers during its service life testing and failure analysis of TL towers is a mandatory requirement. In the present study, forensic failure investigation of a full scale TL tower due to deficient design of a redundant member is emphasized and the remedial measures are explained in detail. The stub failure of TL tower due to reduction in cross sectional area due to unfilled bolt hole is also discussed. To investigate the effect of unfilled bolt holes on the compression capacity of leg member, detailed FEA is carried out and compared with experimental results. The reason for failure of 9 m roof top communication tower due to redundant member deficiency is also discussed. The importance of guyed tower accessories in the guy rope design of 7 m roof top guyed pole structure is also investigated. Finally, failure investigation of compression bracing member, which has failed during testing of TL tower sub panel has been investigated. The failure load is predicted by using the proposed bolt slip model in the analysis. Thus the overall research contributions emerging from this thesis are, i) development of bolt slip model accounting for rotational stiffness, ii) development of direct method of damage detection for steel pole structures based on modified modal strain energy approach, iii) development of simplified model for prediction of natural frequency of TL tower and steel pole structures, iv) development of model updating technique through natural frequency based on semi-empirical approach and v) prediction of failure load for TL tower panel using the proposed bolt slip model...|$|E
