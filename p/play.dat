5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the <b>play,</b> he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The <b>play</b> was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the <b>play</b> to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the <b>play</b> The Night is Young. After the <b>play</b> opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the current date.|$|E

5|$|Don Quixote in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second <b>play,</b> {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of Don Quixote in England.

It was his second <b>play,</b> and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of Cervantes's Don Quixote. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the <b>play</b> until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new <b>play.</b> Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the <b>play.</b>|$|E

30|$|According to {{the spatial}} {{relationships}} between reservoir rocks and high-quality source rocks, the tight oil <b>plays</b> {{can be classified}} into eight types.

5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with <b>play</b> stopping only when the ball has left the field of <b>play</b> or when <b>play</b> is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, <b>play</b> recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's seventh <b>play,</b> Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic <b>play</b> {{that first}} ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The <b>play</b> enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the <b>play</b> as it focused on mocking current news events. The <b>play</b> is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the <b>play</b> is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's thirteenth <b>play,</b> The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732.

Although early-20th-century critics believed that the <b>play</b> could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The <b>play</b> was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the <b>play</b> died soon after and the plot of the <b>play</b> discouraged new actors from wanting to <b>play</b> the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E

Tech {{returned the}} punt to its 21-yard line, where the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech's first offensive <b>play,</b> running back Maurice Williams broke free for a 77-yard run that took the Hokies inside the one-yard line of NC State.
