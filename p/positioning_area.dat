This approach turns out to be advantageous for the deployment of FP systems based on beacons equipped with inexpensive technologies, in which the measures precision loss could be compensated by larger numbers of beacons.

40|$|One of the {{research}} focuses in the integer least squares problem is the decorrelation technique {{to reduce the number}} of integer parameter search candidates and improve the efficiency of the integer parameter search method. It remains as a challenging issue for determining carrier phase ambiguities and plays a critical role in the future of GNSS high precise <b>positioning</b> <b>area.</b> Currently, there are three main decorrelation techniques being employed: the integer Gaussian decorrelation, the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) algorithm and the inverse integer Cholesky decorrelation (IICD) method. Although the performance of these three state-of-the-art methods have been proved and demonstrated, there is still a potential for further improvements. To measure the performance of decorrelation techniques, the condition number is usually used as the criterion. Additionally, the number of grid points in the search space can be directly utilized as a performance measure as it denotes the size of search space. However, a smaller initial volume of the search ellipsoid does not always represent a smaller number of candidates. This research has proposed a modified inverse integer Cholesky decorrelation (MIICD) method which improves the decorrelation performance over the other three techniques. The decorrelation performance of these methods was evaluated based on the condition number of the decorrelation matrix, the number of search candidates and the initial volume of search space. Additionally, the success rate of decorrelated ambiguities was calculated for all different methods to investigate the performance of ambiguity validation. The performance of different decorrelation methods was tested and compared using both simulation and real data. The simulation experiment scenarios employ the isotropic probabilistic model using a predetermined eigenvalue and without any geometry or weighting system constraints.

In addition, Received Signal Strength (RSS) based positioning is also investigated in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless networks, which is based on an industry project. In the first contribution, a physical resource blocks (PRB) allocation scheme with fuzzy logic based user selection is proposed. This work considers three parameters and exploit a fuzzy logic (FL) based criterion to categorize users. As a result, it enhances accuracy of user classification. This work improves system capacity by a ranking based PRBs allocation schemes. Simulation results show that proposed fuzzy logic based user selection scheme improves performance for CoMP users. Proposed ranking based greedy allocation algorithm cut complexity in half but maintain same performance. In the second contribution, a two-layer proportional-fair (PF) user scheduling scheme is proposed. This work focused on fairness between CoMP and Non-CoMP users instead of balancing fairness in each user categories. Proposed scheme jointly optimizes fairness and system capacity over both CoMP and Non-CoMP users.

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} operating hand-held power tools {{has been associated}} with various health consequences. The magnitude of HTV is strongly affected by the hand-handle interface coupling forces, handle geometry and gripping method apart. Assessment of the HTV exposure currently does not incorporate the impact of coupling forces exerted at the hand-handle interface, mostly due to lack of reliable measurement methods for hand-handle interface forces. This dissertation seeks to develop a low cost hand-handle coupling force measurement system and methods for quantifying the hand grip and push forces applied to the tool handles. A hand-handle interface force measurement system was developed using flexible force sensing resistors (FlexiForce). The static properties of the sensors were thoroughly characterized in terms of linearity, hysteresis and repeatability. Moreover, the sensors’ output characteristics were observed by considering the effect of <b>positioning,</b> <b>area</b> and flexibility of the loading medium used to transmit the applied forces. Five different cylindrical and elliptical instrumented handles were subsequently chosen to observe the input-output characteristics of the sensors under stationary and vibrating conditions. The measurements under static and dynamic conditions revealed good linearity and repeatability of the sensors, and affirmed their feasibility for accurate estimations of the hand grip and push forces. The sensors’ outputs also showed strong dependence on the loading medium’s area, position and flexibility as well as the length of the sensor suggesting the need for individual sensor calibration, which was noted as the primary limitation of the system. The effectiveness of the measurement system was further explored through measurements of hand forces on a percussion tool handle and biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm system. The measurement system provided reasonably good estimations of the hand grip and push forces when applied to the percussion tool handle under both stationary as well as vibration conditions. The biodynamic impedance responses measured with six subjects showed trends similar to the reference response. However, a compensation function was necessary and subsequently proposed to account for the limited bandwidth of the sensors. ...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{consistent}} radio {{maps for}} WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor positioning systems {{is an essential}} step to improve the performance of the positioning engines. The radio maps consist of WiFi fingerprints collected at a predefined set of positions/places within a <b>positioning</b> <b>area.</b> Each fingerprint consists of the identification and radio signal level of the surrounding Access Points (APs). Due to the wide proliferation of WiFi networks, it is very common to observe 10 to 20 APs at a single position and more than 50 APs across a single building. However, in practical, not all of the detected APs are useful for the position estimation process. Some of them might have weak signals at certain positions or might have less significance for a position’s fingerprint. Thus, those useless APs will add additional computational overheads during the position estimation, and consequently they will reduce the overall performance of the positioning engines. A similar phenomenon also occurs with some of the collected fingerprints. While it is widely accepted that the larger and more detailed the radio map is, the better is the accuracy of the positioning system, we found that some of the fingerprint samples on the radio maps do not contribute significantly to the estimation process. In this paper, we propose two methods for filtering the positioning radio maps: APs filtering and Fingerprints filtering. Then we report on the results of a set of experiments that have been done to evaluate the performance of a WiFi positioning radio map before and after applying the filtering approaches. The results show that there is possibility to simplify the radio maps of the positioning engines without significant degradation on the positioning precision and accuracy, and therefore to reduce the processing time for estimating the position of a tracked WiFi tag. This result has an important impact on increasing the number of tags a single instance of a WiFi positioning engine can handle at a time.

30|$|A {{variety of}} the {{positioning}} techniques for the URT have been developed based on measurements obtained from signal receiver, which is also denoted as access point (AP). The measurements mainly include time of arrival (TOA) [1], time difference of arrival (TDOA) [2], frequency different of arrival (FDOA) [3], received signal strength (RSS) [4, 5], angle of arrival (AOA) [6], and hybrid of them [7 – 9]. Among all the measurement parameters, the RSS-based positioning techniques are widely used for the advantages of no extra antenna arrays, no time synchronization limitation, and low cost. A large number of RSS-based techniques have been developed in recent years. Due to the RSS {{information that can be}} converted to distance estimates for constructing a set of linear equations, a well-known method was proposed by utilizing least square (LS) algorithm to estimate the optimal location of the target by minimizing the sum of squares of geometric distance errors between the target and AP [10]. Since the distance between the target and each AP is different, the estimated geometric distance error is not the same when using the channel model to convert RSS to geometric distance. In order to improve the robustness to the errors in the estimation of the geometric distance, weighted least squares (WLS) estimators were proposed in [11, 12]. However, due to serious signal attenuation and multi-path effect, the channel model used to convert RSS and geometric distance is not enough to accurately reflect the real distance between the target and AP in the actual scenario. Therefore, the positioning accuracy will be seriously affected. The RSS-based fingerprint positioning technique does not require accurate signal propagation model and estimation of parameters such as the geometric distance between target and APs. The process of RSS-based fingerprint positioning method is mainly divided into two phases: the off-line training phase and the on-line positioning phase. In the off-line training phase, RSS measurements are collected from different access points (APs) deployed in the <b>positioning</b> <b>area.</b> Then, RSS and corresponding location coordinates construct off-line fingerprint database. In the on-line positioning phase, the positioning target location is estimated by collecting the real-time RSS measurements and matching the fingerprint database with appropriate positioning algorithm. Two typical RSS-based fingerprint positioning techniques are RADAR [13] and LANDMARC [14], which are based on K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm [15]. The basic principle of KNN approach is to calculate the location of positioning target by averaging locations of K reference points with the minimum RSS Euclidean distance found in the fingerprint database. But the techniques mentioned above do not fully take into account the stochastic properties of measurement errors, and the Euclidian distance cannot reflect the geometric distance exactly. To solve this issue, the famous Maximum-likelihood (ML) [16] positioning technique was proposed to process the measurement information in the form of probability. In this way, it not only directly reflects the stochastic properties of measurement information but also achieve higher accuracy compared with the deterministic positioning methods [17, 18]. Nevertheless, the major problem of ML approach is hard to implement in practice because the ML cost function is highly nonlinear and contains multiple local minima and maxima [19]. Furthermore, ML-based algorithm is not feasible because of its high computational complexity.|$|E
