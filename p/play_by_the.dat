5|$|In 1913, {{writing on}} his own, Hesketh-Prichard created the crime-fighting figure November Joe, a hunter and backwoodsman from the Canadian wilderness. It was {{broadcast}} as a radio <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> BBC on 23 September 1970.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Clemson in {{the inaugural}} Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, Alabama announced in December 2008 they would {{return for the}} 2009 edition against the Virginia Tech Hokies. The Tide dominated play {{for most of the}} game, outgaining Tech in total offense by 498 yards to 155, but mistakes, penalties, and poor <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> special teams allowed the Hokies to hang on until 18 fourth-quarter points sealed the 34–24 Alabama victory.|$|E

5|$|Allah jang Palsoe was {{the first}} stage <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{journalist}} Kwee Tek Hoay. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his wife, Kwee was raised in Chinese culture and schools that focused on modernity. By the time he wrote the drama, Kwee Tek Hoay was an active proponent of Buddhist theology. However, he also wrote extensively on themes relating to the native population of the archipelago and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay, and drew on these readings after becoming a writer.|$|E
5|$|As a {{high school}} student at Chengzhong, Chen was {{influenced}} by the post-May Fourth surge of modern drama. In 1928, he entered Daxia University (a predecessor of East China Normal University) in Shanghai, where he translated, directed, and acted in The Rising of the Moon, a <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Irish dramatist Lady Gregory. It was the first Chinese production of the play.|$|E
5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted {{from his own}} short story.

5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Pacino {{worked on}} his {{personal}} project, The Local Stigmatic, a 1969 Off Broadway <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English writer Heathcote Williams.

The film was not released theatrically, but was later released {{as part of the}} Pacino: An Actor's Vision box set in 2007.|$|E

5|$|After the season, {{a number}} of Trojans were named as {{national}} award winners and finalists. Reggie Bush became USC's seventh Heisman Trophy winner with the second largest margin of victory ever. However, after the aforementioned NCAA investigation, USC would return its copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy, considering that Bush {{was determined to be}} ineligible to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NCAA. On September 14, 2010, Bush announced that he would forfeit the Heisman and return his copy of the trophy. Bush also won the Doak Walker Award. Despite not winning the Maxwell Award, he won two other Player of the Year awards. Leinart, who was voted third in the Heisman Trophy ballot, was named as a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award and the Maxwell Award, won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and was named by The Sporting News as their Sportsman of the Year. In addition, Pete Carroll was named a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, and Jarrett was named a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, though neither won.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Macedonia {{produced}} {{only a few}} fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, {{although there was no}} notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town is a <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English {{playwright and}} novelist Henry Fielding, first {{performed}} on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket. Written {{in response to}} the Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, The Author's Farce was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again {{in response to the}} Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including The Cheats of Scapin and Fielding's Tom Thumb.|$|E

5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing {{the game in the}} same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E
5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E
