Then came a piece of cheese and a quart jug with a crown of foam upon it.

50|$|While early mass {{production}} of guitars dramatically {{increased the number}} of guitars in circulation, each instrument was still handcrafted by a single or team of luthiers. For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand. Handcrafting guitars is a time and labor-intensive method of production.

50|$|The {{building}} originally included {{seating for}} 8,800, though standing room {{was sufficient to}} ensure that 9,500 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allocated {{a large number of}} the seats, including those in the lower sections directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987-1988 removed the standing room areas, added an electronic scoreboard and display over center court, wood paneling, brass railings and student seats, bringing capacity to 9,314, though now there is sufficient standing to ensure a total of 10,000 could fit into Cameroon Indoor on a very busy day. For high profile games, students are known to pack in as many as 1,600 into the student sections, designed for a maximum of 1,100.

50|$|Play {{continued}} with both teams attacking the other strongly. Gralton, Ward and Evans for Australia, made good passing combinations {{on a number}} of occasions. Cookson and Stout making notable plays for Britain, with Stout showing in one run: a remarkable feint, having to stop almost dead and then wheel round to hoax his opponent. Britain pressured the Australian line, with play coming to within five yards from the try line. Pressure was applied through passing the ball starting from Mullineux, and on to Cookson, Bucher, Nicholls, and Doran who was tackled well by Spragg. A scrum that was formed close to the Australian try line, was won by Australia, and Gralton cleared the ball to mid-field with a kick. Subsequent play shifted the attack to the British half. Here the Gralton, Ward, Evans combination brought Evans close to the British try line. A subsequent scrum yielded the ball to Gralton who forced his way forward, but he lost the ball. and the British cleared the ball to the western sideline. The relief was short lived, as the attack was once again brought against the British {{in the center of the}} field. Evans receiving the ball, made an unsuccessful drop goal attempt sending the ball high and wide of the goal. The ball dropped in front of the British fullback Martelli who overran the ball, having let the ball bounce. Australian players came rushing through and jumped upon the loose ball. The referee awarded the try, against the protests of the British who claimed that Kelly had illegally interfered with Martelli getting to the ball, as well as an off-side by the Australians. The reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that, From the <b>press</b> <b>table,</b> in the balcony of the members' pavilion, the interference appeared to be simply a jostle but it seemed hard to come to any other conclusion than that Kelly and Colton were off-side. The try scorer is officially recorded as Colton, however Kelly is in other places recorded as the try scorer. The conversion attempt by Spragg was unsuccessful.|$|E
