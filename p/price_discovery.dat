40|$|Major private {{corporations}} {{are among the}} principal actors {{in the world of}} mineral exploration. This study analyzes changes in the level and distribution of base and precious metals exploration by a number of large North American and European firms over the last twenty years. It finds that corporate exploration, like other forms of investment, responds to an interplay of economic, political, and technical factors influencing the expected revenues, costs, and risks associated with this activity. The level of exploration expenditure varies to a large degree with changes in overall expected returns, which are strongly influenced by changing mineral <b>prices,</b> <b>discovery</b> rates, and corporate goals such as diversification. The distribution of funds with respect to both commodities and countries tends to vary with changes in relative potential returns. In the first case, relative mineral <b>prices,</b> <b>discovery</b> rates, advances in exploration and production technologies, new exploration models, and corporate goals such as diversification are important determinants of change. In the second case, geologic criteria, particularly recent discoveries in an area, are the most important determinants of change; the importance of government policies and political risks, although not trivial, has been exaggerated. Accordingly, corporate exploration works together with material substitution and other forms of technologic change to offset the cost-increasing effects of mineral resource depletion...|$|R

Uncertainty about {{the preferences of}} future trading counter-parties causes randomness in future resale prices that we call liquidity risk.

The liquidity discovery process leads to endogenous joint dynamics for prices, trading volume, volatility, and expected returns.

2500|$|In {{determining}} {{the success or}} failure of a Dutch Auction, one must consider competing objectives. If the objective is to reduce risk, a traditional IPO may be more effective because the underwriter manages the process, rather than leaving the outcome in part to random chance in terms of who chooses to bid or what strategy each bidder chooses to follow. From the viewpoint of the investor, the Dutch Auction allows everyone equal access. [...] Moreover, some forms of the Dutch Auction allow the underwriter to be more active in coordinating bids and even communicating general auction trends to some bidders during the bidding period. Some have also argued that a uniform price auction is more effective at <b>price</b> <b>discovery,</b> although the theory behind this is based on the assumption of independent private values (that the value of IPO shares to each bidder is entirely independent of their value to others, even though the shares will shortly be traded on the aftermarket).

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} stock price {{reactions}} on selected stocks listed on Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) vis-à-vis the short selling announcements. On 28 th August 1997, the regulator of Malaysia re-impose short selling restrictions, there are 50 stocks which are restricted at this time. Subsequently, the regulator made the further removal of short selling restrictions announcement on 22 nd December 2006 which there are 70 stocks are being selected. Both events provide some implications to investors on the market reactions on the short selling announcement. It is argued that stock prices are biased upward if short selling restrictions are present. If short selling restrictions exist, investors {{will not be able}} to react on the negative information, thus, stock prices will bias upward. Conversely, it is claims that stock prices will bias downward if short selling activities are restricted. This is because short sales restrictions would reduce the speed of adjustment of stock prices towards negative information. In another words, removal of short selling restrictions will help to complete the market by permitting fuller <b>prices</b> <b>discovery.</b> In this study, event study methodology was utilized to analyze the stock price reactions. The results on 28 th August 1997 showed that the market reacted negatively towards the announcement of the re-imposition of short selling restrictions. This indicates that the market viewed the announcement as negative news. The second event which is being examined is the announcement on the further removal of short selling restrictions on 22 nd December 2006. The results showed that the stock prices reacted positively. This is the indication that the market viewed the announcement as positive news. Therefore, market completeness is coherent with the reactions of the market on this event. Overall, this study offers significant implications to investors. The results implied that the announcement on the removal of short selling activities is welcome by investors. The positive reactions on the announcement also indicates that there are more supply in the market hence it increases the liquidity of the stock market. Thus, the indications from the results in this study will enable investors to construct their investment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Discovering {{networked}} {{services in}} pervasive computing environments is problematic as multiple Service Discovery Protocols (SDPs), differing on their services description formats {{as well as}} advertisement and request models, have already become (de-facto) standards. This calls for a solution to SDP interoperability, enabling clients to locate networked services independent of the SDP they use to advertise their presence. In this paper, we report on our experience in developing two such solutions: the transparent approach of INDISS based on message translation, and the explicit approach of MSDA based on protocol integration. While efficient and able to support legacy clients and services, INDISS {{is limited by the}} basic service information available in existing SDPs, and assumptions about the network protocols used by the SDPs. Advanced discovery features required by pervasive environments, such as context or security management, can only be provided by more complex discovery frameworks like MSDA, but come at a <b>price.</b> Index Terms—Service <b>discovery,</b> interoperability, pervasive environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{international}} economic and financial crises highlights {{the need for a}} comprehensive framework to assess the robustness of national economic and financial systems. This paper proposes a new comprehensive approach to measure, analyze, and manage macroeconomic risk based on the theory and practice of modern contingent claims analysis (CCA). We illustrate how to use the CCA approach to model and measure sectoral and national risk exposures, and analyze policies to offset their potentially harmful effects. This new framework provides economic balance sheets for inter- linked sectors and a risk accounting framework for an economy. It also provides a new framework for sovereign capital structure analysis. It is useful for assessing vulnerability, policy analysis, risk management, investment analysis, and design of risk control strategies. Both public and private sector participants can benefit from pursuing ways to facilitate more efficient macro risk accounting, improve <b>price</b> and volatility <b>discovery,</b> and expand international risk intermediation activities...|$|R

Further operational realism is added by permitting differential interest rates on sovereign debt and financial assets. The approach is applied to Gabon, where oil reserves {{are expected to be}} exhausted in 30 years.
