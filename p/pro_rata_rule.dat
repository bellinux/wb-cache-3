40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} often causes {{injuries that}} occur {{over long periods}} of time. These “long-tail” injuries, which tend to span periods during which a liable party was covered by multiple insurers, do not map neatly onto standard indemnification insurance policies. As a result, liable parties and their insurers frequently engage in protracted litigation to minimize the portion that they must contribute to environmental remediation projects. In Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indemnity, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld an application of Massachusetts’s recently announced <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment <b>rule,</b> which greatly reduced the insurer’s liability. Proponents of <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment argue that it lessens the burden that indemnification litigation puts on court dockets and that it promotes environmentally conscientious business practices. This Comment challenges those claims and argues that <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment may actually undermine environmental remediation projects by limiting the amount of private resources available for them...|$|R

Insurance premiums are determined by no-arbitrage option pricing methods. The results are developed under the realistic assumption that the losses created by insurer default are allocated among policyholders following an ex post, <b>pro</b> <b>rata,</b> sharing <b>rule.</b> In general, the ratio of default costs to expected claims, and thus the ratios of premiums to expected claims vary across insurance lines. Moreover, capital and related costs are allocated across lines in proportion to each line’s share of a digital default option on the insurer.

40|$|We study a {{competitive}} multiline insurance industry, in which insurance companies with limited liability choose which insurance lines to cover {{and the amount}} of capital to hold. Premiums are determined by no-arbitrage option pricing methods. The results are developed under the realistic assumptions that insurers face friction costs in holding capital and that the losses created by insurer default are shared among policyholders following an ex post, <b>pro</b> <b>rata,</b> sharing <b>rule.</b> In general, the equilibrium ratios of premiums to expected claims and of default costs to expected claims will vary across insurance lines. We characterize the situations in which monoline and multiline insurance offerings will be optimal. Insurance lines characterized by a large number of essentially independent risks will be offered by very large multiline firms. Insurance lines for which the risks are asymmetric or correlated may be offered by monoline insurers. The results are illustrated with examples. 1...|$|R

In a friction-free setting, an insurance company covering multiple insurance lines can hold sufficient capital to guarantee payments of all claims {{since there is no}} lost opportunity cost to holding additional capital. In practice, however, limited liability and limited capital imply that insurers may fail to make the required payments to policyholders. Thus, in practice policyholders face a counterparty risk, leading t...|$|R
40|$|We {{had hoped}} that our recent article {{exploring}} a <b>rule</b> of <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> shareholder liability for corporate torts would spark renewed interest in the limited liability doctrine. Indeed, we concluded that article by inviting limited liability proponents to redress {{the balance of the}} argument. We therefore enthusiastically welcome the spirited defense of limited liability offered by Professor Joseph Grundfest in this issue of The Yale Law Journal and by his colleague, Professor Janet Cooper Alexander, in a forthcoming article in the Harvard Law Review. We predicted in our original article that the strongest arguments supporting limited liability would {{have little to do with}} the particular concerns of corporate law or the requirements of the corporate form. Rather, they were likely to rest on a belief that investors would be able to evade a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> liability regime, or that the difficulties of extraterritorial enforcement would preclude effective adoption of such a regime in any single jurisdiction. Judging from the arguments of our critics, our prediction was on the mark. For what these critics do not argue is as important to us as what they do. Although we take the criticisms of Professors Grundfest and Alexander seriously, we remain unconvinced. In this Response, we attempt to show that Professor Grundfest 2 ̆ 7 s description of the difficulties of enforcing a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> liability <b>rule</b> against public shareholders are less daunting than he suggests. We respond to Professor Alexander in greater detail elsewhere...|$|R

3000|$|The fifth {{equation}} treats principal prioritization. The equation {{requires the}} additional parameters α and β _ΔTS,M. It was constructed {{so that the}} first part of the equation is the same as the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case. Thus, the two additional terms in the equation for principal prioritization versus the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case determine whether the resulting levered equity beta is greater, less than or equal to the levered equity beta for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution, when equal inputs are used. As was mentioned earlier, β _ΔTS,M> 0 is a reasonable assumption for principal prioritization. Furthermore, for a positive risk-free rate the term τ×D/S×([...] r^c/R^c - α×r^c - r^f/R^f) is always positive. Assuming that β _U,M>β _D,M, makes the two additional terms positive. This leads to a levered equity beta that is greater than the one under the assumption of a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Currently, the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> {{method is}} widely used to price policy {{extensions}} and other changes to policy length. However, {{there are several other}} methods that an actuary can use in pricing policy-length changes, such as option and forward pricing, or modeling. There is little discussion in the literature about the relative merits of these different methods, leaving the pricing actuary potentially unsure of which method to use in a given situation. This paper seeks to resolve some of that ambiguity by identifying the features of a contract that would indicate the need to select a certain method over others. The goal of this discussion is to provide the pricing actuary with a framework {{that can be used to}} select the most appropriate method for the particular contract that is being priced. The paper then provides simple examples of how these methods might be applied in different situations. Finally, it compares the results obtained using the recommended method to the results from the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method, and points out the potential for pricing insufficiencies when the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method is applied universally. These results should encourage the reader to consider pricing techniques aside from the standard <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method...|$|R
