This paper investigates the use of ceramic tile polishing waste as a partial substitute for cement and sand in the manufacturer of concrete <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> A concrete mix design was defined and then the sand was replaced with wastes from three production lines (porcelain tile, porous tile and stoneware tile) of a Brazilian ceramic tile industry in the percentages of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 % and 30 %. Another group of concrete was produced with porcelain tile waste replacing the cement. The concretes were characterized using a slump test. <b>Paving</b> <b>blocks</b> were produced and subjected to compression strength, water absorption and porosity tests. Compression strength values were compared to Brazilian Standards for <b>paving</b> <b>blocks.</b> A reduction in slump was observed for all concretes as the percentage of waste addition increased, in relation to the control concrete. The compression strength values were higher for concrete cured for 28 days, and all blocks met the standard requirement of 35 MPa for light vehicle traffic at a curing age of 7 days. The strength values obtained when the porcelain tile waste replaced sand were higher than when this waste replaced cement, and those values were even higher than the control concrete, and met the standard requirement of 50 MPa for heavy vehicle traffic. Water absorption values tended to decrease as sand was replaced by ceramic tile wastes, due to the filler effect. These results show {{that it is possible to}} replace 30 % of fine aggregate or 20 % of cement with ceramic tile wastes and produce <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> suitable for use in heavy vehicle traffic.

40|$|Paving blocks are {{building}} material products that {{used as an}} alternative to pave land surfaces. Quality of paving blocks according to SNI 03 - 0691 - 1989 and BS 6717 was determined based on its compressive strength. But on field, {{it can be seen that}} the cracking pattern is different with the cracking pattern caused by compressive strength in the laboratory. Paving blocks tested by compressive strength, crack occured on around edge of paving while on the field, cracking occured across in the middle of the paving. Therefore, the BS EN 1338 recommend for testing of <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> quality by using tensile splitting test. This final assignment research for the quality test of paving using compressive test based on BS 6717 and tensile splitting test based on BS EN 1338. The testing of paving blocks used samples with a planned quality of 400 kg/cm 2 and 500 kg/cm 2 with dimension 21 x 10. 5 x 8 cm and the total sample are 128 paving blocks. Based on the result of testing, the <b>paving</b> <b>block</b> samples were able to fulfil the terms of BS 6717 and BS EN 1338 requirements. And also it is included in the first quality paving based on SNI 03 - 0691 - 1989. Keywords; <b>paving</b> <b>block,</b> compressive strength, tensile splitting test...|$|E
40|$|<b>Paving</b> <b>blocks</b> {{have been}} widely known as an {{alternative}} technology for reducing runoff discharge due to their infiltration performance and capability of retarding the flow. Surface configuration of the different <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> types and the openings area play important role in decreasing the runoff velocity. In this study, we investigated the surface runoff velocity on two types of <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> layers, and a smooth pavement as comparison. The <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> type were rectangular blocks, which have 3. 2 % openings ratio and hexagonal blocks, which have 6. 5 % openings ratio. We used a tilted plot covering area of 2 × 6 m, equipped by a rainfall simulator to accommodate the variation of surface slope and rainfall intensity. We measured the velocity by using modification of dye tracer and buoyancy method. The data were then tabulated and graphed based on the paving types and the surface slopes. Generally, the velocity-slope relationship has demonstrated {{that the increase in}} surface slope leads to the increase in velocity. In this study, the result showed that slope and rainfall intensity simultaneously influenced the velocity (F = 19. 91 > Ftable = 5. 14; P < 0. 05). However, {{the findings of this study}} showed a weak relationship between the changes of surface slope and the changes of runoff velocity on the rectangular blocks (R 2 = 0. 38). The greater slope did not always invariably lead to the greater runoff velocity. It was likely that there was other predictor variable that was not identified before, and need to be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} been conducted to analyze the tensile behavior of plain concrete. One of the most well-known methods, favored due to its ease in test set-up, is the cylindrical splitting test or the Brazilian test. Recently, {{attempts have been made}} to numerically simulate the concrete tensile behavior based on this splitting test method. Meanwhile, the question as to whether this case should be modeled as a plane-stress or plane-strain condition was looked into. The experimental testing was conducted in accordance to the ASTM C 496. Additionally, <b>paving</b> <b>blocks</b> tested in accordance to the BS EN 1338 : 2003 standard based on the same principals as the Brazilian test, were performed. The specimens were simulated by a finite element program constructed in Visual Basic language. The load-displacement responses of the laboratory tested specimens, namely cylinders and <b>paving</b> <b>blocks,</b> functioned as a validation tool to the finite element program. Beside proving that the developed program was correct, it was also concluded that the plain-strain approach represented a better outcome to the cylinder splitting test, while the plain-stress mode provided a better characterization for the <b>paving</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R
