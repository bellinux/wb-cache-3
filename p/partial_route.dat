In this paper, we investigate the application of Fisheris Extended Contract Net Protocol (ECNP) to our transportation domain. ENP provides a distributed and reactive approach to transportation scheduling that is fairly suited to this domain but has its shortfalls. This includes the inablity for TA to bid for <b>partial</b> <b>routes,</b> in addition to partial quantities, for a transportation task. A new protocol is proposed, based on ECNP, called the Provisional Agreement Protocol (PAP), which overcomes these shortfalls.

40|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>route</b> {{matching}} is {{the problem}} of comparing two routes — polylines consisting of sequential geographical coordinates — and matching them based on their proximity to each other. Even if a perfect matching is not found then the parts of the routes that do match must be identified as such. The proposed algorithm rasterizes the routes into two sequences of grid fields. These can then be treated like strings of characters and are matched using an approximate string matching algorithm. Its cost function is modified so {{it is based on the}} length of the routes rather than edit distance. Unlike characters, grid fields match if they are close to each other in the grid. Furthermore the basic algorithm is modified to allow a single “character ” to match multiple others. The complexity is O(mn), m and n being the number of grid fields in the rasterized routes. While these are dependent on the rasterization, it is shown that if the lateral grid size is bounded by the average line segment length, then the complexity is bounded by O(st), where s and t are the number of line segments in the routes. The algorithm is tested on a dataset made by GPS-tracking runners and cyclists and is found to be both feasible and capable of consistently producing the desired results. ...|$|E

By Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) we refer to transportation systems which apply emerging information technologies to alleviate congestion problems (see, for example, Transportation Research Board 1999).

40|$|The gradual {{decline in}} global oil {{reserves}} {{and the presence}} of ever so stringent emissions rules around the world have created an urgent need for the production of automobiles with improved fuel economy. HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles) have proved a viable option to guaranteeing improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The fuel consumption benefits which can be realised when utilising HEV architecture are dependent on how much braking energy is regenerated, and how well the regenerated energy is utilised. The challenge in developing a real-time HEV control strategy lies in the satisfaction of often conflicting control constraints involving fuel consumption, emissions and driveability without over-depleting the battery state of charge {{at the end of the}} defined driving cycle. Reviewed literature indicates some research gaps and hence exploitable study areas for which this thesis intends to address. For example, despite the research advances made, HEV energy management is still lacking in several key areas: optimisation of braking energy regeneration; real-time sub-optimal control of HEV for robustness, charge sustenance and fuel reduction; and real-time vehicle speed control. Consequently, this thesis aims to primarily develop novel real-time near-optimal control strategies for a parallel HEV, with a view to achieving robustness, fuel savings and charge sustenance simultaneously, under various levels of obtainable driving information (no route preview information, <b>partial</b> <b>route</b> preview information). Using a validated HEV dynamic simulation model, the following novel formulations are proposed in this thesis and subsequently evaluated in real time: 1. A simple grouping system useful for classifying standard and real-world driving cycles on the basis of aggressivity and road type. 2. A simple and effective near-optimal heuristic control strategy with no access to route preview information. 3. A dynamic programming-inspired real-time near-optimal control strategy with no access to route preview information. 4. An ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimisation Strategy) inspired real-time near-optimal control strategy with no access to route preview information. 5. An ECMS-inspired real-time near-optimal control strategy with partial access to route preview information. 6. A dynamic programming based route-optimal vehicle speed control strategy which accounts for real-time dynamic effects like engine braking, while solving an optimisation problem involving the maximisation of fuel savings with little or no penalty to trip time. 7. A real-time vehicle speed control approach, which is based on smoothing the speed trajectory of the lead vehicle, consequently reducing the acceleration and deceleration events that the intelligent vehicle (follower vehicle) will undergo. This smoothing effect translates into reduced fuel consumption, which tends to increase with increasing traffic preview window. Among other studies performed in this thesis, the fuel savings potential of the proposed near-optimal controllers was investigated in real time over standard driving cycles and real-world driving profiles. Results from these analyses show that, over standard driving cycles, properly formulated near-optimal real-time controllers are able to achieve a fuel savings potential within 0. 03 % to 3. 71 % of the global optimal performance, without requiring any access to route preview information. It was also shown that as much as 2. 44 % extra fuel savings could be achieved over a driving route, through the incorporation of route preview information into a real-time controller. Investigations were also made into the real-time fuel savings that could be realised over a driving route, through vehicle speed control. Results from these analyses show that, compared to an HEV technology which comes at a bigger cost, far higher fuel savings, as much as 45. 96 %, could be achieved through a simple real-time vehicle speed control approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an exact algorithm for {{a variant of}} the vehicle routing problem in which customer demands to be collected are stochastic. Demands are revealed upon the vehicle arrival at customer locations. As a result, a vehicle may reach a customer and does not have sufficient capacity to collect the realized demand. Such a situation is referred to as a failure. In this paper the following recourse action is then applied when failure occurs: the vehicle returns to the depot to unload and resumes its planned route at the point of failure. The capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD) consists of minimizing the sum of the planned routes cost and of the expected recourse cost. The VRPSD is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model and solved by means of an integer L-shaped algorithm. This paper introduces three lower bounding functionals based on the generation of general <b>partial</b> <b>routes,</b> as well as an exact separation procedure to identify violated cuts.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} approaches to reducing the routing overhead in mobile ad hoc network routing protocols is to reuse routes discovered for one packet to deliver as many other packets as possible. Numerous techniques have been developed to facilitate route reuse, including caching, overhearing, using <b>partial</b> <b>routes,</b> and replying to route discovery with cached routes. We term such reuses natural reuse, as they are passive techniques and do not cause any detour in routing data packets. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic P 2 P Source Routing (DPSR) protocol which imposes additional reuse of routes by exploiting the synergy between mobile ad hoc networks and peer-to-peer overlay networks. By imposing reuse of a route to a faraway common destination node among a set of nearby source nodes using localized communication, DPSR limits the number of the source routes that each node has to discover to OðlogNÞ, in contrast to the maximum of N source routes per node in DSR, where N is the number of nodes in the network. Our detailed simulations show that DPSR reduces the routing overhead significantly from imposed route reuse when many nodes communicate with one or a few other nodes. Obtaining the maximum benefit from imposed route reuse, however, requires sustaining traffic patterns beyond the capacity of current ad hoc networks. We conjecture that the full potential of DPSR will manifest as the capacity of ad hoc networks increases in the future from advances in physical layer technologies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithmic {{approach to the}} shortest path (SP) routing problem. Variable-length chromosomes (strings) and their genes (parameters) {{have been used for}} encoding the problem. The crossover operation exchanges <b>partial</b> chromosomes (<b>partial</b> <b>routes)</b> at positionally independent crossing sites and the mutation operation maintains the genetic diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm can cure all the infeasible chromosomes with a simple repair function. Crossover and mutation together provide a search capability that results in improved quality of solution and enhanced rate of convergence. This paper also develops a population-sizing equation that facilitates a solution with desired quality. It is based on the gambler’s ruin model; the equation has been further enhanced and generalized, however. The equation relates the size of the population, the quality of solution, the cardinality of the alphabet, and other parameters of the proposed algorithm. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithm exhibits a much better quality of solution (route optimality) and a much higher rate of convergence than other algorithms. The results are relatively independent of problem types (network sizes and topologies) for almost all source–destination pairs. Furthermore, simulation studies emphasize the usefulness of the population-sizing equation. The equation scales to larger networks. It is felt that it can be used for determining an adequate population size (for a desired quality of solution) in the SP routing problem.

40|$|Ad-Hoc Networks {{consist of}} {{peer-to-peer}} communicating nodes {{that are highly}} mobile. As such, an ad-hoc network lacks infrastructure and the topology of the network changes dynamically. The task of routing data from a source to a destination in such a network is challenging. Several routing protocols have been proposed for wireless ad-hoc networks. Most of these protocols, however, pre-suppose the presence of bi-directional links between the nodes in the network. In reality the ad-hoc network may consist of heterogeneous nodes with different power capabilities and hence, different transmission ranges. When this is the case, a given node {{might be able to}} receive the transmission of another given node but {{might not be able to}} successfully transmit to the latter. Thus, unidirectional links are formed. Most of the current routing protocols are unsuitable for deployment when such unidirectional links are present. We consider a routing protocol called the zone routing protocol (ZRP) that has been proposed for wireless ad-hoc networks with bi-directional links. The zone routing protocol employs a hybrid proactive (table driven) and reactive (ondemand) methodology to provide scalable routing in the ad-hoc network. However, in the presence of unidirectional links some routes remain undiscovered if ZRP is used. We propose extensions to ZRP to support its deployment when unidirectional links are present. In particular, we propose a query enhancement mechanism that recursively builds <b>partial</b> <b>routes</b> to a destination. Simulation results show that even at a high mobility of 20 m/s, the queries resulting due to the enhancement mechanism result in the computation of valid routes more than 80 % of the time.
