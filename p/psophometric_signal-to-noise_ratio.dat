30|$|In this work, we {{have proven}} the {{existence}} of an <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) wall for the eigenvalue-based maximum-minimum-eigenvalue (MME) spectrum sensing algorithm. The <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) wall is caused by uncertainty about the coloring of the receiver noise. A lower bound on the <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) wall is derived and is complemented by time and receiver correlation examples. For the example, we give concrete <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SNR) values, below which the maximum-minimum-eigenvalue (MME) detector is non-robust. Finally, numerical results supporting the analytical results are provided.|$|R

Analytic expressions for ultimate intrinsic <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> and ultimate intrinsic specific absorption rate are obtained for arbitrary sample geometries. These expressions are valid when {{the distance between the}} point of interest and the sample surface is smaller than the wavelength, and the sample is homogeneous. The dependence on the sample permittivity, conductivity, temperature, size, and the static magnetic field strength is given in analytic form, which enables the easy evaluation of the change in <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> and specific absorption rate when the sample is scaled in size or when any of its geometrical or electrical parameters is altered.
