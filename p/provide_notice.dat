25|$|The Court {{had last}} {{addressed}} the issue of notice in Dusenbery v. United States, , which held that the government need only take steps reasonably calculated to <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> even if actual notice is not achieved. The four justices who dissented in Dusenbery now formed the majority with Roberts in Jones v. Flowers, distinguishing the prior case on the basis that the government in Dusenbery did not know that its method of notice had failed before the taking occurred. Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, believed the Court was instead undermining Dusenbery, which he argued implicitly dictated a result contrary to the majority's decision.|$|E
25|$|Jones filed {{a lawsuit}} in Pulaski County Circuit Court against the Commissioner and Flowers, alleging that the Commissioner's failure to <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> of the tax sale and of Jones' right to redeem {{resulted}} in the taking of his property without due process. The Commissioner and Flowers moved for summary judgment {{on the ground that}} the two unclaimed letters sent by the Commissioner were a constitutionally adequate attempt at notice, and Jones filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and Flowers, concluding that the Arkansas tax sale statute, which set forth the notice procedure followed by the Commissioner, complied with constitutional due process requirements.|$|E

25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E

The notice must include the nature and location of each new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance was directed. It must also describe the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify the applicant's belief that each new surveillance place or facility under surveillance is or was being used by the target of the surveillance. The applicant must also provide a statement detailing any proposed minimization procedures that differ from those contained in the original application or order, that may be necessitated by a change in the facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed. Applicants must detail the total number of electronic surveillances that have been or are being conducted under the authority of the order.|$|E

"Taken together," [...] Reinhardt concluded, [...] "the {{regulations}} and the preamble may be reasonably read to <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> that vessels that engage in at-sea transfers of fins, {{are prohibited from}} landing shark fins in a U.S. port, {{but they do not}} <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> that such vessels are prohibited from possessing fins for the purpose of making a delivery to a foreign port."

2500|$|In a five-justice opinion {{delivered}} by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, the Court reversed the Arkansas Supreme Court and ruled that, under the circumstances, the State's sale of Jones' property violated due process. [...] It held that [...] "when mailed notice {{of a tax}} sale is returned unclaimed, the State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so." [...] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent, arguing that the State's attempts went beyond any requirements the Court's prior precedents had established.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the Court {{addressed}} the argument {{proposed by the}} Massachusetts and the amici that a finding for the petitioner would place a substantial burden on the courts. [...] The Court reassured respondents that [...] "the sky [...] not fall." [...] It noted that several states had already passed Constitutional statutes that satisfied {{the requirements of the}} Confrontation Clause. [...] Specifically, the Court held that the so-called [...] "notice-and-demand" [...] statutes require the prosecution to <b>provide</b> <b>notice</b> to the defendant of its intent to use an analyst’s report as evidence at trial, after which the defendant is given a period of time in which he may object to the admission of the evidence absent the analyst’s appearance live at trial" [...] and that these would be Constitutional. [...] These statutes are not a burden shift, but merely require the defense to invoke an objection prior to trial. [...] Notice-and-demand statutes are procedural and merely regulate the timing of objections. The Court also took note of usual practice of defense attorneys to stipulate to the results of drug analyses as a matter of trial strategy (e.g. not wishing {{to draw attention to the}} certainty of the results or draw the ire of the judge). [...] It reasoned that the practice would continue and the burdens predicted by the dissent and amici for respondent would not materialize. [...] The Court stressed that the requirements of the Confrontation Clause are [...] "binding" [...] and not to be disregarded.|$|E
