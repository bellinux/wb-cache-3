40|$|INTRODUCTION: In 2010, the Global Fund {{provided}} more than 75 % of external international financing for malaria control. The Global Fund uses performance based funding in the grants it finances. This paper analyses the indicators {{used to measure}} the performance of Global Fund supported malaria grants in Asia. METHODS: Indicators used in the <b>performance</b> <b>frameworks</b> for all Global Fund supported malaria grants in Asia were retrieved from grant database and grouped into impact, outcome, output and input categories and categorized by service delivery areas. Indicators of each group were compared over rounds. Indicators used in <b>performance</b> <b>frameworks</b> were compared with internationally adopted indicators included in the Monitoring and Evaluation Toolkit developed by the Global Fund and international technical agencies. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2010, 1, 434 indicators were included in the <b>performance</b> <b>frameworks</b> of the 48 malaria grants awarded in Asia, including 229 impact and 227 outcome indicators, 437 output and 541 input indicators, with an average of 29. 9 indicators per grant. The proportion of impact and outcome indicators increased over rounds, with that of input indicators declining from 44. 1 % in Round 1 to 22. 7 % in Round 9. CONCLUSIONS: Input indicators, which have predominated the <b>performance</b> <b>frameworks</b> of the Global Fund supported malaria programs in Asia have declined between Rounds 1 and 9. However, increased alignment with internationally adopted indicators included in the Monitoring and Evaluation Toolkit is needed to improve the validity of reported results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Performance {{indicators}} are a popular mechanism {{for measuring the}} quality of healthcare to facilitate both quality improvement and systems management. Few studies make comparative assessments of different countries' <b>performance</b> indicator <b>frameworks.</b> This study identifies and compares <b>frameworks</b> and <b>performance</b> indicators used in selected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development health systems to measure and report {{on the performance of}} healthcare organisations and local health systems. Countries involved are Australia, Canada, Denmark, England, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Scotland and the United States. Methods: Identification of comparable international indicators and analyses of their characteristics and of their broader national frameworks and contexts were undertaken. Two dimensions of indicators - that they are nationally consistent (used across the country rather than just regionally) and locally relevant (measured and reported publicly at a local level, for example, a health service) - were deemed important. Results: The most commonly used domains in <b>performance</b> <b>frameworks</b> were safety, effectiveness and access. The search found 401 indicators that fulfilled the 'nationally consistent and locally relevant' criteria. Of these, 45 {{indicators are}} reported in more than one country. Cardiovascular, surgery and mental health were the most frequently reported disease groups.

40|$|The Department of Building and Housing is {{currently}} developing a <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> that will, if adopted, provide a compulsory methodology for performance based fire engineering designs to prove {{compliance with the}} fire safety requirements of the New Zealand Building Code. The conceptual <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> currently includes eight design fire scenarios, fire loads for particular building uses, and tenability criteria for the life safety of occupants. As the level of fire safety within the Code is not explicit, the Department of Building and Housing determined that the <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> for fire should ensure buildings are designed and built to provide {{the same level of}} safety as if they complied with the current Compliance Document for New Zealand Building Code Fire Safety Clauses, C/AS 1. This work analysed 12 buildings with a range of uses, which comply with the current C/AS 1, using the conceptual <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> to provide a risk comparison for life safety. Accepted, previously established calculation and modelling methods were used to test the case buildings to the <b>performance</b> <b>framework.</b> None of the buildings met the pass criteria proposed for life safety. Consequently, to comply with the <b>performance</b> <b>framework,</b> a building would be required to be designed to a higher level of safety than {{is currently}} accepted to meet code. This shows the current proposal provides a more onerous design regime for fire safety for buildings than the current C/AS 1. The results of this research show the conceptual <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> for fire safety is not ready to be included into New Zealand building regulations in its present form. Furthermore, protection from fire for primary structural members and systems, to protect against building collapse, and tenability criteria and fire fighting access for fire fighters needs to be developed and included in the framework...|$|E

Marketing performance frameworks are comprehensive systems of marketing metrics to assess the performance of marketing activities, but according to studies, they are not widely leveraged by business managers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand marketing performance frameworks from marketing strategy, implementation and control point of views. The objective is to study the constructs as phenomenon, rather than as a process. The objective is to understand how marketing <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> should be linked with marketing strategy, which factors influence marketing implementation in terms of adaptation and standardization in local business units of MNC and what kind of control tools can be used to manage the marketing performance. The theoretical framework of the study consists of marketing strategy implementation and marketing <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> literature. First, marketing strategy implementation at MNCs is discussed in terms of factors influencing standardization and adaptation. Also the concept of marketing control and forms of control are introduced. Second, the concept of marketing performance frameworks are examined within MNC-context aiming at finding a link between marketing strategy and <b>performance</b> <b>framework.</b> The empirical part of this study is conducted following the principles of a single case-study method, since the research is conducted within one MNC. The focus of this study is on one particular marketing performance program of the case company. Four interviews are used as the main data collection method, but are supported by a number of unpublished materials. This study mostly supports the theoretical framework of the study. The marketing strategy and marketing <b>performance</b> <b>framework</b> should be aligned on financial, customer, internal processes, innovation and corporate culture levels in order to create a strong link between the strategy and measurement, which supports business managers’ strategic decision-making. MNC should aim at a standardized marketing <b>performance</b> <b>framework,</b> but allow adaptation on metrics when required. Factors influencing the adaptation and standardization supported in this study were: consumer preferences, customer needs, market development and conditions and the need for central control.
