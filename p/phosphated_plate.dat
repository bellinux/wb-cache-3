40|$|Transportation of CO 2 via steel {{pipelines}} from CO 2 {{sources to}} storage wells {{will be required}} in the capture and storage (CCS) cycle. However if the CO 2 stream contains contaminants, internal localized CO 2 corrosion could occur. Further corrosion protection is also required to transport fluids in the hydrocarbon and chemical process industries if such fluids are acidified by in-situ speciation of carbonic acid (and other impurities). In this context, we report the feasibility of nanostructured Cu-based Fe phosphate coatings as a protection system for the interior surface of steel pipelines in acidified environments. Cu-based Fe phosphate coatings were deposited on mild steel surface via chemical conversion and electroless process.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare {{clinical}} and radiographic outcomes of opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) augmented with either xenograft or tricalcium phosphate spacer for the management of medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) with genu varum. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, we prospectively enrolled 52 patients with medial compartment knee OA who underwent opening-wedge HTO fixed with locking Puddu plate and xenograft (n[*]=[*] 26) or non-locking Puddu <b>plate</b> and tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> spacer (n[*]=[*] 26). The alignment of the lower limb was assessed by measuring the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the Knee Society Score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, SF- 36 and European Quality of Life- 5 Dimensions scale. All patients were followed up at six weeks and at three, six, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. Clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 24 months post-operatively. RESULTS: All clinical scores improved significantly in both groups after surgery, without any significant difference between the two groups. Immediately after surgery, the HKA angle went from 9. 1 [*]±[*] 5. 2 ° in varus to 3. 1 [*]±[*] 4. 8 ° in valgus (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) in the xenograft group, and from 8. 5 [*]±[*] 5. 9 ° in varus to 3. 4 [*]±[*] 4. 2 ° in valgus (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) in the tricalcium phosphate group. At the last follow-up, the tricalcium phosphate group showed a significant loss of correction (P[*]=[*] 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: HTO performed with xenograft locking <b>plate</b> and tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> non-locking <b>plate</b> constructs showed good clinical outcomes.

40|$|The {{health of}} {{skeletal}} tissue is dependent, in part, on a balanced coexistence between two main cell types: osteoblasts, which form the mineralized structure of bone, and osteoclasts, which digest and break down bone. Communication {{between these two}} cell types is facilitated by osteoblast production of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa‐B (RANK) ligand and osteoprotegerin (OPG). The increased bone loss anticipated after long‐term spaceflight {{may be associated with}} the degenerative effects of ionizing radiation on this system. We hypothesize that ionizing radiation associated with spaceflight modulates RANK‐Ligand/OPG expression in osteoblasts, consequently altering the behavior of osteoclasts. To examine the effects of irradiation on mRNA levels of RANK‐Ligand/OPG, and subsequent effects on osteoclasts, we irradiate MC 3 T 3 ‐E 1 cells (osteoblast cell line) with 2 Gy of ionizing radiation and introduce RAW 246. 7 cells (osteoclast cell line) to the culture 1 day after.

40|$|Under {{conditions}} of phosphate starvation Escherichia coli can solubilize mineral phosphates, such as dicalcium phosphate, to orthophosphate {{which is then}} available for uptake and cell growth processes. lac operon fusions were created using MudX phage, and mineral phosphate solubilization (Mps) mutants were identified by their inability to solubilize mineral <b>phosphate</b> on <b>plate</b> assays. Four of these mutants have been mapped on the E. coli chromosome via Hfr matings and are located at two distinct portions of the chromosome; between 23 and 50 minutes and between 60 and 90 minutes. One mutant in each region has phosphate starvation inducible (Psi) promoter activity. One of these mutants (DB 1047) was mapped to between 69 and 75 minutes via F' matings, and fine structure mapped to 75 minutes by hybridization with λ clones from a genomic library of Escherichia coli. DB 1047 was characterized more closely and found to exhibit pleiotropy with regard to several membrane related traits. Evidence {{that this is a}} single insertional event comes from the simultaneous loss of all traits tested in spontaneous revertants. Additionally, a Tn 5 mutant was identified that was identical for these traits. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the mutation carried by DB 1047 is in the ompB locus. This locus consists of the two regulatory cotranscribed genes, ompR and envZ. This locus is involved in regulation of transcription of the ompC and ompF genes for outer membrane porin proteins, and is located at 75 minutes on the chromosome as is the DB 1047 mutation. DB 1047 lacks the outer membrane porin OmpF, a phenotype previously attributed to envZ mutants. However, the ompR 321 mutant resembles DB 1047 in reduced ability to solubilize phosphate. Additional supporting evidence for the DB 1047 mutation belonging to the ompB locus comes from the most recent report that mutations in the himA gene, which I found to be deficient in the ability to solubilize phosphate, also affect the regulation of production of the outer membrane porin OmpF...|$|R

Alginate and agar immobilization of the tested bacteria or coimmobilization of A. lipoferum 137 and B. megaterium significantly enhanced phosphorus solubilization for four consecutive 4 -day cycles. In a pot experiment, phosphorus mobilization in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv.

40|$|We {{generated}} Dictyostelium double mutants {{lacking the}} two F-actin crosslinking proteins alpha-actinin and gelation factor by inactivating the corresponding genes via homologous recombination. Here we investigated {{the consequences of}} these deficiencies both at the single cell level and at the multicellular stage. We found that loss of both proteins severely affected growth of the mutant cells in shaking suspension, {{and led to a}} reduction of cell size from 12 microns in wild-type cells to 9 microns in mutant cells. Moreover the cells did not exhibit the typical polarized morphology of aggregating Dictyostelium cells but had a more rounded cell shape, and also exhibited an increased sensitivity towards osmotic shock and a reduced rate of phagocytosis. Development was heavily impaired and never resulted in the formation of fruiting bodies. Expression of developmentally regulated genes and the final developmental stages that were reached varied, however, with the substrata on which the cells were deposited. On <b>phosphate</b> buffered agar <b>plates</b> the cells were able to form tight aggregates and mounds and to express prespore and prestalk cell specific genes. Under these conditions the cells could perform chemotactic signalling and cell behavior was normal at the onset of multicellular development as revealed by time-lapse video microscopy. Double mutant cells were motile but speed was reduced by approximately 30 % as compared to wild type. These changes were reversed by expressing the gelation factor in the mutant cells. We conclude that the actin assemblies that are formed and/or stabilized by both F-actin crosslinking proteins have a protective function during osmotic stress and are essential for proper cell shape and motility. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary Frizzled genes encode {{integral}} membrane {{proteins that}} function in multiple signal transduction pathways. They {{have been identified}} in diverse animals, from sponges to humans. Frizzled genes are well characterized for their functions in development and diseases. In this study we report the identification and characterisation of a Frizzled like protein in Dictyostelium. We identified a novel Frizzled like protein (FrzA) in the Dictyostelium database, which has a seven transmembrane region at the N-terminus but unlike other Frizzleds it lacks the CRD domain and instead has a Phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase (PIP 5 K) domain at the C-terminus. The FrzA gene is present on the chromosome 4 of the Dictyostelium genome. The expression pattern of FrzA revealed a single transcript of ~ 2. 5 kb in size in the northern blot analysis. To characterize the function of FrzA protein in vivo, cells carrying an inactivated FrzA gene were generated by homologous recombination. The FrzA- cells grew normal on a bacterial lawn or in axenic medium indicating normal pinocytosis as well as intact cytokinesis. However the cell size was slightly smaller when compared to the Ax 2 wild type cells. Notable was the defect in development on bacterial plates. When developed on <b>phosphate</b> agar <b>plates</b> the FrzA- cells did not form tight aggregates during early development. However the loose aggregates gave rise to very few and small fruiting bodies, which were formed with a delay of 24 hrs. Also, the FrzA- mutant exhibited a pronounced developmental defect when developed at low cell density, where the mutant cells did not aggregate or develop fruiting bodies. Northern blot analysis to characterise the developmental defect in the FrzA- mutant showed expression of genes expressed early in aggregation such as csA; cAR 1, ACA, PDE and PDI. However, the pattern was strongly altered and showed prolonged expression in case of CAR 1 nad PDE and delayed expression for ACA and csA. The mutant cells did not exhibit a directed migration towards cAMP and thus showing a defect in chemotaxis. However, application of the exogenous cAMP pulses restored the expression of contact sites A and adenylyl cyclase (ACA) transcripts necessary for aggregation and also rescued the defect in chemotaxis. Calcium oscillation, which is important for initiating aggregation and further development, was disturbed in the mutant. We could show that the FrzA- mutant did not sense the cell density factor (CMF) and produce IP 3 in response to the CMF stimulation. We therefore presume that FrzA is involved in the early steps of aggregation during Dictyostelium development. Our results indicate that FrzA is a potential G protein coupled receptor for the ligand CMF to induce the CMF signaling during the early development of Dictyostelium...|$|R

As regards nsp 14, the protein was expressed in E. coli origami B as inclusion bodies, which became soluble in sarkosyl-containing CAPS buffer (pH 11). Nonetheless, we failed to obtain refolded protein with expected activity even though great deals of refolding approach were launched. Coexpression with chaperone proteins (GroEL, GroES, and tig) helped to get some soluble nsp 14. Preliminary data suggest that the soluble viral protein could hydrolyze RNA substrate.

40|$|Agricultural systems {{depend on}} {{continued}} inputs of phosphate fertiliser to maintain productivity. However, due to ever increasing global demand, the finite reserves of phosphate rock are being rapidly depleted. This {{is compounded by}} the fact that half of the soluble phosphate in fertiliser applied to soil is converted to sparingly-soluble minerals such as calcium phosphate which are unavailable for plant uptake. It is therefore important to investigate strategies that will improve the utilisation of phosphate in soil-plant systems. While it has been demonstrated that phosphate-solubilising bacteria can utilise sparingly-soluble phosphate minerals in soil, the mechanisms by which this occur remain unclear. In this project, 105 rhizobacteria were assessed for a number of plant growth-promoting traits, such as production of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate deaminase, phytase, and inorganic <b>phosphate</b> solubilisation using <b>plate</b> screening assays. Ten of the most effective phosphate-solubilising isolates were further assessed using an in vitro hydroxyapatite liquid culture assay. Analysis of culture filtrates revealed that the effective phosphate-solubilising isolates, Pseudomonas spp. and Burkholderia sp., were predominantly secreting 2 -keto-gluconic acid rather than the expected gluconic acid. In addition, a yet to be characterised organic acid was secreted by several Pseudomonas spp. strains which may also be involved in phosphate solubilisation. In an attempt to identify novel genes involved in phosphate solubilisation, three isolates of different bacterial genera, Enterobacter sp. Wi 28, Pseudomonas sp. Ha 200 and Burkholderia sp. Ha 185, derived from diverse geographic locations were subjected to random transposon mutagenesis. This enabled the identification of two unique uncharacterised genes from Burkholderia sp. Ha 185. One mutant, hemX::Tn 5 (F 18), with a mutation in hemX gene involved in haem biosynthesis, exhibited an almost complete abolition in hydroxyapatite solubilisation. The second mutant bxpC::Tn 5 (F 13) exhibited partial and delayed solubilisation. The translated product of the bxpC gene encodes a novel hypothetical protein with unknown function. However, based on a combination of organic acid, qRT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis, it is hypothesised that BxpC is a potential cargo protein involved in protection and transport of the calcium bound 2 -ketogluconic acid compound. Through the use of a Burkholderia sp. Ha 185 GFP-tagged strain in conjunction with a gnotobiotic in vivo plant assay developed in this study, the colonisation pattern of Burkholderia sp. Ha 185 and its derivatives on ryegrass roots over three week duration was defined. The preliminary characterisation of the bxpC and hemX identified in the study and defining the interaction of Burkholderia sp. Ha 185 on the plant root provides a greater understanding of phosphate cycling by bacteria and its relationship to the plant. The novel pathways and findings of this study have provided further insights into the underlying mechanisms of inorganic phosphate solubilisation in soil-plant systems...|$|R

Based on the high energy demand of using reverse osmosis at high salt concentrations and concerns surrounding mineral scaling, a hybrid approach was developed. This hybrid process combined pressure driven reverse osmosis (RO) to process the stream with lower salinity, thermal membrane distillation (MD), to recover fresh water from the high salt concentrate stream, and crystallisation of bulk salt from the final brine. The salt rejection of the RO polyamide membrane was affected by the pH, or specifically the concentration of hydronium (H 3 O+) or hydroxide (OH-) ions. These ions influenced the surface charge and swelling behavior of the polyamide active layer. Despite the high rejection of sodium chloride (NaCl), the rejection of these small mobile ions reached negative values of approximately - 400 % and - 100 % for H 3 O+ and OH-, respectively. A significant increase in H 3 O+ or OH- flux was observed with increasing permeate water flux through the membrane. This behavior was described using the extended Nernst Planck equation (ENP) by taking into consideration the effect of convection, diffusion and electromigration. The Donnan-Steric partition coefficient {{was used to determine}} the concentration at the membrane surface. The model showed that with higher concentrations of NaCl in the feed stream, increasing amounts of counter-ion passed through the membrane. This was followed by the passage of a high mobility co-ion to maintain the electroneutrality within the solution. This mechanism resulted in the negative rejection of the high mobility co-ion. Recovering fresh water using MD was a viable option for the high salinity level stream recovered from the RO step. When trace amounts of protein were present in the system, liquid penetration could not be avoided during operation using a 0. 45 µm PTFE membrane. Enhancement of cross flow velocity and turbulence could increase the mass transfer coefficient and product recovery, at a cost of increasing pressure drop along the channel filled spacer. At a cross-flow velocity 0. 27 m/s, the pressure drop observed was greater than the liquid entry pressure (LEP) of the system, resulting in pore penetration. At the end of the concentration process, the final solid concentration was limited to 30 wt% despite the enhancement of mass transfer. The solubility limit of the calcium phosphate in the salt concentrate was assessed using dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DPCD) as the starting material. With increasing background ionic strength (NaCl), the activity coefficient of both calcium and phosphate ions decreased, resulting in the increased solubility of the aforementioned ions. Beyond 1 M ionic strength, the reverse behavior was shown as the solubility of both calcium and phosphate started to fall. This observation was in agreement with the prediction of the activity coefficient using Pitzer thermodynamic equations. As the temperature increased from 10 - 50 oC, a solubility increase of both ions was observed which was also in agreement with the prediction of ionic activity. Bulk precipitation of salts from concentrated dairy effluent showed the opposite behaviour. The induction time before precipitation occurred showed an exponential decrease from approximately 17 hours at 10 oC down to 2 hours at 70 oC at 30 wt% final solids concentration. This reflected the dominance of crystallisation kinetics, rather than equilibria. During precipitation of the real solution, the morphology of the calcium <b>phosphate</b> varied, with <b>plate,</b> flake and aggregate amorphous structures observed. The induction time could be reduced by applying ultrasound technology. Applying low power and low frequency ultrasound with 7. 3 J/g energy density increase the reproducibility and shortened the induction time down to 15 hours and 0. 5 hours at 10 oC and 70 oC, respectively. Increasing the duration of sonication had only a marginal impact on this induction time. However, a further reduction of induction time could be attained through the application of an intermediate pulse 10 minutes after the initial pulse. This second pulse disrupted the crystal growth, creating a greater population of surface templates and enhancing the mass transfer of growth units towards the growing surface. The outcome of this thesis provide {{a better understanding of the}} utilisation of hybrid processes including reverse osmosis, membrane distillation and crystallisation for processing a broad range of saline stream concentrations with a reasonable energy demand. Moreover, the precipitation study in this work provide useful knowledge to assist in fouling mitigation, which could benefit not only the dairy industry but also a broader range of water treatment industries.
