25|$|This {{was in part}} {{facilitated}} by improved transportation in the area. The Crane and Thomas Iron Companies wanted a railroad to bring local ore to their furnaces, but faced strong local opposition when attempting to gain a charter. As a compromise, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road corporation was chartered on July 2, 1853, to build a plank road from the ore pits to the furnaces. A short section of plank road was constructed, but the exceptional weight of the ore wagons quickly destroyed it. Renewed efforts to <b>palliate</b> the local farmers were successful, and the plank road was renamed and rechartered on April 20, 1854 as the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad. The C began hauling ore from the mines near Fogelsville in 1857. In 1864, it was further extended to a connection with the East Pennsylvania Railroad at Alburtis and in 1865, to the magnetite mines at Rittenhouse Gap. Improvements to the physical plant also occurred, building No. 6 stack in 1868. The company survived the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent poor iron market, and No. 5 stack was rebuilt in 1877, introducing new firebrick heat exchangers (stoves) to heat the blast, rather than the iron pipes heretofore used. No. 3 stack collapsed in 1879 while out of blast, and Nos. 1 and 2 were subsequently demolished. A new No. 1 and 3 were built, and the site of No. 2 used for stoves for the new furnaces, which were built in 1880 and put in service in 1881.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare all {{in-hospital}} mortality for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) before and after the establishment of an emergency EVAR (eEVAR) service. Design and methodsAn eEVAR service was established in January 2006, since when all patients presenting with rAAAs have been considered for endovascular repair. Data for all rAAAs presenting between January 2006 and December 2007 was prospectively collected (Group 1). This patient group was compared to those presenting with rAAA between January 2003 and December 2005 when eEVAR was not offered at our institution (Group 2). These records had also been collected prospectively and submitted to the National Vascular Database (NVD). ResultsA total of 50 rAAAs (17 eEVAR, 29 open repairs, 4 <b>palliated)</b> presented after the introduction of eEVAR (Group 1) and 71 in the historical Group 2 of which 54 underwent open repair and 17 were <b>palliated.</b> The total in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in Group 1 20 % (eEVAR (n= 1), 6 %: Open (n= 5), 17 %: <b>palliated</b> (n= 4), 100 %) when compared to Group 2 54 % (Open (n= 21), 39 %: <b>palliated</b> (n= 17), 100 %) (p= 0. 000001). Furthermore similar significant differences were seen in 30 -day operative mortalities between the two groups 13 % in Group 1 versus 39 % in Group 2 (p= 0. 0003). In addition the proportion of patients who were <b>palliated</b> has significantly decreased (8 % Group 1 versus 24 % Group 2, p= 0. 01).

2500|$|Medical {{therapy for}} {{nutcracker}} esophagus includes {{the use of}} calcium-channel blockers, which relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and <b>palliate</b> the dysphagia symptoms. [...] Diltiazem, a calcium-channel blocker, {{has been used in}} randomized control studies with good effect. [...] Nitrate medications, including isosorbide dinitrate, given before meals, may also help relax the LES and improve symptoms. [...] The inexpensive generic combination of belladonna and phenobarbital (Donnatal and other brands) may be taken three times daily as a tablet to prevent attacks or, for patients with only occasional episodes, as an elixir at the onset of symptoms. [...] Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil, can be given to reduce symptoms, particularly pain, but small trials {{have not been able to}} demonstrate clinical improvement. [...] Finally, trazodone, an antidepressant that reduces visceral sensitivity, has also been shown to reduce chest pain symptoms in patients with nutcracker esophagus.|$|E
