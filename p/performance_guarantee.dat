40|$|Abstract. Fair-queuing schedulers provide {{clients with}} {{bandwidth}} or latency guarantees provided they are well-behaved i. e. the requested service is always within strict predefined limits. Violation {{of the service}} bounds results in nullification of the <b>performance</b> <b>guarantees</b> of the misbehaving client. In this paper we relax this notion of good behavior and present a generalized service model that takes the current system load into consideration. Consequently clients may opportunistically consume more than their contracted service without losing future <b>performance</b> <b>guarantees,</b> if doing so will not penalize well-behaved clients. We present a new algorithm RFQ (Redemptive Fair Queuing) along with a generalized traffic model called the Deficit Token Bucket (DTB). RFQ incorporates the notion of redemption, whereby a misbehaving client may be rejuvenated and regain its <b>performance</b> <b>guarantees.</b> We characterize the conditions for rejuvenating a client, and prove that RFQ meets its <b>performance</b> <b>guarantees</b> in the DTB model. ...|$|R

In particular, the <b>performance</b> <b>guarantees</b> obtained here separate the properties required of the measurement matrix from the properties required of the signal, which depends critically on the minimum {{signal to noise ratio}} rather than the power profiles of the signal.
