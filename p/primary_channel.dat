5|$|Quotas on high {{definition}} content — {{a minimum of}} 1040 hours per year — were imposed by the Australian government in July 2003 on broadcasters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The same requirement was extended in April 2005 to stations in Darwin, regional New South Wales and regional Queensland, and in January 2006 in Mildura. As of 13 July 2007 commercial television networks in Australia were permitted to provide a separate standard definition and {{high definition}} channel. As of January 2009, they were permitted 2 standard definition channels {{in addition to the}} high definition channel — the networks planned to launch these via Freeview (Australia). However, in August 2015, the government finally lifted the SD <b>Primary</b> <b>Channel</b> mandate, allowing broadcasters to simulcast their respective main channel programmes in high definition.|$|E

In this case, the secondary mobiles are in competition.

30|$|When an SU senses more {{channels}} in PU band it consumes more energy. The energy conservation during the sensing phase requires that fewer {{channels in}} the PU band be sensed. But {{at the same}} time, it is desirable that collectively all SUs sense all the <b>primary</b> <b>channels</b> to maximize the pool of idle channels available to SUs. In the proposed parallel sensing scheme, the energy conservation {{can be achieved by}} forming more SU groups. When we cerate more SU groups, then it implies that every SU has to sense less number of <b>primary</b> <b>channels,</b> thus saving energy during the parallel sensing phase. For example, if there are 5 SU groups in the CRN then <b>primary</b> band <b>channels</b> are also divided into 5 portions and each group has the onus of only 1 / 5 th of the band, thus saving the SU energy by a factor of 5.|$|R

The comprehensive performance of the offset-bubble <b>primary</b> surface <b>channel</b> with the baseline dimension is superior to the CC 4 - 45 (pitch-over-height ratio of 4 and inclined angle of 45 °) and CC 3. 1 - 60 <b>primary</b> surface <b>channels.</b> The geometrical parameter studies indicate that variation of the comprehensive performance is very small when the wave length is greater than 18 mm {{and the effect of}} wave height is very small...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing, {{which can}} profoundly improve {{the ability of}} discovering the spectrum opportunities, is regarded as an enabling mechanism for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). One {{of the most fundamental}} problems in cooperative spectrum sensing is how to assign Secondary Users (SUs) to sense different <b>primary</b> <b>channels</b> such that SUs can achieve a good balance between sensing accuracy and the exploration of potential spectrum holes. This problem becomes more challenging when the <b>primary</b> <b>channels</b> require heterogeneous detection probabilities for incumbent protection. In this paper, the Cooperative Sensing Scheduling with QoS guarantee (CSS-Q) problem is studied for designing energy-efficient CRNs. We first explore the inherent structure of the CSS-Q problem and find several useful properties for it. Then, based on these properties a novel and efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Sufficient numerical results are also presented to validate our analysis. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

30|$|In CRSNs, {{secondary}} {{users can}} share the spectrum with primary users by adopting {{one of the}} two known modes: overlay and underlay modes. In overlay mode, secondary users can access radio resources (i.e., channels) owned by the primary network only if the <b>primary</b> <b>channels</b> are idle. However, for some wireless broadcast services such as TV and FM radio, the <b>primary</b> <b>channels</b> may be busy most of the time and secondary users may be unable to access these channels opportunistically. On the other hand, in underlay mode, secondary users can concurrently access the channels owned by the primary network, provided that the resulted interference at primary users remains below a predefined threshold value [4]. Operating on this mode may become challenging for secondary users in densely deployed area since these users will cause more interference to closely located primary users. Therefore, we need to find substitute techniques to solve this problem and enhance the performance of the secondary system.|$|R
