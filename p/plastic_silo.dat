40|$|Silage is the {{feedstuff}} {{resulted from}} the preservation of forages through lactic acid fermentation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nutritive value, fermentation characteristics and nutrients digestibility of rice crop residue based silage ensiled with epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The mixture of rice crop residue (RC), soybean curd residue (SC) and cassava waste (CW) in a 90 : 5 : 5 (on dry matter basis) ratio was used as silage material. Three treatments silage were (A) RC + SC + CW as a control; (B) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculums from rice crop residue; (C) RC + SC + CW + LAB inoculums from king grass. Silage materials were packed into <b>plastic</b> <b>silo</b> (1. 5 kg capacity) and stored for 30 days. The results showed that crude protein content in B and C silage was higher than that of silage A, but NDF content in silages B and C was lower than that of silage A. Lactic acid concentration was higher (P < 0. 01) in silage C compared to silage B and A, thus pH value of silage C was lower (P < 0. 01) than silage B and A. Silage C had the highest Fleigh point than that of other silages. Dry matter and organic matter digestibilities were higher in silages B and C (P < 0. 01) than that of control silage. It was concluded that the addition of LAB inoculums from king grass to rice crop residue based silage resulted a better fermentation quality compared to LAB inoculums from rice crop residue...|$|E
40|$|Forage {{shortage}} {{may force}} producers to feed unfermented or partially fermented forages, {{which are more}} susceptible to aerobic deterioration. Propionic acid-based additives can be added to ensiled forages to inhibit yeast and mold growth, and improve the aerobic stability of silages. The objectives of this study were {{to determine the effects of}} a propionic acid-based silage additive (Solution Foin) on ensiling characteristics, aerobic stability and feeding value of short-term ensiled corn forage. Chopped whole corn was left untreated or treated with Solution Foin (contains 700 g kg- 1 propionic acid and 300 g kg- 1 NH 4 OH). The additive was added to forage prior ensiling at a rate of 5 L ton- 1 (wet basis). Treated and untreated forages were placed in six <b>plastic</b> <b>silo</b> bags (three each). Silo bags were opened one day after ensiling and daily samples were collected for 30 consecutive days. Effects on animal performance of feeding treated or untreated forage were determined in a completely randomized design, using 30 lactating cows (178 +/- 55 days in milk) fed total mixed ration (50 : 50 forage: concentrate) with the major forage portion consisting of untreated or treated forage. The feeding study started one day post-ensiling. Results showed that Solution Foin reduced (P < 0. 05) yeast and mold populations between d 5 and 14 post-ensiling. The highest differences (P < 0. 002) were observed on d 10, at which point yeast and mold populations for untreated silage were 7. 86 and 2. 51 log cfu g- 1, respectively. The corresponding values for treated silage were 4. 35 and 0. 00 log cfu g- 1, respectively. Aerobic stability of treated ensiled forage was also improved (P < 0. 01) from day 0 (by 159 h) to day 10 (by 33 h) post-ensiling. Solution Foin also increased (P < 0. 05) the overall lactic acid and WSC content, and lowered the temperature of the treated ensiled forage in the field. No treatment differences were detected in the forage pH and acetic acid concentration. Dairy cows fed treated forage had similar feed intake (average 23 kg d- 1) and milk yield (average 29 kg d- 1) to cows fed the untreated forage. It was concluded that Solution Foin can be used to improve the aerobic stability and ensiled forage characteristics of short-term corn forage, likely by reducing yeast and mold populations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the nutritive value and fermentation characteristic of king grass silage treated with addition of liquid or dried lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculant. Experiment was arranged to a completely randomized design with four treatments and three replications. Four treatments as follows (A) king grass without LAB inoculant as the control; (B) king grass + 30 ml of liquid of epiphytic LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage; (C) king grass + 30 g of freeze-dried powder of LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage; (D) king grass + 30 g of centrifuged powder of LAB inoculant/kg of fresh forage. The liquid LAB inoculant was sprayed on the top of grass and then mannualy mixed by hand. The intial LAB concentration in all inoculants were 1. 0 × 106 cfu/g.

40|$|Ensiling, a wet {{preservation}} method, is {{an appropriate}} method of storing feedstock for biogas production. Fresh maize straw, contain enough water-soluble carbohydrates, is the prevailing material producing biogas, but research on preservation and storage of maize straw as feedstock for anaerobic digestion {{is still in its}} infancy. Generally in China, the free sugars are consumed, the water evaporates during wilting and field drying, giving rise to fail to achieve the demand of good-quality silage. In view of strong complementary in terms of physical structure, nutrient/moisture content of maize straw and vegetables, this paper propose a hypothesis of trans-seasonal mixed ensiling for biogas production. The objective of the current work was to evaluate effects of different mixed ratio of maize straw (MS) and cabbage wastes (CW) on silage quality, taking into account the silage quality, chemical composition and structural properties of feedstock. Mixed ensiling of maize straw and cabbage waste were prepared in 1. 6 -L <b>plastic</b> <b>silos</b> at 25 degrees C. The mixed mass ratios (MMR) of MS and CW were 19 : 29, 21 : 27, 23 : 25, 25 : 23, 27 : 21 and 29 : 19, respectively. The results show that the content of cellulose and hemicellulose after ensiling were increased, achieving the goal of seasonal storage for MS. When the MMR was 27 : 21, that is, the moist content was 73 % (MEMS 73), the pH value had a minimum and the content of lactic acid was highest after mixed ensiling for 30 days. Therefore, the optimum MMR of MS and CW was 21 : 27 for storage of maize straw. The microtoporaghy of SEM indicated that the cracks and ruleless pores were taken on the surfaces of maize straw silage, compared to the compact lignocellulosic matrix before ensiling. The crystalline degree of cellulose was decreased after ensiling. In a word, ensiling {{is an appropriate}} feasibly storage method to preserve MS and should be considered a promising method for stable storage of biogas feedstock...|$|R

40|$|Currently, biomasses {{contribute}} to the European energy supply-chain by an average amount of 4 %. With reference to the Italian situation, {{in the last years}} about 10 % of the overall maize area is earmarked to biogas production causing a changing in its harvesting operations. In particular, due to the wide surface to collect in a short harvesting period, the mowing, chopping, transport and ensiling operations must be well adapted in order to avoid bottlenecks that otherwise would lead to unproductive periods of delay, idle machines and, as a result, higher costs that could reduce the overall efficiency. Ensiling, in this sense, {{is one of the key}} issues that could affect the sustainability of such biomass, both from an economical and environmental point of view. In fact, several ensiling techniques can be carried out. However, among them, in Europe, the two most widespread are: bunker silos (traditional systems) and plastic bag-silos. While the bunker silos represent so far the most utilized solution, the <b>plastic</b> bag <b>silos</b> could be a potentially cheaper alternative to traditional silage storage systems.

40|$|Native species like Hyperthelia dissoluta {{have great}} {{potential}} in livestock production {{but not much}} {{has been done to}} improve their contribution to that sector.  This study examined 2 conservation methods (drying and ensiling) and 3 different growth stages, namely: elongation stage (January), early flowering (February) and late flowering stage (March) of H. dissoluta in terms of nutritional composition and digestibility.  The method of conservation had a significant effect (P< 0. 05) on nutritive value, with silage having more P and CP than hay.  Stage of growth had an effect (P< 0. 05) on all nutritional properties of both hay and silage:  Phosphorus, Ca and CP concentrations and digestibility of hay and silage decreased with maturity, while NDF and ADF concentrations increased.  Silage pH value was significantly higher at elongation (5. 2) and late flowering growth stages (5. 7) than at early flowering (4. 4).  Dry matter digestibility of the conserved material reached levels as high as 82 % for silage made at the elongation stage with all values at least 60 %.   We conclude that H. dissoluta can be conserved as both silage and hay to produce a good quality feed.  Harvesting at the early flowering stage would seem to provide a good compromise between quantity (not measured in this study) and quality of harvested forage.   Further studies seem warranted to determine the acceptability and intake of the material by livestock, the advantages of adding fermentable carbohydrates during ensiling and DM yields in different areas and a range of seasonal conditions.

50|$|The {{method is}} heavily used in central, {{southern}} parts of Africa (i.e. Botswana) and South America. Small scale farmers {{have found the}} process to be more beneficial in their regions. Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore hermetic storage has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in supplementary measures. In Botswana, traditional people usually use the hermetic storage placed inside a jute bag to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that hermetic storage of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically sealed <b>plastic</b> bags (<b>silo</b> bags) has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the silo bags in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|R
40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as silage bags, bunker silo covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch films. Plastic pesticide containers are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., silage bags in place of concrete <b>silos,</b> <b>plastic</b> hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from controlled incineration (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Observations {{were made}} on silage pH, {{chemical}} composition and 24 hr in vitro dry matter digestion (IVDMD) to evaluate effects of various additives ensiled with annual ryegrass straw. Additives were compared in factorial designed trials utilizing. 95 1 glass jar silos. Selection of additives used in each subsequent trial was based on results of preceding trials and then combined with other additives. All additives were used {{as a percent of}} straw on a dry matter basis and incorporated with water to give 22 % dry matter in silages. Adding 4. 5 % NaOH:KOH allowed greater (P<. 01) silage IVDMD than. 5 g cellulase while this gave more (P<. 01) IVDMD than straw ensiled with water. Including 10 % and 20 % molasses lowered (P<. 01) silage pH to more desirable levels, with or without the other additives. Using 20 % molasses resulted in more favorable silage aspects and the lowest (P <. 01) acid detergent fiber (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) and cell wall constituents (CWC) for the silage. Adding 1 % urea to silage having 20 % molasses or 4. 5 % hydroxide and 20 % molasses increased (P<. 01) crude protein content and IVDMD. Adding 1. 2 % biuret to these silages raised (P<. 01) crude protein but did not affect IVDMD. Including. 1 % elemental sulfur raised (P< 01) silage pH and a strong sulfur odor was present. Some spoilage occurred when sulfur was added to hydrooxide- treated ensilage and was more evident in material containing urea. Reduced (P<. 01) ADF and CWC values were observed in hydroxide silage having sulfur-biuret additives. Silage with 20 % molasses and 1 % urea had a lower (P<. 01) pH at 40 days than at 20 days ensilation. Adding. 5 % limestone lowered (P<. 01) pH further and improved (P<. 01) IVDMD at 40 days ensilation. Ensilage having 4. 5 % hydroxide and the same molasses and urea additives resulted in a more elevated (P<. 01) p 11 at 40 days. The addition of limestone to these additives lowered (P<. 01) silage pH while IVDMD was unaltered. Using. 5 % formic acid in these silages lowered (P<. 01) pH while not affecting IVDMD. All silages had less (P<. 01) residual ash at 40 days than at 20 days ensilation. Ensiling straw with 20 % molasses, 1 % urea and. 5 % limestone gave lower (P<. 01) pH values than for hydroxide-treated silage having the other additives at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 days ensilation. Decreased (P<. 01) ADF and CWC and increased (P<. 01) ADL values occurred in treated silage several days earlier (P<. 01) than untreated ensilage. Less (P<. 01) residual ash remained in either type silage after 32 days ensiling. Formation of organic acids during the 0 - 64 days ensiling by hydroxide-treated material gave peak (P<. 01) lactic acid at 16 days then dropped (P< 01) while acetic plateaued (P<. 01) at 16 days and butyric rose (P<. 01) sharply after 16 days. In contrast, untreated silage had a steady rise (P<. 01) of lactic to 64 days, acetic peaked (P<. 01) at 32 days, while butyric rose (P<. 01) at 8 days and declined at 32 days. Propionic acid was not detectable in untreated sila. ge after 2 days ensilation while rises (P<. 01) occurred at 2 and 32 days in treated material. IVDMD was higher (P<. 01) with 2 - 64 day substrate from treated silage while digestion for untreated was increased after substrate had been ensiled for 32 days. In vitro rumen liquor following 24 hr fermentation of hydroxide-treated silage allowed greater (P<. 01) concentrations of acetate and butyrate than untreated silage while numerical differences for propionate were not significant. Lambs consumed more (P<. 05) dry matter and nitrogen from silage prepared in plastic barrels with 4. 5 % NaOH:KOH, 20 % molasses, 1 % urea and. 5 % limestone as compared to ensilage having these additives except hydroxide. Material ensiled with hydroxide resulted in higher (P<. 05) digestibility of dry and organic matter, ADF, ADL, CWC and crude protein. Also more (P<. 05) nitrogen was retained while urine volume and density was greater numerically. Rumen fluid of these lambs contained more (P<. 05) acetic and propionic acids while butyric acid and C₂:C₃ ratio were not significantly different. Body weight gains during a 98 day trial were similar in heifers fed ryegrass silage, or straw ensiled with the molasses, urea, limestone and hydroxide additives, or the same straw silage without hydroxide when animals each received. 9 kg barleycottonseed meal supplement daily. Supplementing these silages with an equal amount of fat-molasses-urea mixture reduced (P<. 05) gains and silage intake was depressed. An additional daily. 9 kg grain supplement during the final 38 days of the trial stimulated intake of either type straw silage while consumption of ryegrass ensilage was lowered. Animals consumed the straw silage having hydroxide more readily than the untreated straw ensilage throughout the trial.
