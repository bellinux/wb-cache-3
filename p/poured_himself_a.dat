500|$|In November 1950, Namuth and Pollock's {{relationship}} came to {{an abrupt}} conclusion. [...] After coming in from the cold-weather shoot of the glass painting, Pollock, who had been treated in the 1930s for alcoholism, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> tumbler of bourbon whiskey after supposedly having been sober for two years. [...] An argument between Namuth and Pollock ensued with each calling the other a [...] "phony", culminating in Pollock overturning a table of food and dinnerware in front of several guests. [...] From then on, Pollock reverted to a more figure-oriented style of painting, leading some to say that Namuth's sessions robbed Pollock of his rawness and made Pollock come to feel disingenuous about doing things for the camera that he had originally done spontaneously. [...] Art critic Jonathan Jones suggests that by filming Pollock, Namuth [...] "broke the myth of trance" [...] and by framing Pollock's work in the larger surrounding landscape, destroyed Pollock's view that his paintings were boundless. [...] Jeffrey Potter, a close friend of Pollock's, described Namuth as commanding, frequently telling Pollock when to start and stop painting. [...] According to Potter, Pollock [...] "felt what was happening was phony." [...] Namuth himself describes Pollock as being [...] "very nervous and very self-conscious" [...] of the filming at the time, but less so when Pollock discussed it in a later interview.|$|E
60|$|Freddie {{moved to}} the table, and <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> cup of coffee.|$|E
60|$|Wallenstein, the German Resident Commissioner from Bougainville, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> long Scotch {{and soda}} and smiled.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the novel}} The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson, Evert Gullberg, a former {{intelligence}} officer, although not fond of alcohol, <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> glass of Glenfiddich.|$|R
60|$|Antoine, {{white with}} fear, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> liqueur of brandy.|$|R
60|$|Dominey <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} brandy {{with a steady}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{believed}} him this time, and Pym triumphantly <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> glass of whisky, spilling {{some of it}} on his dressing-gown.|$|E
60|$|He went unhappily {{into the}} kitchen and opened the great gleaming refrigerator. As he <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> drink he thought about the clock.|$|E
60|$|Smoke cast an incurious {{glance at}} the coarse gold, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> cup of coffee at the fire, and sat down. Joy sensed {{something}} wrong {{and looked at him}} with eagerly solicitous eyes. Shorty, however, was disgruntled by his partner's lack of delight in the discovery.|$|E
60|$|He <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> little, {{added some}} soda, {{and took a}} sip.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{coughed and}} <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{little more of}} the coffee.|$|R
60|$|Dredlinton {{moved to}} the sideboard, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> liqueur and drank it off.|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't realize it," [...] said Jeff, with a {{finality}} that piqued her. He {{reached out}} for the bottle of apollinaris, with somehow the effect of being in another student's room, and <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> glass. This would have amused her, {{nine times out of}} ten, but the tenth time had come when she chose to resent it.|$|E
60|$|The officer's {{heart was}} plunging. He <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> glass of wine, {{part of which}} he spilled on the floor, and gulped the remainder, leaning against the cool, green stove. He heard his man {{collecting}} the dishes from the stairs. Pale, as if intoxicated, he waited. The servant entered again. The Captain's heart gave a pang, as of pleasure, seeing the young fellow bewildered and uncertain on his feet, with pain.|$|E
60|$|Then a big, loosely-hung figure came shambling {{down the}} ladder, {{and the second}} withdrew. However, he stood among the columns below, and watched his {{superior}} stop and glance at the tube through which the oil flowed before he went about his work again. Robertson was apparently satisfied, and after slouching round the engine-room and unscrewing a little further the throttle valve which turns steam on to the engines, he crawled back to his greasy room. He sloughed off his jacket and boots, and drawing a bottle from beneath the mattress of his bunk <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> stiff drink of whisky before he stretched himself out.|$|E
60|$|Felix <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass and}} drank it off. But he {{remained}} silent.|$|R
50|$|Frankie {{lays the}} baby in the oven, and turns {{it all the way to}} the {{cleaning}} setting. He then <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> glass of spoiled milk and drinks it, before committing suicide via gun. The final shot shows a train passing by into the night.|$|R
60|$|He <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} water with {{trembling}} fingers and drank it unsteadily.|$|R

50|$|Afterwards, Jesse {{returns to}} his house by the water and <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> drink. His wife calls and begins {{to leave a message}} on the {{answering}} machine, but Jesse doesn't pick up the phone. Instead he walks outside and watches the tide beneath the evening sky.|$|R
60|$|Burton <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} wine from the bottle which his {{companion}} had ordered.|$|R
60|$|Selingman <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} wine from the bottle which stood at his elbow.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bulstrode, {{alone with}} his brother-in-law, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.|$|R
60|$|The doctor <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} claret, and drank it off. His throat {{must have been}} dry.|$|R
60|$|Weiss drew a great {{breath of}} relief. He <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of wine}} and drank it off.|$|R
60|$|Lord Chelsford <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{glass of}} wine, {{and held it}} up to the light for a moment.|$|R
50|$|Later, Bing {{is shown}} {{finishing}} {{one of his}} streams in his penthouse, still holding the shard of glass to his neck. He <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> fresh orange juice and stands staring through a wall-length screen at {{an image of a}} vast green forest stretching to the horizon, in a cell much larger than his original.|$|R
60|$|He {{sighed and}} looked grave for a moment. Then he <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> glass of {{champagne}} and drank it deliberately off.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a second}} plate on the table, and he calmly helped himself to soup, then <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> glass of wine.|$|R
50|$|Alan {{continues}} on, {{and finally}} reaches {{the safety of}} his apartment. The noises suddenly stop. Relieved, Alan enters and <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> drink. He hears a lion's roar from the bedroom. When he opens the bedroom door, he finds a lion on the bed, as well as Doris' presumed-dead body. The episode ends as the lion leaps towards Alan for the kill.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} pause, during which Alton glanced bewilderedly at his comrade, and Deringham glanced round as he <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> whisky and seltzer.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll need little discussing," [...] was Nick's savage {{answer as}} {{he rose and}} went to <b>pour</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> cup of wine. [...] "There's but one course open to us --instant flight. I am for Minehead to join Hewling's horse, which went there {{yesterday}} for guns. We might seize a ship somewhere on the coast, and thus {{get out of this}} infernal country of mine." ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless {{she moved}} her skirts and made room for him by her side. Macheson came up out of breath, and <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> glass of wine.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped and}} wiped his forehead--then {{unlocked}} his desk, produced a bottle of brandy, and <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> glass of the liquor, which he drank by sips, slowly.|$|R
60|$|He sat {{upright in}} his chair and, {{ignoring}} the look of consternation that passed between husband and wife, <b>poured</b> <b>himself</b> out <b>a</b> {{cup of tea and}} took a slice of cake.|$|R
50|$|Returning to Kelly's home, Eph {{encounters}} {{one final}} horror: Kelly, now a vampire, {{is driven by}} a primal need to find and infect her son. Eph drives her away, knowing that she will never stop pursuing Zach unless she is destroyed. With Zach's help, Eph posts proof of the vampire plague online, and, {{for the first time}} in years - as he has been a recovering alcoholic - <b>pours</b> <b>himself</b> <b>a</b> drink.|$|R
