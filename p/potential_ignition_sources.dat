50|$|On December 17, 1963, {{nine days}} after the crash of flight 214, Leon H.

Â Many of the new low GWP refrigerants are mildly flammable or 2 L as classified by ISO 817 and ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 34 (ASHRAE 2008, ISO 2014). The new refrigerant flammability class provides the heating/air-conditioning/refrigeration industry more options to meet environmental regulations with equipment designed for low flammability. Â Mildly flammable refrigerants are defined as refrigerants which have burning velocity (BV) less than 10 cm/sec and heat of combustion (HOC) less than 19, 000 kJ/kg. Â A relatively unexplored <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> is a hot surface {{which can be found}} in air conditioning auxiliary heaters and other refrigeration systems.

30|$|Fire {{blocking}} technologies operate by two broad, {{not mutually}} exclusive modes: passive and active ([Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack 1998]).

40|$|Abstract. We {{assessed}} {{the exposure of}} the built environment to <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> generated from vegetative fuel for four communities {{in the province of}} Alberta, Canada. Ignition processes generated by burning vegetation that were included in the analysis were radiant heat, short-range spotting, and longer-range spotting. Results were used to map the boundaries of the wildland–urban interface and to delineate zones within each community that identify the degree to which these areas represent potential wildfire entry-points into the wildland–urban interface. The assessment method can be used to set priorities for mitigation activities; compare conditions within and between communities and over time; and identify priority areas for time- and resource-intensive site assessments that are often completed for individual structures located in the wildland–urban interface. We compared results among the four case-study communities and demonstrated an application of the approach for evaluating community fuel treatment plans. Factors that influenced the exposure of the built environment to <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> differed among the communities, which suggested the need for community-specific mitigation strategies. Spatial patterns of areas with elevated ignition exposure reflected not only the amount of ignition-producing vegetation around the built environment, but also the size and arrangement of fuel patches in relation to the unique morphology of the community and the occurrence of occluded interface zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{reusable launch vehicle}} systems for a single stage to orbit vehicle requires vehicles at liftoff with 85 % to 94 % of its mass consisting exclusively of propellants. These dry mass requirements drive designs to utilize stronger, lighter weight materials for structures. This technology development focus has allowed the introduction of composite materials in lieu of conventional metallic materials due to their higher specific strengths. Composite materials were successfully used for the liquid hydrogen tanks for the DC-XA, and a multi-lobed liquid hydrogen tank will be employed for the X- 33. Another potential non-traditional application for composite materials is for liquid oxygen tanks, which is still being investigated. Traditionally, organic materials have been avoided wherever possible, due the potential fire hazard {{and the fact that}} composites fail conventional oxygen compatibility requirements. However, the potential weight savings warrant the investigation of the use of polymeric composite materials in oxygen environments. Since composites fail the conventional, time-proven test methods because they are considered flammable by test, we have embarked on an innovative approach to oxygen compatibility testing and evaluation focused on the use environments and attempts to eliminate or "design away" all <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources.</b> Oxygen compatibility is defined as the ability of a material to coexist with oxygen and <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> with an acceptable, manageable degree of risk...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{focuses on the}} study of the {{dispersion}} and combustion of a vapor cloud resulting from the escape of LNG and LPG. The consumption of natural gas and LPG is clearly growing, and is based on multiple storage facilities and different types of transport. The possibility of a release and the subsequent vapor cloud formation is significant. The application of appropriate measures to ensure safety in terminals and facilities related to these products is essential to the community safety. An important aspect is the management of the emergency once the cloud has reached the stationary state (the time to reach this state depends on wind velocity, but is usually very short). In this situation, any information about the position of the flammable region of the cloud can be very helpful. A historical analysis of accidents involving vapor cloud fires has been carried out. 176 accidents have been analyzed, which have yielded information on the causes, origins and consequences of such events. A dispersion safety factor (DSF) has been proposed as a tool to help in the decision process under these circumstances. The parameter DSF is the ratio between the distance reached by the lower flammability limit and that of the visible cloud. The results obtained for the dispersion safety factor with the DEGADIS code agree fairly well with the evidence from experimental data obtained at large scale. This factor is strongly dependent on the atmospheric relative humidity. Thus, when high relative humidity prevails, the cloud will be visible for some distance beyond the flammable region (DSF 1). In this case, the flammable vapor cloud will not be visible at the location of any <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> Two expressions have been proposed to estimate the parameter DSF for a release of LNG according to the range of HR. The same treatment has also been applied to the case of a spill of liquefied propane gas cooled at atmospheric pressure. With respect to the combustion of the flammable vapor cloud, a new expression has been obtained, which determines the flame speed {{as a function of the}} wind speed, based on various large scale tests conducted with LNG between 1968 and 1982; this expression gives a better fit for high wind speeds. A relatively simple model of the flash fire has been developed based on the dispersion of the cloud as a function of fuel properties and atmospheric conditions (stability and wind velocity). The size of the flames will depend on the size of the cloud, being higher that the latter. It has been observed from the available data experiments, that the flame height increases proportionally to the visible cloud. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Modifications in {{the process}} {{industry}} are quite common. For many of these modifications cutting of existing equipment and structure will be a central activity. The abrasive diamond wire cutting technology is adopted from the stone cutting industry, and has proven to cut cross-sections of steel quite efficient.

This theory is then used as a basis for a thermal model, usable for numerical simulations. The model is partially validated against measured temperatures.

40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{potentially}} catastrophic hazards associated with the operation of crewed spacecraft. A major lesson learned by NASA from the Apollo 204 fire in 1966 was that ignition sources in an electrically powered vehicle should and can be minimized, but can never be eliminated completely. For this reason, spacecraft fire control is based on minimizing <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> and eliminating materials that can propagate fire. Fire extinguishers are always provided on crewed spacecraft, but are not considered as part of the fire control process. "Eliminating materials that can propagate fire" does not mean eliminating all flammable materials - the cost of designing and building spacecraft using only nonflammable materials is extraordinary and unnecessary. It means controlling the quantity and configuration of such materials to eliminate potential fire propagation paths and thus ensure that any fire would be small, localized, and isolated, and would self-extinguish without harm to the crew. Over the years, NASA has developed many solutions for controlling the configuration of flammable materials (and potentially flammable materials in commercial "off-the-shelf" hardware) so that they can be used safely in air and oxygen-enriched environments in crewed spacecraft. This document describes and explains these design solutions so payload customers and other organizations can use them in designing safe and cost-effective flight hardware. Proper application of these guidelines will produce acceptable flammability configurations for hardware located in any compartment of the International Space Station or other program crewed vehicles and habitats.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of rusted and mechanical damaged flame gaps, {{and the ability of}} these flame gaps to prevent a hydrogen gas explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosion chamber. An explosion chamber intended for preventing such an explosion transmission between an inner and outer explosive atmosphere is called an Ex'd' enclosure. In the industry there are many <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> that could be a threat in an explosive atmosphere, as an explosion may occur if being ignited. Ex'd' enclosures are designed to surround the <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> and to protect a possible internal explosion from spreading to the outer environment. Ex'd' enclosures have certain design requirements specified in the international standards IEC. The design criteria that was examined in this work is (IEC 2007 a) 's requirement which states that the mean surface roughness of the flame gap opening shall be less than 6. 3 μm. The international standards also require that any damaged flame gap surface must be restored to the original state. However, the standards have no definition of what damages are considerable large enough for having to be restored to the original quality. As a result of this lack of guidance, even minor rust or mechanical damage of the flame gap surfaces must be repaired, which is a time consuming and expensive procedure. The purpose of the present research is, {{due to the lack of}} damage ranking definition, to examine what effect different damages have on the safe gap. To be able to conclude about the importance and effect of the damage, one must have a characteristic value for each slit to compare the results. The characteristic value used in this work is the maximum experimental safe gap, MESG, which is a measure of the largest gap opening that does not generate a re- ignition on the outside of the Ex'd' enclosure. An increase in MESG value does therefore imply an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The MESG value is individual for each explosive gas, and will vary as the surfaces of the flame gaps are changed. Similar experiments have previously been performed with propane as the explosive gas, but the present work is carried out with hydrogen as the explosive gas. The present work has also considered the effect of different time periods of rust formation. Six slits were set at sea side for one month and six others for two months. Rusted slits shall, according to the stardards, be restored to the initial state. But results show that corrosion actually increases the efficiency of the safe gap. The efficiency of the safe gap also increases with increased rust formation on the slit's surfaces. The mechanical damaged flame gaps were applied grooves of various depths and various widths to their surfaces. All grooves were crosswise, thus in the opposite direction of the gas flow that was being pushed through the opening by the internal explosion. The MESG values of the mechanical damaged slits turned out to be larger than the undamaged slits' MESG values, which refers to an increased efficiency of the safe gap. The overall conclusion from this investigation is that damaged surfaces of flame gaps do not reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. Neither rusted nor significant mechanical damaged flame gap surfaces reduce the efficiency of the safe gap. In fact, improvements are observed in all cases. This indicates that the surface roughness requirements of the international standards which states that the mean surface roughness must be less than 6. 3 μm, is an arbitrarily chosen value. It is also shown in this study that the temperature of the hot combustion gases is lower after they have penetrated through flame gaps with grooves, rather than after penetrating through an undamaged flame gap. The probability of generating a re-ignition in the secondary chamber through flame gaps with grooves is then decreased as a result of the lower temperatur...|$|E
40|$|A {{discovery}} Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) {{was declared}} on the underground waste storage tanks at the Hanford Site in May 1996. The USQ was for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions (sometimes called organic complexant reactions) in the tanks. This paper outlines the steps taken {{to close the}} USQ, and resolve the related safety issue. Several processes were used at the Hanford Site to extract and/or process plutonium. These processes resulted in organic complexants (for chelating multivalent cations) and organic extraction solvents {{being sent to the}} underground waste storage tanks. This paper addresses the organic complexant hazard. The organic complexants are in waste matrices that include inert material, diluents, and potential oxidizers. In the presence of oxidizing material, the complexant salts can be made to react exothermically by heating to high temperatures or by applying an external ignition source of sufficient energy. The first organic complexant hazard assessments focused on determining whether a hulk runaway reaction could occur, similar to the 1957 accident at Kyshtm (a reprocessing plant in the former U. S. S. R.). Early analyses (1977 through 1994) examined organic-nitrate reaction onset temperatures and concluded that a bulk runaway reaction could not occur at the Hanford Site because tank temperatures were well below that necessary for bulk runaway. Therefore, it was believed that organic-nitrate reactions were adequately described in the then current Authorization Basis (AB). Subsequent studies examined a different accident scenario, propagation resulting from an external ignition source (e. g., lightning or welding slag) that initiates a combustion front that propagates through the organic waste. A USQ evaluation determined that localized high energy ignition sources were credible, and that point source ignition of organic complexant waste was not adequately addressed i n the then existing AB. Consequently, the USQ was declared on the underground storage tanks in May 1996 for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions. At {{the same time that the}} operating contractor recommended that the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) declare a USQ. preventative coiitrols were implemented to minimize <b>potential</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> and prevent a possible accident...|$|E
40|$|During {{spray drying}} where a {{solution}} is dispersed in small droplets through a nozzle the liquid evaporates {{by means of}} hot air. In {{a large number of}} these processes organic materials are processed so three out of four factors for dust explosions to occur are already present. The only thing missing for a dust explosion to occur is an <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> In order to prevent explosions in spray dryers we try to remove all possible <b>ignition</b> <b>sources.</b> During spray drying large amounts of material can accumulate. These accumulations are exposed to high temperatures, can cause self heating and change into an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> for dust explosions. In order to prevent your material changing into an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> you need to investigate the self heating properties of the material. From this you can deduct which amount of accumulation is safe in your processes and thus help you in designing inspection and cleaning schemes in order to prevent your material changing into an <b>ignition</b> <b>source.</b> This paper describes an overview of a method to asses your material as an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> and how you can use this information to prevent dust explosions in your spray drying processes...|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{mattress}} flammability standards prescribe {{full-scale testing}} of a prototype mattress (mattress without bedclothes) {{when exposed to}} different <b>ignition</b> <b>sources.</b> The <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> defined for the mattress flammability test in Table 1 represent the fire hazard of a mattress. For example, the Michigan Roll-up test defined by the Boston Fire Department, U.S., requires testing of mattresses used in jails to be tested as rolled up mattresses stuffed with newspaper. This configuration of mattress and <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> (burning newspaper) represents a fire hazard stemming from a deliberate, representative act.|$|R
50|$|When Edlich treated burn {{patients}} {{in which the}} patient’s ignited clothing was adherent to the burned skin, he was concerned that the adult textiles were highly flammable and became the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> for the burn injury. His clinical measurements of fabric flammability of the textiles {{as well as a}} careful review of the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> documented that flammable liquids, such as gasoline, were the <b>ignition</b> <b>sources</b> of most burn injuries. Consequently, Edlich initiated a nationwide educational program that has dramatically reduced the frequency of burn injuries stemming from flammable liquids.|$|R
