The visual aspect of prosthesis can favour a positive body image in the users; however they are often not advised or provided with models responding to their needs. We claim that the visual designer would improve the process for the appearance of the prosthesis, provide the amputees with visual solutions and support the prosthetists in the design process. The aim of this research is to highlight that more attention is needed for the visual needs of prosthetic users and that a change is needed in the current design approach of public <b>prosthetic</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

40|$|A Smart home is an {{intelligent}} environment {{able to perform}} several tasks, from the simple door-window automation, to the secure-safety functions, to the most advanced telecare services. But if we join the technological point of view with the social, educational and experimental ones, a smart home can become a multipurpose environment. This {{is the case of}} the two domotic apartments in the city of Ferrara, recently renewed. One of them is dedicated to a permanent domotics show and a disability help desk (called Centro H, where H stays for handicap), the other serves as a real smart home, where patients from the near San Giorgio Rehabilitation Hospital can spend a period of two weeks, together with a relative, to test the technology, acquire a certain level of independence and autonomy, eventually referring about possible improvements of the smart home system or of the apartment structure (furniture, spaces, lighting and so on). The first smart home is also used from the University of Electronic Engineering as a laboratory for students, to test experimental projects, in collaboration with the INAIL <b>Prosthetic</b> <b>Centre,</b> a very important partner in the domotic research field.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate the possibility of reflexology being used as a non-invasive form of phantom limb pain relief and of empowering patients to maintain any positive results with self-treatment. Setting: Prosthetic Services Centre, Herbert Street, Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England Design: A same-subject, experimental pilot study, recording the intensity of phantom limb pain in weekly pain diaries over a 30 -week period, which was divided into five phases: phase 1 gave a baseline of pain, whilst phase 3 was a resting phase. Phases 2, 4 and 5 provided the reflexology interventions. Sample: Ten participants with unilateral lower limb amputations and phantom limb pain were selected from the database at the <b>Prosthetic</b> <b>Centre.</b> Reflexology interventions: In phase 2, six weekly reflexology treatments were given, which consisted of: full foot reflexology to the remaining foot and full hand reflexology to the hand of the amputated side of the body. In phase 4, six weekly hand reflexology teaching sessions were carried out; patients copied on their own hands what the therapist did on hers. A hand reflexology booklet gave the sequence of the treatment and was used as a reference. In phase 5, the patients self-treated for 6 weeks at home, using the reference material. Results: Over the 30 -week period, there was an improvement in the perception of the presence and the intensity of the phantom limb pain, with a corresponding improvement in the duration of the pain and the affect on the person's lifestyle. The improvement was maintained when the clients self-treated. Follow-up questionnaire: A follow-up questionnaire was carried out in 2007 — 12 months after the project had ended—to elicit whether the patients had suffered from phantom pain over the previous 12 months, whether they still had relief from phantom limb pain and whether they still self-treated. Conclusions: The project indicated that reflexology treatment, teaching and self-treatment were effective in eradicating or reducing the intensity and duration of phantom limb pain, in this group of clients. The follow-up questionnaire revealed that there was a maintained improvement in the intensity of phantom limb pain the patients experienced and that the majority still self-treated...|$|E

30|$|Amputation was not {{considered}} a first-line treatment for this group of patients because of the poor availability of <b>prosthetic</b> limb <b>centres</b> in Pakistan and the questionable long-term cost of limb reconstruction versus prosthetics for young patients. The majority of these patients were young and were not from urban centres but evacuated from rural Kashmir which, following the earthquake, had limited infrastructure remaining. The cost of prosthetics over a young patient’s lifetime, which in most cases would be self-funded, would be very high. McKenzie et al. [19] suggested reconstruction {{for the treatment of}} injuries below the distal part of the femur typically resulted in functional outcomes equivalent to those of amputation. This conclusion would not be applicable in a setting with inadequate provision of prosthetics.|$|R

40|$|The Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) {{has been}} {{developed}} specifically to enable the broadbased evaluation of hand function irrespective of the disability, thereby allowing assessment of both natural and prosthetic hands. This technique enables a contextual result to be formed (relative to normal hand ftxnction), hence providing a quantifiable index of functionality rather than the more conventional subjective measures. The establishment of normative data trials and subsequent statistical analysis demonstrates the procedure to be both reliable and r epeatable. The procedure has been undergoing evaluation at hand rehabilitation and <b>prosthetic</b> fitting <b>centres.</b> The subject group consists of those with impaired natural hand fimction (ranging fiom traumatic injury to diseased joints), as well as unilateral amputees and those with congenital deficiencies ofthe upper limb.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the optimal trans-femoral prosthetic alignment configuration for running. A case study design was implemented as the method to collect data on four male Paralympic level trans-femoral amputee runners. In total 28 synchronised 3 D kinematic, kinetic, and temporal biomechanical measures were analysed. A new prosthetic alignment, in which the prosthetic knee axis was lowered longitudinally (moved distally), was evaluated for running. The performance of the symmetry indices and running time for a total of three new modified alignments were compared to the standard prosthetic alignment. The interlimb asymmetry was found to improve when the subjects ran on the modified prosthetic alignment, and most importantly a one way ANOVA found a statistically significant increase in running velocity. This study identified that for all four subjects, who used the same prosthetic components, lowering the <b>prosthetic</b> knee joint <b>centre</b> improved their interlimb symmetry, and subsequently their running velocity by an average of 26 %...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} patients’ {{mobility and}} satisfaction with their lower limb prosthetic or orthotic device and related service delivery in Malawi and to compare groups of patients regarding type and level of device and demographics. METHODS: Questionnaires were used to collect self-report data from 83 patients. RESULTS: Ninety percent of prostheses or orthoses were in use by patients, but approximately half of these needed repair. Thirty-nine percent reported pain when using their assistive device. The majority of patients were able to rise from a chair (77 %), move around the home (80 %), walk on uneven ground (59 %) and travel by bus or car (56 %). However, patients had difficulties {{walking up and down}} hills (78 %) and stairs (60 %). In general, patients were quite satisfied with their assistive device (mean of 3. 9 out of 5) and very satisfied with the service provided (mean of 4. 4 out of 5). Access to repairs and servicing were rated as most important, followed by durability and follow-up services. Lack of finances to pay for transport was a barrier to accessing the <b>prosthetic</b> and orthotic <b>centre.</b> CONCLUSION: Patients were satisfied with the assistive device and service received, despite reporting pain associated with use of the device and difficulties ambulating on challenging surfaces...|$|R

Patients and methods: Resonance frequency analysis was performed at T 1 (measured immediately at the time of implant placement) and at T 2 (measured before dental restoration) in 177 patients (329 implants). Using a multivariate linear regression model, we analyzed the influence of the following eleven candidate factors: sex, age, maxillary/mandibular location, bone type, immediate/delayed implantation, bone grafting (presence or absence), insertion torque, I-/II-stage healing pattern, implant diameter, implant length, and T 1 –T 2 time interval. Results: The following factors were identified to significantly influence the implant stability quotient (ISQ) values at T 1 : insertion torque, bone grafting, I-/II-stage healing pattern, immediate/delayed implantation, maxillary/mandibular location, implant diameter, and sex. In contrast, the ISQ values at T 2 were significantly influenced only by three factors: implant diameter, T 1 –T 2 time interval, and insertion torque. Conclusion: Among the eleven candidate factors, seven key factors were found to influence the T 1 -ISQ values, while only three key factors influenced the T 2 -ISQ values. Both T 1 and T 2 -ISQ values were found to be influenced by implant diameter and insertion torque. T 1 was influenced specifically by the sex of the patient, the location (maxillary or mandibular), the implantation mode (immediate/delayed implantation), the healing stage, and the absence or presence of bone graft materials.

Methods: Seventy adults with CP {{were randomly assigned}} to the three treatment groups: 1)  SRP alone; 2) MO alone; and 3) combinatory use of SRP and MO (SRP + MO). Before and 7 days after the treatments, we evaluated both clinical parameters (pocket depth [PD] and sulcus bleeding index [SBI]) and the gene load of four main periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [Aa], Fusobacterium nucleatum [Fn], Porphyromonas gingivalis [Pg], and Prevotella intermedia [Pi]). Results: The bacterial prevalence per patient was Aa, 31. 25 %; Fn, 100 %; Pg, 95. 31 %; and Pi,  98. 44 %. Seven days after treatments, the three treatments could significantly reduce both PD and SBI, but not detection frequencies of the four pathogens. For PD, the reduction efficacy of SRP + MO was significantly higher than that of both MO and SRP. Only Pg responded significantly to SRP. Pg and Fn could be significantly reduced in the presence of MO. Only SRP + MO but not the respective showed a significant reduction effect on the gene load of Pi. The reduction of PD significantly correlated with the gene load of Pi (r= 0. 26; P= 0. 042) but not of the other bacteria. Conclusion: SRP and MO could reduce the load of Pi in an interdependent pattern, which correlated with symptomatic improvements of CP.
