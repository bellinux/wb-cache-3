25|$|The Foundation Stone for Prince Alfred College, an all-boys K-12-day and {{boarding}} school in Adelaide, was laid by the Prince himself, during his visit in 1867. This prestigious college has the biggest Old Scholars Association in the Southern Hemisphere, and has educated several outstanding citizens. There is also a Prince Alfred Park in Sydney and Prince Alfred Square in <b>Paramatta.</b>|$|E
25|$|New Zealand (1814): The Revd Samuel Marsden {{became the}} {{chaplain}} of the penal colony at <b>Paramatta,</b> Australia in 1874. Samuel Marsden attempted {{to establish a}} mission in New Zealand in 1809, however {{it was not until}} 1814 that the CMS established a mission in New Zealand (Aotearoa) when he officiated at its first service on Christmas Day in 1814, at Oihi Bay in the Bay of Islands.|$|E
60|$|After two days' toil all was completed. Sail was hoisted again and, under {{a greatly}} reduced spread of canvas {{to that which}} she had carried before the gale burst, the <b>Paramatta</b> {{proceeded}} on her way. The weather continued favourable and, without further adventure, the <b>Paramatta</b> arrived off Sydney heads; having made the voyage in a hundred and three days, which was, under the circumstances, a quick one.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the <b>Paramatta</b> weighed anchor and {{proceeded}} down the river. Reuben {{had no time to}} look at the passing ships, for he was fully occupied with the many odd jobs which are sure to present themselves, when a ship gets under weigh. The wind was favourable, and the <b>Paramatta</b> ran down to the mouth of the Medway before the tide had ceased to ebb. She anchored for three hours, and then made her way up to Chatham, where she brought up close to the government yard.|$|E
60|$|The {{only other}} single lady among the {{passengers}} of the <b>Paramatta</b> was going out, under {{the charge of}} the captain, to fill a place as governess in a family in Sydney. Miss Furley was somewhat quiet, but a friendship had naturally sprang up between her and Miss Hudson, as the only two young women on board the ship; and the life and high spirits of the young colonist, and the musical acquirements of Miss Furley, helped to make the voyage pass pleasantly for the passengers in the <b>Paramatta.</b>|$|E
6000|$|<b>Paramatta</b> and Binnum {{are gone}} to their rest [...] In the vale of Tapanni Taroom, [...] Kawakawa, Deniliquin--all that was best [...] In the earth are but graves and a tomb! ...|$|E
60|$|Never was the <b>Paramatta</b> {{stripped}} {{more rapidly}} of her sails, {{for every man}} was conscious of {{the urgency of the}} work. As soon as the sails were furled, the yards were sent down. The upper spars followed them and, in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds, the <b>Paramatta</b> was metamorphosed. Her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone. Every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck; and she lay under close-reefed topsails, a stay sail, and a storm jib. The captain gave a sigh of relief, as the men began to descend the rigging.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} the sea moderated greatly and, the wind having gone round to the southeast, the <b>Paramatta</b> {{made the most of}} it, to get west as far as {{possible}} before turning her head to the south.|$|E
60|$|Reuben {{went back}} at once, to the inn {{where he had}} stopped, and had his chest taken down to the docks; and went on board the <b>Paramatta</b> which, at high water, warped out of dock into the stream.|$|E
60|$|The fine weather, {{which the}} <b>Paramatta</b> had {{experienced}} so far, speedily left her. The sky grew overcast, {{and the wind}} freshened fast, {{and the next morning}} the ship was staggering, under close-reefed canvas, in the teeth of the southwesterly gale.|$|E
60|$|The {{passengers}} by the <b>Paramatta</b> were {{up early}} in the morning, for the ship was to sail at nine. But early as they were, Reuben was before them; and on Mr. Hudson inquiring about him, as he turned out, he was informed that he had already gone on board the ship.|$|E
60|$|For a {{week the}} <b>Paramatta</b> ran before the gale. At {{the end of}} the fourth day its force {{somewhat}} abated, but it still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spars; while the lost mizzen rendered it impossible for them to bring her up into the wind.|$|E
60|$|At nightfall the <b>Paramatta</b> was in {{the midst}} of the icebergs, and Reuben soon {{understood}} the antipathy which Bill had expressed for them. As a spectacle, they were no doubt grand; but as neighbours to a half-crippled ship, with half a gale blowing, their beauty was a very secondary consideration to those on board.|$|E
60|$|A {{number of}} small boxes, bags, coats and cloaks were handed up, and then the rope was cast off, and the lugger made {{her way back to}} Dover, and the <b>Paramatta</b> again got under sail. While they had been waiting, the chief mate had told Reuben that, {{according}} to the captain's orders, he would henceforth be in his watch.|$|E
60|$|The jibs {{were run}} up, the courses and topsails shaken out and braced, and the <b>Paramatta</b> began to steal {{through the water}} again, for the second portion of her voyage. Mr. Hudson and his friend very soon made their way forward, and the ship was {{scarcely}} under way when Reuben, who was gazing over the bulwark at the shore, felt a hand laid on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|The voyage {{down to the}} Cape was wholly uneventful. The <b>Paramatta</b> {{was most}} {{fortunate}} in her weather and, beyond trimming the sails, the crew had a very easy time of it. Captain Wilson had, as he promised Miss Hudson, taken the opportunity, when Reuben was sitting idly on deck, of having a chat with him; {{but he did not}} learn much {{in the course of the}} conversation.|$|E
60|$|This {{was soon}} done and, under bare poles, the storm jib {{now the only}} sail upon her, the <b>Paramatta</b> tore through the water. There was little motion, for the sea had not begun to get up, seeming to be pressed flat {{by the force of}} the wind. The captain now left the helm. Two or three of the male {{passengers}} were standing {{at the top of the}} companion, peering out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dinner is ready," [...] Frances Hudson said, {{running into}} the room. [...] "Here you are, papa, talking away as usual, {{whenever}} you get the chance. Now run upstairs quickly, both of you; for Rachel will not be pleased if you let the first dinner get cold, after she has been doing her best to turn out something special, in honour of the occasion, ever since she heard the <b>Paramatta</b> was in port." ...|$|E
60|$|Very well, then. The letter must be sent on {{alternate}} Wednesdays to {{the colonial}} newsagent's address, {{and it would}} be duly forwarded by mail {{to the office of the}} <b>Paramatta</b> 'Chronicle.' A little suspicious, that item, Berkeley thought, but Ernest swallowed it like a child and made no comment. It must be addressed to 'Paramatta, care of Lane & Co.,' and the payments would be made fortnightly through the same agency. Arthur watched his friend's face narrowly at this point again; but Ernest in his simple-minded, unsuspecting wasy, never noticed the obvious meaning of this little deception. He thanked Arthur over and over again for his kindness, but he never guessed how far it extended. The letters kept him employed for two days a week, or thereabouts, and though they never got to <b>Paramatta,</b> nor any farther than Arthur Berkeley's own study in the little house he had taken for himself at Chelsea, they were regularly paid for through the colonial newsagents, by means of a cheque which really owed its ultimate origin to Arthur Berkeley himsslf. Fifteen shillings a week is not a large fortune, certainly; but still it is considerably better than nothing, when you come to try both methods of living by practical experience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, there's {{eight or}} ten {{passengers}}, I hears," [...] the sailor said. [...] "Passengers don't mostly like going by convict ships, but then the fares are lower than by other vessels, and that tempts a few. Besides, the <b>Paramatta</b> {{is known to be}} a fast ship, and the skipper has a good name; so we shall have a better class of passengers, I expect, than usually voyages with convict ships; and besides the passengers there will be the officer of the convict guard, and a surgeon, so we shall be pretty full aft." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't no croaker, Reuben, but I {{knows what}} I knows. I {{have been through}} a job like that I am telling you of, once; and I don't {{want to do it}} again. I will tell you about it, some day. I ain't saying as I expect any such thing will happen, on board the <b>Paramatta.</b> God forbid. She's a tight ship, and she's got as good {{officers}} and crew as ever I sailed with. She has as good a chance as ever a ship had; but when I sees that 'ere sort of sky in these latitudes, I feels as we are in for a tough job." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{arrival at}} <b>Paramatta,</b> his new home, {{was in the}} March of 1794, when the convict system had prevailed about seven years, and had been {{sufficient}} to form a population disgraceful to human nature. None of those endeavours to reclaim the prisoner which now prevail had then been attempted, and jails were schools and hotbeds of crime, whence the transported were sent forth to corrupt each other {{more and more on}} board ship; and then, though employed on Government works or assigned to free settlers as servants, so soon as they had worked out their time of servitude they were let loose to live after their own will.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hudson nodded. Only {{the evening}} before {{arriving}} at Cape Town, Captain Wilson had spoken {{to him on the}} matter of his affection for his daughter, and had asked his permission to speak to Frances. They had known each other in the colony, but had not been intimate until thrown together on board the <b>Paramatta.</b> Seeing that she was an only child, and that her father was considered one of the wealthiest squatters in the colony, Captain Wilson had feared that Mr. Hudson would not approve of him as a suitor; and had therefore broached the subject to him, before speaking to her. Mr. Hudson, however, had raised no objections.|$|E
60|$|The wind being favourable, no {{time was}} lost after the marines {{had come on}} board. The {{moorings}} were cast off and sails hoisted, and the <b>Paramatta</b> made her way against the tide {{to the mouth of}} the Medway; and there dropped her anchor to wait until the tide began to ebb, for the wind was so light that little would have been gained by an attempt to proceed at once. Sail was made again as soon as tide turned and, on turning out next morning at daylight, for he had not yet been assigned to a watch, Reuben found that the ship was lying at anchor in the Downs.|$|E
60|$|That brave {{soldier of}} his Lord decided on going {{at once to}} the scene of peril. Though sixty-three years old, he sailed as soon as {{possible}} in H.M.S. Rainbow, but found peace restored and the danger to his missions over. He therefore came back, after remaining only five days at his labours in New South Wales, to the superintendence of the translation of several chapters of Holy Scripture, and to the instruction of the young Maories at the sort of college he had tried from the first to keep up at <b>Paramatta,</b> but which he was forced to abandon, since the delicate lungs of the Maories could not endure the parching dryness of the Australian climate.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain was}} right. In {{less than the}} time he named, a terrific sea had got up. The <b>Paramatta</b> had already made more than one circuit of the compass. There was no {{regularity}} in the sea. It seemed to rise suddenly in heaps, now striking the ship on one side, now on another, and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks. The motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even Bill Hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty {{to carry out the}} orders of the captain; while Reuben clung to the shrouds, now half buried in water, now almost hanging in the air, with the sea racing along under his feet.|$|E
60|$|The captain, {{the first}} mate, and two seamen {{were at the}} wheel. Reuben saw the captain wave his hand, but his words {{were lost in the}} fury of the wind. The second mate, Bill Hardy, and two or three other sailors knew what was required, and hauled upon the lee brace of the fore-top-sail yard. The <b>Paramatta</b> was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but {{gradually}} her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale. Scarcely had she done so, when the fore-top sail blew out of the bolt ropes, with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{though of}} this fearless mould, {{he was one}} of the most loveable of men; {{everyone}} on his farm, as well as all little children, and the savages he conversed with, all loved him passionately. Some young Maories, whom he brought back on his last voyage, used to race after his gig to catch his eye, and when they took hold of any book, used to point upwards, as if whatever was associated with Matua, as they called him, must lead to heaven. He was fond of playing with children, and never was so happy as when he yearly collected the schoolchildren of <b>Paramatta</b> on his lawn, for a feast and games after it.|$|E
6000|$|The square short {{face and}} sturdy form of Samuel Marsden show the force, vigour, and {{determination}} of his nature, which told on beast {{as well as}} man. On the road between Sydney and <b>Paramatta,</b> he used to let the reins lie loose on the splash-board of his gig and read, saying that [...] "the horse that could not keep itself up was not worth driving," [...] and though one of the pair he usually drove was unmanageable in other hands, nothing ever went amiss with it when it went out with its master. Such a spirit of determination produced an impress even on those who opposed him most, and many works were {{carried out in the}} teeth of the difficulties thrown in their way; such as the erection of schools, of a factory for the reception of the female convicts, and of a sort of model farm, where it was intended to collect, tame, and civilize the aborigines. This was at first planned between the governor and chaplain, but when it was ready Marsden was under Colonel Macquarie's displeasure, and was therefore excluded from all share in the management, though the site was actually in his own parish of <b>Paramatta.</b> The experiment was a failure, probably not on this account, but from the restless character of the blacks, whose intellect was too small, and their wants too few, to feel any comfort a compensation for their freedom and wandering life. Mr. Marsden and the other chaplains repeatedly tried bringing up children,--some too young to retain any memory of their native habits, but they always relapsed into savage life on the first opportunity, and though here and there individuals may have better come up to the hopes of their devoted friends, yet as a race they seem too little above the animal to be susceptible of being raised.|$|E
60|$|After four hours' sleep, he {{was again}} on deck. The gale was blowing as {{strongly}} as ever, three men were at the helm, and the vessel was still tearing along at great speed. Several of the male passengers were on the poop, and {{the contrast between the}} appearance of the <b>Paramatta</b> at the same hour on the previous day, and that which she presented now, struck Reuben very strongly. Sadly, indeed, she looked with mizzen mast gone, the main mast shortened to the cap, and all the upper spars and rigging of the fore mast gone. She was, however, making good weather of it, for her hold was now so dry that the pumps were worked only on alternate hours, and the relief afforded by the loss of all her top hamper was very great.|$|E
60|$|In 1834, the Rev. William Grant Broughton, one of {{the clergy}} of Australia, took home {{an account of the}} spiritual destitution of New South Wales, and the effect was that in 1836 a bishopric was there created, and the first {{presentation}} given to him. Some thought that this was a passing over of the chaplain who had laboured so hard for so many years, but Mr. Marsden himself only observed that it was better thus: he was too old a man, and it was with sincere goodwill that he handed over the charge he had held for more than forty years, so that only the parish of <b>Paramatta</b> remained to him, and there he continued his ministry in church, to the sick, and among the poor to the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{news for}} you, Reuben," [...] Captain Wilson said, {{in the first}} pause of conversation. [...] "I saw the chief, and told him I wanted an {{appointment}} for a young friend of mine, who had {{come out in the}} <b>Paramatta,</b> and who had shown great pluck and presence of mind in an affair at the Cape, which I described to him. He said that he could appoint you at once, as young Houghton, a district superintendent, was killed three weeks ago, in an affair with the bush rangers up country. He said he was very glad to hear of someone likely to make a good officer, to fill his place. So if you make up your mind to be a constable, the place is ready for you." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{their return}} to <b>Paramatta,</b> Mr. Marsden made a second visit to New Zealand, taking them back, and also going to instal some fresh missionaries and {{mechanics}} on a new settlement. There was great competition among the chiefs; for the possession of a Pakeha, or Englishman, was greatly coveted {{as a means of}} bringing the material good things of life, and Mr. Marsden was eagerly assured that there was no danger of the English being killed and eaten, since the Maori flesh was much sweeter, because the whites ate so much salt. There was as yet no convert, but Mr. Marsden's resolution by no means failed him; he believed--and he was right--that kindness, truth, and uprightness, in those who could confer temporal benefits, would, in time, lead these intelligent men to appreciate the spiritual blessings that were offered to them.|$|E
60|$|The {{people of}} Sydney {{ought to be}} afraid of the sharks, but for some reason they do not seem to be. On Saturdays the young men go out in their boats, and {{sometimes}} the water is fairly covered with the little sails. A boat upsets now and then, by accident, a result of tumultuous skylarking; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun--such as it is with sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence. The young fellows scramble aboard whole--sometimes--not always. Tragedies have happened more than once. While I was in Sydney it was reported that a boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the <b>Paramatta</b> river and screamed for help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him from the assembling sharks; but the sharks made swift work with the lives of both.|$|E
60|$|Additional stays {{were fixed}} to the jury mast, {{as it might be}} necessary, at any moment, to attempt to bring her up into the wind; and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck. Fortunately the night was a light one, for the moon was up, and the sky almost cloudless. The mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel; while the second mate took his place in the fore top, with a lantern, to signal the {{position}} of ice ahead. Fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about, and the <b>Paramatta</b> threaded her way through the larger bergs, without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent. It was a long and anxious night but, when morning broke, it was seen that the sea was now open ahead, and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind.|$|E
6000|$|The Active plied {{backwards}} and forwards, supplying {{them with the}} necessaries of life, and bringing guests to the farm at <b>Paramatta,</b> where Mr. Marsden provided instruction for them. Two, named Tooi and Teterree, were sent in charge of Mr. Nicholas to visit England in a King's ship, where they had learnt to speak English tolerably, and to follow the customs of civilized society. They were gentle and intelligent, and eager to learn, {{but no one could}} reckon on what would interest or excite them. They were taken to see St. Paul's Cathedral, which did not seem to strike them at all; but, as they were walking along Fleet Street, they came to a sudden stand before a hairdresser's shop, screaming out, [...] "Women, women," [...] as they beheld the display of waxen busts, which they thought did credit to the Pakeha, or English, style of preserving dried human heads! Like Duaterra, their great anxiety was to see King George; but, in 1817, the apology recorded in Teterree's English letter was only too true,--"I never see the King of England, he very poorly; and Queen Charlotte very poorly too." ...|$|E
