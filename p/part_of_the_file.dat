40|$|Managing file {{systems of}} large {{organizations}} can present significant challenges in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> users, shared access to <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system, and securing and monitoring critical <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system. We present an interactive exploratory tool for monitoring and viewing the complex relationships within <b>the</b> Andrews <b>File</b> System (AFS). This tool is targeted {{as an aid}} to system administrators to manage users, applications and shared access. We tested our tool on UNC Charlotteâ€™s Andrews File System (AFS) file system, which contains 4554 users, 556 user groups, and 2. 2 million directories. Two types of visualizations are supported to explore file system relationships. In addition, drill-down features are provided to access <b>the</b> user <b>file</b> system and access control information of any directory within <b>the</b> system.

50|$|In delta encoded {{transmission}} over {{a network}} where {{only a single}} copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is available at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communication channel, special error control codes are used to detect which <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> have changed since its previous version.For example, rsync uses a rolling checksum algorithm based on Mark Adler's adler-32 checksum.|$|R

50|$|CFS is {{stacked on}} top of the real file system and co-ordinates accesses from {{different}} nodes using a token mechanism. One node has physical access to the underlying file system and performs all read and write operations. At any one time one node owns a token, representing a part of the underlying file, this implies that that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is in the cache of the owning node. If another node tries to access that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> the token is stolen and the cache contents are copied to the stealing node. The OpenSSI CFS implementation is remarkably similar to that used by HP TruCluster.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{processor}} {{in this example}} cannot address RAM beyond 4 GB, the operating system may provide services to programs that envision a larger memory, such as files that can grow beyond <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> installed RAM. <b>The</b> operating system lets a program manipulate data in <b>the</b> <b>file</b> arbitrarily, using paging to bring <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> into RAM when necessary.|$|R
50|$|File {{extensions}} {{are often}} used in AmigaOS, {{but they are not}} mandatory and they are not handled specially by the DOS, being instead just a conventional <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> names. Executable programs are recognized using a magic number.|$|E
50|$|As {{the archive}} bit is a file {{attribute}} and not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> itself, {{the contents of}} the file are unrelated to the status of the archive bit and remain unchanged even if the setting of the archive bit is changed.|$|E

Files are considered as mount point directories from which views on <b>the</b> <b>files</b> are accessible as subdirectories and files with read and write permissions. Views are designated with logical formulas describing desired properties of views. They contain those <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>file</b> that satisfy <b>the</b> formulas. Properties are attached to <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> automatically via programs called transducers. A file system interface is used for querying views, navigating between views, and updating view contents...|$|R
