5|$|Since its creation, Bembo {{has enjoyed}} {{continuing}} popularity as an attractive, legible book typeface. Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books, the Everyman's Library series, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, Yale University Press and Edward Tufte. Bembo {{has been released}} in versions for <b>phototypesetting</b> and in several revivals as digital fonts by Monotype and other companies.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-digital period, IBM offered Aldine, a font {{inspired}} by Bembo, as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric golfball typewriter system, intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects, or for high-quality office documents. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, {{as it was}} displaced by cheaper <b>phototypesetting,</b> {{and then in the}} 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E
5|$|While {{extremely}} popular in Britain, {{and to a}} lesser extent in European printing, Gill Sans did not achieve popularity with American printers in the hot metal era, with most preferring gothic designs like Franklin Gothic and geometric designs like Futura and Monotype's own Twentieth Century. Gill Sans therefore particularly achieved worldwide popularity after the close of the metal type era and in the <b>phototypesetting</b> and digital era, when it became a system font on Macintosh computers and Microsoft Office. One use of Gill's work in the United States in this period, however, was a custom wordmark and logo made by Gill for Poetry magazine in 1930 based on Gill Sans. Its editor Harriet Monroe had seen Gill's work in London.|$|E
25|$|While the Allen and Unwin sheets {{appear to}} have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not <b>phototypeset</b> new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had {{accumulated}} up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the way it would with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its crispness, it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Hence, comparisons of type degradation to sort out the 15th, 16th, and 17th impressions would seem fruitless. Indeed, the 23rd impression's type block seems just as effectively identical.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of <b>phototypesetting,</b> which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
25|$|Vinholes {{advocated}} {{the importance of}} audio to Niikuni, after which Niikuni started to actively experiment with aural poetry. At the same time, reel to reel audio technology and <b>phototypesetting</b> were developed, and are seen to have {{had an effect on}} the style of expression in Zero-on and later works.|$|E
25|$|Ligatures {{began to}} fall out of use due to their {{complexity}} in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura. Inexpensive <b>phototypesetting</b> machines in the 1970s (which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them.|$|E
25|$|Caslon 223 and 224 were <b>phototypesetting</b> {{families}} {{designed by}} Ed Benguiat of Lubalin, Smith, Carnase and then ITC. Like many ITC families, {{they have an}} aggressive, advertising-oriented bold structure, not closely related to Caslon's original work. 223 was the first version (named for LSC's street number), a companion version with more body text-oriented proportions followed sequentially numbered 224.|$|E
25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as <b>phototypesetting,</b> utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive <b>phototypesetting</b> paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Each matrix {{contains}} the letter form {{for a single}} character of a font of type; i.e.,a particular type design in a particular size. The letter form is engraved into {{one side of the}} matrix. For sizes up to 14 points, and in some matrices of size 16 to 24 points, the matrix has two letter forms on it, the normal and auxiliary positions. The normal position has the upright (Roman) form of a given character, and on the auxiliary, the slanted (Italic) form of that character will be used, but this can also be the boldface form or even a different font entirely. The machine operator can select which of the two will be cast by operating the auxiliary rail of the assembler, or, when setting entire lines of italics, by using the flap, which is a piece that can be turned under a portion of the first elevator column. This is the origin of the old typesetting terms upper rail for italic and lower rail for Roman characters. These terms have persisted in <b>phototypesetting</b> technology even though the mechanics of the auxiliary rail do not exist there. The character on a Linotype matrix, when viewed, is not inverted as a letter for conventional movable type would be, and the letter is incised below the surface rather than raised above it. This is because the matrix is not used directly to print onto the paper—rather, it is used as part of a mold from which a metal slug will be cast. The slug has its features reversed: therefore, the matrix does not.|$|E

500|$|Besides designs {{with similar}} inspiration, {{a number of}} {{unofficial}} releases and digitisations of Bembo {{have been made in}} the <b>phototypesetting</b> and digital periods, reflecting the lack of effective intellectual property protection for typefaces. Several unofficial versions were released during the <b>phototypesetting</b> period under alternate names; for example one unofficial <b>phototypesetting</b> version was named [...] "Biretta" [...] after the hat worn by Roman Catholic clergy, and another by Erhard Kaiser was created for the East German printing concern Typoart, outside the reach of Western intellectual property laws. In the digital period, Rubicon created a version named [...] "Bentley" [...] intended for small sizes and Bitstream made a version under the name of [...] "Aldine 401". Its licensee ParaType later created a set of Cyrillic characters for this in 2008. The name [...] "Bembo" [...] remains a Monotype trademark and may not be used to describe such clones.|$|E

The fonts {{released}} in 1961 included Light 362, Series 262, Bold 275, Extra Bold 321, Condensed 343, {{all of which were}} {{released in}} film matrix sets [...] "A" [...] (6–7 points) and [...] "B" [...] (8–22, 24 points).|$|E
500|$|Technological {{advances}} began affecting sentence spacing methods. [...] In 1941, IBM {{introduced the}} Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing—which {{had been used}} in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. [...] This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic <b>phototypesetting</b> systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools. By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing.|$|E
2500|$|Caslon type again {{entered a}} new {{technology}} with <b>phototypesetting,</b> mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, and then again with digital typesetting technology. There are many typefaces called [...] "Caslon" [...] {{as a result of}} that and the lack of an enforceable trademark on the name [...] "Caslon" [...] by itself, which reproduce the original designs in varying degrees of faithfulness.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} of metal type, when each size was cut individually, display types were often cut that were {{adjusted}} for display use. [...] These modifications continued to be made even after fonts started {{to be made by}} scaling using a pantograph, but began to fade away with the advent of <b>phototypesetting</b> and then digital fonts, which can both be printed at any size. Premium digital fonts used for magazines, books and newspapers do often include display variants, but they are often not included with typefaces bundled with operating systems and desktop publishing software.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a number}} of years after its introduction, the Selectric Composer was {{considered}} to be a highly desirable, powerful desk-sized cold type setting system, affordable by small businesses and organizations. It was usually leased, including a service contract for the skilled labor required to fix and adjust it. [...] The Selectric Composer was accorded respect and affection among small publishers, unrivaled until the appearance of the Apple Macintosh, laser printer, and desktop publishing software. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, as it was displaced by cheaper <b>phototypesetting,</b> and then in the 1980s by word processors and general-purpose computers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{linotype}} machine ( [...] ) is a [...] "line casting" [...] machine used in printing {{sold by the}} Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype {{became one of the}} mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19thcentury to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by <b>phototypesetting,</b> offset lithography printing and computer typesetting. The name of the machine {{comes from the fact that}} it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e.,manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and drawers of letters.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the end of}} mass use {{of metal}} type, Akzidenz-Grotesk has been rereleased and adapted in {{versions}} for the new <b>phototypesetting</b> and digital technologies. Contemporary versions of Akzidenz-Grotesk descend from a late-1950s project, directed by Jimmy Lazar at Berthold, to enlarge the typeface family, adding a larger character set, but retaining idiosyncrasies. Under the direction of Günter Gerhard Lange, he had designed 33 font styles to the Akzidenz-Grotesk family, including AG Extra (1958), AG Extra Bold (1966) and AG Super (1968), AG Super Italic (2001) and Extra Bold italic (2001). Karl Gerstner and other designers at his company GGK Basel launched a project in the 1960s to build Akzidenz-Grotesk into a coherent series, to match the new families appearing in the same style; it was used by Berthold for its Diatype system in the late 60s {{under the name of}} [...] "Gerstner-Programm".|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{there has}} been a designer-led trend towards closer-fitted text in general. For example, an {{increasing}} number of computer font design guidelines now recommend the use of quarter-em spaces rather than third-em spaces. With regard to spacing, modern designers are retracing the steps of the 19th-century design-led typographer William Morris. Morris rejected the restrictions of commercial typesetting which at the time demanded traditional typesetting's spacing rules, and, declaring a [...] "rage for beauty", advocated close-set type and dark [...] "colour" [...] (lack of whitespace, creating uniformity of appearance). However, the reason Donald Knuth gave for creating the TeX typesetting system was his dismay on receiving the proofs of a new edition of his book The Art of Computer Programming at the unreadability of the then new close-fitted <b>phototypesetting</b> technology, which he described as [...] "awful" [...] due to its [...] "poor spacing". The leading style guides of Morris's time documented that readers of the time had the same reaction to Morris's output as Knuth did later to phototypesetting's output. De Vinne, for example, wrote in The Practice of Typography: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} paper volume of Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming was {{published}} in 1968, it was typeset using hot metal typesetting set by a Monotype Corporation typecaster. This method, {{dating back to the}} 19th century, produced a [...] "good classic style" [...] appreciated by Knuth. When the second edition of the second volume was published, in 1976, the whole book had to be typeset again because the Monotype technology had been largely replaced by <b>phototypesetting,</b> and the original fonts were no longer available. When Knuth received the galley proofs of the new book on 30 March 1977, he found them awful. Around that time, Knuth saw {{for the first time the}} output of a high-quality digital typesetting system, and became interested in digital typography. The disappointing galley proofs gave him the final motivation to solve the problem at hand once and for all by designing his own typesetting system. On 13 May 1977, he wrote a memo to himself describing the basic features of TeX.}} ...|$|E
