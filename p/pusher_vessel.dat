500|$|For centuries, the Doom Bar was {{regarded}} as a significant danger to ships—to be approached with caution to avoid running aground. When sails were the main source of power, ships coming round Stepper Point would lose the wind, causing loss of steerage, leaving them to drift away from the channel. Sometimes, gusts of wind known colloquially as [...] "flaws" [...] blew over Stepper Point and <b>pushed</b> <b>vessels</b> towards the sandbank. Dropping anchor would not help, as it could not gain a firm hold on the sand. Richard Hellyer, the Sub-Commissioner of Pilotage at Padstow, gave evidence in 1859 that the Doom Bar {{was regarded}} as so dangerous that in a storm, vessels would risk being wrecked on the coast rather than negotiate the channel to Padstow harbour.|$|R

25|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory is that high transmural pressures lead to pulmonary capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary capillary transmural pressure is determined by pulmonary capillary pressure and airway pressure. The horse has very high pulmonary vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 mmHg in the pulmonary artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood <b>vessels</b> <b>pushing</b> out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood <b>vessels</b> <b>pushing</b> out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls.|$|R

25|$|J.J. Smith {{operated}} the Star of Bengal for 7 more years, mainly for grain and coal trade.

50|$|On a {{power-driven}} ship, {{the drive}} shaft, or propeller shaft, usually connects the transmission inside the vessel {{directly to the}} propeller, passing through a stuffing box or other seal at the point it exits the hull. There is also a thrust block, a bearing to resist the axial force of the propeller. As the rotating propeller <b>pushes</b> the <b>vessel</b> forward, any length of drive shaft between propeller and thrust block is subject to compression, and when going astern to tension. Except for the very smallest of boats, this force isn't taken on the gearbox or engine directly.|$|R

50|$|Captain James Thomas was {{in charge}} of Postboy on 15 December 1876 about 11-12 miles (20 km) off Glenelg when a sudden squall struck. She was {{returning}} from Port MacDonnell, South Australia to Port Adelaide, South Australia, with a small cargo of bark and stone ballast and seven people on board. The wind <b>pushed</b> the <b>vessel</b> bodily over and she lay on her side with sails floating in the water, resulting in the loss of 6 lives. Thomas was drowned and his body was found on Kirkcaldy Beach on 26 December 1876. His wife Sarah was pregnant with daughter Edith Emily at the time.|$|R
50|$|The ferries {{are known}} for their ability to operate in very heavy seas. The reason {{services}} are usually suspended is not because the ferries cannot cope with the heavy winds and waves of the Mersey, it is because berthing the vessel can be extremely hazardous. When berthing the vessel, the captain uses a combination of rudder positions and engine movements. The ferries all have Fletner system rudders which make them much more manoeuvrable. By using the vessel's twin screws, captains can move the vessels away by using one engine to <b>push</b> the <b>vessel</b> from the stage and the rudders and other engine to point it into the correct direction.|$|R
50|$|The common oceans, {{parts of}} the water that are beyond each country’s 200-mile limit, are not being managed properly. Stinting is the favoured method of {{management}} around those areas, where each vessel catches {{a limited amount of}} fish. However, {{it does not seem to}} work, as two species of large toothfish around Antarctica have gone extinct. The vessel construction industry is <b>pushing</b> more <b>vessels</b> to fish in those unregulated areas as fish stocks decrease. For example, the Irish domestic pelagic fleet is already 40% larger than the EU fleet limits. Yet, new fishing vessels, such as the Atlantic Dawn with over 15 000 tons, are being produced because of the entrenched interests business and political interests.|$|R

60|$|By {{the time}} they reached the galley and prizes, the eleven fire ships were a mass of flame, which was {{spreading}} to the corsairs. Lying packed together as these were, the confusion was terrible. Numbers of men endeavoured to push off the fire ships, but it was too late; others tried to extricate their galleys from the mass, throwing off the hawsers, and striving with hand and oar to <b>push</b> their <b>vessels</b> out of the line. As soon as the boats were alongside the galley, the guns of the four vessels opened fire with grape into the crowded ships, now lit up by the flames as clearly as at noontide, while the battle cry of the Order sounded high above the din.|$|R
5000|$|... "Articulated tug and barge" [...] (ATB) units also utilize {{mechanical}} {{means to}} connect to their barges. The tug slips into a notch in the stern and is attached by a hinged connection. ATBs generally utilize Intercon and Bludworth connecting systems.

50|$|For a {{few weeks}} crews {{who had participated in}} the rescue were treated as heroes, {{especially}} Captain Greig and the crew of Ladybird. In the community, businesses and individuals raised money for the Admella Shipwreck Reward and Relief Fund for rescuers and survivors. After the commission of inquiry into the wreck of Admella, the loss was attributed to the effects of a current that <b>pushed</b> the <b>vessel</b> off course, although investigations were also held into a magnetic disturbance in the area that may have affected the compasses on iron-hulled ships. The commission found that a contributing factor had been the way that the watertight bulkheads had been inserted - the holes for the hundreds of rivets had weakened the metal. The inquest also resulted in the installation of the telegraph at Cape Northumberland and in 1881 a lighthouse was built at Cape Banks.|$|R
40|$|Xylem {{vessels in}} grapevines Vitis labrusca L. and Vitis riparia Michx. growing in New England {{contained}} air over winter and yet filled with xylem sap and recovered their maximum hydraulic conductance {{during the month}} before leaf expansion in late May. During this period root pressures between 10 and 100 kilopascals were measured. Although some air in vessels apparently dissolved in ascending xylem sap, results indicated that some is <b>pushed</b> out of <b>vessels</b> and then out of the vine. Air in the vessel network distal to advancing xylem sap was compressed at about 3 kilopascals; independent measurements indicated this was sufficient to <b>push</b> air across <b>vessel</b> ends, and from vessels to the exterior through dead vine tips, inflorescence scars, and points on the bark. Once wetted, vessel ends previously air-permeable at 3 kilopascals remained sealed against air at pressures up to 2 and 3 megapascals. Permeability at 3 kilopascals was restored by dehydrating vines below − 2. 4 megapascals. We suggest that the decrease in permeability with hydration is due to formation of water films across pores in intervascular pit membranes; this water seal can maintain a pressure difference of roughly 2 megapascals, and prevents cavitation by aspirated air at xylem pressures less negative than − 2. 4 megapascals...|$|R
50|$|One {{day in his}} {{new home}} Badang saw fifty men trying to push a heavy boat into the water. Badang {{continually}} offered to help but the men refused, saying that no one so small would make any difference. The king Paduka Seri Rana Wikrama eventually sent for 300 men to help <b>push</b> the <b>vessel</b> but it was to no avail. When he saw Badang being refused, the king gave Badang the chance to push the boat by himself.

He was summoned to the court of Seri Rana Wikrama and was asked to display his strength. The king ordered several of his ministers to sit on a long bench, which Badang lifted effortlessly. After this, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the army.|$|R
50|$|In {{difficult}} cases or {{in situations}} where intervention to restore blood flow is appropriate, coronary angiography can be performed. A catheter is inserted into an artery (usually the femoral artery) and <b>pushed</b> to the <b>vessels</b> supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and angioplasty applied as a therapeutic measure (see below). Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in interventional cardiology.|$|R
