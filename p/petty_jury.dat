2500|$|The Commission Court {{opened on}} 20 May, and Baron Lefroy {{proceeded}} {{to charge the}} grand jury. On Monday the foreman handed down a true bill against Mitchel. The Clerk of the Crown asked for what the bill was. To illustrate the rapidity with which the whole case was despatched; and the absolute indifference [...] "whether there was justice done or not," [...] P.A. Sillard, one of Mitchel's biographers, quoted from the speech of Mitchel's defence Council Robert Holms, [...] "The foreman of the Grand Jury, gentlemen, having been asked if the jury had found bills against the prisoner—replied— 'Oh yes, we find him guilty of sedition.' 'Gentlemen,' said the officer of the court, 'he is not indicted for sedition.' 'Well,' said the fore man, 'we find him guilty of treason.' 'But, gentlemen,' again interrupted the officer, 'the charge against Mr Mitchel is for felony.' 'Oh, no matter!' said the foreman, 'sedition, treason, or felony, {{it is all the}} same to us." [...] Sillard concluded, [...] "Justice! the thing is not to be had in British law courts. The <b>petty</b> <b>jury</b> having been sworn, the remaining portion of this awful scene was very quickly gone through." ...|$|E
6000|$|As the Wesley tale {{is a very}} typical {{instance}} {{of a very large}} class, our study of it may exempt us from printing the well-known parallel case of [...] "The Drummer of Tedworth". Briefly, the house of Mr. Mompesson, near Ludgarshal, in Wilts, was disturbed in the usual way, for at least two years, from April, 1661, to April, 1663, or later. The noises, and copious phenomena of moving objects apparently untouched, were attributed to the unholy powers of a wandering drummer, deprived by Mr. Mompesson of his drum. A grand jury presented the drummer for trial, on a charge of witchcraft, but the <b>petty</b> <b>jury</b> would not convict, there being a want of evidence to prove threats, malum minatum, by the drummer. In 1662 the Rev. Joseph Glanvil, F.R.S., visited the house, and, in the bedroom of Mr. Mompesson's little girls, the chief sufferers, heard and saw much the same phenomena as the elder Wesley describes in his own nursery. The [...] "little modest girls" [...] were aged about seven and eight. Charles II. sent some gentlemen to the house for one night, when nothing occurred, the disturbances being intermittent. Glanvil published his narrative at the time, and Mr. Pepys found it [...] "not very convincing". Glanvil, in consequence of his book, was so vexed by correspondents [...] "that I have been haunted almost as bad as Mr. Mompesson's house". A report that imposture had been discovered, and confessed by Mr. Mompesson, was set afloat, by John Webster, in a well-known work, and may still be found in modern books. Glanvil denied it till he was [...] "quite tired," [...] and Mompesson gave a formal denial in a letter dated Tedworth, 8th November, 1672. He also, with many others, swore to the facts on oath, in court, at the drummer's trial. {221} ...|$|E

40|$|Difficulties in {{securing}} convictions in nineteenth-century Ireland led {{the authorities to}} resort to various methods of ensuring that <b>petty</b> <b>juries</b> delivered guilty verdicts in cases where this was clearly warranted by the evidence. This article examines some of the ‘stratagems’ put forward by David Johnson and suggests {{a number of other}} practices which were used, arguing that many of these mechanisms centred around controlling the composition of trial juries. Examples included altering the property qualifications for jurors, the system of asking jurors to ‘stand aside’ and the use of fines to compel attendance. While some of these were the legitimate exercise of established procedures, it will be seen that the crown on occasion abused or overused its powers...|$|R
50|$|The assizes {{themselves}} {{consisted of}} a judge of the Court of King's Bench, or after the Judicature (Ireland) Acts, the High Court of Justice in Ireland, sitting with a <b>petty</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|E
50|$|If a {{bill was}} thrown out, {{although}} {{it could not}} again be preferred {{to the grand jury}} during the same assizes or sessions, it could be preferred at subsequent assizes or sessions, but not in respect of the same offence if a <b>petty</b> <b>jury</b> had returned a verdict.|$|E
50|$|Trial by jury is {{available}} only for severe criminal cases, which are {{the jurisdiction of the}} Courts of Assizes. A full Court is made up of a 3-judge panel and a <b>petty</b> <b>jury</b> of 9 jurors (vs. 12 jurors on appeal), who, together, render verdicts, and if a conviction is handed down, also determine a sentence. Jurors are selected at random from eligible voters.|$|E
5000|$|A general pardon {{was issued}} {{at the start}} of August 1763 for all Hearts of Oak who would return to their homes, {{and by the end of}} August the Hearts of Oak had been subdued. This pardon however {{excluded}} those who had already been arrested or previously indicted, of which some would need to be the subject of [...] "exemplary" [...] punishment. These trials however descended into farce when only one Oakboy brought to trial was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, with all other defendants acquitted. This may have been due to the fact the charges labelled against them were of treason, with the sole Oakboy found guilty being charged as such for treating a clergyman [...] "very ill". <b>Petty</b> <b>juries</b> didn't like charges such as this, especially when death was the penalty, and it is suggested that the juries were made up of people who sympathised with the Hearts of Oak.|$|R
50|$|Although he was {{specially}} {{qualified to}} survey new highways, {{he did do}} other public service work, being on several <b>petty</b> and grand <b>juries.</b> He also served on civil case juries in late 1639, March 1640, mid-and-late 1642 and March 1643 court sessions. Most of the civil case involved trespass, debts or slander. He was also on grand juries in 1638, 1640, 1642 and 1643 which involved crimes of a misdemeanor or felony nature.|$|R
5000|$|The Charters Towers {{courthouse}} {{was constructed}} by contractor Charles Miller {{at a cost}} of £4650 and opened on 9 February 1887. The local newspaper, The Northern Miner, indulged in some critical remarks about the appearance of the building, describing it as [...] "unpretentious", but admitted that it was commodious and well ventilated. In general style and layout it resembled that of the courthouse at Mackay, built about the same time. Apart from the court, rooms were provided for the judge, police magistrate, Clerk of <b>Petty</b> Sessions, <b>jury,</b> witnesses and gold warden, plus a number of other offices. Even so, by 1890 the building had become inadequate, reflecting the rapid growth of the city. Local building contractor, Benjamin Toll, was employed to construct a large brick extension with verandahs on three sides alongside the court and connected to it.|$|R

5000|$|Potts {{has been}} {{described}} as an [...] "active and selective reporter"; he omits significant details of court procedure in the early 17th-century English legal process, such as that all indictments were initially submitted to a grand jury, whose task was to decide whether there was a prima facie case against the accused before the prisoners were taken into the courtroom to be tried by the <b>petty</b> <b>jury,</b> the forerunner of the modern jury. The accused witches would not have been tried separately as Potts' account suggests, but in groups. Potts also represents written depositions {{as if they had been}} spoken in court, and he almost certainly [...] "improved" [...] Bromley's speeches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first case}} decided by an English jury in India {{happened}} in Madras in 1665, for which Ascentia Dawes (probably a British woman) was charged by {{a grand jury}} {{with the murder of}} her slave girl, and a <b>petty</b> <b>jury,</b> with six Englishmen and six Portuguese, found her not guilty. With the development of the East India Company empire in India, the jury system was implemented inside a dual system of courts: In Presidency Towns (Calcutta, Madras, Bombay), there were Crown Courts and in criminal cases juries had to judge British and European people (as a privilege) and in some cases Indian people; and in the territories outside the Presidency Towns (called [...] "moffussil"), there were Company Courts (composed with Company officials) without jury to judge most of the cases implying indigenous people.|$|E
60|$|I am {{confident}} your lordship {{will be of}} my sentiments in one thing, that some short plain authentic tract might be published for the information both of <b>petty</b> and grand <b>juries,</b> how far their power reacheth, {{and where it is}} limited, and that a printed copy of such a treatise might be deposited in every court, to be consulted by the jurymen before they consider of their verdict; by which abundance of inconveniences would be avoided, whereof innumerable instances might be produced from former times, because I will say nothing of the present.|$|R
50|$|The 1880s saw an {{expansion}} in police numbers and in court cases as the Queensland economy enjoyed a boom and people {{poured into the}} colony. Police numbers were expanded and police and judiciary facilities constructed at such a pace that it became difficult to obtain suitably qualified contractors. The sugar industry was also booming and Mackay was amongst those regional centres where substantial new court houses were erected. In 1884 contracts for a new court house were prepared following {{the construction of new}} police stables and lock-up keeper's quarters.The new court house was designed by noted architect John James Clark, who was at the time Queensland Colonial Architect. Clark was born and trained in Liverpool, England. He arrived in Melbourne in 1853 and won a number of architectural competitions, his success in such competitions being a feature of his career. He designed some major public buildings in Melbourne, including the Treasury. He moved to Sydney in 1881 and in 1883 had become Queensland Colonial Architect. Although he left the position in 1885, he was responsible for some important public buildings including courthouses at Charters Towers, Rockhampton and Warwick. They and the Mackay court house were designed in the classical revival style thought appropriate for public buildings intended to convey a sense of stability and dignity, particularly a court house which represented the power of the law. The contractor for the work was Denis Kelleher and the cost on completion, including a strong room and furniture, was £4499/8/7. The court house was a single storey building with rooms extended to each side of the front entrance containing barristers and witnesses' rooms and which were later extended by one room on each side. Behind the bench were rooms for the judge, police magistrates, Clerk of <b>Petty</b> Sessions and <b>Jury.</b> It was opened on 27 May 1886 and the first local sitting of the Supreme Court was held on 15 June 1886.|$|R
50|$|Skelton's first {{publication}} was an anonymous pamphlet {{in favour of}} Samuel Molyneux Madden's scheme for premiums in Trinity College. He published anonymous discourses against Socinians, and in 1736 an attack on Benjamin Hoadly's views of the Eucharist, entitled A Vindication of the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Winchester, whom he ironically supposes incapable of having written the book attributed to him. His next publication Some Proposals for the Revival of Christianity (1736) was again ironical; Jonathan Swift was at first suspected of the authorship. In 1737 Skelton published A Dissertation on the Constitution and Effects of a <b>Petty</b> <b>Jury</b> endeavouring to show that such juries led to false swearing, and in 1741 The Necessity of Tillage and Granaries, {{as well as an}} account in the Philosophical Transactions of an extraordinary development of caterpillars seen in Ireland in 1737.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{jury trial}} decided by an English jury in India {{happened}} in Madras (now Chennai) in 1665, for which Ascentia Dawes (probably a British woman) was charged by {{a grand jury}} {{with the murder of}} her slave girl, and a <b>petty</b> <b>jury,</b> with six Englishmen and six Portuguese, found her not guilty.

"This year John Billington {{the elder}} (one that came {{over with the}} first) was arraigned; and both by grand, and <b>petty</b> <b>jury</b> found guilty of willful murder; by plain and notorious evidence. And was for the same {{accordingly}} executed. This {{as it was the}} first execution amongst them, so was it a matter of great sadness unto them; they used all due means about his trial, and took the advice of Mr. Winthrop, and other the ablest gentlemen in the Bay of Massachusetts, that were then newly come over, who concurred with them that he ought to die, and the land be purged from blood. He and some of his, had been often punished for miscarriages before, being one of the profanest families amongst them; ... His fact was, that he waylaid a young man, one John Newcomen (about a former quarrel) and shot him with a gun, whereof he died." ...|$|E
50|$|In common law, a {{petit jury}} (or trial jury, {{sometimes}} <b>petty</b> <b>jury)</b> hears {{the evidence in}} a trial as presented by both the plaintiff (petitioner) and the defendant (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions {{it may be a}} majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury. The size of the jury varies; in criminal cases involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors, although Scotland uses 15. A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi-juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases. However, the common law trial jury is {{the most common type of}} jury system.|$|E

5000|$|The charge {{having been}} delivered, {{the grand jury}} withdrew to their own room, having {{received}} the bills of indictment. The witnesses whose names were endorsed on each bill were sworn as they came to be examined, {{in the grand jury}} room, the oath being administered by the foreman, who wrote his initials against the name of the witness {{on the back of the}} bill. Only the witnesses for the prosecution were examined, as the function of the grand jury was merely to inquire whether there was sufficient ground to put the accused on trial. If the majority of them (and at least 12) thought that the evidence so adduced made out a sufficient case, the words [...] "a true bill" [...] were endorsed on the back of the bill. If they were of the opposite opinion, the phrase [...] "not a true bill", or the single Latin word ignoramus ("we do not know" [...] or [...] "we are ignorant (of)"), was endorsed instead and the bill was said to be [...] "ignored" [...] or thrown out. They could find a true bill as to the charge in one count, and ignore that in another; or as to one defendant and not as to another; but they could not, like a <b>petty</b> <b>jury,</b> return a special or conditional finding, or select part of a count as true and reject the other part. When some bills were [...] "found", some of the jurors came out and handed the bills to the clerk of arraigns (in assizes) or clerk of the peace, who announced to the court the name of the prisoner, the charge, and the endorsements of the grand jury. They then retired and considered other bills until all were disposed of; after which they were discharged by the judge, chairman, or recorder.|$|E
