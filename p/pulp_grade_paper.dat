40|$|Many {{forests in}} the {{interior}} western region of the United States consist of densely stocked small-diameter trees of mixed softwood species. These forests have a potential for large-scale insect infestations, disease, and fire. Active management of these forests is costly and will probably generate a large volume of materials with very little commercial value. Using these materials to produce certain <b>grades</b> of <b>paper</b> might bring economic and environmental benefits. The principal wood species found in these forests are western larch, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish the suitability of kraft pulping of interior western small-diameter matured softwoods for production of packaging <b>grades</b> of <b>paper</b> from high kappa number pulps. The kraft pulping process, suitable for all wood species, was used in the preparation of packaging <b>grade</b> handsheets. <b>Pulps</b> were prepared at around 70 kappa using the same liquor concentration and liquor to wood ratio but cooking to various H-factors. The pulp yield varied significantly even at similar kappa numbers for the various wood species. Mechanical properties of handsheets differed significantly for different raw materials when compared at similar CSF and sheet density levels. Adhesion-based properties, such as tensile strength and burst index values were highest for lodgepole pine and lowest for western larch and Douglas-fir/western larch mixture. However, tear values were highest for western larch and lowest for lodgepole pine. The vacuum compression apparatus (VCA) compression test was also performed to evaluate the suitability of the <b>pulps</b> for packaging <b>grade</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the main}} {{interest}} for kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) {{is due to}} the peculiar characteristics of the stem and of its fibres in particular. The two main components of the stem are the external part, containing the longer fibres (bark), and the inner part containing shorter fibres (core). The outer bark fibres are very appreciated for several industrial products, as high <b>grade</b> <b>pulps</b> for <b>paper,</b> composite boards and textiles (Mc Millin et al., 1998). Conversely, the inner core fibres have a smaller market value and are suitable for products such as pulps for packaging, animal bedding, sorbents and horticultural mixes (Muzzarelli, 1994). Therefore, for defining the industrial quality of stalks, the bark : core ratio {{is one of the most}} important parameters to evaluate. In this work data from a research carried out in southern Italy are reported, to assess the pattern and some relationships of the bark : core ratio during the whole crop cycle of the kenaf...|$|R
40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} mills {{generate}} various quantities of energy-rich biomass as wastes, depending on technological level, <b>pulp</b> and <b>paper</b> <b>grades</b> and wood quality. These wastes are produced in {{all stages of}} the process: wood preparation, pulp and paper manufacture, chemical recovery, recycled paper processing, waste water treatment. Energy recovery from wastes of different origin has become a generally accepted alternative to their disposal. Pulp and paper industry expresses an interest in adapting and integrating advanced biomass energy conversion technologies into its mill operations. Industrial adoption of these new technologies {{has the potential for}} higher efficiency, lower capital cost, and safer operation than conventional operations that burn fossil fuels for energy. Incineration with energy recovery has the advantage of hygienic disposal, volume reduction, and the recovery of thermal energy by means of steam or super heated water {{that can be used for}} heating and power generation. The paper reviews the current state and tendencies in using as a fuel of solid wastes generated in pulp and paper mills. A description of biomass-derived wastes regarding their opportunity to be used for energy recovery is presented.

40|$|A {{sheet of}} paper is {{modelled}} as a two-dimensional network of cellulose fibres. The fibres {{are assumed to be}} either cylindrical or band-shaped. Both well-ordered fibrous structures and fibrous structures in which a random arrangement of fibres is assumed are studied. The equations for creeping flow through such structures are solved, and the calculated permeabilities are compared with measured values. Flow through such paper structures as pulp sheets and handsheets of unbeaten sulphate pulp is found to be adequately described by a structural model that assumes cellulose fibres to be band-shaped when a fibre aspect ratio of 3. 5 (well-ordered structure) or 5 (random fibre distribution) is used. These values of the fibre aspect ratio compare favourably with the values used when gas diffusion through the same sheets is modelled. For newsprint sheets the measured permeability is found to be lower than that predicted by the models when physically realistic values for the aspect ratio are taken. It is also found that for all the <b>pulp</b> and <b>paper</b> <b>grades</b> investigated (a total of 19) the measured permeabilities and effective diffusivities correlate with each other.

Both entrained and dissolved gases can be found from virtually all pulp flows, but fast and accurate inline measurement technique for gas content measurement has yet to been established. In these experiments new sonar technique for gas content measurement was tested. Experiments where done in pilot-scale pumping system where pulp suspension was circulated with centrifugal pump in closed loop. Measurements where located in the vertical outlet pipe of the pump. Air content of the system could be adjusted with two different principles. Macro bubbles (> 100 µm) were fed to the system through membrane tube controlling volumetric air flow with rotameters. Micro bubbles (= 20 - 100 µm) were created precipitating bubbles from dissolved form controlling the level of dissolved oxygen and volumetric flow of the supersaturated suspension. Measurement accuracy of the sonar method was tested with four different air content levels and two different bubble types. Furthermore the effect <b>pulp</b> <b>grade,</b> consistency, flow velocity and process pressure were tested. Microwave and radiometric methods were used as reference measurements.

A joint study was undertaken to evaluate the wood and pulp quality from fast-grown 14 -year-old loblolly pine from the Piedmont and 17 -year-old slash pine from the Coastal Plain. The properties were compared to 24 -year-old plantation-grown controls. ~hree sets of chip samples, sawmill residial, top log, and whole stem, were prepared &om each wood source. Two unbleached <b>pulp</b> <b>grades,</b> linerboard at kappa no. 90 and sack kraft at kappa no. 60, were prepared from each chip sample, and the pulp yields, fiber lengths, and handsheet properties were compared.

40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} is currently facing broad structural changes due to global shifts in demand and supply. These changes have significant impacts on national economies worldwide. In this paper, we describe the recent trends in the pulp and recovered paper (RP) production, and estimate augmented gravity models of bilateral trade for chemical pulp and RP exports with panel data. According to our results, there is some variation in the effects of the traditional gravity-model variables between <b>pulp</b> <b>grades</b> and RP. The results imply also that, in comparison to export supply, import demand plays a larger role in determining the volume of exports. Finally, it is evident that Asia, particularly China, is the most important driver of chemical pulp and RP trade: China is hungry for fiber, and must import to satisfy its growing needs. Moreover, the speed of China’s growth in chemical pulp and RP imports has been driving the increased significance of planted forests in the exports of hardwood pulp (BHKP) as well.

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching, and paper production. The type of pulping {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. Sulphite pulping is one of the chemical pulping processes that can be used. It involves chemically pulping the wood using SO 2 adsorbed in a base solution. Sulphite pulping produces a weaker paper than some other types of pulping, but the pulp is less coloured, making it more suitable for printing, often with little bleaching. The production of sulphite pulps (European Commission 2001) is much smaller than the production of kraft pulps and sulphite pulps are more used in special purposes in papermaking rather than being an alternative market <b>pulp</b> <b>grade</b> for kraft <b>pulps.</b> Very little unbleached sulphite pulp is made and the yield is a little higher which can be attributed to the lower pH in the cooking.
