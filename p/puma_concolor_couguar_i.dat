50|$|On March 2, 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{declared}} the Eastern cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> officially extinct.|$|R
50|$|The North American cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar),</b> is the cougar {{subspecies}} once {{commonly found}} in eastern North America and still prevalent in the western half of the continent.|$|R
50|$|Animal {{species in}} the area include beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), wolf (Canis lupus), boreal {{woodland}} caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), North American cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> and blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus).|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Culver et al., {{recommended}} {{that based on}} recent genetic research, all North American cougars be classified as a single subspecies, <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar</b> following the oldest named subspecies (Kerr in 1792).|$|R
50|$|The Florida panther is an {{endangered}} population of cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor)</b> {{that lives in}} forests and swamps of southern Florida in the United States. Its current taxonomic status (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> coryi or <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> is unresolved, but recent genetic research alone does not alter the legal conservation status. Florida panthers are usually found in pinelands, hardwood hammocks, and mix swamp forests.|$|R
50|$|Eastern cougar or eastern <b>puma</b> (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> {{refers to}} the extinct {{subspecies}} or extirpated population of cougars that once lived in northeastern North America. The eastern cougars were deemed extinct by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) evaluation in 2011, while a parallel Canadian organization has taken no position on the question.|$|R
50|$|The {{preserve}} {{is highly}} diverse biologically. Dominated by a wet cypress forest, it is host to {{an array of}} flora and fauna, including mangroves, orchids, alligators, venomous snakes like the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti) and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), a variety of birds, the Florida panther, (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> and the Florida black bear.|$|R
50|$|The 2005 {{edition of}} Mammal Species of the World {{followed}} Culverâ€™s recommendations. This revision {{was made by}} Dr. W. Chris Wozencraft of Bethel University, Indiana, as the sole reviewer. However, the publication's Web site as of 2011, {{as well as that}} of its affiliate, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, continued to maintain the <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar</b> (both western and eastern cougars) as a subspecies of <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor.</b>|$|R
50|$|As well {{as several}} {{previous}} subspecies of cougar of the western United States and western Canada, <b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar</b> encompasses the remaining populations of the eastern cougar, where the cat was {{also known as the}} panther, the only unequivocally known of which is the critically endangered Florida panther population. Many extinct populations, such as the Wisconsin cougar, which was extirpated in 1925, are also included in the subspecies.|$|R
50|$|A genetic {{study of}} cougar {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has reported that}} many of the supposed subspecies are too similar to be recognized as distinct, suggesting a reclassification of the Florida panther and numerous other subspecies into a single North American cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar).</b> Following the research, the canonical Mammal Species of the World (3rd edition) ceased to recognize the Florida panther as a unique subspecies, collapsing it and others into the North American cougar.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{habitat of}} the Clayoquot Biosphere is {{temperate}} rainforest (Coastal Western Hemlock), covering 85% of the terrestrial component and extending to altitudes of about 900 m. The habitat {{is dominated by}} large trees including the Western Hemlock, Western Red Cedar, Amabilis Fir, Western Yellow Cedar, Sitka Spruce, Pine, Douglas Fir, Yew and Red Alder. There are approximately 300 vertebrae species, including the American black bear (Ursus americanus), cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar),</b> American mink (Neovison vison) and grey wolf (Canis lupus).|$|R
50|$|As with West Virginia's remote {{mountain}} forests, {{the farms}} and lands with meadows and woodlots near urban areas also hold whitetail deer, chipmunks, raccoons, skunks, groundhogs, opossums, weasels, field mice, flying squirrels, cotton-tail rabbits, gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat {{to name a}} few. Bobcats, snowshoe hares, wild boars and black bears are not strictly found in deepest forests and parks of West Virginia. But, the mink, beaver and at one time the eastern cougar (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar)</b> are very rarely seen near farms, even the farthest from towns.|$|R
40|$|Pumas {{are one of}} {{the most}} studied {{terrestrial}} mammals because of their widespread distribution, substantial ecological impacts, and conflicts with humans. Extensive efforts, often employing genetic methods, are undertaken to manage this species. However, the comparison of population genetic data is difficult because few of the microsatellite loci chosen are shared across research programs. Here, we describe the development of PumaPlex, a high-throughput assay to genotype 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms in pumas. We validated PumaPlex in more than 700 North American <b>pumas</b> (<b>Puma</b> <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar),</b> and demonstrated its ability to generate reproducible genotypes and accurately identify individuals. Furthermore, we compared PumaPlex with traditional genotyping of 12 microsatellite loci in fecal DNA samples and found that PumaPlex produced significantly more genotypes with fewer false alleles. PumaPlex promotes the cross-laboratory comparison of genotypes, is easily expandable in the future, and is a valuable tool for the genetic monitoring and management of North American puma populations...|$|R

50|$|In 1792, Robert Kerr of the Royal Physical Society and Royal Society of Surgeons {{assigned}} the name Felis couguar to eastern North America cougars north of Florida. John Audubon in 1851 believed that cougars in both North and South America were indistinguishable. The eastern cougar was first {{assigned to the}} subspecies Felis <b>concolor</b> <b>couguar</b> and the Florida panther (F. c. coryi). Young and Goldman based their description of the eastern subspecies on their examination of eight of the existing 26 historic specimens.|$|R
