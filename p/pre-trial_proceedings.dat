500|$|In June 2006, <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{began in}} Grasse, before the {{investigating}} Magistrate, Catherine Bonnici. The proceedings {{were part of}} the French investigative process that is used to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to send a case to trial. During the first week of June, the court travelled to the site where the peer's body was found. Mohamed M'Barek was transported in leg chains for the one-day reenactment. Once they arrived, M'Barek demonstrated that he had enough strength to have acted alone. He managed to lift a [...] dummy — the same weight as Shaftesbury's body — out of the boot of a car and dump it down a ravine.|$|E
500|$|In <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the {{government}} stipulated that Noriega had received $322,000 from the U.S. Army and the CIA. Noriega {{insisted that he}} had in fact been paid close to $10,000,000, {{and that he should}} be allowed to testify about the work he had done for the U.S. government. The district court held that information about the operations in which Noriega had played a part supposedly in return for payment from the U.S. was not relevant to his defense. It ruled that [...] "the tendency of such evidence to confuse the issues before the jury substantially outweighed any probative value it might have had." [...] One of the witnesses in the trial was Floyd Carlton, who had previously flown shipments of drugs for Noriega.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> Judge Mira {{found that}} there was {{insufficient}} evidence that the defendants were gang members and ruled that any evidence of gang membership would be excluded. [...] Notwithstanding this ruling, during cross-examination the prosecution twice asked Jason Holland about Gumbys, including asking him if he was a member. [...] Judge Mira instructed the jury to ignore these questions. [...] During closing arguments, the prosecution again strongly suggested the existence of gang activity. [...] These suggestions of gang activity would be brought up in the defendants' later appeal as prejudicial misconduct that deprived them of their right to a fair trial.|$|E

50|$|Judges of the {{competition}} include ICC judges and officers, and teams have to present arguments based on a fictitious problem via the roles of prosecution counsel, defence counsel, government counsel, or victim's representative. The arguments made usually relate to <b>pre-trial</b> or appeal <b>proceedings.</b> Each team is given 20 minutes for the main submissions and 10 minutes for rebuttal. For the English edition of the moot, each country can only send two to three teams to participate; where necessary, regional rounds are organised to select the top two to three teams. Regional rounds have been held for North America, India, and China.|$|R
2500|$|On June 10, 1993, {{shortly after}} the special {{election}} victory, Travis County authorities, led by Democratic district attorney Ronnie Earle, raided Hutchison's offices at the State Treasury. The search was conducted without a warrant, as incident to service of the indictments in the case. Subsequently, after two other grand jury indictments were thrown out, Hutchison was indicted a third time by a Texas grand jury in September 1993 for official misconduct and records tampering. Hutchison stated {{that she was the}} innocent victim of a politically motivated prosecutor. Earle acknowledged that he had sought appointment by Democratic Governor Ann Richards, to the same U.S. Senate seat to which Hutchison was ultimately elected, but he denied that his legal actions against Hutchison were politically motivated. The case against Hutchison was heard before State District Judge John Onion in February 1994. Pre-trial motions included a Motion to Quash evidence Earle obtained without a warrant when raiding the Treasurer's office. During <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the judge did not rule on admissibility. [...] Following the lack of a ruling, Earle declined to proceed with his case. Onion swore in a jury and directed the jury to acquit Hutchison, since Earle chose not to present evidence. The acquittal barred any future prosecution of Hutchison.|$|E

50|$|The grand jury's {{functions}} were gradually made redundant by {{the development}} of committal proceedings in magistrates' courts from 1848 onward when the (three) Jervis Acts, such as the Justices Protection Act 1848, codified and greatly expanded the functions of magistrates in <b>pre-trial</b> proceedings; these <b>proceedings</b> developed into almost a repeat of the trial itself. In 1933 the grand jury ceased to function in England, under the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 and was entirely abolished in 1948, when a clause from 1933 saving grand juries for offences relating to officials abroad was repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1948.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the trial}} against Lubanga Dyilo started, the <b>Pre-Trial</b> Chamber halted <b>proceedings</b> and ordered Lubanga Dyilo to be {{released}} on grounds that the prosecutor had failed to disclose evidence to the defence. In a subsequent ruling the chamber reversed its previous decision and allowed the trial to begin. Additionally, the senior trial lawyer, prosecutor Ekkehard Withopf, {{was removed from the}} case only a month before the trial started. Lubanga Dyilo's trial began on 26 January 2009 but on 8 July 2010 the Trial Chamber once again stayed the proceedings because of the conduct of the Prosecutor and ordered that he be released. Following a successful appeal by the Prosecutor the order to release Lubanga Dyilo was reversed and the trial resumed. Closing arguments of the participants concluded on 26 August 2011. In 2012, Lubanga was found guilty and is sentenced to a total period of 14 years imprisonment.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to present}} the {{contemporary}} legal criminal procedures in Saudi Arabia {{that are relevant to}} crimes of killing. The thesis is divided into five chapters; each chapter is divided into two or three sections; and every section contains various sub-sections. Part one in the first section of chapter one provides a general introduction to the criminal procedures, its establishment and objectives in Islamic law. Part two discusses the general essential elements that must exist in the analysis of every crime. The general divisions of crimes have been pointed out in this part, as well as importance of this classification in Islamic law. Section two of this chapter embodies two parts which reflect respectively the sources of criminal procedure, as the ground from which it derives its legal authority; in addition, it provides miscellaneous statistics that indicate the effect of Islamic criminal law on decreasing crime rate in Saudi Arabia. Chapter two consist of two sections in which crimes of killing are classified. Part one of the first section discuses the fundamental components of intentional killing; types of punishments imposed upon a murderer, and the infliction of the death penalty as aq'sas in Saudi Arabia. The contemporary legal methods and conditions to implement capital punishments in Saudi Arabia has been discussed {{in the second part of}} this section. The second section deals with unintentional crimes of killing which comprise quasi-murder and killing by mistake. The due punishments for such crimes have been detailed in the first part of this section. The Saudi legal system of blood-money has been elaborately discussed in the second part. Chapter three is divided into three sections, each section contains various parts. Part one and two in the first section concentrate on examining those crimes of killing that are committed by a group of people, who either directly or indirectly participated in the crime. The effect of circumstances of insanity, infancy and intoxication, on annulling criminal responsibility has been comprehensively discussed in the second section. The last section of this chapter focuses on examining the effect of certain extenuating circumstances, such as self-defence and defence of honour, upon criminal liability. Chapter four deals with the contemporary Saudi <b>pre-trial</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> relevant to crimes of killing. The first section of this chapter comprises six parts. The discussion in these parts focuses upon the legal procedure of examining suspects, searching of private premises, and the rights of suspect during this stage of police investigation. Section two deals with the pre-trial legal procedure following the detection of crimes of killing. It also covers the legal process of <b>pre-trial</b> detention, release <b>proceedings,</b> and the rights of the detained person. Chapter five embodies three sections which provide a comprehensive discussion to the trial proceeding and the consequent procedure after the trial. This includes: the Saudi courts system; the rule of evidence for proving criminal cases; the procedures of hearing cases of crimes of killing; the rights of the accused during this stage; and the ensuing legal process required to implement the judgement...|$|R

5000|$|Many other {{lawsuits}} {{had been}} filed in federal courts arising from disputes involving {{the collapse of}} Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The Judicial Panel for Multi-District Litigation had previously directed that all these cases {{be transferred to the}} United States District Court for the District of Arizona in Phoenix for coordinated <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> pursuant to the multi-district litigation statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1407. While the case was pending in Phoenix, Milberg Weiss moved that the case be transferred to Phoenix for purposes of the trial itself. Lexecon objected, arguing that the statute allowed for only <b>pre-trial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> not the actual trial, to be held in the [...] "transferee" [...] district and that it was entitled to have the trial in its chosen forum of Chicago.|$|E
5000|$|The STL and the T.M.C. Asser Instituut jointly {{organize}} an Inter-University Programme on International Criminal Law and Procedure {{for senior}} Lebanese undergraduates (and some graduate students), {{in partnership with}} Lebanese-based universities. Students from nearly a dozen Lebanese universities follow 15 lectures on international criminal law and procedure from prominent academic experts and practitioners. [...] Topics include {{the history of the}} law of the international tribunals; sources of international criminal (procedural) law; the substantive law of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and terrorism; general legal principles (modes of liability, rights of the accused, role of victims); jurisdiction, admissibility and complementarity; and international criminal <b>proceedings</b> (<b>pre-trial,</b> trial, judgment, appeal and sentencing). Over 800 Lebanese students have completed the program since it began in 2011.Each year, a group of students achieving the highest grades in the program are awarded a study trip to the seat of the STL in The Hague, Netherlands to visit the STL and neighbouring judicial institutions. In 2016, a competition was organized to encourage program alumni to share their knowledge with younger Lebanese by conducting presentations on the STL to high school students.|$|R
40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 problem 2 ̆ 2 of {{judicial}} discretion in our federal courts is perennial and vexing. Appointed by the President and tenured for life, federal judges are an anomaly {{in a democratic}} system such as ours. Their license to choose among rules of law and select precedents for their holdings may be restrained by craft rules, the opinion of peers, and {{the constraints of the}} Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but the same Rules allow the judge great latitude in managing the conduct of <b>pre-trial</b> and trial <b>proceedings.</b> Indeed, the modem federal judge has much of the discretion of the old English chancellor, who determined facts without juries, allowed parties the freedom to amend their pleas and introduce all sorts of evidence in the name of justice, and was capable of creating new remedies when required by novel circumstances. If there was no check upon such chancellor 2 ̆ 7 s discretion then, what guarantee have we now that judges will act responsibly toward the parties who submit their quarrels to the court and to the larger community whose members they serve? History does not teach definitive lessons, but it does offer precedents on the problem of discretion. Two of our young nation 2 ̆ 7 s preeminent jurists, James Kent of New York and Joseph Story of Massachusetts, were sitting chancellors and wrote treatises on equity. They admitted that the discretion of chancellors was much controverted in their day, and in a marvelously subtle exchange, they wrestled with the source of the chancellor 2 ̆ 7 s authority to impose justice upon litigants. In their treatment of what appears at first glance to be a very small point-the concealment of material conditions of goods sold by one party to anotherthey demonstrated that chancellors must simultaneously empower and restrain their discretion by basing it upon conscience, a conscience informed by an explicit theory of moral knowledge. The means that they used, therefore, were rooted not in law (for they acted in the interstices of law; if they merely followed the law, then every valid contract in law would be enforceable in equity), or in equity itself (since, in many areas of contract in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they were making the rules, not following them, as they themselves admitted), but in their appreciation of shared dicta of moral philosophy. Implicit in their view of discretion is the claim that chancellors can see behind the facade of formal pleading to gauge the moral intentions of the parties to a transaction, and that it is right and fitting to impose contemporary moral standards upon that transaction...|$|R
