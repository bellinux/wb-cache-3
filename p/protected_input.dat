A unique firm-input level dataset for India with information on different raw material inputs used in production, enables us to identify firms with imported inputs subject to trade policy. To guide the empirics, we first develop a back-bone model of heterogeneous firms that source inputs from abroad. We find that affected firms engage in input reallocation and lower their use of <b>protected</b> <b>inputs</b> by 25 - 40 %, relative to other inputs. Especially large firms and multi-output firms skew their input use towards unprotected inputs. To identify the output reallocation ensuing trade protection on inputs, we develop a firm level input-output correspondence. Firms reduce their sales of outputs made of <b>protected</b> <b>inputs</b> on average by 50 - 80 %, relative to sales of other outputs. We find a firm level decrease in markups, suggesting that the cost of imported inputs is only partially passed through to output prices.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the question of}} adaptive security for two re-lated cryptographic primitives: all-or-nothing transforms and exposure-resilient functions.

In this paper, we study how these notions fare against adaptive adversaries, who may choose which positions of a secret string to observe on the °y. In the perfect setting, we prove a new, strong lower bound on the con-structibility of (perfect) AONT. This applies to both standard and adap-tively secure AONT.

Brain areas that process task-irrelevant space might be actively suppressed by increased alpha-activity (alpha-synchronization) to <b>protect</b> against <b>input</b> of distracter information. In the present study, we demonstrate that such suppression mechanisms are highly selective and are taking place even without distracters {{that need to be}} ignored. During voluntary orienting of attention, we found alpha-synchronization to dominate over desynchronization, to be topographically specific for each of eight attention positions, and to occur over areas processing unattended space in a retinotopically organized pattern.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{association}} rule mining, the state-of-the-art in privacy preserving data mining provides solutions for categorical and Boolean association rules but not for quantitative association rules. This research fills this gap by describing a method based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to <b>protect</b> <b>input</b> data privacy while preserving association rules in static and dynamic environments. The key idea is to sort the data on each attribute, perform one-level Haar transform on each sorted attribute, retain approximation coefficients and copy them to two consecutive rows. In the static case, the strategy is simple since changes to the collection of data are ignored. In the case where data is dynamic, updates must be captured incrementally to save computational and I/O resources. Preserving association rules and the privacy of data in a dynamic environment is a three-step process. In step one, an approach to synchronize a source location with a target location is proposed. Known as Target-Based Database Synchronization (TBDS), this approach is aimed at solving {{a variation of the}} synchronization problem. The approach relies on comparing hash values for corresponding partitions of the source and the target databases so that if these values differ, the tuples in the target partition can be dropped and reloaded from the source. A table of partition information guides this process. In step two, the target-based database synchronization approach is used in conjunction with the discrete wavelet transform approach to incrementally update transformed data. Finally in step three, deleted and inserted transformed deltas retrieved from the data owner's database transaction logs are passed to the data miner who combines them with his previous set of frequent itemsets to efficiently compute the new set of frequent itemsets and rules. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing approaches such as kd-tree and random projection, the proposed approach renders higher accuracy and privacy for small to moderate size of database updates when updates lie within attribute domains, preserves 90 % - 100 % of the original rules regardless of whether the size of database updates is small or moderate and executes efficiently when the percentage of database changes are small...|$|R
40|$|The motion {{counter and}} trigger module is a module {{which must be}} able to {{determine}} coordinates of a mobile unit according to moving sensors, and to send a serial stream when the mobile unit has reached a determined distance. More precisely, a trigger is generated when the distance has been reached, and consequently a stream is built up and sent through a serial line. Basically, the stream contains calculated coordinates values. This module must be implemented on a hardware-platform composed basically of a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and a processor. The processor is responsible for fetching the correct instruction for the FPGA processes execution. The moving sensors are incremental encoder wheels, which signals have to be analysed by the FPGA. However, sensors lines mustn 't be directly connected to the hardware-platform connector which is directly linked to the FPGA pins, because there is no voltage security and the FPGA can be destroyed. Therefore a voltage interface has to be developped in order to <b>protect</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs of the FPGA pins with external elements. Then a VHDL program has to be implemented into the FPGA in order to carry out the motion counter and trigger module. A motion counter module generates the coordinates values, and it has two operation modes: The first one is to calculate coordinates according to moving sensors information, and the second one is to generate emulated coordinates. A trigger module generates a trigger each time a determined distance has been reached, and then a stream can be built up and sent through a serial line. Moreover, a receiver module gets back the serial stream, and stores the deserialized stream data into SRAM. (In this way, a control of sent stream data can be done). A practical case where this motion counter and trigger module is required is a moving unit which need to perform a measurement every ten centimeters. A trigger is generated each time the moving unit has reached ten centimeters, then a stream is sent, and the reception of this stream by an other module initiates a new trigger where measurements can be performed, and data of this measurement could be stored with the corresponding coordinates...|$|R

We present a front-end drive-readout integrated circuit suitable for 2 D CMUT arrays used in 3 D ultrasonic imaging. The circuit consists of a pulser for driving the CMUT array element by a high voltage pulse, a metal pad for connection to the CMUT element, a low noise readout amplifier for buffering the received echo signal, and a switch for <b>protecting</b> the <b>inputs</b> of the readout amplifier {{not only from the}} DC bias of the CMUT but also from the high voltage pulses in transmit mode. We developed an equivalent electrical model for simulating the CMUT, where the model parameters were obtained through a finite element analysis using ANSYS. Based on this model we performed the prc-layout simulations for each sub-circuit using the Cadence Spectre Simulator, where a 10 pF load capacitance was assumed to model the routing and off-chip parasitic capacitances. The layout of the circuit fits into 200 x 2 QQfj,m 2 area that satisfies the Nyquist spatial sampling requirement for a 2 D transducer aperture operating at 3 - 5 MHz. We also performed post-layout simulations using the extracted circuit by Cadence Spectre and compared the results with the pre-Iayout simulation results to examine the possible effects of the parasitic components on circuit performance. We observed that the prc- and post-layout simulations were in agreement, proving the validity of our electrical model.

40|$|The paper {{links the}} {{intensity}} of re-distributional activities within an economy to {{the availability of the}} input markets. When an individual is faced with a choice between productive vs non-productive (re-distributional) activities, the outcome heavily depends on whether this individual can match his/her personal endowment of human resources (labor, entrepreneurial talent, skills etc.) with commensurable quantities of transferable economic inputs, which are required to complement the human resources in production technologies. If the markets for these inputs are missed or impeded, rational individuals could be forced into re-distribution, where "technologies" do not require matching inputs. However, the development of the input markets alone is not sufficient to suppress redistributional activities. Another factor {{to be taken into account}} is the degree of protection of property rights. An equilibrium model is presented to demonstrate that if property rights are adequately protected, then opening of the input markets undermines the incentive to seek re-distributional gains. On the other hand, if property rights are <b>protected</b> poorly, making <b>input</b> markets available could further stimulate re-distribution, as the society is getting richer, and the rate of return to re-distributional efforts goes up. Implications of the above observations for institutional change and economic reform are briefly discussed in conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} are to {{reconstruct}} the geological setting of the Punta Bassano series (Marettimo Island, Egadi Archipelago, western Sicily) and its palaeogeographic evolution. The reference section for the Upper Triassic of Marettimo shows an alternation of marl and limestone beds together with brecciated levels. The limestones are both homogeneous mudstones with evaporite pseudomorphs and laminated with fenestrae. Foraminiferal, palynomorph, and ostracod associations constrain the Punta Bassano sequence to the Carnian-Rhaetian interval. The Punta Bassano succession represents a shallow inner ramp, ranging from open-marine environment with good water circulation to lagoonal and peritidal <b>protected</b> environments. Freshwater <b>input</b> from rivers or groundwater on the carbonate ramp is indicated by the ostracod microfauna. The comparison of facies and microfauna with those from other sequences of the Mediterranean Upper Triassic (Pyrenees, Corsica, Sardinia, and Tunisia) allows us to conWne the Punta Bassano sedimentation to the northern margin of the Tethys, between the Corsican and the Pyrenean depositional setting.

40|$|The major {{challenge}} {{in the design of}} an integrated network is the integration and support {{of a wide variety of}} applications. To provide the requested performance guarantees, a traffic control strategy has to allocate network resources according to the characteristics of input traffic. Specifically, the definition of traffic characterisation is significant in network conception. In this thesis, a traffic stream is characterised based on a virtual queue principle. This approach provides the necessary link between network resources allocation and traffic control. It is difficult to guarantee performance without prior knowledge of the worst behaviour in statistical multiplexing. Accordingly, we investigate the worst case scenarios in a statistical multiplexer. We evaluate the upper bounds on the probabilities of buffer overflow in a multiplexer, and data loss of an input stream. It is found that in networks without traffic control, simply controlling the utilisation of a multiplexer does not improve the ability to guarantee performance. Instead, the availability of buffer capacity and the degree of correlation among the input traffic dominate the effect on the performance of loss. The leaky bucket mechanism has been proposed to prevent ATM networks from performance degradation due to congestion. We study the leaky bucket mechanism as a regulation element that <b>protects</b> an <b>input</b> stream. We evaluate the optimal parameter settings and analyse the worst case performance. To investigate its effectiveness, we analyse the delay performance of a leaky bucket regulated multiplexer. Numerical results show that the leaky bucket mechanism can provide well-behaved traffic with guaranteed delay bound in the presence of misbehaving traffic. Using the leaky bucket mechanism, a general strategy based on burstiness characterisation, called the LB-Dynamic policy, is developed for packet scheduling. This traffic control strategy is closely related to the allocation of both bandwidth and buffer in each switching node. In addition, the LB-Dynamic policy monitors the allocated network resources and guarantees the network performance of each established connection, irrespective of the traffic intensity and arrival patterns of incoming packets. Simulation studies demonstrate that the LB-Dynamic policy is able to provide the requested service quality for heterogeneous traffic in integrated broadband networks...|$|R
40|$|Protection of one’s {{intellectual}} property {{is a topic}} with important technological and legal facets. The significance of this issue is amplified nowadays due to the ease of data dissemination through the internet. Here, we provide technological mechanisms for establishing the ownership of a dataset consisting of multiple objects. The objects that we consider in this work are shapes (i. e., two dimensional contours), which abound in disciplines such as medicine, biology, anthropology and natural sciences. The protection of the dataset is achieved through means of embedding of an imperceptible ownership ‘seal’, that imparts only minute visual distortions. This seal needs to be embedded in the proper data space so that its removal or destruction is particularly difficult. Our technique is robust to many common transformations, such as data rotation, translation, scaling, noise addition and resampling. In addition to that, the proposed scheme also guarantees that important distances between the dataset shapes/objects are not distorted. We achieve this by preserving the geodesic distances between the dataset objects. Geodesic distances capture {{a significant part of}} the dataset structure, and their usefulness is recognized in many machine learning, visualization and clustering algorithms. Therefore, if a practitioner uses the <b>protected</b> dataset as <b>input</b> to a variety of mining, machine learning, or database operations, the output will be the same as on the original dataset.

40|$|M. B. A. The {{debate over}} plant {{biotechnology}} and genetic engineering (GE) is surrounded with controversy. On {{the one side}} of the debate, phrases such as `Frankenfood' and `terminator seed' have been used to describe food and seed resulting from plant biotechnology. On the other hand, Agricultural Scientists see biotechnology and genetic engineering as a solution to keep feeding and clothing the increasing world population with static or reducing world resources. Many farmers in developing countries eke out a living based on the production techniques that are becoming increasingly unaffordable because of increasing inputs cost and are no longer producing enough output to provide adequate access to food. Plant biotechnology holds the potential for increasing the productivity of agriculture in developing countries. New crop varieties are developed which are resistant to insects and are tolerant to certain non-selective herbicides. All these plant biotechnology developments are said to help reduce the cost of <b>inputs,</b> <b>protects</b> yields and reduce environmental contamination with toxic insect sprays. For many commercial farmers, cotton production is the only possibility they have to produce a cash crop but spraying to control insect pests is required several times during the season resulting in high input costs. An alternative to spraying is to introduce a built-in defense into the plant itself to combat insect damage. The introduction of the insecticidal gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into the cotton plant trough biotechnology, has secured a built-in defense against the most common insect family in cotton namely the lepidopteran caterpillar. Cotton engineered with such genes was introduced into commercial production {{for the first time in}} 1996 with over 1. 8 million acres planted with transgenic cotton in the US. Following early trials, Bt-cotton has since the 1998 / 99 growing season been commercialized in South Africa. Since the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) crops, US farmers have rapidly adopted most of them. Analyses by USDA's Economic Research Services (ERS) and others indicate economic benefits to many farmers adopting first-generation GE crops. This research study was carried out to determine to what extend the South African cotton growers embraced this kind of technology through usage thereof and if they benefited as much as other cotton farmers world-wide. The specific research objectives for this study were as follows: An evaluation of the adoption rates and benefits derived from plant biotechnology on a worldwide base through literature. An evaluation of the acceptance and penetration of Bt-cotton amongst the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine the benefits of Bt-cotton to the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine to what extend the South African cotton growers benefited economically through the use of the Bt-cotton trait. To identify segmental differences in the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait amongst commercial cotton growers in South Africa. The main findings of this research indicate that almost three quarters of the cotton hectares surveyed were planted with the Bt-cotton trait and that almost ninety percent of cotton growers surveyed, adopted the Bt-cotton trait in the 2001 / 2002 season. Comparing the benefits derived from Bt-cotton in South Africa to those in other countries, it can be concluded that the South African commercial cotton growers had equal results. Most of the cotton growers in South Africa experienced yield increases with a substantial reduction in the use of insecticides. This resulted in higher gross margins from Bt-cotton compared to the non-Bt cotton or commercial cotton varieties. The South African commercial cotton grower has benefited agronomically, economically and environmentally through the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait. Future introductions of plant biotechnology traits such as herbicide tolerance will further enhance the production potential of cotton...|$|R
40|$|A {{vehicular}} battery must {{consist of}} a large number of cells to provide the necessary energy and power. Management only at the level of the battery pack causes out-of-investigation cells and lack of cell equalization ability. Therefore, in the smart module concept, cells are first grouped into modules, which are then connected to the battery pack. Each module is an independent unit with a controller to investigate and control cells. Based on this concept, the work in this thesis redistributes tasks among module controllers and a central controller, applies a self-power design to enhance module independence, and selects the newly developed automotive ICs and sensors. Finally, a prototype of the BMS has been developed and successfully applied in a series of HEVs. Cell equalization is a crucial technique to balance the cells inside a battery pack, with the ability to maximize pack capacity and protect cells from damage. For the bi-directional Cuk equalizing circuit, we propose a SoC based, instead of voltage based, fuzzy controller to intelligently determine the equalizing current, with the aim of reducing equalizing duration, enhancing equalizing efficiency, and <b>protecting</b> cells. The <b>inputs</b> to the controller are specially designed as the difference in SoC, the average SoC, and the total internal resistance. Because of the lack of theoretical analysis on equalizing current in the electrochemistry field, we utilize a fuzzy controller to incorporate the experience and knowledge of experts. Simulations and experiments verify its availability and efficacy. Especially for a LiFePO 4 battery, a large SoC difference may lead to only a small difference in voltage and cause the failure of a traditional voltage based equalizer. The SoC based method successfully avoids this problem and obtains good performance in equalizing LiFePO 4 cells. Fast charge is intended to charge a battery as fast as possible, without any damage and with high energy efficiency, thus helping to reduce vehicle out-of-service time and promote the commercialization of EVs. Battery safety and charging efficiency are partially reflected by the increase in temperature during the charging process. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were to accelerate charging speed and reduce the temperature increase. We introduce a model predictive control framework to control the charging process. An RC model and the modified enhanced self-correcting model are employed to predict the future SoC in simulations and experiments respectively. A single-node lumped-parameter thermal model and a neural network trained by real experimental data are also applied respectively. In addition, a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the charging current under multiple objectives and constraints. Simulation and experimental results strongly demonstrate that the Pareto front of the proposed algorithm dominates that of the popular constant current constant voltage charge method. State of charge (SoC) is a battery state indicating its residual capacity. It is the fundamental state of the battery and is the basis for other battery operations. However, SoC is not a directly measurable state and has to be obtained by estimation techniques. Aiming to enhance the anti-noise ability of SoC estimation in a real vehicle environment, we propose a SoC estimation framework consisting of an adaptive nonlinear diffusion filter to reduce the noise of current measurement, a self-learning mechanism to remove its zero-drift, an open loop coulomb counting estimator and a model based closed loop filter to estimate SoC, and a data fusion unit to reach the final estimation result. In a simulation study, the closed loop filter is implemented based on an RC model and Hinfinity filter. In experiments and application, we modify the enhanced self-correcting model to model a type of LiFePO 4 battery and apply an extended Kalman filter to estimate SoC. The framework has been demonstrated to improve accuracy and anti-noise ability, and achieves the technique upgrading goal recently published by the Chinese government. The automotive industry has experienced a significant boom in recent years, accelerating the problems of energy shortage and environmental disruption around the world. To solve the two problems, electric vehicles (EVs), including battery electric vehicles (BEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FEV), have been proposed and studied in recent years. Despite the efforts devoted to the development of EVs by both the scientific research and industrial communities, there are still many obstacles hindering the mass commercialization of EVs. Among these obstacles, the battery system, the new energy storage component in EVs, is one of the most important yet most difficult parts of EV design, and the battery management system (BMS) is recognized as the single most important technical issue in the successful commercialization of EVs.
