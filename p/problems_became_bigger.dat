As security data are multivariate, parallel coordinates provides a neat way to display and ease abnormal behaviors detection. Picviz implements the use of parallel coordinates on acquired data, such as logs, to create a parallel coordinates image. Using this image, the analyst can use Picviz to improve the output image, filter information and visually detect things. Finally, {{based on what the}} image helped to detect, the analyst can then write automatic tools and avoid the human interaction with the image. ...|$|R

Considering the accelerated growth of the Internet over the last decade, where distribution has become an essential non-functional requirement of most applications, the <b>problem</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>bigger.</b> This paper proposes a novel Incremental Process Model (IPM) that integrates the concepts of Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), frameworks, patterns, and distribution.

40|$|The {{principal}} aim of “intraoperative neuromonitoring” (IN) {{is to prevent}} potential neurologic deficits that {{may be caused by}} the surgical process, which is very appropriate to the principal rule of medicine “primum non nocere. ” Monitoring neurologic structures, in addition to reducing the neurologic deficits, also provides very valuable knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the central nervous system. IN is almost a routine technique during surgeries concerned with central and/or peripheral neurologic structures. The monitoring technique used varies depending on the involved neurologic structure and the aim of the surgical intervention. Because of this, the staff that run the monitoring must be well trained and experienced. As it similar in the other countries, there are serious controversies in IN in our country in terms of training, price, and legal aspects. Before the <b>problems</b> <b>become</b> <b>bigger</b> and hard to solve, all sides of neuromonitoring must be together to regulate all aspects of the issue...|$|R
40|$|This project {{started when}} LIC Audio AB wanted help with {{development}} of a hearing aid for public rooms. The problem {{is that a lot}} of people suffer from some sort of hearing impairment. In places with a lot of people and background noise the <b>problem</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>bigger</b> and the sound seems to flow together. During the project we found the solution for the problem in the shape of a headphone. The headphone receives a signal from a preinstalled hearing loop. The hearing loop exists in most public rooms and after the receiver got the signal an amplifier increases the sound to wished strength by the user. The headphone is easy to use and only got one regulator to control both sound level and on/off. To ease the usage we developed a charging stand and a charging list to hang the headphones after usage. When doing this you can ensure to always have power left in the headphones. The project resulted in a working prototype of the headphones showing the thought of the project. We have also made models of the charging stand and charging list...|$|R
30|$|One {{advantage}} {{of dealing with}} the convex bi-level programming problem is that under mild constraint qualification, the lower-level problem can be replaced by its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to obtain an equivalence single level mathematical programming problem. Although bi-level programming has been used in various applications, one of the essential conditions for applying bi-level programming to solve designed problems is the availability of the efficient algorithms. In transportation road networks various algorithms have been proposed for solving the bi-level programming problems, such as the simulated annealing [27], the genetic algorithm [28], the ant colony algorithm [29]. These algorithms have also succeeded to solve other branches of network design problems [30 – 32] and [33]. However, in traffic assignment problems even when the upper-level and the lower-level problems are convex, the resulting bi-level program itself may be non-convex [34]. For that reason, up to now most of the proposed approaches are inapplicable when the size of the <b>problem</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>big.</b> Therefore, it is important to find advanced theoretical and methodological methods for handling such as bi-level problems efficiently. In this study, we adopt the smoothing based on the F-B function to solve a combined road toll pricing and capacity expansion problem.|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} the escape plans was due {{to a series of}} misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and poor judgments. Much was due to the King's indecision; he {{repeatedly}} postponed the schedule, allowing small <b>problems</b> to <b>become</b> <b>big</b> ones. Furthermore, he misjudged popular support for the traditional monarchy. He thought that only radicals in Paris were promoting a revolution that the people as a whole rejected. He believed, mistakenly, that he was beloved by the rural peasants and the common people.The king's flight was traumatic for France, inciting a wave of emotions that ranged from anxiety to violence and panic. Everyone was aware that foreign intervention was imminent. The realization that the king had effectually repudiated the revolutionary reforms made up to that point came as a shock to people who, until then, had seen him as a fundamentally well-meaning monarch who governed as a manifestation of God's will. Republicanism, from being merely a subject of coffeehouse debate, suddenly became the dominant ideal of revolutionary leaders.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{media in the}} Web poses many {{scalability}} issues and among them copyright management. This <b>problem</b> <b>becomes</b> even <b>bigger</b> when not just the copyright of pieces of content has to be considered, but also media fragments. Fragments and the management of their rights, beyond simple access control, are the centrepiece for media reuse. This can become an enormous market where copyright has to be managed through the whole value chain. To attain the required level of scalability, {{it is necessary to}} provide highly expressive rights representations that can be connected to media fragments. Ontologies provide enough expressive power and facilitate the implementation of copyright management solutions that can scale in such a scenario. The proposed Copyright Ontology is based on Semantic Web technologies, which facilitate implementations at the Web scale, can reuse existing recommendations for media fragments identifiers and interoperate with existing standards. To illustrate these benefits, the papers presents a use case where the ontology is used to enable copyright reasoning on top of DDEX data, the industry standard for information exchange along media value chains. ...|$|R

As world becomes more complex and problems more open ended, these pieces of knowledge tend to be spread through several individuals.

In this paper we present the mESA model for collective {{decision making}} based on an iterative and interactive process of gathering information and experts, synthesizing knowledge and then questioning hypotheses and expanding discussion. The model was created to support the receipt and processing {{of a large number}} of submissions (demands, questions, issues or responses), automatically processing participants´ contributions, clustering knowledge, assisting small groups to interpret clustered information to either produced better informed decisions or guide issues to be further discussed, in a cyclic process. This model was successfully instantiated in mGov, a system for eliciting citizen demands in a participatory government structure. We also discuss how mESA model is a good metaphor to collective problem solving and decision making in participative organizations, that is our next item in our research agenda.

40|$|Ill-posed inverse {{problems}} arise in many fields {{of science and}} engineering. The ill-conditioning and the big dimension make the task of numerically solving this kind of problems very challenging. In this thesis we construct several algorithms for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Starting from the classical Tikhonov regularization method we develop iterative methods that enhance the performances of the originating method. In order to ensure {{the accuracy of the}} constructed algorithms we insert a priori knowledge on the exact solution and empower the regularization term. By exploiting the structure of the problem we are also able to achieve fast computation even when the size of the <b>problem</b> <b>becomes</b> very <b>big.</b> We construct algorithms that enforce constraint on the reconstruction, like nonnegativity or flux conservation and exploit enhanced version of the Euclidian norm using a regularization operator and different semi-norms, like the Total Variaton, for the regularization term. For most of the proposed algorithms we provide efficient strategies for the choice of the regularization parameters, which, most of the times, rely on the knowledge of the norm of the noise that corrupts the data. For each method we analyze the theoretical properties in the finite dimensional case or in the more general case of Hilbert spaces. Numerical examples prove the good performances of the algorithms proposed in term of both accuracy and efficiency...|$|R

Policy makers require evidence of the association of poultry farming with houseflies and its possible impact on the health of the population. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional two-group comparison study was conducted. Six villages within 3 km and another six villages beyond 5 km from any poultry farms were selected as the study and the control villages, respectively. We measured indoor and outdoor housefly density and family morbidity in the last 1 month and observed the poultry hygiene and manure management practices. Findings: The mean fly density was 1737 (95 &#x 0025; CI 697 - 2778) houseflies in study villages compared to 100 (95 &#x 0025; CI 2 - 197) houseflies in the control area. The mean all-cause morbidity was also significantly higher in study village families compared to control village families. Poultry farm hygiene and use of insecticides and growth regulators were inadequate. Interpretation : Poultry farms are associated strongly with high fly density and high infectious morbidity in this area. Monitoring and regulation for poultry manure management practices and insecticide use practices need to be strengthened...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} optimal {{placement}} of phasor measurement units (PMUs) was first studied using graph theoretic and mathematical programming methods. However, {{due to the}} increase of renewable generations, PMUs may be required not only in transmission networks, but also in sub-transmission, or even distribution networks. Hence, {{the size of this}} PMU placement <b>problem</b> will <b>become</b> too <b>big</b> for mathematical programming approaches. As a result, in this paper, we investigated solving this problem using a novel metaheuristic technique, called chemical reaction optimization (CRO). CRO loosely mimics the interactions between molecules in a chemical reaction process. Based on the canonical CRO, we propose a simplified version of CRO (SCRO) for the optimal PMU placement (OPP) problem. Both canonical CRO and SCRO are tested on the full observability of OPP in two scenarios, i. e., considering and not considering zero injections. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we evaluate their performances in the IEEE 14 -bus, 30 -bus, 57 -bus, 118 -bus, and 300 -bus standard systems as well as a large-scale system with 1180 buses. Our simulation results show that, compared with other deterministic and metaheuristc algorithms, SCRO can find the optimal solutions in a shorter time for small-scale systems, and a near-optimal solution within a reasonable time even for a large-scale system. © 2013 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
