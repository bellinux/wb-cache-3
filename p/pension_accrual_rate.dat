40|$|Despite facing some of {{the same}} {{challenges}} as private insurance markets, {{little is known about the}} role of adverse selection in Old-Age Social Security. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study we find robust evidence that people who live longer both choose larger annuities- by delaying the age they first claim benefits- and are more costly to insure, evidence of adverse selection. To quantify welfare consequences we develop and estimate a model of claiming decisions, finding that adverse selection increases costs to the system and reduces social welfare by 1 - 3 percent. Our results are robust to extending the choice set to include disability insurance, observed and unobserved heterogeneity in Social Security annuity val-uations, and the endogeneity of longevity expectations. The estimates imply that increasing the <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> <b>rate,</b> by decreasing the adjustment factor for early retirement, would yield substantial costs savings and by encouraging more efficient sorting, slightly increasing social welfare. In contrast, the cost savings from in-creasing the full retirement age are accompanied by significant reductions in social welfare. A mandate eliminating the choice to claim early, while resulting in large cost reductions, is even less desirable: it would entail large social welfare losses and a 50 percent increase in the number of people claiming disability insurance...|$|E
30|$|Pension {{reforms have}} been on the agenda in all Member States during the past decade (overview in European Commission 2008, box 2.1). First of all, early exit schemes were closed in the {{majority}} of countries, leading to increasing average age of exit from the labour market. In five countries 4, the average exit age is still below 60 (in 2010), whereas twelve countries have a retirement age of 62 years or above 5. An increase in the statutory retirement age causes different reactions among persons and firms, with the extent to which such a reform increases the employment rate depending on many factors. Hakola and Määttänen (2007) calculated the impact of the pension reform 2005 in Finland on the average labour market exit age. In the reform, there was a restriction in access to early retirement options and an increase in retirement age of two years (also an increase in <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> and actuarial adjustment factors), which led to an increase of the average labour market exit age by 8.5 months. The increase of the pension age for early exits in Austria by 2.2 years between 2000 and 2006 leads to a decrease in retirement of 25 percentage points among women of the relevant age cohorts and 19 percentage points among men. Employment increased by 10 / 7 percentage points among women/men, although the unemployment rate also significantly increased (+ 11 / 10 percentage points among women/men) (Staubli and Zweimüller 2011). However, for the outsiders, the unemployed older, the reform leads to a decrease in employment probabilities. Empirical findings for the Netherlands suggest that 11 % of all people entering the disability pensions constitute a form of hidden unemployment (1994 – 2003) (Koenig and van Vuuren 2010). To stop this dynamic, new measures among employers and employees have been established. To reduce labour lay-offs, a firm’s firing costs of older workers were increased through increased pension contributions in the case of lay-offs. The employer’s contributions are experience rated. That is, the higher the amount of workers who exit from the labour market and enter disability pensions, the higher the employers contributions are. The introduced system of experience rating in the health and disability insurance reduced the inflows in disability (Hakola and Uusitalo 2005). In Germany, public pension reforms led to an increase of average labour exit age among women from 61.6 to 61.9 and among men 62.1 to 62.6 years within 2006 to 2009. The reason for this is the introduction of the means-tested ‘unemployment benefit II’ in combination with the shortened entitlement period that paved the way for a higher job-search intensity as well as the broader acceptance of fixed-term contracts and agency work. In France, the past reforms increased the employment rate of older workers and persons beyond the retirement age up to 13 %.|$|E

40|$|Low {{fertility}} rates combined with increases in early retirement pose {{a serious challenge}} to the sustainability of social security systems in most industrialized countries. Therefore, {{it is important for}} policy makers to understand the determinants of early retirement and especially the role that institutional factors play in the retirement decision. However, analyzing such factors ideally requires international microdata, which have in the past been largely unavailable. To fill this void, this paper investigates early retirement determinants across several European countries using the rich 2005 SHARE (Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe) microdataset, which produces more precise estimates of the effects of institutional and economic factors like pension systems, unemployment, and employment protection legislation. The analysis shows that pension systems offering generous early retirement options encourage early departure from the labor market. In addition, <b>pension</b> wealth <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> exerts a greater influence on early retirement decisions than does the average replacement rate, while stricter employment protection legislation has no significant impact.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in the UK defined benefit {{pensions}} are more prevalent in the public sector than in the private sector. Furthermore, we find that the average value of accrual to members of both defined benefit pensions and defined contribution pensions is lower in the private sector than in the public sector. As a result of both these factors, we find that the average value of <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> is much higher in the public sector than in the private sector. Due to the long-running shift away from defined benefit pensions to less generous workplace defined contribution pensions in the private sector continuing between 2001 and 2005 the difference in average <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> between the sectors increased over this period. While on average over this period earnings in the public sector grew 3. 5 % faster than in the private sector, including <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> increases this difference by one-third to 4. 7 %.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} distortions in labor supply choices that are {{induced by the}} {{recovery}} policies of pension funds. Pension funds recover from funding shortfalls and surpluses by making adjustments in the contribution rate charged to participants and/or adjusting the value of <b>pension</b> <b>accruals</b> received by participants in return. Deviations between contribution and <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> imply that the pension fund levies a net tax or provides a net subsidy on the labor supply of its participants. The resulting distortions in labor supply choices cause labor earnings to become more positively correlated to stock returns, thereby reducing the risk-bearing capacity of participants. Recovery policies prevent pension funds from taking optimal advantage of the risk premium in financial markets. Labor supply distortions are eliminated if financial gains and losses are levied upon participants through lump-sum transfers, rather than through transfers that are proportional to labor supply.

Also, an increase in <b>pension</b> <b>accruals</b> increases the probability of working full-time for lower-income earners only. Among nonfinancial factors, a negative health shock increases the probability of working part-time or retiring for full-time workers but has little effect on the labour market transitions of part-time workers.

Type A trials are those trials for which TROG is the principal sponsor and are dependent on accrual from TROG centres.

Methods: All type A trials that had presented accrual data during the TROG annual scientific meetings and the trials review meetings between April 2010 and April 2012 were reviewed. Expected <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> (EAR) and actual <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> (AAR) were estimated from accrual curves as well as initial delays in accrual. Ratios of AAR to EAR (RAEAR) were calculated. Results: There were 16 type A trials from which estimates could be made. The median EAR was 40 patients per year and the median AAR was 20 patients per year. Wide variations in each were noted and the median RAEAR was 0. 67. The median initial delay was 7. 5 months. Conclusions: Although TROG is a highly successful trials organisation, the median AAR is only half of the median EAR and in only three trials (19 %) was the AAR the same or more than the EAR. Future reports could address potential factors affecting the AAR but would require prospective data collection.

One potential accrual barrier {{has been the}} step of identifying potential clinical trials for patients. In order to partially address this barrier, a clinical trial listing was developed for oncologists to use on their personal digital assistants (PDAs).

40|$|Abstract Aim: We {{identified}} and analyzed the developmental phases (exponential and loss) of periphyton on artificial substrates based on biomass <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> in dry and rainy seasons {{in a shallow}} mesotrophic reservoir (Ninfeias Reservoir, Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga, São Paulo, Brazil). We evaluated the colonization time required for the developmental phase to change, as well as related limnological variables. Methods Samplings were carried out weekly, totaling 98 days of substrates exposure. We analyzed the limnological and periphyton variables (chlorophyll a, ash free dry mass, net and gross <b>accrual</b> <b>rate).</b> Results Maximum biomass occurred on the 42 nd day in rainy season and on the 98 th day in dry season. In the rainy season, the exponential phase of biomass accrual continued until the 28 th day of colonization, followed by a fluctuation phase (35 th to 77 th day) and then a loss phase (84 th to 98 th days). In the dry season, the exponential phase continued until the 35 th day, followed by a loss phase (42 th to 63 rd day) and then a fluctuation phase (70 th and 77 th day). In the same season, we observed {{the beginning of a}} new exponential phase (84 th to 98 th day). The biomass peak was recorded on the 42 nd colonization day in the rainy season and on the 98 th day in the dry season. Biomass and gross and net accrual were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. Conclusions Periphyton biomass and net and gross <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> were higher during the dry season, which was characterized by high total nitrogen concentration, water transparency and low rainfall. We concluded that periphyton biomass accrual and the duration of the developmental phases (exponential, loss and fluctuation) changed with variations in limnological conditions in each climatic period in the tropical shallow reservoir studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{reform of}} the UK's state pension system is currently being enacted. From 2016 - 17, the basic state pension and state second pension {{will be replaced by}} a new single-tier pension for everyone below the state pension age (SPA). This will bring an end to earnings-related state <b>pension</b> <b>accrual</b> in the UK. This marks the latest step on a long, tortuous and rather circular journey - a journey that started in the early 1970 s with a basic state pension worth about 3145 a week (in current earnings terms) and that has finally ended up in much the same place. The major difference between the 1974 system and the proposed new system is that the new system will be essentially universal, with considerably more extensive crediting of unpaid activities than was available in 1974 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We measure {{accruals}} in {{defined benefit}} (DB) pension plans for {{public and private}} sector workers in Britain, using typical differences in scheme rules and sector-specific lifetime age-earnings profiles by sex and educational group. We show not just that coverage by DB pension plans is greater in the public sector, but that median <b>pension</b> <b>accruals</b> as a % of salary are almost 5 % higher among DB-covered public sector workers than covered private sector workers. This is largely driven by earlier normal pension (retirement) ages. For workers of different ages in the two sectors, marginal accruals also vary {{as a result of}} differences in earnings profiles across the sectors. The differences in earnings profiles across sectors should induce caution in using calculated coefficients on wages from cross sections of data in order to estimate sectoral wage effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Computational Infrastructure and Informatics Poster SessionBackground: The {{most common}} reason why {{clinical}} trials fail {{is that they}} fall well below their goals for patient accrual. Researchers will frequently overpromise and underdeliver {{on the number of}} patients that they can recruit during the proposed time frame. The result is studies that take far longer than planned and/or that end with fewer patients than planned. This raises serious economic and ethical issues. Our research efforts have focused on (1) getting reliable data on the scope and magnitude of problems with slow patient accrual in clinical trials, and (2) developing a Bayesian model for accrual that will encourage careful planning of <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> as well as allow regular monitoring of accrual patterns during the conduct of the clinical trial. Methods: A random sample of 130 prospective studies approved by the Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) IRB from 2001 through 2005 were retrospectively reviewed for the proposed and actual <b>accrual</b> <b>rates.</b> At the same time, a Bayesian model for accrual was developed and applied to a clinical trial at Kansas University Medical Center to produce monthly reports projecting estimated final sample sizes with uncertainty limits given the initial projection and currently available enrolment data. Results: 117 (90 %) of the studies submitted to the IRB did not specify a start date, a completion date, or both, making it impossible to assess the <b>accrual</b> <b>rate.</b> Of the remaining studies, two failed to list actual start or end dates. Of the remaining 11 studies, 8 took more time than proposed and the average increase in duration in these 8 studies was 100 %. Among the 109 studies that included both a target and an actual sample size, 59 (54 %) fell short of the proposed sample size. The average shortfall across these 59 studies was 55 %. The informative prior used in the Bayesian model was reasonable and produced early estimates of total sample size that were an accurate reflection of the end result. Conclusions: A large number of studies failed to meet the specified sample sizes and the average shortfall among these studies was considerable. The Bayesian model for accrual produced useful reports for a particular study and provided reassurance to the researchers that their <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> were on target. The Bayesian model, however, also has the capability of correcting an inaccurate prior distribution as the accumulated accrual patterns provide contradictory results. Future research should focus on collaborations with organizations that conduct large numbers of clinical trials to get more data on existing problems with slipped deadlines and sample size shortfalls and to test the Bayesian accrual model {{on a wide range of}} clinical trials...|$|R
