In 1979, he was offered a position as a water quality engineer with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan). He directed a variety of <b>physical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> and environmental chemistry projects, and he ran the central water laboratory for Metropolitan. As Water Quality Manager and Director of Water Quality for Metropolitan he supervised the Water Quality Branch and Division, respectively, which grew {{to a total of}} 82 scientists, engineers and administrators. During this period he designed a comprehensive research program to determine the cause of earthy musty odor problems in six southern California reservoirs. Once the cause was isolated to blue-green algae growing {{on the bottom of the}} reservoirs, he devised a methodology to control the growth of the algae and prevent the occurrence of taste and odor problems in the Metropolitan service area. In 1984-85, he managed the conversion of Metropolitan’s secondary disinfection system from free chlorine to chloramines.|$|E

This work investigated the combined treatment of the leachate from Morro do Céu Landfill in Niterói, RJ and sewage samples from Icaraí MWTP with different proportions (0, 0. 5, 2. 0 and 5. 0 %). This MWTP features a <b>physical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> followed by expulsion through a submarine emissary, and so the <b>physical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> was simulated. The coagulants used were ferric chloride, aluminum sulfate, Tanfloc SG, Tanfloc SL and PanflocTM Hiper Plus in different concentrations (20, 40 and 60 mg L- 1). During testing, polyelectrolytes in concentrations of 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg L- 1 were added in some samples to stimulate flocculation. The statistical analysis of COD removals showed that Tanfloc SG achieved better results than the other coagulants in all conditions studied, without requiring the addition of polyelectrolytes. Toxicity tests were performed on the raw sewage {{with a mixture of}} 5. 0 % of landfill leachate and in the mixture treated with Tanfloc SG. The results indicated that the toxicity of the samples is lower than the limit established by current Rio de Janeiro State legislation (NT- 213, INEA) ...|$|E

In order to allow the contaminated soil excavation in dry conditions a dewatering system was necessary. The water pumped through this system was then treated in an adequate plant. Acque Industriali realized and managed the whole system. The dewatering system was made of suction pins fixed {{to a depth of}} 5. 5 m, connected by a junction manifold to the suction and booster vacuum assisted pump, which allowed the groundwater release toward the plant. The treatment plant, entirely designed by Acque Industriali and called ITAM (Impianto di Trattamento Acque di Falda Mobile, which means movable groundwater treatment), was realized and set {{up at the end of}} 2008. It consisted of a pre-treatment section, made of reinforced concrete, prefabricated nitrogen sweep elements, and a <b>physical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> plant, in a continuous loop, completely made on skid. The plant, with 25 m 3 /h of maximum potential, was able to remove possible sedimentable or in suspension material particles from water, iron, manganese, residual organic substances such as hydrocarbons, solvents (chlorinated and not), PCBs, and partly heavy metals. Totally, 98, 167 m 3 of groundwater were managed in about 25 months of activity. The analytic input and output results confirmed extremely high and satisfactory pollutant removal efficiency.

Previamente se midió el caudal de dicha corriente residual, que proyectado al año 2020 promedió 16 L/s y, se caracterizó la misma, en cuanto a la medición de nueve parámetros indicadores de la contaminación, que fueron los sólidos mientras no se tratan las aguas servidas, la concentración de este parámetro de las aguas del río aumenta en 67 %, pero una vez tratadas con el sistema bajo estudio, este porcentaje será sólo 10 %.

This work {{deals on}} the <b>physical</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment,</b> based on filtration and ozonization of Alausi city sewage, at the Chimborazo province South. Previously, the sewage flux was measured and pro jected to 2020 year near 16 L/s and the sewage was characterized on base of nine contamination parameters, such as solids (totals, suspended and dissolved), Biochemical Oxygen Demand of 5 days and 20 °C, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Nitrogen (total and organic) and Coliforms (totals and fecals). According to the obtained {{data from the}} sampling design system and from the laboratories of the Etapa enterprise of Cuenca city, the Alausi sewage {{can be considered as}} middle strength. It was developed two series of exp eriments, batch about the sewage and continuous on the ozonized air current, with 2 and 3 minutes of detention times in a 16 liters effective volume reactor. The different parameters about removing efficiencies were appreciable highs; this is, for 3 minute s of detention time, such efficiencies were between 83 y 94 %, with the exception of total nitrogen (20 %) and organic nitrogen (70 %), because of the nitrate formation. For 2 minutes of detention time, the efficiencies averaged above 97 %, also with the exception of total nitrogen (71 %). As the BOD 5 balance, while sewage be not treated, the concentration of this parameter for the water river increase in a 67 %, but once treated, this value will be reduced down to 10 %. The Initial Environmental Revisio n yielded 17 % only from the totality of points possible to be obtained and the Environmental Impact Evaluation showed an environmental quality about 136 % better; this implies an estimated environmental benefit /cost relationship about 0, 0026 percent unit s by each USD invested...|$|E
