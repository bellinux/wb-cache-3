5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and even the direction the aircraft was parked on the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{evidence}} in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and payments made by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Titanics {{passengers}} {{were divided into}} three separate classes, determined {{not only by the}} price of their ticket but by wealth and social class: those travelling in first class, most of them the wealthiest <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> included prominent members of the upper class, businessmen, politicians, high-ranking military personnel, industrialists, bankers, entertainers, socialites, and professional athletes. Second class {{passengers were}} middle class travellers and included professors, authors, clergymen, and tourists. Third class or steerage passengers were primarily emigrants moving to the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February 1980, a Britannia 253F of Redcoat Air Cargo crashed at Billerica, Massachusetts, {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Boston. The {{probable}} cause of the accident was degraded aerodynamic performance beyond the flight capabilities of the aircraft resulting from an accumulation of ice and snow on the airframe before takeoff and a further accumulation of ice when the aircraft was flown into moderate to severe icing conditions following takeoff. Contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident were encounters with wind shear, downdrafts, and turbulence during the climb. Of eight crew and <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> there were seven fatalities with one seriously injured.|$|E
5|$|On November 17, 1997, {{an empty}} train {{collided}} with another train waiting to depart Union Station with over 800 <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The empty train's locomotive engineer {{was at the}} opposite end of the train, and the conductor at the leading end failed in his attempts to relay the situation to the engineer or apply the emergency brake. The two trains then collided at a speed of , causing a partial derailment and minor injuries to fifty-four passengers and two crew members. The subsequent Transportation Safety Board report made recommendations, including making emergency brakes more accessible and that the locomotive engineer must always control the train from the leading end in the Union Station Rail Corridor.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|The episode depicts Christina {{fleeing the}} police from a museum robbery by {{boarding}} a bus that accidentally travels from London {{to the desert}} planet of San Helios, trapping her, the Doctor, and several <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the damaged vehicle.

5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex {{had something to do}} with the explosion.|$|E
50|$|There were no {{survivors}} {{among the}} five crew members and one jumpseat <b>passenger</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the aircraft. There were no other fatalities on the ground. The wreckage was located approximately 12010 ft from the runway.|$|R

5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne {{and ran into}} rough ground {{at the end of}} the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a delivery flight to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage <b>passengers.</b> <b>On</b> <b>board</b> Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on the approach to each airfield, one at Southall for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.|$|E

5|$|She left Soda Creek for {{her first}} trip {{upstream}} on May 23, leaving at the break of day and arriving in Quesnel at 11 am. Captain Browne made semi-weekly trips between Quesnel and Soda Creek until June 23 when he decided that the BX was ready for testing in the two canyons between Quesnel and Fort George, the Cottonwood Canyon and the Fort George Canyon. He left Quesnel at 1pm and upon arriving at the Cottonwood Canyon, offloaded the passengers and lined through using the steam capstan. However, Browne soon realized that the light and powerful BX {{did not need to}} line through and could run the canyons unaided. By law passengers were forced to disembark and walk around any canyon that a steamer was lining through and be picked up on the other side. However, by the fall of 1910, the federal steamboat inspector decided that the BX was allowed to keep her <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> This gave her a huge advantage over her rivals, all of which had to line through both canyons, wasting time and fuel as well as inconveniencing the passengers.|$|E
