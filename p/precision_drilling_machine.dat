40|$|Abstract: For the {{determination}} of the long life and economical material of drill cultures, 27 cast chromium materials, two Ni-hard 4 cast material produced at different times, C 1050 (C 45) cast material, materials produced by filling worn C 1050 materials with Oerlikon Citadur 600 B hard filling electrodes and grinding in regular ranges, were tested. The experiments are performed by 5 rows mechanical <b>precision</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> 8 sets of drill cultures were marked distinctively in order to be recognized later, their initial weighs were taken, and mounted randomly to the mostly used precision drilling machines in Afyon and Bor Sugar Factories. After the finishing of the sowing phase, drill cultures were cleaned and weighed again. The differences between the initial and last weighs were compared by calculation of wear amount according to the unit surface and the distance. As the result of this research: Drill culture blades produced from 27 chromium materials were determined to be 44 % less worn comparing to Ni-hard 4 (1), 61 % to Ni-hard 4 (2), 90 % according to the blades filled with Citadur 600 B and 306 % comparing to the C 1050 wrought iron material...|$|E
