50|$|A <b>pl{{antibody}}</b> is an antibody that {{is produced}} by plants that have been genetically engineered with animal DNA. An antibody (also known as an immunoglobulin) is a complex protein within the body that recognizes antigens on viruses and other dangerous compounds in order to alert the immune system that there are pathogens within the body. The transgenic plants become transformed with the DNA and produce antibodies {{that are similar to}} those inserted. The term <b>plantibody</b> and the concept are trademarked by the company Biolex.|$|E
50|$|By {{being able}} to genetically alter plants to create {{specific}} antibodies, {{it is easier to}} produce antibodies that will fight diseases not only for humans but for plants as well. For that reason, <b>plantibody</b> applications will move more towards the medicinal field.|$|E
50|$|A <b>plantibody</b> is {{produced}} by insertion of antibodies into a transgenic plant. The plantibodies are then modified by intrinsic plant mechanisms (N-glycosylation). Plantibodies are purified through processes such as filtration, immunofluorescence, chromatography, and diafiltration. It is more cost effective to produce antibodies in transgenic plants than in transgenic animals.|$|E

50|$|<b>Plantibodies</b> {{targeting}} phytoplasmas {{have also}} been developed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Plantibodies</b> {{are close}} to passing {{clinical}} trials and becoming approved commercially because of key points. Plants are more economical than most forms of creating antibodies and the technology for harvesting and maintaining them is already present. Plants also reduce the chance of coming in contact with pathogens, making their antibodies safer to use. <b>Plantibodies</b> can be made at an affordable cost and easier manufacturing due to the availability and relatively easy manipulation of genetic information in crops such as potatoes, soybean, alfalfa, rice, wheat and tobacco.|$|R
40|$|This study {{reviewed}} the biomass production and {{expression of a}} <b>plantibody</b> in Nicotiana tabacum plants cultivated in zeolite, zeolite+soil and soil under confined conditions {{with the hope that}} results in the zeolite variant can be comparable with results in soil (best case). Production of leaves (168. 4 - 228. 8 g plants - 1) and stems (148. 0 - 190. 4 g plants - 1) achieved the highest values at the 8 th week of cultivation. Non-significant differences were detected among substrates for production of leaves (p = 0. 0920); meanwhile production of stems showed statistical significances between zeolite (148. 0 g plants - 1) and the mixture of zeolite and soil (190. 4 g plant - 1, p = 0. 0422). The highest <b>plantibody</b> concentration in leaves ranged 56. 7 - 71. 5 µg mL - 1 showing significant differences between zeolite and soil (p = 0. 0219). The expression pattern of the <b>plantibody</b> was similar in all substrates reaching maximum values of <b>plantibody</b> amount (mg m - 2) at 8 th week. The expression level of <b>plantibody</b> ranged 0. 19 ± 0. 05 (soil) - 0. 13 ± 0. 02 % (zeolite). The optimal moment for purifying <b>plantibody</b> was at the 7 th week when zeolite was used as substrates. Results of purification experiments performed to corroborate that <b>plantibody</b> produced by plants cultivated in zeolite was functional allow confirming a value of <b>plantibody</b> recovery higher than 40 %, high level of <b>plantibody</b> purity and non-statistical differences in the antibody affinity constant. As concise outline, results obtained from this study provide information to conclude that although zeolite experiment results were lower than those observed in the mixture of zeolite and soil and soil, zeolite can be used as substrate for cultivation of transgenic tobacco plants employed in <b>plantibody</b> large-scale production under assessed conditions...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{studies with}} a <b>plantibody</b> {{expressed}} in tobacco seeds {{found that this}} species is able to glycosylate recombinant proteins (Hernández-Velázquez et al. 2015). The <b>plantibody</b> contained structures of high-mannose and predominantly type-complex N-glycans, indicating that {{a high proportion of}} molecules modified with α (1.3) fucose and β (1.2) xylose. Additionally, a high mannose type N-glycan profile of five to nine mannoses residues was found, and the most prevalent modification was the presence of seven mannose residues in the recombinant protein, with a oligomannoside structure proportion of 52 % of the <b>plantibody</b> N-glycans (Hernández-Velázquez et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an assessment of}} a N. tabacum L., variety {{for the analysis of}} the consistent production of biomass, Leaf Total Soluble Protein (LTSP) and <b>plantibody.</b> To perform this research, seedlings of genetic modified plants were transplanted and grown in zeolite in a green-containment of 1320 m 2 of cultivable area to be analyzed during a cropping year. Comparison of morpho-agronomic characters of this variety cultivated under these conditions revealed similarity in qualitative characters but differences in plant height and leaf weight with those reported for this variety cultivated soil and open field. A first-round result using a random block design demonstrated that 15 plants m - 2 was the best assessed density to perform further experiments. The maximum biomass and LTSP production was observed during the spring, demonstrating statistical differences among seasons of the year (p - 1 in a whole cropping year. Thus, these results tested the hypothesis that this variety allows a consistent production of biomass and <b>plantibody</b> in the assessed conditions...|$|E
50|$|The {{main reason}} plants {{are being used}} to produce {{antibodies}} is for treatment of illnesses such as immune disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, {{given the fact that the}} <b>plantibodies</b> also have no risk of spreading diseases to humans.In the past 2 decades years, research has shown that plant-derived antibodies have become easier to produce.|$|R
40|$|Recombinant {{antibodies}} {{can be used}} to diagnose, {{treat and}} prevent disease by exploiting their specific antigen-binding activities. A large number of drugs currently in development are recombinant antibodies and most of these are produced in cultured rodent cells. Although such cells produce authentic functional products, they are expensive, difficult to scale-up and may contain human pathogens. Plants represent a cost-effective, convenient and safe alternative production system and are slowly gaining acceptance. Five plant-derived therapeutic recombinant antibodies (<b>plantibodies)</b> are undergoing clinical evaluation, three of which can be used as prophylactics...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies are an {{important}} class of proteins {{that can be used}} for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of many diseases. Consequently, there is an intense and growing demand for recombinant antibodies, placing immense pressure on current production capacity which is based largely on microbial cultures and mammalian cells. Alternative systems for cost effective antibody production would be very welcome, and plants are now gaining widespread acceptance as green bioreactors with advantages in terms of cost, scalability and safety. Several plant-produced antibodies (<b>plantibodies)</b> are undergoing clinical trials and the first commercial approval could be only a few years away. The performance of the first generation of products has been very encouraging so far. In terms of product authenticity, differences in glycosylation between <b>plantibodies</b> and their mammalian counterparts have been defined, and the scientific evaluation of any possible consequences is underway. Ongoing studies are addressing the remaining biochemical constraints, and aim to further improve product yields, homogeneity and authenticity, particularly where the antibody is intended for injection into human patients. A remaining practical challenge is the implementation of large-scale production and processing under good manufacturing practice conditions that are yet to be endorsed by regulatory bodies. The current regulatory uncertainty and the associated costs represent an entry barrier for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the favourable properties of plants are likely to make the plant systems a useful alternative for small, medium and large scale production throughout the development of new antibody-based pharmaceuticals...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic {{plants are}} an {{attractive}} alternative to produce antibodies for the manufacturing of biologics. The main {{subject of this}} study was to assess two non-commercial transgenic tobacco plant varieties (BHmN and Habana 92) cultivated in zeolite and confined conditions for the production of a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) -specific <b>plantibody</b> (PHB- 01). The <b>plantibody</b> molecule biochemical characterization and the assessment of the immunopurification capacity of the antigen recognized by PHB- 01 -immunoadsorbents were other subjects studied in this study to decide which variety would be more suitable for PHB- 01 large-scale production. As results, the BHmN variety allowed obtaining 1. 18 fold more biomass of leaves and up to 2 fold in the pantibody yield with similar specificity and affinity constant by the HBsAg. The assessment of the HBsAg immunopurification capacity of the PHB- 01 immunoadsorbents produced by these two non-commercial transgenic plant varieties did not showed significant differences in terms of adsorption capacity (p = 0. 2135), elution capacity (p = 0. 1239), recovery (p = 0. 2655) and purity during 13 purification cycles. In conclusion, the BHmN variety would be the most suitable variety for the production of the PHB- 01...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of plants}} as {{heterologous}} hosts {{is one of}} the most promising technologies for manufacturing valuable recombinant proteins. Plant seeds, in particular, constitute ideal production platforms for long-term applications requiring a steady supply of starting material, as they combine the general advantages of plants as bioreactors with the possibility of biomass storage for long periods in a relatively small volume, thus allowing manufacturers to decouple upstream and downstream processing. In the present work we have used transgenic tobacco seeds to produce large amounts of a functionally active mouse monoclonal antibody against the Hepatitis B Virus surface antigen, fused to a KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retrieval motif, under control of regulatory sequences from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed storage proteins. The antibody accumulated to levels of 6. 5 mg/g of seed in the T 3 generation, and was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography combined with SEC-HPLC. N-glycan analysis indicated that, despite the KDEL signal, the seed-derived <b>plantibody</b> bore both high-mannose and complex-type sugars that indicate partial passage through the Golgi compartment, although its performance in the immunoaffinity purification of HBsAg was unaffected. An analysis discussing the industrial feasibility of replacing the currently used tobacco leaf-derived <b>plantibody</b> with this seed-derived variant is also presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cloning a recombinant mycotoxin antibody in plants {{was tested using}} Arabidopsis as a model. An antizearalenone single-chain Fv (scFv) DNA fragment was first cloned in the newly constructed phage display vector (pEY. 5) and then recloned in the plant transformation vector pKYLX 71 :: 35 S 2. After transformation, constructs of antizearalenone scFv were introduced into immature Arabidopsis seeds via Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediation by vacuum infiltration. Only plants transformed with the construct containing a PR- 1 b signal peptide sequence produced transgenic offspring. The antizearalenone scFv “plantibody” from these transgenic plants bound zearalenone with a high affinity (50 % inhibitory concentration, 11. 2 ng/ml) that was {{comparable to that of}} bacterially produced scFv antibody and the parent monoclonal antibody (MAb). By electron microscopic immunogold labeling, the presence of antizearalenone scFv was detected mainly in the cytoplasm and only occasionally outside the cell. Like bacterially produced scFv antibody, antizearalenone scFv <b>plantibody</b> exhibited greater sensitivity to methanol destabilization than did the parent MAb. The sensitivity of antizearalenone scFv <b>plantibody</b> to acidic disassociation was similar to the sensitivities of bacterially produced scFv antibody and MAb. Expression of specific plantibodies in crops might be useful for neutralizing mycotoxins in animal feeds and for reducing mycotoxin-associated plant diseases...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{regarded}} as a promising system {{for the production of}} heterologous proteins. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of plant development and growth conditions on N-linked glycosylation. To investigate this, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun NN) plants expressing a mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (MGR 48) were grown in climate rooms under four different climate conditions, i. e. at 15 °C and 25 °C and at either low or high light conditions. N-glycans on <b>plantibodies</b> and soluble endogenous proteins were analyzed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Antibodies isolated from young leaves have a relatively high amount of high- mannose glycans compared with antibodies from older leaves, which contain more terminal N-acetylglucosamine. Senescence was shown to affect the glycosylation profile of endogenous proteins. The relative amount of N-glycans without terminal N-acetylglucosamine increased with leaf age. Major differences were observed between glycan structures on endogenous proteins versus those on antibodies, probably to be attributed to their subcellular localization. The relatively high percentage of antibody N-glycan lacking both xylose and fucose is interestin...|$|R
40|$|Plant-based {{expression}} {{systems are}} attractive for the large-scale production of pharmaceutical proteins. However, glycoproteins require particular attention as inherent {{differences in the}} N-glycosylation pathways of plants and mammals result {{in the production of}} glycoproteins bearing core-xylose and core-alpha(1, 3) -fucose glyco-epitopes. For treatments requiring large quantities of repeatedly administered glycoproteins, the immunological properties of these non-mammalian glycans are a concern. Recombinant glycoproteins could be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to prevent such glycan modifications occurring in the late Golgi compartment. Therefore, we analysed cPIPP, a mouse/human chimeric IgG 1 antibody binding to the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), fused to a C-terminal KDEL sequence, to investigate the efficiency of ER retrieval and the consequences in terms of N-glycosylation. The KDEL-tagged cPIPP antibody was expressed in transgenic tobacco plants or Agrobacterium-infiltrated tobacco and winter cherry leaves. N-Glycan analysis showed that the resulting <b>plantibodies</b> contained only high-mannose (Man) -type Man- 6 to Man- 9 oligosaccharides. In contrast, the cPIPP antibody lacking the KDEL sequence was found to carry complex N-glycans containing core-xylose and core-alpha(1, 3) -fucose, thereby demonstrating the secretion competence of the antibody. Furthermore, fusion of KDEL to the diabody derivative of PIPP, which contains an N-glycosylation site within the heavy chain variable domain, also resulted in a molecule lacking complex glycans. The complete absence of xylose and fucose residues clearly shows that the KDEL-mediated ER retrieval of cPIPP or its diabody derivative is efficient in preventing the formation of non-mammalian complex oligosaccharides...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{cells are}} able to perform most of the post-translational {{modifications}} that are required by recombinant proteins to achieve adequate bioactivity and pharmacokinetics. However, regarding N-glycosylation the processing of plant N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus displays major differences when {{compared with that of}} mammalian cells. These differences in N-glycosylation are expected to influence serum clearance rate of plant-derived monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody against the hepatitis B virus surface antigen expressed in Nicotiana tabacum leaves without KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal (CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL) and with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) fused to both IgG light and heavy chains (CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL) were tested for in vivo stability in mice. Full characterization of N-glycosylation and aggregate formation in each monoclonal antibody batch was determined. The mouse counterpart (CB. Hep 1) was used as control. Both (CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL) and (CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL) showed a faster initial clearance rate (first 24 h) compared with the analogous murine antibody while the terminal phase was similar in the three antibodies. Despite the differences between CB. Hep 1 (+) KDEL and CB. Hep 1 (-) KDEL N-glycans, the in vivo elimination in mice was indistinguishable from each other and higher than the murine monoclonal antibody. Molecular modelling confirmed that N-glycans linked to <b>plantibodies</b> were oriented away from the interdomain region, increasing the accessibility of the potential glycan epitopes by glycoprotein receptors that might be responsible for the difference in stability of these molecules. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Plant-specific N-glycosylation can {{represent}} an important limitation {{for the use}} of recombinant glycoproteins of mammalian origin produced by transgenic plants. Comparison of plant and mammalian N-glycan biosynthesis indicates that β 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase is the most important enzyme that is missing for conversion of typical plant N-glycans into mammalian-like N-glycans. Here, the stable expression of human β 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase in tobacco plants is described. Proteins isolated from transgenic tobacco plants expressing the mammalian enzyme bear N-glycans, of which about 15 % exhibit terminal β 1, 4 -galactose residues in addition to the specific plant N-glycan epitopes. The results indicate that the human enzyme is fully functional and localizes correctly in the Golgi apparatus. Despite the fact that through the modified glycosylation machinery numerous proteins have acquired unusual N-glycans with terminal β 1, 4 -galactose residues, no obvious changes in the physiology of the transgenic plants are observed, and the feature is inheritable. The crossing of a tobacco plant expressing human β 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase with a plant expressing the heavy and light chains of a mouse antibody results in the expression of a <b>plantibody</b> that exhibits partially galactosylated N-glycans (30 %), which is approximately as abundant as when the same antibody is produced by hybridoma cells. These results are a major step in the in planta engineering of the N-glycosylation of recombinant antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{regarded}} as a promising system {{for the production of}} heterologous proteins. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of plant physiology and plant development on the yield and quality of the heterologous proteins produced in plants. To investigate this, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun NN) was transformed with a single construct that contained behind constitutive promotors the light- and heavy-chain genes of a mouse antibody. The in planta stability of the antibody was analyzed in transgenic plants that were grown under high and low irradiation at 15 °C and 25 °C. High-light conditions favored the production of biomass, of total soluble protein, and of antibody. The plants grown at 25 °C developed faster and contained less antibody per amount of leaf tissue than the plants grown at 15 °C. Both endogenous protein and antibody content showed a strong decline during leaf development. The heavy chains of the antibody underwent in planta degradation via relatively stable fragments. In vitro incubations of purified <b>plantibody</b> with leaf extracts of wild-type tobacco indicated the involvement of acidic proteases. It is interesting that the same antibody produced by mouse hybridoma cells exhibited higher stability in this in vitro assay. This may be explained by the assumption that the plant type of N-glycosylation contributes less to the stability of the antibody than the mouse-type of N-glycosylation. The results of this study indicate that proteolytic degradation during plant development can be an important factor affecting yield and homogeneity of heterologous protein produced by transgenic plants...|$|E
40|$|Shiga toxin 1 (Stx 1) is a {{virulence}} {{factor of}} enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, {{such as the}} O 157 :H 7 strain. In the intestines, secretory IgA (SIgA) is {{a major component of}} the immune defense against pathogens and toxins. To form SIgA, the production of dimeric IgA that retains biological activity is an important step. We previously established hybrid-IgG/IgA having variable regions of the IgG specific for the binding subunit of Stx 1 (Stx 1 B) and the heavy chain constant region of IgA. If hybrid-IgG/IgA cDNAs can be expressed in plants, therapeutic or preventive effects may be expected in people eating those plants containing a "plantibody". Here, we established transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA. The heavy and light chain genes were placed under the control of a bidirectional promoter and terminator of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of Arabidopsis thaliana (expression cassette). This expression cassette and the J chain gene were subcloned into a single binary vector, which was then introduced into A. thaliana by means of the Agrobacterium method. Expression and assembly of the dimeric hybrid-IgG/IgA in plants were revealed by ELISA and immunoblotting. The hybrid-IgG/IgA bound to Stx 1 B and inhibited Stx 1 B binding to Gb 3, as demonstrated by ELISA. When Stx 1 holotoxin was pre-treated with the resulting <b>plantibody,</b> the cytotoxicity of Stx 1 was inhibited. The toxin neutralization was also demonstrated by means of several assays including Stx 1 -induced phosphatidylserine translocation on the plasma membrane, caspase- 3 activation and 180 base-pair DNA ladder formation due to inter-nucleosomal cleavage. These results indicate that edible plants containing hybrid-IgG/IgA against Stx 1 B have the potential to be used for immunotherapy against Stx 1 -caused food poisoning...|$|E
