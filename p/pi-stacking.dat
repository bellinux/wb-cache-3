The introduction of rigid-rod <b>pi-stack</b> architecture allowed us to address one of the great challenges in the field, i. e. ligand gating.

Conductance experiments in planar lipid bilayers corroborate results from spherical bilayers and molecular modeling: Highly cooperative and highly selective ligand gating produces small, long-lived, weakly anion selective, ohmic ion channels.

The PBI units are characterized by their increasing sterical demand from a planar conformation, which is orange (o) colored, via the slightly distorted greenish (g) colored form to the strongly distorted derivative, which is red (r) colored. An equilibrium between the two possible pinched cone conformations of the calix[4]arene unit is observed for all three compounds, with one conformation showing a <b>pi-stacked</b> sandwich arrangement of the PBI units and the second revealing a nonstacked conformation. The amount of the <b>pi-stacked</b> conformation in the equilibrium enhances upon decreasing the steric encumbering of the respective PBI unit as well as upon lowering the solvent polarity, thus increasing pi-pi interactions as well as electronic coupling between the PBI units. Accordingly, {{the presence of the}} <b>pi-stacked</b> calix[4]arene conformation is most pronounced for compound o 2 c in methylcyclohexane (MCH), CCl 4, and toluene, {{and to a lesser extent}} for compound g 2 c in MCH.

5000|$|Water-in-water (W/W) {{emulsion}} is {{a system}} that consists of droplets of water-solvated molecules in another continuous aqueous solution; both the droplet and continuous phases contain different molecules that are entirely water-soluble. As such, when two entirely aqueous solutions containing different water-soluble molecules are mixed, water droplets containing predominantly one component are dispersed in water solution containing another component. Recently, such a water-in-water emulsion was demonstrated to exist and be stable from coalescence by the separation of different types of non-amphiphilic, but water-soluble molecular interactions. [...] These molecular interactions include hydrogen bonding, pi stacking, and salt bridging. This w/w emulsion was generated when the different water-solvated molecular functional groups get segregated in an aqueous mixture consisting of polymer and liquid crystal molecules. This water-in-water emulsion consists of liquid crystals suspended as water-solvated droplets dispersed in a solution of polymer whose solvent is also water. The liquid crystal component of the emulsion is disodium cromolyn glycate (DSCG). This molecule is an anti-asthmatic drug, but also exists as a special type of liquid crystal when the concentration of DSCG is ~9-21 wt%. Unlike conventional lyotropic liquid crystals which consist of oily molecules such as 5CB, DSCG molecules are not amphiphilic, but entirely water-soluble. Thus, the separation of hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups cannot be applied to DSCG. The polymer solution serves as the medium or continuous phase of the w/w emulsion. Apart from being water-soluble, one important criterium for the generation of this w/w emulsion system is that the polymer cannot bear functional groups that interact strongly with DSCG. As such, ionic polymer when mixed with DSCG does not form w/w emulsion, but gives rise to a homogeneous solution or a precipitate solution. Consequently, the known polymers that afford w/w emulsion include polyacrylic amides and polyols. Surprisingly, some of these water-in-water emulsions can be exceptionally stable from coalescence for up to 30 days. Because molecules of liquid crystal assume a preferred common orientation among themselves, the overall orientation of liquid crystals in a droplet is only stable in certain configurations (Fig. 3). As water solvated droplets in a w/w emulsion, DSCG molecules would align in a preferred direction {{on the surface of the}} droplet. To minimize the overall energy of the system, the DSCG molecules in the droplet prefer to align either parallel or perpendicular to the surfaces of the droplets.(Fig. 4A,B).The stability of this water-in-water emulsion from coalescence is attributed to three molecular forces: 1. The separation of different molecular forces at the beginning of the droplet formation. Similar forces tend to stay together: <b>pi-stacking</b> and salt bridging are the two dominant forces in the liquid crystal droplet phase, while hydrogen bonding governs in the continuous polymer phase.|$|E

Organic single crystals have high charge carrier mobilities but are usually impractical(11), whereas polymers have good processability but low mobilities(1, 12). Liquid crystals exhibit mobilities approaching those of single crystals and are suitable for applications(13 - 18), but demanding fabrication and processing methods limit their use.

40|$|Charge {{transfer}} in supramolecular assemblies of DNA is unique {{because of the}} notion that the <b>pi-stacked</b> bases within the duplex may mediate the transport, possibly leading to damage and/or repair. The phenomenon of transport through <b>pi-stacked</b> arrays over a long distance has an analogy to conduction in molecular electronics, but the mechanism still needs to be determined. To decipher the elementary steps and the mechanism, one has to directly measure the dynamics in real time and in suitably designed, structurally well characterized DNA assemblies. Here, we report our first observation of the femtosecond dynamics of charge transport processes occurring between bases within duplex DNA. By monitoring the population of an initially excited 2 -aminopurine, an isomer of adenine, we can follow the charge transfer process and measure its rate. We then study the effect of different bases next to the donor (acceptor), the base sequence, and the distance dependence between the donor and acceptor. We find that the charge injection to a nearest neighbor base is crucial and the time scale is vastly different: 10 ps for guanine and up to 512 ps for inosine. Depending on the base sequence the transfer can be slowed down or inhibited, and the distance dependence is dramatic over the range of 14 Å.
