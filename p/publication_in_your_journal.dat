40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 23 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 12 - 15 July 2004 "Getting recognition {{for the importance of}} transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Abstract: By analyzing the kinematic characteristics of lifting booms system (LBS) of aerial work platform (AWP) about its working process, this paper provided a differential forward incremental PID (DFI-PID) controller to improve its control accuracy. Based on operating principles and structural parameters of LBS, three mathematical models were established: the mechanical motion system of each lifting booms, the mechanical-hydraulic coupling system and the electro-hydraulic proportional system. Meanwhile, a model of LBS was built up based on the electro-hydraulic proportion of AMES. A joint simulation was conducted by integrating the differential forward incremental PID (DFI-PID) controller into AMES (working as a major simulation environment) through certain software interface. Then, a DFI-PID closed-loop controller was designed to analyze the effect of the PID controller on LBS. The result showed that compared with the conventional PID controller, the DFI-PID closed-loop controller had better steady and higher robustness towards command changes and load disturbance. Besides, the validity of joint simulations was also proved. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference. The material on the CD ROM was published using Adobe Acrobat technology. The original CD ROM was produced by Document Transformation Technologies Postal Address: PO Box 560 Irene 0062 South Africa.
