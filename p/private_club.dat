5|$|Some sources {{claim that}} The Big Parade {{superseded}} The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually {{being replaced by}} Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by Gone with the Wind. Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, {{and it was not}} released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although {{it would have been the}} highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of <b>private,</b> <b>club</b> and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that Gone with the Wind took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. Gone with the Wind itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to Gone with the Winds $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since Gone with the Wind was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing Gone with the Wind by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{factors that}} influence the job tenure of general managers of <b>private</b> <b>clubs</b> in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Descriptive statistics, correlations, analysis of variance, and regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Fifteen items correlated positively to predict top management tenure in <b>private</b> <b>clubs.</b> Level of conflict between the club general manager and general membership was identified as the one statistically significant negative correlation. Number {{of years in the}} club industry, clearly defined job responsibility, satisfaction with compensation, sense of loyalty, and Certified Club Manager certification all had significant relationships with job tenure. <b>Private</b> <b>clubs</b> have been much less researched than other segments of the hospitality industry. The cost of finding, training, and keeping new managers is tremendous. No previous study did a quantitative study of job tenure of general managers.
