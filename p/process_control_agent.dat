40|$|Abstract. Mechanochemical (MC) {{processes}} are often modified {{to a large}} extent with use of <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> (PCAs). An appropriate PCA is, however, chosen semi-empirically for any MC process such as ball-milling. In this study, milling period and medium, PCA kinds and amount, and powder kinds, are altered as major parameters to systematically and mechanistically investigate the effect of PCAs on powder milling and the related phenomena. The model systems selected are TiO 2 and ZnO powders with various PCAs including alkanes, alcohols, water, and a few ionic liquids. According to X-ray line broadening analyses the viscosity and the structure of PCA molecules strongly affect the MC process. In addition, the MC process for harder TiO 2 is quite different from ZnO, and oxygen-derived polarity of PCA molecules would cause major difference on the milling behavior. Various parameters <b>controlling</b> the MC <b>process</b> will be discussed. Introduction. Mechanochemistry, the term of which is originally coined by W.

The products of the solid-state reaction induced Al 3 BC, AlB 2, γ-Al 2 O 3 and spinel MgAl 2 O 4. MM processing time and heating temperatures in the Al– 15 and 50 at% MgB 2 composite materials affected the selection of those intermetallic compounds. When MM processing time was increased for a given composition, the formation of the Al 3 BC compound started at lower heat treatment temperatures. However, when the amount of MgB 2 was increased in the 4 h MM processing regime, the formation of the Al 3 BC compound during heating was suppressed. As a result of the solid-state reactions in MMed powders the hardness was observed to increase after heating at 573 – 873 K for 24 h. The fully dense bulk nano-composite materials have been successfully obtained through the combination of the MM and spark plasma sintering (SPS) processes for the 4 h or 8 h MMed powders of the Al– 15 at% MgB 2 composite materials sintered under an applied pressure of 49 MPa at 873 K for 1 h. <br /...|$|E

Unlike most reported powder production methods, this method could fabricate silk particles in a short time without any pre-treatment on degummed fibre. Moreover, the size range obtained is much smaller than that previously produced using standard milling devices. Reduction in fibre tenacity either shortened the milling time even further or helped bypassing media milling to produce fine powder directly through jet milling.

The objective for the FY 07 portion of this task was to demonstrate the production of Zr-Fe getter materials by mechanical alloying and begin to optimize the milling parameters. Three starting compositions (ratios of elemental Zr and Fe powders) were selected and attritor milled under argon for times of 8 to 60 hours. Hexane and liquid nitrogen were used as <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents.</b> In general, milling times of at least 24 hours were required to form the desired Zr{sub 2 }Fe and Zr{sub 3 }Fe phases, although {{a considerable amount of}} unalloyed Zr and Fe remained.

Carbides of Zr formed during some of the milling experiments in hexane. Formation of carbides during milling appears to be much less of an issue than formation of nitrides, although some of the phases that were not able to be identified in the XRD results may also be carbides. Additional XRD experiments should be designed to improve signal to noise ratio (i. e., longer count times) and use a wider scan range to better identify phases that were not clear in the original data. Elemental Zr was present in the as-milled material but not detected after annealing for milling times of 48 and 60 hours. It may be that after intimate mixing of the powders in the attritor mill the annealing temperature was sufficient to allow for the formation of a Zr-Fe alloy. The phase diagram for the binary Zr-Fe system agrees with this proposition. If this is the case, then the annealing conditions should also be investigated and optimized to form as much of the Zr-Fe alloy as possible in the milled powder. Also, this finding would mean that milling times of more than 48 hours are not necessary. Further investigation of this conversion is necessary, and could provide an opportunity for reducing the amount of unreacted metal powder after milling. Elemental Fe remained in all of the powders after annealing for all of the milling times tested. This may indicate that the ratio of Zr to Fe needs to be increased in order to improve the yield of the desired Zr-Fe alloys. Particle size analysis data are presented to aid in the selection of filters for future hydrogen sorption testing. Based on the XRD results, four samples were suggested for further XRD analysis and hydrogen sorption testing: (1) Zr{sub 2 }Fe, 24 hr milling, annealed; (2) Zr{sub 2 }Fe, 24 hr milling in LN{sub 2 }, annealed; (3) Zr{sub 3 }Fe, 24 hr milling, annealed; and (4) Zr{sub 3 }Fe, 48 hr milling, annealed. These four samples showed the largest volume (based on relative peak intensities) of the desired Zr{sub 2 }Fe and Zr{sub 3 }Fe alloys...|$|R
