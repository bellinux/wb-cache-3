We were lifted on shore through a tumbling surf; and welcomed by an intelligent and courteous German gentleman, who showed us all {{that was to be}} seen; and what we saw was satisfactory enough. The estate was paying, though this was only its third year. An average number of 77 convicts had already cleared 195 acres, of which 182 were under cultivation. Part of this had just been reclaimed from pestilential swamp: a permanent benefit {{to the health of the}} island. In spite of the exceptional drought of the year before, and the subsequent plague of caterpillars, 83,000 pounds of rice had been grown; and the success of the rice crop, it must be remembered, will become more and more important to the island, as the increase of Coolie labourers increases the demand for the grain. More than half the plantains put in (22,000) were growing, and other vegetables in abundance. But, above all, there were more than 7000 young coco- palms doing well, and promising a perpetual source of wealth for the future. For as the trees grow, and the crops raised between them diminish, the coco-palms will require little or no care, but yield fruit the whole year round without further expense; and the establishment can then be removed elsewhere, to reclaim a fresh sheet of land.|$|E

5000|$|If two planar rigid {{bodies are}} in contact, and each body {{has its own}} {{distinct}} centre of rotation, then the relative centre of rotation between the bodies has to lie somewhere on the line connecting the two centres. As a result, since pure rolling can only exist when the centre of rotation is {{at the point of}} contact (as seen above with the wheel on the road), it is only when the point of contact goes through the line connecting the two rotation centres that pure rolling can be achieved. This is known in involute gear design as the <b>pitch</b> <b>point,</b> where there is no relative sliding between the gears. In fact, the gearing ratio between the two rotating parts is found by the ratio of the two distances to the relative centre. In the example in Sketch 4 the gearing ratio is ...|$|E

5000|$|Pressure angle in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a <b>pitch</b> <b>point</b> between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The pressure angle is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] pressure angle at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with pressure angle 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.|$|E

The calculations include the elastic deflections of the gear shafts and the deflections of the four shaft bearings. The method assumes that the surface curvature of each tooth is constant near the unloaded <b>pitch</b> <b>point.</b> Results from these calculations will help designers reduce transmission weight without seriously reducing transmission performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} misalignment on meshing behaviour of acetal gears as hardly any misalignment investigations on polymer gears in the existing literatures. The experimental results show that the wear of acetal gears is insensitive to radial and axial misalignments but sensitive to yaw and pitch misalignments which degrade the conjugate contact action. Yaw misalignment leads to ‘scoop’ wear marks near tooth <b>pitch</b> <b>points.</b> <b>Pitch</b> misalignment causes ‘superimposed palisade’ wear marks and micro cracks near tooth roots. Compared with metal gears, the effects of small pitch angle on acetal gears are insignificant which may be linked closely to polymer's low elastic modulus. Strikingly different wear striations and various debris morphologies are observed by using scanning electronic and optical microscope (SEM, OM) and misalignment effects can be noted...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{to predict the}} shift of the contact ellipse between the meshing teeth in a spiral bevel gear set is presented in this report. The contact ellipse shift of interest is {{the motion of the}} nominal tooth contact location on each tooth from the ideal <b>pitch</b> <b>point</b> to the point of contact between the two teeth considering the elastic motions of the gears and their supporting shafts. This is the shift of the <b>pitch</b> <b>point</b> from the ideal, unloaded position on each tooth to the nominal contact location on the tooth when the gears are fully loaded. It is assumed that the major contributors of this motion are the elastic deflections of the gear shafts, the slopes of the shafts under load and the radial deflections of the four gear shaft bearings. The motions of the two <b>pitch</b> <b>point</b> locations on the pinion and the gear tooth surfaces are calculated in a FORTRAN program which also calculates the size and orientation of the Hertzian contact ellipse on the tooth faces. Based on the curvatures of the two spiral bevel gear teeth {{and the size of the}} contact ellipse, the program also predicts the basic dynamic capacity of the tooth pair. A complete numerical example is given to illustrate the use of the program...|$|E

The Gothic Revival styles were beginning to displace earlier, classically inspired modes such as the Federal and Greek Revival among new Protestant churches in the mid-19th century.
