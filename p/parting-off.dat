40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} on <b>parting-off</b> mechanisms of {{a significantly higher}} impact velocity compared to commercial methods. A specially developed method, allowing for <b>parting-off</b> velocities ranging from 38 to 285 m/s {{has been applied to}} 100 Cr 6 steel bars. Two different heat treatments; spheroidise annealing (SA) and quench and tempering (QT) were employed to produce two different microstructures of a hardness of 255 and 310 HV, respectively. It appears that the failure mechanisms active in the current process are virtually identical to failure occurring during high-velocity <b>parting-off</b> using commercially available machines, which displays shear fracture and adiabatic shear banding. It was also concluded that the estimated energy consumed during <b>parting-off</b> is not dependent on microstructure. Prior to <b>parting-off,</b> impact results in shear localisation, which is somewhat increased with increased impact speed. Furthermore, shear strains at fracture also increases with impact speed, from a value of about 2. 2 at the lowest impact velocity to almost 3. 5 at an impact velocity of 285 m/s. The heavy deformation causes a grain refinement. Right below the fracture surface three subzones {{can be found in the}} microstructure; a white etching band (WEB) (only present on some locations), equiaxed grains and then elongated subgrains. The grain size within these zones varies between 50 and 150 nm. The findings of elongated subgrains of a mutual orientation, adjacent subgrains having { 110 } type of planes in parallel, support the theory of formation of white etching bands being a mechanically rate controlled process...|$|E

High-velocity <b>parting-off,</b> or adiabatic cutting, has shown {{to result in}} very low material waste as well as narrow dimensional tolerances of parted-off samples. However, for optimisation of the process improved knowledge is required regarding fracture characteristics and deformation mechanisms associated with the process. For evaluation of samples cut by commercially available technology, incorporating impact velocities of 5 - 10 m/s, a hydraulic high-velocity pressing machine with a <b>parting-off</b> tool was used. In addition, for evaluation of the possible influence of a higher impact velocity on the shear localisation, a non-conventional method was developed. In that case velocities up to 285 m/s could be employed. By measurement of velocities an estimation of fracture energies could be made. Microstructure evolution during deformation and fracture was characterised using optical microscopy combined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It has been concluded that for impact velocities of 5 - 285 m/s, the <b>parting-off</b> is, within {{the full range of}} velocities, initiated through shearing resulting in ductile shear fracture. However, depending on sample size and velocity the fracture mechanisms active {{in some parts of the}} fracture are ductile tensile indicating a triaxial stress state. Microstructural studies showed that the depth of the severely deformed region below the fracture surface is more dependent on the size of the sample than on the microstructure, resulting in much smaller deformed regions for smaller samples. The severe deformation results in cracks: For small samples only microcracks initiated on precipitates such as carbides and MnS inclusions, but for larger samples inter- and intragranular cracking also occurred. Electron microscopy of the severely deformed region below the fracture surface has shown three different types of structures: Right below the fracture surface a white-etching band (appears white in optical microscopy) consisting of nanocrystalline equiaxed grains was occasionally found. The grain size within this region was between 50 and 150 nm. The region below the white-etching band consisted of a mixture of equiaxed grains and highly elongated subgrains. The third region, located below region two, is composed of highly elongated subgrains. In the case of speroidise-annealed 100 Cr 6 parted-off at an impact velocity of 225 m/s the elongated subgrains were shown to have a mutual orientation, adjacent subgrains having (110) type of planes parallel. This could be an indication of formation of white etching bands being a mechanically rate controlled process involving dynamic recovery. In the case of <b>parting-off</b> pearlitic 100 CrMn 6 steel it has been shown that the lamellar spacing of the cementite decreases and cementite lamellae aligned in a direction perpendicular to the generated fracture surface are severely distorted during the extreme deformation, resulting in breaking up of the lamellar structure. The white-etching band consists of small finely distributed carbides in a ferrite matrix...|$|E
40|$|High-velocity <b>parting-off</b> {{has been}} applied to 80 mm bars of {{pearlitic}} 100 CrMn 6, resulting in shear localisation and white-etching bands in a severely deformed region below the fracture surface. Electron microscopy showed that going from the bulk material towards the fracture surface the grains become elongated and refined. The region below the fracture surface can be divided into three subzones: 50 – 100 μm below the surface grains are elongated, cementite lamellae are distorted, break up and the lamellar spacing decreases. < 50 μm below the fracture surface the microstructure becomes a mix of cementite lamellae and carbides in a ferrite matrix. Within the white-etching band the microstructure consists of equiaxed ferrite refined to a grain size of 50 – 150 nm. Several twinned regions caused by the deformation can be observed. Selected area electron diffraction and low angle convergent beam electron diffraction indicate nanocrystalline cementite dispersed in the ferrite matrix...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{control has}} been and still remains a subject of primary {{importance}} in modern manufacturing industry. To be able to remove high volumes of material in shorter {{time as well as}} {{to be able to get}} the right quality of the parts at the first time are goals that many shops would like to achieve. Tooling systems, and especially cantilever tools, and cantilever structural units of machine tools are the least rigid components of machining systems and therefore the most prone to vibration. Boring tools are often encountered as rotating tools in machining centres or as stationary tools in internal turning. In this thesis the focus is on internal turning. Internal turning is widely known as a very delicate operation and it is often carried out with cutting parameters far from optimal, from a productivity point of view, due to limitations imposed by vibration. Another type of tooling system whose functionality is impaired by vibration is the <b>parting-off</b> tool. The design of damped <b>parting-off</b> tool is one of the focus of this thesis as well. Vibration control has the purpose to achieve an efficient energy dissipation of a vibrational system. Basically this is achieved by controlling the damping of the system. Since damping involves the conversion of energy associated with a vibration to other forms, there are several mechanisms to remove energy from a vibrating system. Typically these mechanisms are divided in two classes: 1. Mechanisms that convert mechanical energy to heat, i. e. passive damping. 2. Mechanisms that transport energy away from vibrating systems, i. e. active damping. Both these techniques have been used during the years and both have been giving excellent results. The active vibration control mechanisms are more expensive and not suitable for machining due to the cables they necessitate that could interfere with the machining operation. This work proposes an original approach to vibration damping in machining systems, the objects of vibration dissipation being the structural components on the link between turret and cutting insert. The idea is to use composite materials to create damping interfaces between and within the different structural components. Different clamping system designs are being compared in order to see how these influence the performance of the machining system and different cutting inserts have been compared for machining hardened steel. The newly designed components have been going through both extensive off-line (modal analysis) and on-line dynamic testing (machining test) and the results show that the new tool holders used in combination with hydrostatic clamping system are the most optimal solution among the tested ones. The new design for the turret has been giving promising results and more can be achieved by bringing minor changes to it, these changes are being implemented at the time of writing this thesis.

40|$|Increasing steel {{prices and}} {{environmental}} aspects have put forward the demand to reduce material consumption and energy usage in manufacturing industry and near-net-shape manufacturing techniques have thus become increasingly important. High-velocity parting-off,high-velocity forming and cold ring rolling are three such manufacturing methods that exhibit great potentials {{in terms of}} material waste reduction. However, all three processes involve large degrees of deformation that is not homogeneously distributed in the samples and the scientific knowledge regarding deformation mechanisms active in these processes is low. In order to allow for process optimisations {{a thorough understanding of}} associated deformation behaviour and microstructural changes is needed. Three steels have been used in this work: two bearing steels and one carbon steel. Through studies employing high-velocity <b>parting-off</b> incorporating impact velocities of 5 - 285 m/s, the fracture mechanisms active during material separation was shown to be a mix of ductile shear and ductile tensile fracture and to some extent failure by adiabatic shear banding. High-velocity forming tests were then conducted to evaluate parameters controlling the strain localisation and initiation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). Strain and strain rate were shown to be important for strain localisation. However, most important was shown to be the microstructure coupled to hardness where quenched and tempered samples developed ASBs while spheroidise annealed samples did not. By using electron microscopy the microstructure in the ASB regions generated by <b>parting-off</b> and forming were compared and shown to be composed of three types of structures: Within the ASB nanocrystalline equiaxed grains with a size of 50 - 150 nm were found, while adjacent to the ASB the microstructure consisted of a mixture of equiaxed grains and highly elongated subgrains. Outside this region only highly elongated subgrains were found. The elongated subgrains were shown to have a mutual orientation, adjacent subgrains having { 110 } type of planes parallel. This could indicate that formation of ASBs is a mechanically rate controlled process. In addition it was shown that smaller carbides were dissoluted while larger spheroid carbides remained and possibly also facilitated the refinement of microstructure in the formation of ASBs. Cold ring rolling tests were done to further investigate the effect of large deformations on microstructure and texture. The plastic deformation was shown to be most severe near the inner diameter of the rings decreasing towards the area of the outer diameter. By employing electron back scatter diffraction the ring rolling process was shown to result in a combined fibre texture where was parallel to the rolling direction and was parallel to the ring radial direction in the centre of the ring, indicating more or less plain strain in this region. Below the inner diameter the texture was of the { 110 } type indicating contribution of shear...|$|E
