50|$|A pedalboard (also {{called a}} pedal keyboard, <b>pedal</b> <b>clavier,</b> or, with {{electronic}} instruments, a bass pedalboard) is a keyboard {{played with the}} feet that is usually used to produce the low-pitched bass line {{of a piece of}} music. A pedalboard has long, narrow lever-style keys laid out in the same semitone scalar pattern as a manual keyboard, with longer keys for C, D, E, F, G, A and B, and shorter, higher keys for C, D, F, G and A. Training in pedal technique is part of standard organ pedagogy in church music and art music.|$|E
