5000|$|The {{processes}} of grafting [...] "onto", [...] "from", and [...] "through" [...] are all {{different ways to}} alter the chemical reactivity of the surface they attach with. Grafting onto allows a preformed polymer, generally in a [...] "mushroom regime", {{to adhere to the}} surface of either a droplet or bead in solution. Due to the larger volume of the coiled polymer and the steric hindrance this causes, the grafting density is lower for 'onto' in comparison to 'grafting from'. The surface of the bead is wetted by the polymer and the interaction in the solution caused the polymer to become more flexible. The 'extended conformation' of the <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted,</b> or polymerized, {{from the surface of the}} bead means that the monomer must be in the solution and there for lyophilic. This results with a polymer that has favorable interactions with the solution, allowing the polymer to form more linearly. Grafting from therefore has a higher grafting density since there are more access to chain ends.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted</b> bilayers on the physicomechanical properties of lipid membranes is important while developing liposomal based drug delivery systems. The melting characteristics and bending moduli of <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted</b> bilayers are investigated using dissipative particle dynamics simulations {{as a function of}} the amount of grafted polymer and lipid tail length. Simulations are carried out using a modified Andersen barostat, whereby the membrane is maintained in a tensionless state. For lipids made up of four to six tail beads, the transition from the low temperature L-beta phase to the L-alpha phase is lowered only above a grafting fraction of G(f) = 0. 12 for polymers made up of 20 beads. Below G(f) = 0. 12 small changes are observed only for the HT 4 bilayer. The bending modulus of the bilayers is obtained as a function of G(f) from a Fourier analysis of the height fluctuations. Using the theory developed by Marsh Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1615, 33 (2003) ] for <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted</b> membranes, the contributions to the bending modulus due to changes arising from the grafted polymer and bilayer thinning are partitioned. The contributions to the changes in kappa from bilayer thinning were found to lie within 11 % for the lipids with four to six tail beads, increasing to 15 % for the lipids containing nine tail beads. The changes in the area stretch modulus were also assessed and were found to have a small influence on the overall contribution from membrane thinning. The increase in the area per head group of the lipids was found to be consistent with the scalings predicted by self-consistent mean field results. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

In {{the first part}} we present a predictive computational materials design study linking molecular features of the polymers to the structure {{and shape of the}} assembly of polymer functionalized nanoprisms. Focusing on nanoprisms with polymers grafted on their edges, we systematically vary monomer and solvent chemistry ranging from homopolymers in theta solvent and bad solvent, to AB copolymers with varying A and B solvent selectivity, and ratio of polymer molecular weight to particle size. In the absence of polymer functionalization the nanoprisms aggregate, when grafted with homopolymers in theta solvent the nanoprisms disperse, and when grafted with homopolymers in a bad solvent they assemble into one-dimensional stacks. When grafted with AB diblock copolymers in an A-selective solvent the nanoprisms form shell-like assembled structures. We find signatures of these many-body assemblies in a two-body potential of mean force (PMF) calculated using biased molecular dynamics simulations. For <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted</b> nanoprisms that assemble into stacks we find strong attraction at contact in the PMF, and for <b>polymer</b> <b>grafted</b> nanoprisms that assemble into shells we find strong attraction in the PMF at appropriate inter-particle distances and orientations.

We present a molecular dynamics simulation study of systems containing homopolymer grafted particles in a homopolymer matrix, where the graft and matrix polymer chemistries are identical, to elucidate the effect of flexibility of the polymers on the wetting of the grafted layer by the matrix polymer and morphology of the nanocomposite. We find that decreasing flexibility of the grafted and matrix polymers causes the wetting of the grafted layer by the matrix polymers to increase. We also find that this increased wetting is more significantly driven by the graft flexibility than by the matrix flexibility. Due to this improved wetting of the grafted layer, we also observe increased particle dispersion in the polymer matrix...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{interest in the}} development of sustainable materials with high performance. Cellulose is promising in this regard as it is a renewablere source with high specific properties, which can be utilized as strong reinforcements in novel biocomposites. However, to fully exploit the potential ofcellulose, its inherent hydrophilic character has to be modified in order toimprove the compatibility and interfacial adhesion with the more hydrophobicpolymer matrices commonly used in composites. In this study, the grafting of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) from cellulose surfaces, via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone and L-lactide, was investigated. Both macroscopic and nano-sizedcellulose were explored, such as filter paper, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC),MFC-films, and regenerated cellulose spheres. It was found that thehydrophobicity of the cellulose surfaces increased with longer <b>graft</b> lengths, andthat <b>polymer</b> <b>grafting</b> rendered a smoother surface morphology. To improve the grafting efficiency in the ROP from filter paper, both covalent(bis(methylol) propionic acid, bis-MPA) and physical pretreatment (xyloglucanbisMPA) were explored. The highest grafting efficiency was obtained with ROPfrom the bis-MPA modified filter papers, which significantly increased amountof polymer on the surface, i. e. the thickness of the <b>grafted</b> <b>polymer</b> layer.

40|$|Surface {{modification}} {{techniques have}} played {{important roles in}} various aspects of modern technology. They have been employed to improve substrates by altering surface physicochemical properties. An ideal surface modifying technique would be a method that is applicable {{to any kind of}} materials prepared {{from a wide range of}} polymers and that can occur under mild reaction conditions. The work in this thesis has utilized four main concepts: I) the development of a ‘grafting-from’ technique by covalently growing <b>polymer</b> <b>grafts</b> from particle surfaces, II) the presence of steric and electrosteric forces due to long-range repulsive interactions between particles, III) a combined surface grafting and layer-by-layer approach to create polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) on particle surfaces to fabricate strong and functional materials, and IV) the roles of hydrophilic <b>polymer</b> <b>grafts</b> and substrate geometry on surface degradation. A non-destructive surface grafting technique was developed and applied to polylactide (PLA) particle surfaces. Their successful modification was verified by observed changes to the surface chemistry, morphology and topography of the particles. To quantify the aggregation behavior of grafted and non-grafted particles, force interaction measurements were performed using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM). Long-range repulsive interactions were observed when symmetric systems, i. e., hydrophilic <b>polymer</b> <b>grafts</b> on two interacting surfaces, and asymmetric system were applied. Electrosteric forces were observed when the symmetric substrates interacted at pH 7. 4. When PEMs were alternately assembled on the surface of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) particles, the grafted surfaces played a dominated role in altering the surface chemistry and morphology of the particles. Three-dimensional scaffolds of surface grafted particle coated with PEMs demonstrated high mechanical performance that agreed well with the mechanical performance of cancellous bone. Nanomaterials were used to functionalize the scaffolds and further influence their physicochemical properties. For example, when magnetic nanoparticles were used to functionalize the scaffolds, a high electrical conductivity was imparted, which is important for bone tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the stability of the surface grafted particles was evaluated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The nature of the hydrophilic <b>polymer</b> <b>grafts</b> and the geometry of the PLLA substrates played central roles in altering the surface properties of films and particles. After 10 days of PBS immersion, larger alterations in the surface morphology were observed on the film compared with microparticles grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). In contrast to the PAA-grafted substrates, the morphology of poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) -grafted substrates was not affected by PBS immersion. Additionally, PAAm-grafted microparticulate substrates encountered surface degradation more rapidly than PAAm-grafted film substrates. QC 20151002 </p...|$|R
