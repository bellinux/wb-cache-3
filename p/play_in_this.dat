5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch {{into any of the}} game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|The Interzonal tournament {{was held}} in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified to <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, Benko (and the reserve Lombardy) gave up his spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His mother thought {{it would be better for}} him to <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero switched to a forward role.|$|E
5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{behind a}} strong three-man {{defensive}} line under Conte's newly established 3–5–2 formation, made up predominantly of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli, Buffon obtained a personal record of 21 clean sheets in Serie A, and only conceded a personal best of 16 goals from 35 appearances (an average of 0.46 goals per game), as Juventus finished {{the season with}} the best defence in Italy, and became the European team with the second-best defence that season, after Porto. Buffon made 81 saves in Serie A that season and his 82% save percentage was the highest of any goalkeeper playing in one of Europe's five major leagues. Buffon {{was included in the}} 2011–12 Serie A Team of the Year for his performances. Juventus also made the Coppa Italia final that season, although Buffon did not <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> competition.|$|E

5|$|Team Canada {{responded to}} their {{previous}} defeat with strong <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game. The first period was scoreless, but the Canadians used the period to intimidate the Soviets with hard body checking, especially from Cashman, Bergman, Peter Mahovlich and Parise, {{to throw the}} Soviets off their game. In the second period, the first goal of the match was again scored by Esposito, this time from a feed from his regular Bruins' linemate Cashman, who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets' zone after colliding with the Soviets' defenceman Vladimir Lutchenko. In the third period, Yvan Cournoyer wheeled around Alexander Ragulin and beat Tretiak. Yakushev got the Soviets on the board after teammate Yevgeni Zimin missed on a break-away. Lyapkin pounced on the rebound and fed it out front for Yakushev to bury the puck behind Esposito. Peter Mahovlich then scored a critical goal while Canada was short-handed, deking out the Soviet defender one-on-one, then Tretiak, to give Canada a two-goal lead. His brother Frank then finished the scoring on a feed from Mikita, who had circled around a Soviets' defenceman. Team Canada won the game 4–1 and tied the series.|$|E
5|$|The main mode {{of play in}} the Guitar Hero {{games is}} Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional {{performance}} arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across {{the rest of the}} game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue in which they wish to <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in Guitar Hero World Tour.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E

25|$|Toys in the Attic {{opened on}} Broadway on February 25, 1960, {{and ran for}} 464 performances.

Hellman had no hand in the screenplay, which altered the drama's tone and exaggerated the characterizations, and the resulting film received bad reviews.

25|$|When the United North of England Eleven (UNEE) {{was founded}} in 1869, it soon {{established}} a regional rivalry with the USEE and the two teams met three times in 1870, the UNEE's first season. The UNEE {{got off to a}} flying start when they easily beat the USEE, including the Graces, at Lord's in July 1870 by an innings and 70 runs. In the next match at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, the UNEE won by an innings and 5 runs. The Graces did not <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game. The teams met again at The Oval in August and this match was drawn, the USEE needing 33 more to win with eight wickets standing and W. G. Grace still in with 51 not out.|$|E
25|$|Shotgun starts {{are mainly}} used for amateur tournament <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> variant, {{each of the}} groups playing starts their game on a {{different}} hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round {{at roughly the same}} time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation to stroke or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.|$|E
