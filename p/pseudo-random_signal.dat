40|$|<b>Pseudo-random</b> <b>signals</b> {{have been}} widely used for system identification. Maximum length binary signals are the best known class of <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signals,</b> because of their ease of {{generation}} using feedback shift registers, but it is less well known that there are several other classes of binary and near-binary signals with identical, or nearly identical properties. An overview of these classes of signal is given and the design of a new MATLAB routine incorporating all these classes of signal is described. The importance of the choice of MLB signal to use in particular applications is illustrated with the identification of a Wiener system having a quadratic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. Errors in the measurements of the input-output crosscorrelation function caused by the nonlinearities can be reduced when the signal is used in the estimation of the system weighting function if an appropriate choice of feedback connections and data length used for the estimation are chosen.

40|$|Perturbation signals for {{linear system}} {{identification}} {{in the frequency}} domain are considered. The fundamental requirement is for a low-amplitude signal with as much power as possible contained in specified harmonics. For the purposes of comparison, two new measures of signal quality are developed. The first relates the power contained in the specified harmonics to the amplitude of the signal. The second relates the least power of any specified harmonic to the average power of the specified harmonics, It is seen that perturbation signal design is a compromise between these two measures. Two classes of signal are examined, each containing several different signal types. In the first class are computer-optimised signals, with power spectra that meet a harmonic specification as closely as possible. In the second class are <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signals,</b> with fixed power spectra. The qualities of the signals in meeting four harmonic specifications are compared, giving three overall conclusions. First, the new measures of signal quality provide an excellent basis for comparing perturbation signals. Secondly, signals with only odd harmonics present are to be preferred to signals with all harmonics present. Thirdly, it is very useful to have available {{the different types of}} computer-optimised perturbation <b>signals,</b> and that <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signals</b> provide highly acceptable alternatives when the specification is for uniform power in specified harmonics...|$|R

However, in most schemes, synchronization marks are easily detectable which makes them vulnerable to malicious removal or tampering.

In this paper, we present and discuss the synchronization recovery process through detection of the periodicity of the embedded signal.

40|$|A {{watermarking}} {{scheme is}} presented in which the characteristics of both spatial and frequency techniques are combined to achieve robustness against image processing and geometric transformations. The proposed approach consists of three basic steps: estimation of the just noticeable image distortion, watermark embedding by adaptive spreading of the watermark signal in the frequency domain, and extraction of relevant information relating to the spatial distribution of pixels in the original image. The just noticeable image distortion is used to insert a <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signal</b> such that its amplitude is maintained below the distortion sensitivity of the pixel into which it is embedded. Embedding the watermark in the frequency domain guarantees robustness against compression and other common image processing transformations. In the spatial domain most salient image points are characterized using the set of Hilbert first-order differential invariants. This information is used to detect geometrical attacks in a frequency-domain watermarked image and to resynchronize the attacked image. The presented schema has been evaluated experimentally.

40|$|Doppleranalysis {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in active radar and sonar sensing to estimate the speed and direction of a single target within an imaging system resolution cell following deterministic theory. For target swarms, such as fish and plankton in the ocean, and raindrops, birds and bats in the atmosphere, multiple randomly moving targets typically occupy a single resolution cell, making single-target theory inadequate. Here, a method is developed for simultaneously estimating the instantaneous mean velocity and position {{of a group of}} randomly moving targets within a resolution cell, as well as the respective standard deviations across the group by Doppleranalysis in free-space and in a stratified oceanwaveguide. While the variance of the field scattered from the swarm is shown to typically dominate over the mean in the range-velocity ambiguity function, cross-spectral coherence remains and maintains high Dopplervelocity and position resolution even for coherent signal processing algorithms such as the matched filter. For <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signals,</b> the mean and variance of the swarms’ velocity and position can be expressed in terms of the first two moments of the measured range-velocity ambiguity function.

40|$|Spread-Spectrum Ultrasonic Evaluation (SSUE) is an {{emerging}} {{technology for the}} global testing of structures and materials [1].

The SSUE instrument records the ultrasonic correlation signature that is representation of the aggregate acoustic state of the test sample. The measured ultrasonic correlation signature {{is used for the}} detection of changes in the acoustic state of the test object. One major advantage of the SSUE technique is that it provides a global inspection of the material or structure without scanning. Some examples of unique SSUE applications are when; 1) the test object is of complex geometry or too large for scanning or, 2) the test material is a highly attenuative material such as concrete, wood, or composites.

The aim of the reported research is to study the propagation of the spread-spectrum signal in concrete structures of various sizes and determine the sensitivity of the SSUE correlation signature to changes in the various acoustic properties of the concrete object.

40|$|A novel {{design of}} ternary signal sets is {{proposed}} for estimation of multiuser fibre-wireless (Fi-Wi) uplink channels. The design overcomes the current limitation in {{the maximum number}} of users that the system can accommodate by separating the signals in a set into subsets. The signals are uncorrelated between subsets, but correlated within subsets, thus forming a semi-correlated ternary <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>signal</b> (SC-TPRS) set. An iterative channel estimator based on the SC-TPRS scheme is then proposed for joint estimation of the Fi-Wi uplink channel. The computational complexity associated with the existing and the proposed estimators is derived and it is shown that the latter incurs substantially lower computational cost than the former. Numerical results show that despite using signals which are a few hundred times shorter, the proposed scheme can improve estimation accuracy dramatically over the existing scheme at low signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed scheme has a further advantage of allowing the designer to optimise the Fi-Wi system under the constraint of maximum permissible level of multiple access interference, since the amount of interference can be tuned by adjusting the number and size of the ternary signal subsets...|$|E

A pulse sequence for diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging is developed, which allows one to suppress velocity encoding of imaging gradients and which is designed such that the influence of concomitant fields is reduced. It is tested with phantoms and healthy volunteers, revealing different signal attenuation curves for flow compensated and monopolar diffusion gradients in liver and pancreas. Furthermore, a dependence on the total duration of the applied diffusion gradient profile is measured. To describe the experimentally observed signal attenuation curves, a model is developed, which allows one to calculate the signal attenuation due to incoherent blood motion for arbitrary diffusion gradient profiles.
