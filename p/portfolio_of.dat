40|$|We {{compare the}} buy-and-hold {{abnormal}} returns (BHARs) among the deciles <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> firms {{based on their}} product market power.

The abnormal returns persist even when we control for industry concentration level (as suggested by Hou and Robinson (2006)), common firm characteristics and alternative industry classifications.

40|$|We {{test for}} {{lead-lag}} {{effects in the}} mean and variance among size-sorted portfolios for the UK stock market. We construct three sets <b>of</b> <b>portfolios,</b> namely a set <b>of</b> size-sorted equally-weighted <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> different capitalization size, a set <b>of</b> size-sorted value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> different capitalization size, and a third set <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> the same capitalization size. The recently proposed Cross Correlation Function test is employed. For both sets <b>of</b> <b>portfolios</b> with different capitalization size, we find evidence of a lead effect in both the mean and the variance from large-firm portfolios to small-firm portfolios. This result {{does not depend on}} the weighting scheme used to construct portfolios, and indicates that contrarian trading strategies on large-firm portfolios are profitable. For <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> equal capitalization size, there is hardly any evidence of a lead-lag effect in either the mean or the variance. This suggests that the lead-lag effect is due to the difference in the capitalization size among portfolios. Â© Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R
