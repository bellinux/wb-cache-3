40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and <b>parallel</b> <b>blending</b> of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an action flow that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual lowlevel MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how verification tools, {{which are based}} on model checking, were used in a real-life communication protocol design <b>project.</b> <b>Parallel</b> composition, abstraction, reduction and visualisation tools were used to examine the behaviour of the protocol. We performed all verification and debugging visually with the figures that the tools produced. A figure represents the behaviour of the system in a certain point of view, which is selected by choosing a set of system’s actions to be externally observable. Visualisation is a user-friendly approach to verifying and validating systems, which does not compromise the completeness of verification. We present how the protocol was modelled and how both safety and liveness failures in the model were found. ...|$|R

40|$|In this <b>project,</b> <b>parallel</b> {{general-purpose}} software for {{two classes of}} mathematical problems has been developed. PVODE is a portable solver for ordinary differential equation systems, based on robustmathematical algorithms, and targeted at large systems on parallel machines. It is the parallel extension of the earlier sequential solver CVODE. A related solver called KINSOL has been developed for systems of nonlinear algebraic equations. KINSOL was first developed as a sequential solver, on a design that permitted extending it to a parallel version with fairly minimal additions. Both PVODE and KINSOL are being used within a parallel version of the tokamak edge plasma model UEDGE. KINSOL is also being applied in the ParFlow groundwater flow model to solve a nonlinear pressure equation...|$|R
40|$|The {{dislocation}} {{content of}} each active slip {{system in a}} crystal is defined by its Dislocation Density Vector (DDV). Each DDV possesses signed screw and edge components having lengths equal to the length per unit volume of all dislocations of like sign lying in the slip plane, <b>projected</b> <b>parallel</b> and perpendicular, respectively, to the slip direction. The length of the DDV {{is proportional to the}} length/unit volume of dislocations of like sign and its orientation {{is a measure of the}} edge-screw character of the population. To demonstrate this representation, we analyze a simulation of a micropillar of single crystal Ni deformed in compression. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the analysis to determine parameters characterizing the motion of the distribution...|$|R
