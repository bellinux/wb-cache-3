5000|$|PVA - {{polyvinyl}} alcohol, not <b>polyvinylacetate</b> {{which is}} used in adhesives such as wood glue. PVA monomers are dispersed in the paint or ink liquid {{at an early stage}} in the mix, as it does not affect rheology unless the pH is low. Boric acid is usually used to initiate polymerization after the pigment is added (the pigment [...] "grind" [...] stage) and dispersed, the mixture is thickened while stirring to maintain homogeneous consistency. Often this stage is problematic since air is entrained by all but the lowest shear impellers, which are inadequate for this purpose, instead antifoam additives are used to control air bubbles, which continue to be a benefit during paint application. Air entrainment during mixing is not unique to PVA—in fact hardly a formula for paint exists that doesn't at least require some care in mixing.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{implementation of}} synthesis concepts into robust and reproducible emulsion polymerization processes requires a reliable process control, ideally also {{with respect to}} an inline monitoring of polymer nanoparticle growth. If critical process parameters like e. g. emulsification of the monomers, particle formation, colloidal stability during processing, heat flux, and viscosity are monitored inline and continuously, an increased understanding of the polymerization process is achieved, resulting in safe and cost-optimal processes and feedback control strategies. For example, <b>polyvinylacetate</b> based dispersion adhesives (white glues) are usually modified with functionalized comonomers to control glue properties like viscosity, pH, film formation, hydrophobicity, and adhesive strength (via crosslinking). However, the modification will also influence process characteristics like particle nucleation and growth or polymerization rates.
