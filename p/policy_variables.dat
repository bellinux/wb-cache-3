40|$|In this article, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} {{identify}} a convenient structure of a <b>policy</b> <b>variable,</b> the final demand vector, {{through the use of}} a multisectoral model. The method used relies on a specific spectral decomposition that allows for the quantification of the scale-effect of each structure that the <b>policy</b> <b>variable</b> can assume on the structures of the objective variable, the total output vector. This quantification is of aggregate type, since each scalar obtained is valid for all the sectoral components of both the <b>policy</b> <b>variable</b> and the objective variable. But, more relevant, they are consistent with the multisectoral feature of the model, overcoming the objections put forward by the theory of aggregation. In fact, the aggregation theory states that if we aggregate sectors, we obtain a new model with different structural properties, while, in our case, the aggregate scalars that we obtain for each structure are perfectly consistent with the original model. We call these scalars macroeconomic multipliers since they say how many times the modulus of the multisectoral <b>policy</b> <b>variable</b> is multiplied to obtain the modulus of the multisectoral objective variable. Once the structures and the associated macro multipliers are identified, the policy maker can have a complete picture of the economic structure of the objective variable that can be attained and determine a convenient structure of the <b>policy</b> <b>variable</b> choosing either one structure or a combination of the structures identified...|$|R

5000|$|In a {{landmark}} paper {{published in the}} Review of Development Economics, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude {{that there have been}} three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, “coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.” [...] Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by “three key <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> - the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.” The study finds that the “heavy-industry development strategy {{played a key role in}} forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.” In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, and decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms. Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income convergence is [...] "strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>variables</b> are {{typically}} treated as exogenous variables in agricultural commodity models. In this paper evidence that <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> can be successfully endogenized {{in a world}} trade model of the soybean/rapeseedand products market is presented. Minimum price support equations are estimated for U. S., Brazilian, and Japanese soybeans, and EC and Japanese rapeseed. Macroeconomic indicator variables are used to capture the impact of nontariff barriers in Brazil and Japan domestic-world price link equations. Simulation experiments are conducted which indicate that the model with endogenous <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> performs well in comparison with a model which treats policy exogenously. Key words: Brazil, econometric, Japan, model, policy, rapeseed, soybeans. Agricultural economists typically treat <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> exogenously in econometric models. There are at least four reasons for this: (a) the analyst believes that <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> are es-sentially random variables unrelated to the system being modeled; (b) the analyst believes that <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> {{are influenced by the}} economic environment but the relationship is weak; (c) the purpose of the analysis is to calculate policy multipliers, so the policy vari-ables must be exogenous; and/or (d) the major <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> are difficult if not impossible to measure. In this paper, we argue that for the illustra-tive commodities chosen, none of the above reasons are valid. Our specific objectives are to show that policy reaction functions can be successfully estimated and included in a struc-turaleconometric model, that policy reaction functions may exhibit systematic parameter variation which can be tested for, and the influence of nontariff barriers to international trade can be partially measured in a structural econometric model. To illustrate these ideas we use a trade model of the international market for soy-beans/rapeseeds and their products. The K.

The second hypothesis is that MTM adoption is also conditioned by macro-level <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> beyond the farm. We therefore include multiple countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania) so as to include country-level <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> obtained from secondary sources: (1) extension personnel-to-farmer ratios (EFR) and (2) subsidy expenditure as a percentage of agricultural budgets spent on farm input subsidies (SER).|$|E
30|$|Second, foreign {{exchange}} rate is an endogenous variable codetermined by the interaction of numerous market players, {{in addition to being}} managed by the monetary authority.

This is especially the case for the exchange rate management and reform of China in 2015, when the PBC cut the RMB benchmark lending rate five times and lowered the reserve requirement ratio five times as part of the counter-cyclical macroeconomic regulation measures.

Data for the analysis included information on 397 non-metropolitan counties in the 13 -state region for the years 1960, 1970, and 1980. Income distribution was measured using the Gini coefficient method. Social <b>policy</b> <b>variables</b> included per capita retirement transfer payments, per capita income maintenance transfer payments, per capita unemployment transfer payments, per capita county government eVpenditures, and population change.
