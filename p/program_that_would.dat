5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E

5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire need of repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E

To ensure that the right students enrolled, they also agreed that admission would be subject to an audition.|$|E
25|$|The Task Force labored to {{identify}} a program theme that would appeal to the young men in the targeted age group.

They {{wanted it to be}} Scouting, but a version that would be viewed to be different from traditional Scouting. They wanted it to be more advanced, one that would hold the interest of a young man entering High School, a more “Senior” version of Scouting.|$|E

Anthony viewed the program {{as an opportunity to}} increase employment of women in a trade from which women were often excluded by both employers and unions. At the next NLU Congress, Anthony was first seated as a delegate but then unseated because of strong opposition from those who accused her of supporting strikebreakers.|$|E

25|$|Michigan State University, Rowan University, and Nova Southeastern University offer both MD and DO {{accredited}} programs.

Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to the creation of more local residency programs and improve the university’s ability to acquire research funding and state funding. Opponents argue that adding an MD program could cause the DO program to lose its unique identity and drain resources from the established osteopathic program.|$|E
25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E
