40|$|Recently, {{inverters}} {{which are}} the key technology component in power electronics are widely used in many fields for energy saving. The switching speed of next-generation switching devices is expected to improve to 10 -fold that of conventional Si IGBTs by using wide band gap semiconductors, which are SiC and GaN. These devices can improve <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter</b> carrier frequency which is difficult to operate conventional inverters. High-frequency <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter</b> can output high response waveform and be downsized. However, High-frequency PWM inverters will increase output voltage distortion and EMI(electromagnetic interference). Major reasons of these problems are dead-time and common-mode voltage. Dead-time is essential for inverters to prevent a short circuit induced by delaying the time of devices. Dead-time generates output voltage error which {{is proportional to the}} carriar frequency. Common-mode current, which caused by common-mode voltage, flows through the loop consisting of main circuit, ground-line and power source. Therefore, common-mode current injects into other devices connecting to same power source and causes conducted EMI. Furthermore, the high-frequency common-mode current flowing in the main circuit may cause radiated EMI. To solve above problems, this paper describes the following topics using 100 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter.</b> 1. A novel feedback-type dead-time compensation method with high-speed and high-response is proposed. The basic operation of proposed method is matching the pulse width of the output signal to that of input signal. If the short pulses, which are shorter than minimum output pulse of <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter,</b> are input, proposed method generates an output pulse after a few input pulses so that the average voltage of output signal equal to the input signal. Therefore, proposed method has no compensation limit theoretically. Experimental result using PWM signal shows that proposed method has low voltage distortion and high-voltage utilization factor characteristics. 2. To cancel the common-mode voltage which causes common-mode noise, active common-noise canceler(ACC) is applied to 100 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter.</b> An ACC for 100 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter</b> is designed and constructed for compare with an ACC for 10 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter.</b> Although the weight of a part of the ACC for 100 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter</b> is 16 % of that of the ACC for 10 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter,</b> the prototype ACC cancels the common-mode voltage equivalent to the ACC for 10 kHz <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter.</b> A new circuit configuration of the ACC for 100 kHz SVPWM inverter is proposed. A new circuit configuration has small size because it operates without another power supply and large parts. Combination of above 2 methods, high-frequency <b>PWM</b> <b>inverter</b> reducing distortion and noise will be developed. 近年、インバータは省エネルギーの核心技術として様々な分野において広く利用されてきている。近年研究が行われているSiCやGaNといったワイドバンドギャップ半導体を用いた次世代パワー半導体デバイスは、従来のSiのIGBTと比較し約 10 倍の速度でスイッチング可能であることが報告されている。これによりPWMインバータのキャリア周波数を、従来では困難であった 100 kHz程度の周波数にまで引き上げることが可能となる。キャリア周波数の高い高周波PWMインバータは、高応答性かつ小型なインバータシステムを実現できる。しかし、高周波PWMインバータは、デッドタイムの挿入に起因する出力電圧ひずみと、コモンモード電圧に起因する電磁妨害(EMI: electromagnetic interference) が増大する恐れがある。デッドタイムは、デバイスの遅れ時間により回路の直流短絡を防止するため挿入される時間である。デッドタイムの挿入により、出力電圧のパルスの幅が変化しその結果出力電圧誤差が発生する。この出力電圧誤差は、キャリア周波数に比例して増加する。コモンモード電圧は、負荷の寄生容量を介してインバータ、負荷、グランド線、電源で構成されるループを流れるコモンモード電流を発生させる。このコモンモード電流は、電源を共有する周辺の機器に流入し伝導性EMIを引き起こす恐れがある。また高周波のコモンモード電流が主回路に流れることとで、電磁波が放射され放射性EMIを引き起こす恐れがある。上記の問題を解決することを目標とし、 100 kHz PWMインバータを用いて以下の研究を行った。I. 高速かつ高精度な補償が可能な新しいフィードバック型デッドタイム補償法を提案する。提案する手法の基本動作は、入力されたPWM信号のパルスと出力信号のパルスの幅を等しくする。PWMインバータが出力できないような細い入力信号に対しては、数周期の平均出力電圧を等しくする。よって理論上どんな細いパルスでも補償可能である。提案の手法を用いてPWM信号を補償した実験結果から、提案法がひずみの低減に効果があることを確認する。II．コモンモードノイズの原因であるコモンモード電圧を除去するため、アクティブコモンノイズキャンセラを 100 kHz PWMインバータに適用する。 100 kHz PWMインバータ用アクティブコモンノイズキャンセラ(ACC) を設計・製作し、 10 kHz PWMインバータ用ACCと比べ 16 ％のコア重量であるにも関わらず、従来のACCと同等の性能を持つ。また、従来のACCでは適用が困難であったSVPWMインバータに適用可能な新しいACCの回路構成を提案し、その効果を確認する。上記 2 つの手法を組み合わせたインバータを実現することが可能である...|$|E
