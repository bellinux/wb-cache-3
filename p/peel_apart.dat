This process was similar to Polacolor film with added timing and receiving layers. The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope commonly associated with a Polaroid photo.

Early laser disk media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to <b>peel</b> <b>apart,</b> damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.|$|E

50|$|Fujifilm makes pack {{film for}} their {{passport}} camera systems, {{and had been}} available outside Japan since the mid-1980s. No legal issues arose with Fuji's <b>peel</b> <b>apart</b> instant films as Polaroid's patents had expired. While very popular in Australia as a cheaper alternative to Polaroid, it was generally not too well known elsewhere due to Polaroid's dominance in most countries. In 2000, Fuji decided {{to change the way}} they manufacture pack film, making the entire pack out of plastic instead of a metal and plastic combination. Fujifilm announced at PMA 2003 that pack film would be made available to the North American market.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Fujifilm {{introduced}} {{a new series of}} cameras using a new film called Instax it was available in markets outside the US. Instax became available in a smaller size with the introduction of the Instax Mini/Cheki line. Polaroid's Mio was available in the US, it uses the same film as the Fujifilm Instax Mini series but were rebranded as Mio film. None of Fujifilm's products were sold officially in the United States, although Polaroid-compatible film is available through some larger photographic suppliers. With the announcement in 2008 of Polaroid ceasing film production, Instax and <b>peel</b> <b>apart</b> type films became available in more channels.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the quality}} of {{integral}} instant film {{is not as good}} as conventional film, <b>peel</b> <b>apart</b> black and white film, {{and to a lesser extent}} color film approached {{the quality of}} traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for passports and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by digital photography, which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or printed with dye sublimation, inkjet, or laser home or professional printers.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to offer}} a fresh {{perspective}} into {{what is at stake}} in the cross-cultural trade dispute over genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) by subjecting a particular discursive sample, the parties’ submissions to the WTO panel, to critical scrutiny. The first step involves a survey of the rhetorical strategies deployed by the parties’ in the presentation of their arguments to the Panel. Next, I embark on the task of ‘disassembling the double helix’. My use of the term ‘double helix’ in this analysis refers to the close coupling of scientific and legal discourses in the trade regime: science and law are two parallel strands of discourse wound around each other, each punctuated at intervals by key binding sites where linkages between the strands are anchored. The image I aim to conjure up is, of course, the one made famous by Watson 2 ̆ 6 Crick’s 1953 discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), “the molecule that genes are made of”. A discovery which has led, inevitably, to the advances in molecular biology that give rise to the technologies so contested in their current application to the task of ‘improving’ food. This work attempts to unfurl that twisted ladder and <b>peel</b> <b>apart</b> the strands of scientific and legal discourse that are coiled together in the ‘double helix’ of international trade law dealing with environmental and health risks. The aim is to gain some clarity from the disentanglement: it is hoped that teasing the scientific from the legal discourses will expose the implicit assumptions at play when international trade tribunals turn to scientific assessment as the means of separating the legitimate from the protectionist in disputes over contested technologies...|$|E

5000|$|Polaroid cameras can be {{classified}} {{by the type of}} film they use. The earliest Polaroids (pre-1963) used instant roll film. Roll film came in two rolls (positive/developing agent and negative) which were loaded into the camera and was eventually offered in three sizes (40, 30, and 20 series). The next generation of Polaroid cameras used 100 series [...] "pack film," [...] where the photographer pulled the film out of the camera, then <b>peeled</b> <b>apart</b> the positive from the negative {{at the end of the}} developing process. Pack film initially was offered in a rectangular format (100 series), then in square format (80 series). Third generation Polaroids, like the once popular SX-70, used a square format integral film, in which all components of the film (negative, developer, fixer, etc.) were contained. Each exposure developed automatically once the shot was taken. SX-70 (or Time Zero) film had a strong following with artists who used it for image manipulation.|$|R

40|$|Cultures of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 were starved of {{threonine}} for 10 hr {{and then}} allowed to reinitiate growth {{in a fresh}} complete medium. On regrowth, culture turbidity began to increase within 10 min, but the ability of cells to autolyze did not begin to increase until after 30 min.

This was followed, at about 40 min, by a notching, splitting, and <b>peeling</b> <b>apart</b> of {{the base of the}} cross wall. After this, extension of new thin peripheral wall from the nascent cross wall appeared to push old thick wall toward the poles. After the first cell division, asymmetric cells with one initial generation thick-walled pole and one second generation thin-walled pole were seen. After two divisions, thick-walled hemispheres were still seen, suggesting conservation of old wall during this time. A small fraction of the initial cell population exhibited aberrations and difficulties in reinitiating linear wall extension and were useful in the establishment of a model for the reinitiation of linear wall extension...|$|R

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{a marine}} bacterium, designated isolate c-A 1, to lysis in distilled water and in salt solutions {{has been found}} to be a function of Na+ concentration. Optical densities of cells pre-exposed to 0. 05 m MgCl 2 were maintained in 1. 0 m KCl, whereas those of cells pre-exposed to 1. 0 m NaCl were not maintained at any KCl concentration tested. Cells transferred from MgCl 2 to low concentrations of NaCl underwent more extensive lysis than did those transferred to distilled water. The degree of disruption of cells transferred to distilled water from mixtures of 0. 05 m MgCl 2 and NaCl (0 to 1. 0 m) was dependent on the concentration of NaCl; similar results were obtained with LiCl, but not with KCl. In electron micrographs of thin sections, c-A 1 cell envelopes consisted of two double-track layers which fractured and <b>peeled</b> <b>apart</b> on lysis after pre-exposure to NaCl-MgCl 2 mixtures. Envelope eruptions or “hernias” occurred only in lysed cells pre-exposed to NaCl alone. No evidence for a functional lytic enzyme was found. Comparative studies on a terrestrial pseudomonad with a multilayered envelope indicated that preexposure to NaCl did not enhance the susceptibility of this cell to lysis in distilled water. The lytic susceptibility of the marine bacterium is considered to be the consequence of competition between specific monovalent cations and Mg++ for electrostatic interactions with components of the cell envelope of this organism...|$|R

40|$|Densely packed {{domains of}} {{membrane}} proteins are important structures in cellular processes that involve ligand-receptor binding, receptor-mediated adhesion, and macromolecule aggregation. We {{have used the}} biotin-avidin interaction at lipid vesicle surfaces to mimic these processes, including {{the influence of a}} surface grafted polymer, polyethyleneglycol (PEG). Single vesicles were manipulated by micropipette in solutions of fluorescently labeled avidin to measure the rate and give an estimate of the amount of avidin binding to a biotinylated vesicle as a function of surface biotin concentration and surface-grafted PEG as PEG-lipid. The rate of avidin adsorption was found to be four times less with 2 mol% PEG 750 than for the unmodified surface, and 10 mol% PEG completely inhibited binding of avidin to biotin for a 2 -min incubation. Using two micropipettes, an avidin-coated vesicle was presented to a biotinylated vesicle. In this vesicle-vesicle adhesion test, the accumulation of avidin in the contact zone was observed, again by using fluorescent avidin. More importantly, by controlling the vesicle membrane tension, this adhesion test provided a direct measure of the spreading pressure of the biotin-avidin-biotin cross-bridges confined in the contact zone. Assuming ideality, this spreading pressure gives the concentration of avidin cross-bridges in the contact zone. The rate of cross-bridge accumulation was consistent with the diffusion of the lipid-linked "receptors" into the contact zone. Once adherent, the membranes failed in tension before they could be <b>peeled</b> <b>apart.</b> PEG 750 did not influence the mechanical equilibrium because it was not compressed in the contact zone, but it did perform an important function by eliminating all nonspecific adhesion. This vesicle-vesicle adhesion experiment, with a lower tension limit of 0. 01 dyn/cm, now provides a new and useful method with which to measure the spreading pressures and therefore colligative properties of a range of membrane-bound macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|In vitro 3 D {{culture is}} an {{important}} model for tissues in vivo. Cells in different locations of 3 D tissues are physiologically different, because {{they are exposed to}} different concentrations of oxygen, nutrients, and signaling molecules, and to other environmental factors (temperature, mechanical stress, etc). The majority of high-throughput assays based on 3 D cultures, however, can only detect the average behavior of cells in the whole 3 D construct. Isolation of cells from specific regions of 3 D cultures is possible, but relies on low-throughput techniques such as tissue sectioning and micromanipulation. Based on a procedure reported previously ("cells-in-gels-in-paper" or CiGiP), this paper describes a simple method for culture of arrays of thin planar sections of tissues, either alone or stacked to create more complex 3 D tissue structures. This procedure starts with sheets of paper patterned with hydrophobic regions that form 96 hydrophilic zones. Serial spotting of cells suspended in extracellular matrix (ECM) gel onto the patterned paper creates an array of 200 micron-thick slabs of ECM gel (supported mechanically by cellulose fibers) containing cells. Stacking the sheets with zones aligned {{on top of one another}} assembles 96 3 D multilayer constructs. De-stacking the layers of the 3 D culture, by <b>peeling</b> <b>apart</b> the sheets of paper, "sections" all 96 cultures at once. It is, thus, simple to isolate 200 -micron-thick cell-containing slabs from each 3 D culture in the 96 -zone array. Because the 3 D cultures are assembled from multiple layers, the number of cells plated initially in each layer determines the spatial distribution of cells in the stacked 3 D cultures. This capability made it possible to compare the growth of 3 D tumor models of different spatial composition, and to examine the migration of cells in these structures...|$|R

40|$|Many AAA+ {{molecular}} machines generate {{power and}} drive cellular processes by harnessing energy from cycles of ATP hydrolysis. ClpX {{is a relatively}} simple AAA+ ATPase that powers regulated protein degradation by binding native protein substrates, denaturing them, and translocating the unfolded molecule into the sequestered proteolytic compartment of its peptidase partner, ClpP. Mechanistic studies of ClpXP degradation provide insight into energy-dependent proteolysis and may help elucidate how other AAA+ motors function as well. By studying the ClpXP-mediated degradation of model substrates in native and denatured forms, I investigated the role of both substrate stability and ATP consumption during the individual substrate processing steps of this protease. My results demonstrate {{that the rate of}} substrate proteolysis by ClpXP correlates poorly with global thermodynamic stability, but instead appears to be influenced by the local stability of protein structure adjacent to the degradation tag, as well as the location of the tag within this individual local element. These findings support a directional unfolding mechanism whereby ClpXP denatures proteins by first <b>peeling</b> <b>apart</b> the structural elements that abut the recognition tag. Analysis of ATP consumption during denaturation and translocation reveals how the ClpXP motor operates during these ClpXP processing steps. ATP turnover rates are relatively fast during substrate translocation, utilizing about 1 ATP molecule per amino acid translocated. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis remains at a reduced but constant rate during the denaturation of native substrates independent of their intrinsic stability, but requires the hydrolysis of increasing numbers of ATP molecules as the stability of the substrate also increases. (cont.) These findings suggest that ClpXP is capable of denaturing very stable proteins by applying repeated cycles of an unfolding force linked to the cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Competition experiments further reveal that stable substrates are frequently released from CIpXP when they resist denaturation, but unstable substrates are rapidly engaged by the proteolytic machinery. This preference prevents ClpXP from being jammed with substrates that are difficult to unfold. Moreover, it allows the protease to selectively degrade poorly structured substrates that consequently require fewer cycles of ATP hydrolysis, thereby ensuring that the energy of ATP hydrolysis is used efficiently for protein degradation. These mechanistic features could be useful for other AAA+ ATPases that translocate polymers against a force. by Jon Anders Kenniston. Thesis (Ph. D.)
