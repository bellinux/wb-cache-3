40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate {{the design of the}} low speed direct driven multiphase PM generator for wind applications in which high voltage system is established by the use of a multilevel converter topology. An approach taken in this thesis for design of multiphase generator is that the generator is a multiphase open winding generator (i. e. both terminals (ends) of each winding are made accessible resulting in 12 terminals for a six phase machine). The generator studied in this thesis is a multi-pole, 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> PM generator with concentrated winding system. Two types of such 6 phase generators are investigated in this thesis paper. One is 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator with 60 degree phase shift between each phase and the other is a dual 3 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift between each set. This generator configuration allows the use of multilevel converter topology with cascaded dc links which is not possible in generators with multi-star configurations. For the design and analysis of 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator, a 120 slot, 116 poles PM generator with single layer concentrated winding has been chosen. The star of slot method has been used to obtain the winding configuration required for the generatorThe numerical and analytical methods are used to calculate different parameters of the test generator 2 like air gap flux, average flux density in the air gap, flux linkage in a phase, induced EMF, flux density distribution, inductances of the machine and also the cogging torque. Moreover, the effect of slotting of the generator on the flux density distribution due to magnet has also been investigated using analytical approach. The dynamic model equations for both 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> RFPM generator (i. e. 60 degree phase shift generator and 30 degree phase shift generator) have been developed using the dq theory. Based on those equations, the simulation models have been developed which are used to study the behavior of generator on connecting 2 level converter topology with cascaded dc link and boost chopper. A lab experiment has also been carried out on the test generator to study the behavior of 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator when it is connected to a 2 level converter topology. Out of many results observed in the lab, one prime result was the voltage stress in the winding insulation and it was found to be close to but lower than the induced voltage per phase. Therefore, it can be concluded that the voltage stress in the winding insulation is not a problem for this generator configuration. The value of cogging torque obtained from the lab test and that obtained from the analytical approach are satisfactorily close. Moreover, it is very low compared to the nominal torque of the PM generator which is one the main advantages of single layer concentrated winding PM machines. However, the other results obtained from the lab and those obtained from the simulations i. e. current drawn and the electromagnetic torque, do not match. So, more work is required on the improvement of generator model so that it can emulate the lab results to a satisfactory level. However, from the simulation results, it was also observed that for the same rectifier-converter-load topology, from the generator s perspective, whether the 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator is configured with 60 degree phase shift or is configured as dual 3 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift, the two models of generator behaves similarly. There is not any typical advantage of dual 3 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift over 6 <b>phase</b> open <b>winding</b> generator with 60 degree phase shift or vice versa. The above conclusion has been drawn based on the generator s behavior only (i. e. output generator voltage, current drawn from the generator and mean electromagnetic torque) but if we see from the converters perspective, the conclusion might be different and since it is not in the scope of this thesis, it has not been considered here...|$|R

50|$|Early {{proposals}} {{have suggested that}} superconductivity is dominant in the γ band. In particular, the candidate chiral p-wave order parameter in the momentum space exhibits k-dependence <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> which is characteristic of time-reversal symmetry breaking. This peculiar single-band superconducting order is expected to give rise to appreciable spontaneous supercurrent {{at the edge of}} the sample. Such an effect is closely associated with the topology of the Hamiltonian describing Sr2RuO4 in the superconducting state, which is characterized by a nonzero Chern number. However, scanning probes have so far failed to detect expected time-reversal symmetry breaking fields generated by the supercurrent, off by orders of magnitude. This has led some to speculate that superconductivity arises dominantly from the α and β bands instead. Such a two-band superconductor, although having k-dependence <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> in its order parameters on the two relevant bands, is topologically trivial with the two bands featuring opposite Chern numbers. Therefore, it could possibly give a much reduced if not completely cancelled supercurrent at the edge. However, this naive reasoning was latter found not to be entirely correct: the magnitude of edge current is not directly related to the topological property of the chiral state. In particular, although the non-trivial topology is expected to give rise to protected chiral edge states, due to U(1) symmetry-breaking the edge current is not a protected quantity. In fact, it has been shown that the edge current vanishes identically for any higher angular momentum chiral pairing states which feature even larger Chern numbers, such as chiral d-, f-wave etc.|$|E

Its stator winding, which consists of a 3 <b>phase</b> <b>winding,</b> is provided with a 3 phase supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply.

The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the starting arrangements.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for fault detection, faulted <b>phase</b> and <b>winding</b> {{identification of}} a three-winding power transformer based on the induced voltages in the electrical power system. The ratio of the induced voltages of the primary-secondary, primary-tertiary and secondary-tertiary windings {{is the same as}} the corresponding turns ratio during normal operating conditions, magnetic inrush, and over-excitation. It differs from the turns ratio during an internal fault. For a single phase and a three-phase power transformer with wye-connected windings, the induced voltages of each pair of windings are estimated. For a three-phase power transformer with delta-connected windings, the induced voltage differences are estimated to use the line currents, because the delta winding currents are practically unavailable. Six detectors are suggested for fault detection. An additional three detectors and a rule for faulted <b>phase</b> and <b>winding</b> identification are presented as well. The proposed algorithm can not only detect an internal fault, but also identify the faulted <b>phase</b> and <b>winding</b> of a three-winding power transformer.

40|$|The {{three phase}} {{permanent}} magnet synchronous generator with full scale converter arrangement has gained significant {{market share in}} win energy turbine topology. This {{is because of the}} advancement in production of superior magnetic properties and steady decline in price of the magnets. Permanent magnet synchronous generators are of compact in size and light in weight. They become attractive for offshore wind application. But offshore wind energy system has to be not only light weight and compact in size but also reliable operation. The majority of failures of wind turbines are the electrical systems. To increase the reliability of the ordinary three <b>phase</b> <b>wind</b> energy system, a six <b>phase</b> <b>wind</b> energy system is proposed: a six phase permanent magnet synchronous connected to six leg converter. To harness the maximum energy from the wind, the viable option is using variable speed wind turbine. Variable speed operation of drive is achieved by suitable control of generator-converter system.

Step by step approach is used to tackle the problem. First the dynamic modeling of six phase permanent magnet in different references frames is studied.

When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode.

This rectification of the whole AC waveform is thus called {{full-wave rectification}}.|$|E
50|$|Tuning of {{the output}} {{wavelength}} {{is achieved by}} smoothly varying the helical pitch: as the winding changes, so does the length scale of the crystal. This in turn shifts the band edge and changes the optical path length in the lasing cavity. Applying a static electric field perpendicular to the dipole moment of the local nematic phase rotates the rod-like subunits in the hexagonal plane and reorders the chiral <b>phase,</b> <b>winding</b> or unwinding the helical pitch. Similarly, optical tuning of the output wavelength is available using laser light far from the pick-up frequency of the gain medium, with degree of rotation governed by intensity and the angle between the polarization of the incident light and the dipole moment. Reorientation is stable and reversible. The chiral pitch of a cholesteric phase tends to unwind with increasing temperature, with a disorder-order transition to the higher symmetry nematic phase at the high end. By applying a temperature gradient perpendicular to the direction of emission varying the location of stimulation, frequency may be selected across a continuous spectrum. Similarly, a quasi-continuous doping gradient yields multiple laser lines from different locations on the same sample. Spatial tuning may also be accomplished using a wedge cell. The boundary conditions of the narrower cell squeeze the helical pitch by requiring a particular orientation at the edge, with discrete jumps where the outer cells rotate to the next stable orientation; frequency variation between jumps is continuous.|$|E
50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E
