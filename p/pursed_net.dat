40|$|Temperature, {{as one of}} {{the main}} factors, is thought to play a {{dominant}} role in determining the spatial and temporal distribution of fish centers and fishing grounds. For many species of marine fish, research has provided much information about their spawning, feeding habitats and migrations; However, such information is always empirical. In order to investigate the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and <b>purse</b> <b>net</b> productivity in East China Sea (N 24 -N 36,E 118. 5 -E 130), a time series of mean weekly SST images and corresponding <b>purse</b> <b>net</b> statistic productivity were analyzed in detail for the region from 1987 - 1997 using Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis models and mapping techniques. Thereby, It is concluded that SST data has great correlation with <b>purse</b> <b>net</b> productivity and their relationship varied steadily in certain range over time and area...|$|R

50|$|Nets were {{formerly}} {{all made}} by hand. They can be started {{from a single}} point, for round <b>nets</b> (such as <b>purse</b> <b>nets,</b> net bags, or hair nets), but square nets are usually started from a headrope. A line {{is tied to the}} headrope at regular intervals, forming a series of loops. This can be done using slipped overhand knots, as in the image above, or using other knots, such as clove hitches. Subsequent rows are then worked using sheet bends, as shown, or another knot (some nets, such as hammocks, may even be looped rather than knotted).|$|R
5000|$|The Puretic {{power block}} {{revolutionized}} {{the technology of}} hauling fishing <b>nets,</b> particularly <b>purse</b> seine <b>nets.</b> According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), [...] "no single invention has contributed more {{to the success of}} <b>purse</b> seine <b>net</b> hauling" [...] than the power block, which was [...] "the linch-pin in the mechanization of purse seining".|$|R
50|$|A long net is used (similar to the <b>purse</b> <b>nets</b> {{used when}} ferreting) to catch rabbits {{that have been}} scared across a field. long netting was the primary method of {{catching}} farmed rabbits in England before they become a major pest. This method is still used today when ferret or shooting isn't an effective method due to hedgerows or large warrens.|$|R

50|$|The {{settlers}} {{learned the}} use of seine nets from Native Americans. By 1895 there were eighty-four seines on the Columbia, and Robert Hume started hauling them with teams of horses. The seines were operated from day break to dawn around islands and along beaches. At Puget Sound salmon were caught by fishing boats using <b>purse</b> seine <b>nets.</b> <b>Purse</b> seine <b>nets</b> are used to encircle a school of salmon and then trap them by drawing ("pursing") {{the bottom of the}} net together, as you would with a string purse. By 1905 the boats used engines for hauling the seine lines. In 1922 it was made illegal to use salmon purse seiners on and around the Columbia. In 1948, horse and manual seines were also outlawed.|$|R
50|$|Typically, long nets {{are placed}} around burrows {{so that a}} bolting rabbit (that is, one leaving its burrow while being chased by a ferret or other animal) will become ensnared, {{allowing}} the hunter to dispatch it. Another method {{is to use a}} <b>purse</b> <b>net,</b> which is a net with a draw string at the opening. This net is placed over the burrow, so that when the rabbit bolts, it will run into the net and cause the draw string to pull the net shut.|$|R

Groups of six subjects with differing votes divide a fixed purse by majority rule in online chat rooms. Earnings proxy for measured power. Chat rooms and processes for selecting subjects reduce or eliminate extraneous forces. Logrolling remains as the primary political force. Subjects' initial proposals for division of the purse allow measurement of effects from focal points and transaction costs. Divisions of <b>purses,</b> <b>net</b> of those effects, closely fit the SSPI, averaging 1. 033 of their SSPI values.

Catch composition revealed that all types of aquatic organisms are being caught by this net. Benefit-cost ratio of studied fishing net was also calculated. Frequent fishing by this net, especially in streams of remote areas of the Chalan Beel resulting in decline of fish species and abundance.

The species is protected federally under the Environment Protection Biodiversity & Conservation Act.|$|R
5000|$|Jack {{mackerels}} or saurels are marine {{fish in the}} Trachurus genus of {{the family}} Carangidae. The name of the genus derives from the Greek words trachys ("rough") and oura ("tail"). Some species, such as T. murphyi, are harvested in <b>purse</b> seine <b>nets,</b> and overfishing (harvesting beyond sustainable levels) has sometimes occurred.|$|R
50|$|The fishery’s {{sustainability}} {{has also}} been certified by independent organizations. Friend of the Sea, an international seafood sustainability certification program, has recognized both the Atlantic menhaden and Gulf menhaden fisheries as sustainable. This is both due to the healthy {{status of the stock}} as well as the fishery’s low levels of bycatch, which it achieves with the use of <b>purse</b> seine <b>nets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The green jack {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} species of fish within its range, and as such is quite important to fisheries throughout its range. It is taken by pelagic trawls, inshore gill <b>nets,</b> <b>purse</b> <b>nets,</b> and seines, as well as hook and line gear. Catch statistics are not kept for the fish throughout most of its range; however, the Mexican state of Colima is one exception. Records from 1980 onward show a catch between 9 and 250 tons, with an average of 93 tons, with the catch best between September and December. Like most carangid species in the area, it is considered a lower class product, fetching between US$ 0.50 and 0.80 per kilogram, making it accessible to the low-income population. The fish are sold both for consumption and as bait, either fresh, smoked or salted. Some hope the Hawaiian population becomes commercially viable in the future, as they are often landed in other carangid catches at the present.|$|R

50|$|Kyaikkami is {{blessed with}} some of Myanmar 's most {{bountiful}} fishing grounds. In Kyaikkami, there are several types of fisheries, including coastal or inshore fisheries, and offshore or deep-sea fisheries. A majority of these fish are harvested by commercial means, which includes the use of trawling <b>nets,</b> <b>purse</b> seins, drift <b>net</b> and gill net. A minority still use traditional techniques, such as hook-an-line, cast net, bag net, trammel gill net and traps.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author advanced a proposal on {{the method of}} fish transportation through a piping without using any fish pump. In this system based on these suggestions, a fish hold is closed and suppose {{it to be a}} large suction strainer box. When a pump draw up fishes together with water, the fishes can be intercepted by a screen plate, and only water will be discharged from the fish hold through the pump. Therefore, the pump need not passing any fish, and so, every type of pump can be useful for this purpose. The experiments performed with model or living fishes, shows that the fish body is not damaged at all, and the pump handling is quite simple. Generally, a mass produced pump has merits of low cost, small size and high efficiency. This method is now practicable to lift mackerel from a <b>purse</b> <b>net</b> into the fish hold. And, a further application of this method, will enable to establish a technique of netless fishing. ...|$|R
