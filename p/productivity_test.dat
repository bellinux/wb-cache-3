Eight subjects visited the climate room on two occasions: 1) exposure to a transient condition (a moderate temperature ramp) and 2) a steady temperature corresponding with a neutral thermal sensation (control situation).

40|$|Competitive Market Segmentation Abstract In a two-firm model {{where each}} firm sells a {{high-quality}} and a low-quality {{version of a}} product, customers differ {{with respect to their}} brand preferences and their attitudes towards quality. We show that the standard result of quality-independent markups crucially depends {{on the assumption that the}} customers' valuation of quality is identical across firms. Once we relax this assumption, competition across qualities leads to second-degree price discrimination. We find that markups on low-quality products are higher if consuming a low-quality product involves a firm-specific disutility. Likewise, markups on high-quality products are higher if consuming a high-quality product creates a firm-specific surplus.

Also, the action of these byproducts was compared with that of conventional amendments such as quarry limestone (QL), and gypsum (QG) Both QL, and SF were found to dramatically decrease the Al 3 + content of the soil solution by raising the pH and precipitating the ion as insoluble hydroxides. Both (QG), and the gypsum-based byproducts increased the content in total Al upon application of the first few percolation rates; however, a sizeable fraction of Al was in the form of ion-pairs with sulphate and fluoride ions —the latter were displaced from the soil matrix by sulphate ions from the gypsum materials in the QG case—; this decreased the concentration and activity of Al 3 + in the soil solution relative to the blank columns. With PG, F – displaced from the soil added to that contained in this byproduct, which increased the amount of Al–F ion-pairs formed relative to the other two gypsum-based byproducts. Unlike the calcareous amend-ments, the gypsum-based amendments also affected the AB horizon.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that eating disordered {{patients}} exhibit traits similar to alexithymia. Alexithymia {{can be described as}} an inability to identify or describe emotional experiences. Bruch (1973) has observed that eating disordered individuals have deficits in interoceptive awareness and are unable to correctly perceive and interpret bodily processes. These traits are often seen in patients with alexithymic tendencies. To date, very little empirical research has looked at the relationship between anorexia nervosa and alexithymia. Since eating disorders represent miscognitions of internal bodily based experiences, it seems reasonable to consider the relevance of this to alexithymia. In other words, are anorexics alexithymic? ^ The present study examined the prevalence of alexithymia in an anorexic sample as compared to a normal control sample. Three hypotheses were formulated. The first hypothesis stated that the mean alexithymia score will be significantly higher in the anorexic group as compared to the normal control group. The second hypothesis stated that the average spontaneous expression of inner cognitive and affective experience will be significantly lower in the anorexic group as compared to the normal control group. The third hypothesis stated {{that there will be a}} positive relationship between interoceptive awareness and alexithymia. In addition, a research question examined to what extent anorexia, fantasy level, interoceptive awareness and the subscales of the SCL- 90 -R predict alexithymia. The samples consisted of 53 female adolescents between the ages of 14 and 25. The first group consisted of 23 anorexic patients from a day treatment program from a large suburban university hospital; while the second group consisted of 30 participants who were recruited from a suburban private high school and through advertisements placed in local schools. Each subject completed 6 measures: Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2), Toronto Alexithymia Scale- 20 (TAS- 20), Ideational <b>Productivity</b> <b>Test</b> (transcendence index), and Symptom Checklist (SCL) - 90 R. ^ Overall results support the stated hypotheses. First, alexithymia was found to be more prevalent in an anorexic group as compared to a normal control group. Second, the anorexic group showed less spontaneous expression of inner cognitive and affective experience than the normal control group. Third, a large positive relationship was found between interoceptive awareness and alexithymia. In response to the research question, the results of a regression analysis revealed that most of the alexithymia variance could be attributed to group membership, depression and interoceptive awareness. ^ Implications for the usefulness in identifying children and young adolescents who might be at risk for developing anorexia and subsequent treatment are discussed. * ^ *Originally published in DAI Vol. 58, No. 7.

H Herbal-acupuncture was injected into abdomen of mice having S- 180 cancer cell line. Result : 1. During the test, LD 50 could not be counted since there was no expired subjects. 2. In an acute toxicity test, the loss of motility and reflex action was observed, but weight increased in the treatment group, compared with those in the normal group (P< 0. 05). 3. In an acute toxicity test of serum biochemical values of mice, glucose increased in the treatment group II while total cholesterol was increased in the all treatment groups (P< 0. 05). 4. In a subacute toxicity test, a little loss of motility and reflex action was observed in the treatment group. Weight of mice in the treatment group decreased on the 28 th day. 5. In a subacute toxicity test, liver weight was decreased but lung weight of mice increased in the all treatment groups (P< 0. 05). 6. As a result of measuring Complete Blood Count test (CBC) of rat, HCT was decreased in treatments even though it was not significant, compared with the normal group (P< 0. 05). 7. In a serum biochemical value test of subacute toxicity, total protein and albumin decreased in the all treatment groups. Creatinine, glucose, GOT increased in the treatment group I compared with the control group. Alkaline phos-phatase decreased in treatment II group, compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). 8.

Given our discussion of stylized facts about industry growth, economies of scale and differences in labour <b>productivity</b> we <b>test</b> for the existence of localised knowledge spillovers and a spatial wage structure in East Germany. We find that localised knowledge spillovers play a role and that a spatial wage structure exists in East Germany. ...|$|R
