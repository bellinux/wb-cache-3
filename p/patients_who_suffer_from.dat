5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

25|$|Conduction aphasia {{is another}} speech {{disorder}} {{that is similar}} to, but not the same as, apraxia of speech. Although <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> conduction aphasia have full comprehension of speech, as do AOS sufferers, {{there are differences between}} the two disorders.

25|$|Many <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> aphasia {{retain the}} ability to produce formulaic language, {{including}} conversational speech formulas and swear words—in some cases, patients are unable to create words or sentences, but {{they are able to}} swear.

25|$|Expressive aphasia: <b>Patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex.

Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E

25|$|In Trauma and Recovery, Herman {{expresses the}} {{additional}} concern that <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude {{to the historical}} misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so {{as a result of}} the intensity of the trauma bond – in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as Stockholm Syndrome – seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma – a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{deficient}} in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration {{of at least}} 6mg of the vitamin in pill form. <b>Patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12. Strategy for treatment {{is dependent on the}} patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning. Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly {{for the rest of the}} patients life. Daily oral supplementation of B12 mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the causes}} for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of {{miscellaneous}} factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as gastric reflux, lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for laryngoscopy and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. <b>Patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> the burning mouth syndrome, most likely menopausal women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.|$|E

500|$|According to BBC News, most <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> extreme {{hypothermia}} die, even if {{doctors are}} able to restart their hearts. The survival rate for adults whose body temperature has decreased to below [...] is 10%–33%. Prior to Bågenholm's accident, the lowest survived body temperature was , which had been recorded in a child. [...] Gilbert said [...] "victims of very deep accidental hypothermia with circulatory arrest {{should be seen as}} potentially resuscitable with a prospect of full recovery. The key success factors of such marginal resuscitation efforts are early bystander actions with vigorous CPR and early warning of the emergency system, early dispatch of adequate rescue units (ground and air-ambulances) and good co-ordination between the resources outside and inside the hospital, aggressive rewarming and a spirit not to give up." [...] General practitioner Jel Coward from Tywyn, Wales, said persons who are victims of extreme hypothermia are often mistakenly thought dead because {{it can be difficult to}} detect a pulse on them.

In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> catatonia, {{to force them to}} change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body, while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours, when the medication wore off.|$|E
