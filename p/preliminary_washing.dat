40|$|The {{effect of}} potato culinary {{processing}} on {{the changes in}} the content of nitrates and nitrites was determined. The experimental material were potato tubers of Ibis, Mila and Muza varieties with elevated nitrate (175. 4 - 250. 7 mg NO 3 • kg - 1) and nitrite (1. 7 - 4. 3 mg NO 2 • kg - 1) content. The losses of nitrites occurring after the <b>preliminary</b> processing (<b>washing,</b> manual peeling and rinsing) were greater than nitrates and ranged from 25 to 75 % and from 18 to 40 %, respectively. Differences in the losses of these compounds were variety-dependent. During thermal processing of potato tubers with different methods, the losses of these compounds varied and were significantly greater for nitrites (61 - 98 %) than for nitrates (16 - 62 %). The greatest decrease in the content of nitrates was found for deep fried potatoes and for boiling in water. The losses of nitrates are significantly higher in peeled potato tubers subjected to thermal processing with direct contact of the product with water (p= 0. 05) than in steam or oil...|$|R

40|$|Fly ash from {{municipal}} solid waste incinerators (MSWI) is classified as hazardous in the European Waste Catalogue. Proper stabilization processes should be required before any management option is put into practice. Due to the inorganic nature of MSWI fly ash, cementitious stabilization processes are worthy of consideration. However, the effectiveness of such processes can be severely compromised by the high content of soluble chlorides and sulphates. In this paper, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>washing</b> treatment has been optimized to remove {{as much as possible}} soluble salts by employing as little as possible water. Two different operating conditions (single-step and two-step) have been developed to this scope.

To ensure a high food value of canned products, in establishing the technological process should take termolability account both the solubility and valuable substances that some vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and nitrogenous substances. If the solubility of the substances determined, in particular, losses during the <b>preliminary</b> operations of <b>washing,</b> scalding, cooling, causes losses both during thermolability cooked, and during sterilization. The vitamins, which recorded the largest losses during the technological process, are vitamin C followed by B 1 and B 2 lesser extent. These vitamins, in addition to being water soluble, are thermo labile, but termolability depends largely on conditions of heating. Thus, vitamin C is destroyed in the presence of air even at a temperature of 50 ° C, but in the absence of air and acid, its resistance to heat action is much greater, mentioned that the acidic environment increases and the strength of vitamin B 1. In some cases, a short heating can contribute to keeping the vitamins in the product by removing air from the tissue and inactivation of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidation of vitamin C (ascorbinase) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. Whole saliva {{obtained}} {{immediately on}} arising, before brushing of the teeth, eating, or mouth rinsing was examined for enzyme activity. The enzymes measured were acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, total esterase, pseudocholinesterase, lipase, aryl-sulfatase, beta-D-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, hyaluronidase, and lysozyme. Hyaluronidase {{activities of the}} saliva samples were determined by a modification of the viscosimetric method. Lysozyme activities were measured turbidimetically. The remaining enzyme activities were determined by the colorimetric methods of Seligman and his co-workers, modified for use with saliva. The measurement of a spectrum of enzymes using various esters and derivatives of a single chromogenic substance, beta-naphthol, afforded a means of comparing the enzyme activities of saliva, while the simultaneous determination of ten enzymes on the same saliva sample permitted evaluation of the possible interrelationship between individual enzyme systems. 	Sterile parotid saliva, obtained by cannulation with a parotid cap, was shown to contain acid phosphatase, esterase, pseudocholinesterase, lipase, beta-glucuronidase, and lysozyme. The acid phosphatase activity of parotid saliva was 1 O% of that found in whole saliva. Cholinesterase represented 60 % of the activity of whole saliva. Parotid saliva contributed about 1 % to the whole saliva total esterase activity, while parotid lipase was approximately 1 O% of the whole saliva lipase titer. Parotid beta-glucuronidase was from 5 - 20 % of the amount found in whole saliva. Only with lysozyme was the activity of parotid saliva higher than that found in whole saliva. 	Broth cultures of whole saliva indicated that all but sulfatase and lysozyme could be produced by the microorganisms normally inhabiting the oral cavity. 	These findings indicated that the parotid gland secretion contributed a part of six of the ten enzymes present in whole saliva, with the remaining share of these six enzymes apparently derived from the oral flora, cellular debris, or the other salivary glands. 	In order to determine further the part-whole relationship of the parotid secretion to whole saliva, various inorganic, organic, nitrogenous and enzymic components of stimulated whole and parotid saliva were measured. An aqueous mouth rinse was employed to minimize the effect of oral microorganisms and cellular debris. One enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, was determined in whole saliva {{both before and after}} the washing process as an indicator for the effectiveness of the mouth rinse. Blood obtained from the test subjects was examined for enzyme titer so that serum and saliva enzyme levels could be compared using the same substrate for both, while the saliva levels for calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphorus, lactic acid, and non-protein nitrogen, total proteins, albumins, and globulins could be compared to established normal serum values. 	In measuring the effect of mouth rinsing on the whole saliva enzyme levels it was found that the beta-glucuronidase level decreased 40 % after washing. Similarly, acid phosphatase values showed a 29 % decrease from the values found in the group which did not have the <b>preliminary</b> mouth <b>washing.</b> 	Two tests, the chi square goodness of fit and a plot of the distribution, of each of the saliva and serum components measured, were used together in a combined judgment in order to gauge the normality of the distribution. Seven (total esterase, lipase, cholinesterase, total proteins, globulins, organic phosphorus, and lactate) of the twenty-one factors measured in whole saliva were abnormally distributed; six (total esterase, lipase, total proteins, albumins, globulins, and potassium) of the twenty factors determined in parotid saliva were found to have an abnormal distribution; while one of the serum enzymes, beta-glucuronidase, proved to be abnormal. The remaining components for whole saliva, parotid saliva, and serum could thus be considered normally distributed populations. 	Measurement of the various salivary components indicated that whole saliva was higher than parotid saliva in regard to the calcium, inorganic phosphorus, albumins, non-protein nitrogen and hydroxyl ion contents; while the parotid secretion contained greater amounts of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, organic phosphorus, lactic acid, total proteins and globulins. An analysis of the difference between the means of each variable in parotid saliva versus its counterpart in whole saliva was made. With the exception of chloride, inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus, albumins, and lactic acid a significant difference existed between the mean whole saliva level and the mean parotid saliva level. 	Human serum normally maintains an anionic and cationic balance of approximately 155 milli-equivalents per liter, with little variation except during marked acidosis, alkalois, or excessive salt excretion. Whole saliva had a mean total anion content of 37. 7 +/- 12. 0 mEq/liter and a mean total cation content of 40. 7 +/- 12. 8 mEq/liter. The mean total anion content of parotid saliva was 47. 4 +/- 19. 2 mEq/liter, while the mean total cation content was 43. 9 +/- 17. 1 mEq/L. Saliva thus contained approximately 25 % of the ionic content of serum. When the individual salivary components were compared to their serum counterparts it was found that only the potassium and inorganic phosphorus levels of whole and parotid saliva and the calcium level of whole saliva were greater than normal serum values. 	It was noted that parotid saliva contained relatively high levels of acid phosphatase and total esterases. The acid phosphatase levels of the parotid secretion were found to be similar in titer to those present in human serum. It was these findings which led to the study of the properties of the parotid saliva phosphomonoesterase and total esterase. Characterization of these enzymes thus permitted comparison with similar enzymes present in the other body tissues and aided in their identification. 	The pH activity curve for the phosphomonoesterase was determined over the range pH 2. 70 - 5. 98 in 1. 2 M acetate buffer at a substrate concentration of 8. 9 x 10 ^- 4 M. 	Results indicated that the pH optimum for parotid saliva acid phosphatase was 4. 57 with beta-naphthyl phosphate as substrate. The reaction rate followed zero order when the substrate concentration was sufficiently high. When the initial substrate concentration was lowered there was a deviation from zero order as the reaction proceeded. If the initial substrate was further decreased and increased amounts of enzyme employed the reaction tended to follow those of a monomolecular reaction, or first order, Using the method of Lineweaver and Burk a plot of S (substrate concentration) against S/V (substrate concentration/ velocity of reaction) the Michaelis constant, Km, was found to have a value of 2 x 10 ^- 4 M. 	The energies of activation and inactivation were determined for the salivary phosphomonoesterase at the pH optimum. Enzyme activity was measured at nine temperatures over 25 and 55 °C. The energy of activation was between 6, 600 and 7, 600 cal. /mole., while the energy of inactivation was found to be between 32, 900 and 35, 900 cal. /mole. The temperature coefficient (Q 10) was 1. 48. Maximum activity occurred at 47 °C. 	Although the substrate employed for the investigation of the parotid total esterases was attacked most readily by the nonspecific esterases of liver; cholinesterase and lipase were also able to catalyze its hydrolysis. Thus it may be assumed that the cholinesterase and lipase observed in saliva, as well as any nonspecific esterase present contributed to the hydrolysis of beta-naphthyl acetate by parotid saliva. 	In dealing with the multiple effects caused by the simultaneous action of several enzymes on a single substrate, each enzyme having its own particular characteristics, certain deviations of the resulting data from ideal were to be expected. However, this did not occur with the total esterase activity of parotid saliva, which acted as a single enzyme. 	Results of the investigation indicated an optimum of pH 8. 57 for parotid saliva total esterases. When a sufficiently high initial substrate concentration was employed the reaction was zero order up to six hours. Longer periods of incubations could not be employed due to the high degree of spontaneous hydrolysis encountered. The Michaelis-Menten constant was calculated to be 14. 48 x 10 ^- 4 M. A linear relationship between saliva volume and the amount of beta-naphthyl acetate hydrolyzed was observed. The energy of activation was 5, 860 calories/mole. Maximum activity occurred at 60 °C. The temperature coefficient (Q 10) of the interval 25 - 35 degrees C was 1. 69, while a QlO of 1. 38 was observed for the interval 35 - 45 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 It {{has been}} {{reported}} that cyanide inactivates the succinate dehydrogenase activity of HMP toward cytochrome c, oxygen, methylene blue and DCIP. In the present study, it was found that cyanide also solubilizes the SDH from HMP, this is reflected by the extent of solubilization of acid nonextractable flavin in the supernatant after cyanide treatment. The solubilization reaction is dependent on a variety of factors like temperature, cyanide concentration, time of exposure to cyanide and the age of HMP but independent of pH. The soluble SDH was not reactive towards methylene blue, DCIP, and cytochrome c but was active toward PMS and ferricyanide. Incubation of HMP with 40 mM succinate or dithionite completely prevented the solubilization of flavin by cyanide indicating that cyanide acted only on the oxidized form of the enzyme. The activity towards PMS was however very small and hence a differential extraction procedure has been developed to improve the specific activity. This was achieved by a <b>preliminary</b> <b>washing</b> whereby most of the inactive proteins were removed followed by a second extraction resulting in considerable increase in the specific activity...|$|E

40|$|Zero valent iron (ZVI) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as a reactive medium for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in reactive permeable barriers. The kinetic rate depends strongly on the superficial oxidation of the iron particles used and the <b>preliminary</b> <b>washing</b> of ZVI increases the rate.

We assumed a shrinking particle type model where the kinetic rate {{is proportional to the}} available iron surface area, to the initial volume of solution and to the chromium concentration raised to a power ˛ which is the order of the chemical reaction occurring at surface.

The influence of the following parameters was experimentally studied: initial available surface area, chromium concentration, temperature and pH. The assumed order for the reaction was confirmed.

40|$|The {{sintering}} process of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) fly ash was investigated in order to manufacture sintered products for reuse as concrete aggregates. Four types of fly ash resulting from different Italian MSW incineration plants were tested in this study. A modification of the chemical composition of MSW fly ash - through a preliminary four-stage washing treatment of this material with water - was attempted to improve the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products. The sintering treatment of untreated or washed fly ash was performed on cylindrical compact specimens (15 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height) at different com act pressures, sintering temperatures and times. The {{sintering process}} of untreated MSW fly ashes proved to be ineffective for manufacturing sintered products for reuse as a construction material, because of the adverse chemical characteristics of these fly ashes in terms of sulfate, chloride, and vitrifying oxide contents. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>washing</b> treatment of MSW fly ash with water greatly improved the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products and, for all the types of fly ash tested, the sintered products satisfied the Italian requirements for normal weight aggregates for use in concretes having a specified strength not greater than 12 and 15 N/mm(2), when measured on cylindrical and cubic specimens, respectively. A compact pressure of 28 N/mm(2), a sintering temperature of 1140 degreesC, and a sintering time of 60 min were the best operating conditions for manufacturing sintered products of washed MSW fly ash.
