5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E

Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for <b>protective</b> <b>gas</b> masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Molten Mg alloys {{burn rapidly}} in air if not {{protected}}. In order to handle molten Mg safely, the molten metal {{should be protected}} from oxidation by covering the surface with flux or <b>protective</b> <b>gases.</b> Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas is widely used for Mg alloy as a cover gas and {{has proved to be}} a successful inhibitor. However, the use of SF 6 gas is limited because of its high cost and its significant impact on global warming potential (GWP). Therefore, SF 6 gas is being replaced by alternative protection gases such as tetrafluoro ethane (HFC- 134 a) and 3 M Novec TM 612. These gases are less expensive and have lower GWP, compared with SF 6 gas. Recent studies show that there has been another attempt by adding CaO into Mg alloys to manufacture CaO added AZ 31 Mg alloy in terms of increasing ignition temperature and reducing <b>protective</b> cover <b>gas</b> amount during melting and casting.

In particular, the pulsed YAG laser {{is an extremely}} flexible and versatile too] capable of hermetically sealing microelectronics packages containing sensitive components without damaging them.

These include; metallurgical considerations such as alloy and plating selection, weld joint configuration, design of optics, use of <b>protective</b> <b>gases</b> and control of thermal distortions. The primary limitations on use of laser welding electronic for packaging applications are economic ones. The laser itself is a relatively costly device when compared to competing welding equipment. Further, the cost of consumables and repairs can be significant. These facts have relegated laser welding to use only where it presents a distinct quality or reliability advantages over other techniques of electronic package sealing. Because of the unique noncontact and low heat inputs characteristics of laser welding, it is an ideal candidate for sealing electronic packages containing MEMS devices (microelectromechanical systems).

40|$|Abstract. Mg {{especially}} in the molten state {{is well known for}} its high affinity to O 2. When O 2 content of the atmosphere is larger than 4 %, molten Mg will burn! To avoid this, melt protection is necessary. At present mostly SF 6 is used during primary production and processing of Mg and its alloys. Unfortunately SF 6 is a very potent greenhouse gas that is> 23, 000 times more effective than CO 2. This also affects life cycle considerations e. g. for the use of Mg alloys in transportation. However, other <b>protective</b> <b>gases</b> like SO 2 or fluorinated hydrocarbons like HFC 134 a, Novec 612, or AMCover (=HFC 134 a) have been suggested to replace SF 6. Additionally fluxes mixed from different salts may be used again as well to protect molten Mg. But fluxes and feasible replacements of SF 6 also have disadvantages. Moreover SF 6 and other fluorinated hydrocarbons are under discussion {{especially in}} Europe. There is an existing EU legislation that will ban SF 6 from 2018 and there are similar discussions regarding all other fluorinated hydrocarbons. Due to this, new innovative ways have to be found or old methods have to be renewed to allow Mg industries further safe processing of molten magnesium.
