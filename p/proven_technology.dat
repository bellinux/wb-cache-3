2500|$|Each chamber {{has three}} lateral water-saving basins, {{for a total}} of nine basins per lock and 18 basins in total. Just like the {{original}} locks, the new locks and their basins will be filled and emptied by gravity, without the use of pumps.

The new locks are connected to the existing channel system through new navigational channels. The new lock chambers are [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] deep. They use rolling gates instead of miter gates, which are used by the original locks. Rolling gates are used in almost all existing locks with dimensions similar to the new ones, and are a <b>proven</b> <b>technology.</b> The new locks use tugboats to position the vessels instead of electric locomotives.
