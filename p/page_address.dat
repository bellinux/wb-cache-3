50|$|In computing, Physical Address Extension (PAE), {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>Page</b> <b>Address</b> Extension,is a memory management feature for the x86 architecture. PAE was first introduced by Intel in the Pentium Pro, and later by AMD in the Athlon processor. It defines a page table hierarchy of three levels, with table entries of 64 bits each instead of 32, allowing these CPUs to directly access a physical address space larger than 4 gigabytes (232 bytes).|$|E

50|$|In early computers, {{including}} the PDP-8, the zero page {{had a special}} fast addressing mode, which facilitated its use for temporary storage of data and compensated for the relative shortage of CPU registers. The PDP-8 had only one register, so zero <b>page</b> <b>addressing</b> was essential.|$|R

The first web <b>page</b> <b>address</b> was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext, technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed. You may find a later copy (1992) on the World Wide Web Consortium website.|$|E
50|$|A <b>page</b> <b>address</b> {{register}} (PAR) {{contains the}} physical addresses of pages {{currently held in}} the main memory of a computer system. PARs are used {{in order to avoid}} excessive use of an address table in some operating systems. A PAR may check a page's number against all entries in the PAR simultaneously, allowing it to retrieve the pages physical address quickly. A PAR is used by a single process and is only used for pages which are frequently referenced (though these pages may change as the process's behaviour changes in accordance with the principle of locality). An example computer which made use of PARs is the Atlas.|$|E
5000|$|With PAE, {{the page}} table entry of the x86 {{architecture}} is enlarged from 32 to 64 bits. This allows {{more room for}} the physical <b>page</b> <b>address,</b> or [...] "page frame number" [...] field, in the page table entry. In the initial implementations of PAE the page frame number field was expanded from 20 to 24 bits. The size of the [...] "byte offset" [...] from the address being translated is still 12 bits, so total physical address size increases from 32 bits to 36 bits (i.e. from 20+12 to 24+12). This increased the physical memory that is theoretically addressable by the CPU from 4 GB to 64 GB.|$|E

5000|$|The {{indirect}} modes {{are useful}} for array processing and other looping. With the 5/6 cycle [...] "(indirect),y" [...] mode, the 8-bit Y register is added to a 16-bit base address read from zero page which is located by a single byte following the opcode. The Y register is therefore an index-register {{in the sense that}} it is used to hold an actual index (as opposed to the X register in the 6800 where a base address was directly stored and to which an immediate offset could be added). Incrementing the index register to walk the array byte-wise takes only two additional cycles. With the less frequently used [...] "(indirect,x)" [...] mode the effective address for the operation is found at the zero <b>page</b> <b>address</b> formed by adding the second byte of the instruction to the contents of the X register. Using the indexed modes, the zero page effectively acts as a set of up to 128 additional (though very slow) address registers.|$|E
