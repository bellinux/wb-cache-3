In fact, the rs 1801157 polymorphism is located at a regulatory region of CXCL 12; however, there are conflicting results about the influence of this <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> expression. Some studies have shown that A allele carriers have increased CXCL 12 protein levels [27, 36]; on the other hand, de Oliveira et al.

50|$|Protein {{evolution}} {{describes the}} {{changes over time}} <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> shape, function, and composition. Through quantitative analysis and experimentation, scientists have strived to understand the rate and causes of protein evolution. Using the amino acid sequences of hemoglobin and cytochrome c from multiple species, scientists were able to derive estimations of protein evolution rates. What they found was that the rates were not the same among proteins. Each protein has its own rate, and that rate is constant across phylogenies (i.e., hemoglobin does not evolve {{at the same rate}} as cytochrome c, but hemoglobins from humans, mice, etc. do have comparable rates of evolution.). Not all regions within a protein mutate at the same rate; functionally important areas mutate more slowly and amino acid substitutions involving similar amino acids occurs more often than dissimilar substitutions. Overall, the level of <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> <b>proteins</b> seems to be fairly constant. Several species (including humans, fruit flies, and mice) have similar levels of protein polymorphism.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tandem repeat {{variation}} in protein-coding regions will alter protein length and may introduce frameshifts. Tandem repeat variants {{are associated with}} {{variation in}} pathogenicity in bacteria and with human disease. We characterized tandem repeat <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> human <b>proteins,</b> using the UniGene database, and tested whether these were associated with host defense roles. RESULTS: Protein-coding tandem repeat copy-number <b>polymorphisms</b> were detected <b>in</b> 249 tandem repeats found in 218 UniGene clusters; observed length differences ranged from 2 to 144 nucleotides, with unit copy lengths ranging from 2 to 57. This corresponded to 1. 59 % (218 / 13, 749) of proteins investigated carrying detectable <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> the copy-number of protein-coding tandem repeats. We {{found no evidence that}} tandem repeat copy-number polymorphism was significantly elevated <b>in</b> defense-response <b>proteins</b> (p = 0. 882). An association with the Gene Ontology term 'protein-binding' remained significant after covariate adjustment and correction for multiple testing. Combining this analysis with previous experimental evaluations of tandem repeat polymorphism, we estimate the approximate mean frequency of tandem repeat <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> human <b>proteins</b> to be 6 %. Because 13. 9 % of the polymorphisms were not a multiple of three nucleotides, up to 1 % of proteins may contain frameshifting tandem repeat polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: Around 1 <b>in</b> 20 human <b>proteins</b> are likely to contain tandem repeat copy-number polymorphisms within coding regions. Such polymorphisms are not more frequent among defense-response proteins; their prevalence among protein-binding proteins may reflect lower selective constraints on their structural modification. The impact of frameshifting and longer copy-number variants on protein function and disease merits further investigation...|$|R

Polymorphisms associated with blood pressure response at P&# 60; 10 – 5 were tested for replication of the associations in independent samples of hydrochlorothiazide-treated European hypertensives. The rs 16960228 <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> kinase C, α replicated for same-direction association with {{diastolic blood pressure}} response in the Nordic Diltiazem study (n= 420) and the Genetics of Drug Responsiveness in Essential Hypertension study (n= 206), and the combined 4 -study meta-analysis P value achieved genome-wide significance (P= 3. 3 × 10 − 8). Systolic or diastolic blood pressure responses were consistently greater in carriers of the rs 16960228 A allele than in GG homozygotes (&# 62; 4 / 4 mm Hg) across study samples.

40|$|Abstract Background Dyslipidemia {{has been}} {{associated}} with hypertension. The present study explored if <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> genes encoding <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> lipid metabolism could be used as predictors for the individual response to antihypertensive treatment. Methods Ten single nucleotide <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNP) <b>in</b> genes related to lipid metabolism were analysed by a microarray based minisequencing system in DNA samples from ninety-seven hypertensive subjects randomised to treatment with either 150 mg of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker irbesartan or 50 mg of the β 1 -adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol for twelve weeks. Results The reduction in blood pressure was similar in both treatment groups. The SNP C 711 T in the apolipoprotein B gene was associated with the blood pressure response to irbesartan with an average reduction of 19 mmHg in the individuals carrying the C-allele, but not to atenolol. The C 16730 T <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> the low density lipoprotein receptor gene predicted the change in systolic blood pressure in the atenolol group with an average reduction of 14 mmHg in the individuals carrying the C-allele. Conclusions <b>Polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> genes encoding <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> the lipid metabolism are associated with the response to antihypertensive treatment in a drug specific pattern.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this report}} we {{demonstrate}} that {{depletion of the}} major phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine, a single non-bilayer forming phospholipid of Escherichia coli, significantly reduces the secretion efficiency of alkaline phosphatase in vivo.

Depletion of this zwitterionic phospholipid also inhibits expression of the protein controlled by the endogenous PPHO promoter but not the PBAD promoter, which is suggested {{to be due to}} the effect of unbalanced phospholipid composition on the orthophosphate signal transduction system (Pho regulon) through an effect on its membrane bound sensor...|$|R

To further investigate the genomic diversity among this group and to help characterize lineages of the plague organism that have no sequenced members, we present here the genomes of two isolates of the "classical" Antiqua biovar, strains Antiqua and Nepal 516. The genomes of Antiqua and Nepal 516 are 4. 7 Mb and 4. 5 Mb and encode 4, 138 and 3, 956 open reading frames respectively. Though both strains belong {{to one of the}} three classical biovars, they represent separate lineages defined by recent phylogenetic studies. We compare all five currently sequenced Y. pestis genomes and the corresponding features in Y. pseudotuberculosis.

There are two closely related genes on chromosome 8 that encode the two human arylamine N-acetyltransferases-NAT 1 and NAT 2.

However, less {{attention has been paid}} to more drastic sequence polymorphisms which cause premature termination of a protein's sequence or large changes, insertions, or deletions in the sequence. We have analyzed a large set (n =  512) of insertions and deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms causing premature termination of translation in disease-related genes. Prediction of protein-destabilization effects was performed by graphical presentation of the locations of <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> the <b>protein</b> structure, using the Genomes TO Protein (GTOP) database, and manual annotation with a set of specific criteria. Protein-destabilization was predicted for 44. 4 % of the nonsense SNPs, 32. 4 % of the frameshifting indels, and 9. 1 % of the non-frameshifting indels. A prediction of nonsense-mediated decay allowed to infer which truncated proteins would actually be translated as defective proteins. These cases included the proteins linked to diseases inherited dominantly, suggesting a relation between these diseases and toxic aggregation. Our approach would be useful in identifying potentially aggregation-inducing polymorphisms that may have pathological effects...|$|R
40|$|The linker histone H 1 binds to the DNA {{in between}} {{adjacent}} nucleosomes {{and contributes to}} chromatin organization and transcriptional control. It is known that H 1 carries diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, lysine methylation and ADP-ribosylation. Their biological functions, however, remain largely unclear. This is {{in part due to}} the fact that most of the studies have been performed in organisms that have several H 1 variants, which complicates the analyses. We have chosen Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism, which has a single H 1 variant, to approach the study of the role of H 1 PTMs during embryonic development. Mass spectrometry mapping of the entire sequence of the protein showed phosphorylation only in the ten N-terminal amino acids, mostly at S 10. For the first time, changes in the PTMs of a linker H 1 during the development of a multicellular organism are reported. The abundance of H 1 monophosphorylated at S 10 decreases as the embryos age, which suggests that this PTM is related to cell cycle progression and/or cell differentiation. Additionally, we have found a <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> the <b>protein</b> sequence that can be mistaken with lysine methylation if the analysis is not rigorous. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cerebral {{ischemia}} {{involves a}} series of reactions which ultimately influence the final volume of a brain infarction. We hypothesize that <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> genes encoding <b>proteins</b> involved <b>in</b> these reactions could act as modifiers of the cerebral response to ischemia and impact the resultant stroke volume. The final volume of a cerebral infarct is important as it correlates with the morbidity and mortality associated with non-lacunar ischemic strokes. Methods The proteins encoded by the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and glutathione S-transferase omega- 1 (GSTO- 1) genes are, through oxidative mechanisms, key participants in the cerebral response to ischemia. On {{the basis of these}} biological activities, they were selected as candidate genes for further investigation. We analyzed the C 677 T <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> the MTHFR gene and the C 419 A <b>polymorphism</b> <b>in</b> the GSTO- 1 gene in 128 patients with non-lacunar ischemic strokes. Results We found no significant association of either the MTHFR (p = 0. 72) or GSTO- 1 (p = 0. 58) polymorphisms with cerebral infarct volume. Conclusion Our study shows no major gene effect of either the MTHFR or GSTO- 1 genes as a modifier of ischemic stroke volume. However, given the relatively small sample size, a minor gene effect is not excluded by this investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> genes {{encoding}} <b>proteins</b> involved <b>in</b> vitamin D {{metabolism and}} transport are recognised to influence vitamin D status. Syntheses of genetic association studies linking these variants to non-skeletal health outcomes are lacking. We therefore conducted a literature review to identify reports of statistically significant associations between single nucleotide <b>polymorphisms</b> (SNP) <b>in</b> 11 vitamin D pathway genes (DHCR 7, CYP 2 R 1, CYP 3 A 4, CYP 27 A 1, DBP, LRP 2, CUB, CYP 27 B 1, CYP 24 A 1, VDR and RXRA) and non-bone health outcomes and circulating levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25 [OH] 2 D). A total of 120 genetic association studies reported positive associations, of which 44 investigated determinants of circulating 25 (OH) D and/or 1, 25 (OH) 2 D concentrations, and 76 investigated determinants of non-skeletal health outcomes. Statistically significant associations were reported {{for a total}} of 55 SNP in the 11 genes investigated. There was limited overlap between genetic determinants of vitamin D status and those associated with non-skeletal health outcomes: <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> DBP, CYP 2 R 1 and DHCR 7 were the most frequent to be reported to associate with circulating concentrations of 25 (OH) D, while <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> VDR were most commonly reported to associate with non-skeletal health outcomes, among which infectious and autoimmune diseases were the most represented...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying evolutionary changes <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> length {{are poorly}} understood. Protein domains are lost and gained between species {{and must have}} arisen first as within-species polymorphisms. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster population genomic data combined with between species divergence information to understand the evolutionary forces that generate and maintain <b>polymorphisms</b> causing changes <b>in</b> <b>protein</b> length <b>in</b> D. melanogaster. Specifically, we looked for protein length variations resulting from premature termination codons (PTCs) and stop codon losses (SCLs). We discovered that 438 genes contained <b>polymorphisms</b> resulting <b>in</b> truncation of the translated region (PTCs) and 119 genes contained polymorphisms predicted to lengthen the translated region (SCLs). Stop codon polymorphisms (SCPs) (especially PTCs) {{appear to be more}} deleterious than other polymorphisms, including protein amino acid changes. Genes harboring SCPs are in general less selectively constrained, more narrowly expressed, and enriched for dispensable biological functions. However, we also observed exceptional cases such as genes that have multiple independent SCPs, alleles that are shared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, and high-frequency alleles that cause extreme changes in gene length. SCPs likely have {{an important role in the}} evolution of these genes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Scrapie is a fatal {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder of}} {{sheep and goats}} caused by post-translational conformational change in the host-encoded prion protein (PrP C). Susceptibility or resistance to scrapie {{has been associated with}} the presence of <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> the prion <b>protein</b> (PrP) gene. <b>In</b> the present study, we analyzed the PrP gene sequence to determine the frequency of <b>polymorphisms</b> <b>in</b> 56 sheep (28 each from Damani and Hashtnagri breeds) and 56 goats (28 each from Kamori and Local Hairy breeds). A total of 7 amino acid <b>polymorphisms</b> were detected <b>in</b> the PrP gene for sheep and 4 for goats. These amino acid <b>polymorphisms</b> were combined <b>in</b> 13 alleles and 15 genotypes in sheep and 5 alleles and 6 genotypes in goats. The overall frequency of the most sheep scrapie-resistant polymorphism (Q 171 R) was calculated to be 0. 107. The most scrapie-susceptible polymorphism (A 136 V) was not detected in any of the studied sheep. The overall frequency of scrapie-associated polymorphism (H 143 R) in goats was found to be 0. 152. Along with already known amino acid polymorphisms, two novel polymorphisms were also detected for each of sheep (Q 171 N and T 191 I) and goats (G 22 C and P 63 L). However, the overall frequency of these polymorphisms was extremely low. </p...|$|R
