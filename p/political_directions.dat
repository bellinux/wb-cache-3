2500|$|Hagen {{has been}} {{regarded}} as the first postmodern politician in Norway by Gudleiv Forr, writing for the Norsk biografisk leksikon. His early success {{has been attributed to}} his ability to use the media in his favour through populist speech. He also managed to somewhat moderate the profile of the party from the more vulgar tone of Anders Lange. Though he identifies himself as a classical liberal, his political practice has been described by political commentators as being populist. His ability to balance different <b>political</b> <b>directions,</b> was seen by Forr as displaying [...] "his mastering of the role of being party leader." [...] Forr also claimed that Hagen has a talent of double communication, which has left the diverse voter group of the party with different impressions of the policies of the party, sometimes leading to internal schisms. His success has also been attributed to his leadership tactics, which included suspending and removing members of the party who deviated too much from his views.|$|E
2500|$|The second main {{legislative}} body is the Council, which {{is composed of}} different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a [...] "European Council" [...] (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general <b>political</b> <b>directions</b> and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', {{but it does not}} itself exercise 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bind the member states in decisions. When voting takes place, where unanimity is not required, a [...] "qualified majority" [...] (defined as a majority of 55% of the Member States representing 65% {{of the population of the}} Union) can approve legislation. This replaces a previous system where votes were weighted according to member state size, (Germany, France, Italy, and UK: 29 votes each. Spain and Poland: 27. Romania: 14. Netherlands: 13. Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal: 12. Bulgaria, Austria, Sweden: 10. Denmark, Ireland, Croatia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Finland: 7. Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia: 4. Malta: 3.) This was set by the 2014 Protocol No 36 on Transitional Provisions, art 3(3) amended by art 20 for Croatia Accession Treaty 2011. In total there were 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes. This is critical during the legislative process.|$|E
