50|$|<b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus,</b> the South Georgia icefish, is {{a species}} of {{crocodile}} icefish only known from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Scotia Sea where it occurs from the surface to 475 m. This species grows to a length of 60 cm TL. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> is {{a member}} of the unique Channichthyidae family of fishes, which lack haemoglobin. The distribution, length-frequency and summer diet are {{described}} from 14 bottom trawl surveys undertaken in the summers between 1986 and 2006. <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> (50 - 590 mm TL) were caught throughout the South Georgia shelf from depths of 76 - 370 m, but very few specimens (< 1 %) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and length-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth is fast during the first 3 - 4 years. Stomach contents analysis (2005 & 2006) indicated that P. georgianus is a pelagic or semi pelagic predator, with the summer diet dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Fish (channichthyids and notothenids) were also taken, but were a relatively minor part of the diet...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that yolk {{deposition}} and final ovarian maturation were prolonged processes for many Antarctic fish. The adolescent phase in three species of channichthyid has been studied, based on an extensive series of samples over five seasons. Samples were obtained during a series of abundance estimation surveys on the shelf around South Georgia. Fish were measured, and sex and maturity stage determined from macroscopic examination of the gonads. It was found that for female Champsocephalus gunnari and <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> the adolescent phase lasts < 1 year but in Chaenocephalus aceratus it lasts for nearly 4 years. ...|$|E

Three species from this family were detected in the sector, represent 12 % of total ichthyic diversity and 37 % of total ichthyic cathes. Champsocephalus gunnari and Chaenocephalus aceratus made up 95 % of Channichthyidae cathes, and <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> made up the other 5 %. In the summer of 2004 - 2005, groups that are highly endemic to the southern oceans predominated. These were Myctophiidae, Nototheniidae, Channichthyidae and Bathydraconidae. Together these families represented more than 62 % of the ichthyic diversity in the sector, the 38 % were cosmopolitan fish.

40|$|The diurnal {{vertical}} distribution and abundance of fish larvae was studied by net samples in the 265 m deep fjord of Cumberland East Bay, South Georgia. In early spring the six most abundant {{species of fish}} larvae in the upper 200 m of the water column were Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen nudifrons, <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus,</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus, Parachaenichthys' georgianus and Electrona antarctica. In summer, the larvae of C. gunnari, Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Lepidonotothen larseni and Trematomus hansoni were most abundant, and the majority {{were found in the}} upper 140 m of the water column, with greatest densities in the top 2 m. During both seasons most species showed some evidence of diurnal vertical migration. A distinct pattern was found for C. gunnari in summer; they were at 0 – 20 m during the day and 60 – 100 m at midnight. Net avoidance by the larvae of most species was greater before sunset in early spring, and during all periods of daylight in summer, than at other times of day...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{characteristics}} of the gonads and the energy contents of axial muscle, liver and gonads of Antarctic notothenioid fish collected during the LAMPOS (Latin American Polarstern Study) survey in April 2002 were analysed. Ovaries and testes were staged following histological maturity criteria. Oocyte diameters frequency were established and fecundity values were estimated. The energetic values (kJ/g) of different organs were determined using a microcalorimetric bomb. Ovaries of Chaenocephalus aceratus showed a generalised atretic process. The gonadal histology of Champsocephalus gunnari, <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> and Chionodracus rastrospinosus suggests that their spawnings take place in autumn. Gobionotothen gibberifrons and Lepidonotothen larseni females {{were in the process}} of maturation, with the ovaries of the former containing yolked and atretic oocytes together. Ovaries of Lepidonotothen kempi showed old postovulatory follicles, which provided evidence of previous spawning. Gonads from both sexes of Dissostichus eleginoides were immature. Absolute and relative fecundity were lower in Channichthyidae than in Nototheniidae. The energy contents of the different organs analysed were: liver > gonads > axial muscle. The highest energy density value (kJ/g wet body mass) was found in Dissostichus eleginoides...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} three species of icefishes (family Channicthyidae), Champsocephalus gunnari, <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> and Chaenocephalus aceratus in South Georgia and Shag Rocks Islands was studied {{by means of}} a histological analysis. Parental care, a widespread behaviour among icefishes such as C. aceratus, is not observed in C. gunnari, which has a broadcast spawning strategy. There were large differences in total fecundity mainly due to the different sizes reached by each species (total fecundity range was 2, 500 – 21, 300 hydrated oocytes). Nevertheless, when comparing relative fecundity values, the average results were, in general, similar for P. georgianus and C. aceratus (6 – 9 hydrated oocytes per female gram). However, relative fecundity estimated for C. gunnari was 10 – 37 hydrated oocytes per ovary-free female gram. The difference may be a consequence of the smaller oocyte size of the species as compared to other icefishes. The small diameter of hydrated oocytes was also associated with low values of dry weight. The high relative fecundity recorded for C. gunnnari may compensate, in part, for a broadcast spawning strategy. サウスジョージアおよびシャグロック諸島周辺海域より得られたコオリウオ科 3 種（Champsocephalus gunnari，Pseudochaenichthys georgianus，Chaenocephalus aceratus）の繁殖特性を組織学的に解析した。親魚による卵保護はコオリウオ科に広く見られる行動であるが，浮性卵を産むC. gunnari には認められない。 3 種の孕卵数はその体サイズと関連し， 2500 ～ 21300 と大きな差が認められた。一方，相対孕卵数はP. georgianus とC. aceratus が 6 ～ 9 なのに対してC. gunnari では 10 ～ 37 であった。この差はC. gunnariの卵が他種に比べて小さいことが原因と考えられた。C. gunnari における相対孕卵数の多さは，浮性卵を産むこの種の繁殖戦略を補完するものと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|The fish {{component}} of the diet of black browed and grey-headed albatrosses at South Georgia was investigated by intercepting 155 meals from adults arriving to feed chicks during February 1986 and 1994. Fish represented 30 % and 72 % by mass of the diet of black-browed albatrosses and 14 % and 60 % by mass of the diet of grey-headed albatrosses in 1986 and 1994 respectively. We determined the identity and quantified the contribution (by numbers, size and mass) of fish species mainly by using otoliths (54 representing 9 taxa and 57 representing 17 taxa in black-browed and greyheaded albatross samples respectively). For blackbrowed albatrosses in 1986 the main fish prey wasPatagonotothen guntheri (77 % of otoliths, 51 % of estimated fish biomass) and a single large specimen ofIcichthys australis (40 % estimated biomass), whereas in 1994 <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus</b> was the main fish prey (57 % of estimated biomass) withMagnisudis prionosa (30 %) andChampsocephalus gunnari (12 %) also making substantial contributions. Grey-headed albatross samples from 1986 were dominated by southern lampreys (40 % by number, 79 % of estimated bio mass), lanternfish (32 % of numbers, 9 % by mass) andPatagonotothen guntheri (11 % by mass); in 1994 Champsocephalus gunnari (42 % by numbers, 24 % by mass),Magnisudis prionosa (13 % by number, 36 % by mass),Muraenolepis microps (90 % by number),Pseudochaenichthys georgianus (15 % by mass) and lanternfish (18 % by number but only 1 % by mass) were the main prey. The importance ofPatagonotothen guntheri to both species in 1986 and its absence in 1994 probably reflect albatrosses obtaining it from the commercial fishery, which was active in 1986 but closed in 1994. Otherwise the fish diet of black-browed albatrosses is dominated by krill-feeding fish, characteristic of {{the waters of the}} South Georgia shelf. In contrast, the grey-headed albatross diet comprises deeper water mesopelagic species, especially lanternfish, which reflect its affinity for the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone and associated oceanic upwellings...|$|E
40|$|The Chaenocephalus aceratus were sampled in {{the summer}} between 1979 and 1990 at South Georgia Is. The {{problems}} of ageing Antarctic fish Channichthyidae are commonly known (Kock, 1989; Le_François, 2014; Campana, 2014) they have not scales and their bones undergo constant and large reduction (Żabrowski, 2000). It {{was found that the}} otoliths of C. aceratus show daily pattern of microincrements as otoliths of similar species <b>Pseudochaenichthys</b> <b>georgianus,</b> Champsocephalus gunnari and fishes both temperate and tropical waters. Width of larvae - postlarvae daily increments are: (1. 0 - 1. 6) • 10 - 3 SSI; (1. 8 - 2. 8) • 10 - 3 SGI; (1. 5 - 2. 4) • 10 - 3 ANI. Changes of the microincrements growth pattern are described in relation to larval, hatching and metamorphosis stages and have similar patterns for Ps. georgianus and C. gunnari reflecting similar habitats in their early life. Age of fish estimated from microincrements was alike to that inferred from the body length distribution and otoliths mass: age (years) = 140. 82 • OM (g) + 0. 8546. C. aceratus due to its adaptation to cold water, attain rapidly large body according to a growth equation: Lt = 75. 1 (1 - exp(- 0. 26 (t – 0. 51))). Bibliography Campana, S. 2014.
