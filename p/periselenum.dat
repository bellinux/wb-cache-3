50|$|For trajectories in {{the plane}} of the moon's orbit with small <b>periselenum</b> radius (close {{approach}} of the Moon), the flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory is longer than for the circumlunar free-return trajectory with the same <b>periselenum</b> radius. Flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory decreases with increasing <b>periselenum</b> radius, while flight time for a circumlunar free-return trajectory increases with <b>periselenum</b> radius.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an empirical investigation of earth-to-moon trajectories. The primary {{objective is to}} uncover relationships that result in the reduction of mission analysis or trajectory analysis problems to fundamentals. It is considered imperative that the results be accurate {{to the extent that}} any relationships that are uncovered are not brought about by simplifying or unrealistic assumptions. Consequently, the model used is as accurate as is presently available for use and the computations are performed under strict error controls. Procedures are reasonable from the engineering viewpoint. Some very helpful principles are uncovered. These may be briefly stated as follows: 1) Trajectories of constant flight time to the moon (in the 66 hour to 90 hour range), and arriving within a few minutes of the same time pass over a common point on the moon regardless of the arrival altitude and inclination, This common point of passage for such a family of trajectories is arbitrarily referred to as a VERTEX point; 2) These VERTEX points lie within a bounded region on the lunar surface as arrival time varies throughout the years, for a given flight time or flight time spread; 3) Increasing flight time results primarily in a longitude shift of the VERTEX point for a given arrival time; 4) Launch azimuth should be treated as a strong parameter regarding its influence on the vertex. Launch azimuth variations up to +/- 20 degrees about 90 degrees can shift the vertex as much as 3 degrees in latitude even when one is free to pick launch time, coast time, and S-IVB burn time appropriately with launch azimuth; and 5) The locus of <b>periselenum,</b> as arrival inclination takes on all possible values, is nearly circular about the vertex point for a given arrival altitude. A publication is now in preparation that applies these principles to much advantage in the solution of various trajectory analysis problems...|$|E
