In this paper, we describe a study examining sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> {{as a predictor of}} vengeance tendencies. A total of 220 respondents completed measures <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> vengeance, and affect across two time periods.

We also explore the effect <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has on different consumers depending on their prior relationship, if any, with the company or business in question. We show that when preferential treatment is afforded "non-loyal" customers of a company, those customers experience an elevated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> {{and are more likely to}} behave opportunistically than the same company's "loyal" customers are...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a conception of}} “sites of entitlement” {{as a basis for}} better understanding how infrastructure and services are perceived and experienced in informal settlements. While legal and policy frameworks are often viewed as the source <b>of</b> <b>entitlements</b> to infrastructure and services, the complexity of provision, access and negotiation in informal settlements demands a conception <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> that exceeds those domains. Based on ethnographic research on sanitation and water in informal settlements in Mumbai, we focus on the ways in which people’s everyday experiences, interactions and practices constitute sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> These sites are unevenly produced, contested, often in flux and ambivalent, sometimes made through collective struggle and at other times through quiet individual practice, and always constituted by social relations. Sites <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> emerge in close relation to moral economies, and are characterized by often profound and – for research, policy and practice – challenging levels of spatial and temporal variation.

40|$|This {{body of work}} {{examines}} {{the concept of an}} inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement,</b> the modern term for a concept that {{can be traced back to}} Plato in 360 BCE (Before Christian Era). Although the concept is advanced and examined in philosophical terms, Plato’s work is also considered to be one of the first and most comprehensive psychological theories of human motivation. A sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is frequently referred to in contemporary literature, and yet there has been a lack of investigations into the nature <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and how it operates in violent men. This investigation set out to rectify the deficiency by examining the concept through four studies. The global purpose of this thesis is to determine if an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related to both violent offending and self-harming behaviour. The first study was designed to refine a definition of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for violent offenders and to determine if there was a qualitative difference in this characteristic between violent offenders and male members of the general public. The study examined twelve domains used to describe an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> It also identified two main themes which were an action theme and an experiential theme. The action theme included actions that were likely to be elicited when an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated. These actions were assault, confrontation and rejection of others. This was particularly so when the domains of anger, respect, power, obedience from subordinates and obedience from family and friends were violated. The experiential theme included emotions and cognition and whether these were expressed in an outward direction towards others or inwardly towards the self. The second study was conducted on archival material from a prison database. It examined the self-harming behaviour of offenders currently incarcerated in Western Australia (WA). This study was conducted to test the assumption that violent offenders are more likely to self-harm than non-violent offenders, using a current cohort. It was revealed that violent offenders self-harm at a far higher rate than incarcerated nonviolent offenders. Of the self-harming offenders, nine out of ten were violent offenders. It was also found that violent offenders were far less likely to have warnings of potential self-harm on the prison database than non-violent offenders. The third study involved the construction and validation of the Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) on a student population. The purpose of this study was to enable the measurement of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men. The action themes and the domains from the first study formed the basis of the questions. This scale had sound psychometric properties and revealed two statistical factors indicating both attitude and behaviour subscales. Further investigations found differences in levels of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in terms <b>of</b> age and sex. The fourth study was the administration of the SOEQ to violent and non-violent, as well as self-harming and non-self harming, incarcerated offenders. This was to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in violent men as well as to establish the level of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in self-harming offenders. It was found that violent men have an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> in both attitude and behaviour. If their inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was violated then violence was most likely their first choice. This was particularly likely when the respect, power, forgiveness and anger domains were involved. When examining self-harming behaviour and entitlement, this study found a difference in attitude only. This body of work demonstrated that an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> is related both to violent offending and self-harming behaviour. Through these investigations different aspects of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> were identified, which included a strong desire for respect, power, admiration and status, as well as a profound aversion to feelings of shame, disrespect and humiliation. A violation of an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has the capacity to end in violent behaviour towards others and harm towards the self. These findings show how an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> meets two <b>of</b> the three criteria required to qualify as a criminogenic need: that is, that the characteristic has the ability to distinguish non-criminal from criminal behaviour and has the ability to be measured. This opens the way for further research to investigate the third criterion required to qualify for a criminogenic need, which is whether an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can be changed...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of three facets <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> (active, passive and revenge) in various forms of subjective well-being (SWB) : hedonistic and two facets of eudaimonic well-being (social and psychological). Social well-being was based on Keyes’ model (1998) and psychological well-being on Ryff’s model (1989). Participants and procedure The study was performed in three nations (Poland, Puerto Rico and Vietnam) on student samples (Poland, n = 245, Vietnam, n = 115, and Puerto Rico, n = 300). To assess entitlement level the Entitlement Questionnaire was used. The level of hedonistic well-being was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and eudaimonic well-being by the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Active entitlement {{was positively related to}} all aspects <b>of</b> SWB. Revenge <b>entitlement</b> was negatively related to hedonistic and psychological SWB in all samples and negatively related to social well-being only in Poland. Passive entitlement was unrelated to SWB. Conclusions The current study shows cross-cultural similarities in relationships <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with hedonistic and psychological well-being and cross-cultural differences in the relationship <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> with social well-being. Additionally, the study indicates positive meaning of healthy aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being and negative meaning of dysfunctional aspects <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{notion of}} an inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> has recently been proposed as a criminogenic need. Criminogenic needs are those factors which {{are directly related to}} criminal behaviour and recidivism. The three determinants that are required for a characteristic to qualify as a criminogenic need are that it can distinguish criminal behaviour, is able to be measured, and has the ability to generate pro-social change. The Sense <b>of</b> <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire (SOEQ) was designed {{in the absence of an}} appropriate instrument to measure this construct within the offending population. The SOEQ was administered to non-offenders, non-violent offenders and violent offenders. The results indicated that violent offenders have a more inflated sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> than non-offenders and non-violent offenders that, when violated, is more likely to result in violent behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to examine the {{possible}} relationship between socioeconomic status, the personality trait sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and driver attitudes and behaviour. Previous research have shown that individuals high in sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> are less inclined to abide by the rules and norms that normally govern social interactions. They might be aware of what the rules are, but they see themselves as exempt from these rules due to their perceived special status. They also show increased levels of aggression in situations with perceived ego threat, and show less concern for the welfare of others. The same kinds of behaviour has also been associated with having a high socioeconomic position, and it could be that these variables are related. The results are based on the responses to a mail questionnaire survey carried out among a representative sample of the Norwegian public (n = 159). Sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found to predict attitudes towards violations and speeding, self-reported violations and aggressive behaviour in traffic, in addition to positive behaviour towards other road users. Unexpectedly, an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> was found. Income had a direct effect on attitudes and behaviour, and moderated the effect <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> on attitudes towards violations. Sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> and socioeconomic status could be important predictors of driver behaviour and road crash involvement. Socioeconomic status has been overlooked in traffic research, and should be a topic of futur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the {{research}} question: is the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees in Australia consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice? The analysis of the research question comprises two components: first, the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees that is required by Rawlsian distributive justice and second, whether Australian law is consistent with that allocation. This thesis focuses on four particular areas of Australian law: the priority regime that is applicable when an insolvent company’s assets are distributed to creditors, director and related company liability for employee entitlements, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and the procedure for corporate and business rescue contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Employees are among the least advantaged persons {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. According to Rawlsian distributive justice, resources must therefore be reallocated to ensure greater equality between employees and other persons ‘affected’ by corporate insolvency, including secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors, consumers, shareholders, insolvency practitioners, directors and taxpayers. However, Rawls’s ‘difference principle’ permits inequalities between employees and other persons affected by corporate insolvency if those inequalities contribute to achieving the greatest benefit of employees, for example as a result of job maintenance or the payment <b>of</b> employee <b>entitlements.</b> The priority regime is broadly consistent with the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of the least advantaged employees. Although employee entitlements receive only partial priority over the claims of secured creditors and are subordinated to the claims of quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners, the better prospects of secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners satisfy Rawls’s difference principle because they are likely to preserve employment and the payment <b>of</b> employee <b>entitlements</b> in the ordinary course of business, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Director and related company liability for employee entitlements is likely to be beneficial for employees only in circumstances where directors and related companies engage in improper behaviour in relation to the payment <b>of</b> <b>entitlements.</b> Liability outside those circumstances is likely to jeopardise employment and the payment <b>of</b> employee <b>entitlements.</b> However, existing Australian law does not adequately provide for director and related company liability in circumstances of improper behaviour. Amendments to director and related company liability for employee entitlements in Part 5. 8 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), including the replacement of the test of subjective intention with an objective test, are likely to contribute to the greatest benefit of employees, thus ensuring greater consistency with the Rawlsian framework. In certain respects, GEERS is consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice. For example, GEERS reduces inequalities between employees and taxpayers; operates in conjunction with the employee priority regime and director and related company for employee entitlements, thus facilitating the equal sharing of resources among claimants; and effectively differentiates between the relative levels of disadvantage faced by individual employees in the event of corporate insolvency. However, the limitation of GEERS to liquidation and the restriction on claimable wages pursuant to GEERS compromise the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of employees. The corporate and business rescue procedure contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) facilitates sustained employment and the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>entitlements,</b> thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Additionally, Part 5. 3 A does not encourage ‘hopeless’ rescue attempts and does not override the interests of secured and quasi-secured creditors, thus avoiding outcomes that may otherwise compromise the greatest benefit of employees. However, the ability of substantial charge holders to remain outside a Part 5. 3 A corporate or business rescue attempt is likely to adversely affect the interests of employees, thus implementing greater protection for secured creditors than is required to satisfy Rawls’s difference principle...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is important because}} entitlement is prevalent in college classrooms and in the workplace, and this belief begins to develop in middle school as students become more self-aware. This sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement</b> can both limit the potential for learning to occur for these students and {{be a source of}} frustration for teachers who are not accustomed to teaching students with a sense <b>of</b> <b>entitlement.</b> Understanding how to transform entitlement into something useful in the classroom could lead to a better learning experience for everyone involved. This research use case study methods to understand teacher’s perception <b>of</b> student <b>entitlement</b> within their classroom. Through use of surveys, interviews, and classroom observations, implications are drawn about the effects <b>of</b> student <b>entitlement</b> on classroom learning. In response to this, four lessons were developed to address student entitlement within the classroom. Results of this will be presented at the Association for Middle Level Educators National Conference this November 4 - 7 in Philadelphia.
