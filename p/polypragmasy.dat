5000|$|The {{presence}} of comorbidity {{must be taken}} into account when selecting the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment plans for any given disease. It is important to enquire comorbid patients about the level of functional disorders and anatomic status of all the identified nosological forms (diseases). Whenever a new, as well as mildly notable symptom appears, it is necessary to conduct a deep examination to uncover its causes. It is also necessary to be remembered that comorbidity leads to <b>polypragmasy</b> (polypharmacy), i.e. simultaneous prescription of a large number of medicines, which renders impossible the control over the effectiveness of the therapy, increases monetary expenses and therefore reduces compliance. At the same time, <b>polypragmasy,</b> especially in aged patients, renders possible the sudden development of local and systematic, unwanted medicinal side-effects. These side-effects are not always considered by the doctors, because they are considered as the appearance of comorbidity and as a result become the reason for the prescription of even more drugs, sealing-in the vicious circle. Simultaneous treatment of multiple disorders requires strict consideration of compatibility of drugs and detailed adherence of rules of rational drug therapy, based on E. M. Tareev's principles, which state: [...] "Each non-indicated drug is contraindicated" [...] and B. E. Votchal said: [...] "If the drug does not have any side-effects, one must think if there is any effect at all".|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of novel therapies to {{directly}} intervene with B cell immunity and complement activation, antibody-mediated kidney allograft rejection (AMR) has come into the focus of transplant immunologists. Intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, bortezomib, and eculizumab {{have been used to}} treat patients with acute AMR, apart from the standard treatment of antibody removal with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption and steroid pulses. This article describes the experimental rationale and summarizes the still limited clinical experience with these novel therapies in the transplant setting. Results with the standard treatment for acute AMR, including intense plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins, and steroids are good with a graft survival of 80 % at 18 months. In contrast, patients suffering from chronic AMR have significant irreversible damage in their grafts with substantially impaired graft survival. Thus, the authors propose a step-wise escalation of therapy in refractory cases of acute AMR and advocate an urgent need for controlled therapeutic trials for acute and chronic AMR not to inflict unnecessary harm on our patients by uncontrolled <b>polypragmasy...</b>|$|E

Inadequate treated acute tonsillopharyngitis, especially caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, determine the development of life-threatening conditions and chronization of the process. Thus, the objective of the work was to study the diagnostic value of general clinical and paraclinical indicators in verification of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children to optimize the initial etiotropic treatment and to prevent <b>polypragmasy.</b> Two clinical groups were formed: I group consisted of 10 children with a diagnosis of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, II clinical group included 16 patients with acute tonsillopharyngitis of non-streptococcal origin. The studies found that at the stage of early detection of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children the following clinical-paraclinical complex can be used: total score by McIsaac’s scale above 4, level of segmental leukocytes in the blood more than 50. 0  %, indices of stimulated test with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) of neutrophilic granulocytes in the blood by cytochemical coefficient below 0. 5 c. u., reserve of NBT-test less than 0, 15 c. u., which increases the risk of disease detection by four times...|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of {{bronchial}} asthma is growing. The experts have proved its genetic and clinical heterogeneity. This is what also calls forth incomplete {{response to the}} conventional anti inflammatory medications. During asthma, dozens of various mediators take {{an active part in}} the pathogenesis of inflammation in the respiratory passages, including a set of c 4, d 4 and е 4 leukotrienes, which causes contractions of the bronchi plain muscles. Among all the anti leukotriene medications ever studied for the sales in the Russian federation, the federal agencies approved of and registered zafirlukast and montelucast only. Montelucast is recommended in treatment for {{bronchial asthma}} of all the severity levels, as well as both as a medication to enhance the basic therapy and a medication for monotherapy, which is thanks to the data from a handful of multicentered, double, blind, placebo, controlled studies. The application of the peroral medications, montelucast in particular, may be a good alternative to the inhalant medications used among the patients with poor discipline and inhalation techniques (children, aged patients and etc.). When we speak of allergic rhinitis, montelucast application is essential to exclude <b>polypragmasy,</b> {{as well as for the}} initial asthma prevention.

40|$|Background. Causes {{of falls}} among people over 65 are complex because of age-related involutional changes, {{comorbidity}} and <b>polypragmasy</b> that exert negative influence on physical mobility. Objectives. The {{purpose of this}} study is to assess the incidence of falls in geriatric outpatients in relation to the number and type of drugs taken. Material and methods. The study involved 304 subjects aged 65 – 100 years, using ambulatory care services. The mean age of the respondents was 78. 6 ± 7. 4. Women constituted 77. 3 % of those analyzed, men – 22. 7 %. This survey-based study was performed using the Geriatric Environmental Inquiry. Results. A higher number of drugs corresponded with more frequent falls (χ 2 test; p 0. 05). Gender was proved to influence the number of drugs (χ 2 test; p < 0. 05). There was a statistically significant relationship between the number of falls and taking hypotensive, anxiolytic and oral antidiabetic drugs (χ 2; p < 0. 05). Conclusions. 1. The use of a higher number of drugs, irrespective of their pharmacological group, contributes to a higher number of falls, which may be associated with an interaction between particular drugs or be a consequence of a multitude of diseases predisposing to falls. 2. Polypharmacotherapy is a fall risk factor, however it is difficult to say which pharmacology group, discussed in the study, contributes most to the incidence of falls. 3. It is suggested that geriatric pharmacotherapy should be individualized to minimize the incidence of the iatrogenic geriatric syndrome, which predisposes to falls...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{study the}} problem of inertia in the medical {{practice}} of ophthalmology, which implies the absence of any modification of the treatment {{in the presence of}} objective necessity or clinical indications. The treatment of multifactorial diseases, including primary glaucoma is particularly critical. An anonymous survey of 147 ophthalmologists from different regions of Western Siberia — Altai Territory, Kemerovo Region and the Republic of Khakassia, has been conducted. Most of the surveyed doctors believed that their treatment was successful in 40 ‑ 80 % of patients. According to literature data, ithe target value of IOP level is achieved in practice in under half of the patients receiving regular therapy. Another reason of medical inertia was the fear of <b>polypragmasy.</b> Almost 54 % of doctors said they are afraid to prescribe several medications, which limits their desire to intensify therapy. The results of our study suggest that the cost of glaucoma treatment, i. e. the fear to prescribe an expensive treatment for patients does not significantly determine the doctors’activity. Doctors often exaggerate the fear of patients for the treatment, believing that a particular medical drug will not be taken by the patient, without {{trying to figure out the}} patient’s intention. The economic barrier has become an essential factor for our doctors, as 35 % ophthalmologists believe that 300 ‑ 500 Rubles for the therapy per month is expencive for a patient. Over 30 % respondents discussed with the patient the prescribed treatment with cost about  700 ‑ 900 Rubles. This could potentially lead to the fact, that the second and third medical drugs would be less likely prescribed due to the increased cost of treatment. Thus, we have set up the structure of the causes of medical inertia — a psychological unwillingness to achieve target values of IOP, overestimation of the therapy success. Less important reasons were the lack of doctor’s awareness and the economic barrier forthe decision making. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ponavljane nefiziološke kretnje, prisilan položaj glave, ramena i ruku pri radu prisutni su u modernim tehnologijama. Uzroci su sindroma prenaprezanja (SIP) i neergonomski kreirani alati i radna sredina. Komorbiditet je dodatni čimbenik veće učestalosti SIP-a. Podaci o visokoj učestalosti tegoba i/ili bolesti gornjih udova u metalskih radnika izloženih velikim fizičkim naprezanjima upućuju na zahvaćenost tetiva, mišića i zglobova osobito desne ruke (12, 5 : 7, 5 %). U vratnoj kralježnici to je još izraženije (45 % prema 7, 5 % u poredbenoj skupini radnika umjerenih operećenja; P< 0, 01). Sličan je odnos i u profesionalnih glazbenika, izraženije u dominantoj ruci. Prikazani su slučajevi agravacije sindroma prenaprezanja tekstilne radnice, kao i disimulacije u mlade gitaristice i liječnice. Raspravlja se o polipragmaziji u liječenju i rehabilitaciji SIP-a. Naglašava se nužnost edukacije zdravstvenih radnika, potreba objektivizacije funkcionalnih promjena kao preventivnog pristupa u ranoj dijagnostici i liječenju sindroma prenaprezanja gornjih udova. Repetitive use {{of upper}} extremities, non-physiological body posture, {{especially}} of cervical spine, shoulders, lower arms, and fists are still present in modern technological processes. Innate deformities, weakness of connective tissue, accompanying morbidity (radicular symptoms, neuropathies, superior thoracic aperture syndrome, vasopathies and neuroses) are significant pathogenic overuse syndromes. Other causes of overuse syndromes are non-ergonomic tools, musical instruments, furniture, or keyboards. Lack of training for jobs involving repetitive movements, {{as well as}} job dissatisfaction are additional aggravating factors of the overuse syndrome. <b>Polypragmasy</b> with drug and physical therapy, insufficient rehabilitation, and questionable medical prognosis of working capacity are challenges to public health of even in richer societies. This paper describes the most common overuse syndromes of upper extremities. The aetiology of reflex dystrophy syndrome, carpal tunnel, and myofascial painful syndrome are still insufficiently explained. The paper also presents data collected {{in a group of}} 40 metal workers exposed to significant shoulder strain. They more often reported pain in the cervical spine than the control group of workers under moderate strain (45 % v. 7. 5 %; P< 0. 01), as well as pain in the shoulders (12. 5 % v. 5. 0 %) and stiffened hand (22. 5 %: 7. 5 %). Symptoms were significantly more frequent in the dominant hand. A common diagnosis In a sample of 110 musicians was a change in the shoulder joint, which was more distinct in the right shoulder (10 %) than in the left (7 %) and comparable in the elbows (8 %). The paper proceeds with cases of advanced overuse syndrome in a textile worker and cases of dissimulation in a physician and a guitarist. The paper stresses the importance of quantification of morphological and functional changes in overuse syndromes and discusses the necessity of prevention, education, early diagnosis, pharmacological and physical therapy, and rehabilitation of overuse syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the state}} of the {{national}} health system (health) is characterized by a low level of funding for medical and pharmaceutical care and the lack of effective methods of free and preferential dispensing of medicines (drugs) and compensation of their value. Thus the most urgent problem arises is unregulated drugs prescription, {{which is one of the}} main negative factors behind the rapid spread of self-medication and <b>polypragmasy.</b> Thus, improving drugs prescription dispensing is one of the current challenges of medicine and pharmacy management which should be solved to provide a safe, rational and effective drug therapy. The results of the questionnaire survey of doctors and pharmaceutical workers identified and explored key factors that contribute to a violation of drugs prescription. The authors analyzed the literature on the current state of drugs prescription in Ukraine, which resulted in selected priority issues that need resolution as soon as possible. Established that the main disadvantages of the national health care system is unreasonable approach to state regulation of the relevant system and the low level of funding. This situation prevents rational regulation of free and preferential delivery of drugs, the introduction of obligatory medical insurance and the reimbursement cost of drugs and other modern approaches that are effective in developed countries. Тhe main motive of view of legislative acts to implement strict drugs prescription in Ukraine is a link to international experience, guided by the standards of European and international practices that do not comply with the Law of Ukraine issued on 18. 03. 2004 № 1629 -IV «On the National Program for Adaptation of Ukraine to the European Union, "and points to the disparity modern domestic rule-making European practice. The fundamental problem here is the comparison of the legal, social, financial and economic status of the counter in Ukraine with the countries in which the system of local government regulation of the drugs cost. The results of the study identified the main directions of improvement of medicines prescription in Ukraine. The major factors of modern problems with drugs prescription include lack of prescription forms F- 1. According to respondents thought one of the main directions of reforming the national health care system should be the implementation of local governmental and insurance recipes that will counter the financial status of the document and at the same time effectively solve the problem of drugs prescription. The investigation identified the main directions for improvement of drugs prescription: • Development and installation authority of Health Management Ukraine at all levels to ensure the prescription forms for hospitals in sufficient quantities; • continuous monitoring of the implementation of these powers in the regional offices of health care. ...|$|E
