5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. This {{study on}} IT {{strategy}} {{was conducted at}} the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> South Africa. Firstly literature review was undertaken {{in the field of}} Business Strategy and to a larger extent on IT strategy. This culminated in a model {{that could be used to}} benchmark against the IT strategy being used at the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> South Africa. Due consideration was also given to the implementation of strategy in the literature review which could be compared with the implementation of strategy at the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> South Africa. The company situation was thereafter presented and discussed in context with what was covered in the literature review. An impact study of the IT strategy on the business processes at the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> was also conducted. Interviews were conducted to determine what was working well and also what was not working well at the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> South Africa. Finally recommendations were provided to the National <b>Ports</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> South Africa on how to improve the business processes and the strategy formulation process...|$|R

5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was {{a concern for the}} <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E

5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey.

The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Red Ensign of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore.

The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port.|$|E

5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E
5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion.

In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects.

5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.
