40|$|This paper {{presents}} the challenges faced during micro-tunnelling process in Emirates of Dubai. In <b>permeable</b> <b>grounds,</b> {{the loss of}} slurry increases the cutter head torque and reduces penetration rates. Overcut is formed to provide space for converging ground and enables the evenly circulation of lubricant flow on the pipe line, as such buoyancy effects of fluid lubrication act on the pipe to lessen the drag during jacking. Micro-tunnelling techniques are used to reduce penetration resistance within the pipe string by providing sufficient uniform overcut and continuously injecting polymer lubricants. It is also observed that as the Urban area in Dubai is surrounded by built structures and numerous underground services, a special consideration is required to protect these services especially DEWA ED Cables. Also, the high ground water table, fractures within the rock and proximity of creek makes things very difficult to reduce the water table level in launching / receiving Pit and have difficulties in breaking the hard ground within the Pit. At Wafi Interchange, proposed development for the extension of interchange had to be incorporated in the alignment and accordingly standard pipe fittings to be introduced in the alignment. There are services towards Sheikh Butti palace (launching pit side) {{and on the other}} side (receiving pit). Ongoing construction of Al Jaliliya children’s hospital requires close coordination and safety related issues to be addressed prior to mobilization of heavy equipment at the proposed micro-tunnelling area. The receiving pit at Emarat petrol pump was also critical and special approval from RTA is required to close one lane at the heavy traffic along the service road, parallel to sheikh Rashid road. The removal of ground water was another challenge because near Sheikh Butti palace the drainage network was not completed and hence special arrangement was to be made to discharge the water near the creek, for which DM environment approval are to be sought...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater flow {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors for the design of a ground heat exchanger (GHEX) since the thermal environment of the ground around the buried GHEX is significantly affected by heat convection due to the groundwater flow. Several preceding studies have been conducted to develop analytical solutions to the heat transfer model of GHEX with consideration of groundwater flow. One of these solutions is the combined heat transfer model of conduction and convection. However, the developed combined analytical models are inapplicable to all of the configurations of ordinary GHEXs because these solutions assume that the inner part of the borehole is thermally inert or consists of the same material as that of the surrounding ground. In this paper, the applicability of the combined solid cylindrical heat source model, which is the most suitable to energy piles until now, was evaluated by performing a series of numerical analyses. In the numerical analysis, the inner part of the borehole was modeled as two different materials (i. e., <b>permeable</b> <b>ground</b> formation and impermeable fill such as concrete) to evaluate applicability of the analytical solution along with different diameter-length (D/L) ratios of borehole. In a small value of the D/L ratio, the analytical solution to the combined heat transfer model is in good agreement with the result of numerical analysis. On the other hand, when increasing the D/L ratio, the analytical solution significantly overestimates the effect of groundwater flow on the heat transfer of GHEXs because the analytical solution disregards the existence of the impermeable region in the borehole. Consequently, such tendency is more critical in the GHEX with a large D/L ratio such as large-diameter energy piles...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} here reported, which {{covered a}} period of about 5 years, 1929 to 1933, was made for the purpose of determining the available supply of ground water in south-central Nebraska, the origin and discharge of the ground water, and the relation of the geologic and ground-water conditions in the Platte River Valley to the conditions occurring under the plains to the south. The area was found to be underlain by permeable Pleistocene and Tertiary sand. and gravel, much of which is saturated and yields relatively large quantities of water to wells. Except in a few isolated places the ground-water supply is abundant. The Pleistocene and Tertiary formations were found in many places to be continuous across the area, but they thin out and disappear near the southern and southeastern boundary of the area. A part of the ground water occurring in south-central Nebraska percolates into the area from the sand-hill region of north-central Nebraska through the <b>permeable</b> water-bearing formations. <b>Ground</b> water is also derived from precipitation on the area and from seepage from streams entering the area from the west and northwest. Some of the ground water of the area is discharged into streams, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the area, and some ground water is used by plants, chiefly in the valleys of the streams. Almost all the public, domestic, industrial, and stock water supplies of the area are derived from wells, and in the Platte River Valley about 800 wells are used for irrigation.

40|$|Florida's {{population}} growth creates ever-increasing pres-sures on the state's springs and other fragile water resources. This drawing illustrates {{many of the}} complex relationships that exist between a Florida community and the environment which sustains it. Water for various uses is withdrawn from subsurface limestones which are extremely porous and <b>permeable.</b> <b>Ground</b> water which resides in these limestones is naturally protected from various types of con-taminants by a widespread confining layer (intermediate confining unit) which is predominantly clay. The situation {{is complicated by the}} presence of discontinuous carbonate lenses (the intermediate aquifer system) and fractures with-in the confining layer. Limestone is vulnerable to extensive dissolution leading to the development of sinkholes which may breach the confining unit in the process of their forma-tion. This same dissolution process results in the formation of large springs and the conduit systems that supply water to them. Springs are highly prized features of Florida’s environ-ment that discharge large amounts of ground water. The spring pictured here includes as part of its recharge mecha-nism, a newly formed sinkhole, ostensibly distant from it. Precipitation over a large area moves down through soil and sand into fractures that eventually are connected to spring-feeding conduits. Surficial sands and clayey sands which blanket the confining layer are subject to major impacts resulting from human activities. Subsurface storage tanks will be buried within them, municipal solid waste will be dis-posed into them and locally, small domestic wells may be drilled into them where their permeability and porosity make them a viable surficial aquifer (surficial aquifer system). At the same time, precipitation moving down into these shallow materials may locally enter sinkholes or fractures within the confining layer, contributing to recharge of the underlying Floridan (limestone) aquifer system and the abundant water that flows from Florida’s springs...|$|E
40|$|Shield {{tunneling}} {{presents a}} modern and highly technical construction method. It establishes itself worldwide {{parallel to the}} classical construction method like the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM), as the supporting systems in shield tunneling efficiently counteract a stress relaxation and a loosening of the surrounding ground (face support, rigid shield, tail void grouting, rigid tunnel lining). While theoretically displacements should hardly occur during shield tunneling, many experiences show that ground deformation cannot be prevented completely and amount to surface settlements. The majority of settlements {{is associated with the}} tail void behind the shield tail, although it is filled with mortal thoroughly, with a volume that even exceeds its theoretical volume. The reason for the occurring surface settlements is found in the interaction of the tail void grouting with the surrounding ground and the tunnel lining behind the shield tail. Therefore, the main objective in this study was an enhancement of the comprehension of the interaction of the tail void grouting with the surrounding ground and the tunnel lining. Thereby, the main focus was set on how far this interaction depends on the hydraulic ground properties, as the permeability of the ground plays a deciding role with respect to the loading time or rather loading velocity. Furthermore, the behavior of the grout is affected by the hydraulic and mechanical ground property. In order to analyze the aforementioned interaction qualitatively, a multiplicity of FE-calculations was executed. The calculations within the investigations of this study were carried out with a one-phase formulation (no coupling of stress with pore water pressure) or with a two-phase formulation (coupling of stress with pore water pressure). The calculations were limited to the tunnel advance in water-saturated, homogeneous ground and simplified assumptions had to be made for the individual components and processes. For the ground, the hypoplasticity with extension with intergranular strains as constitutive law was used; and for the hydrating grout, an elastic constitutive law with time-dependent stiffness and Poisson’s ratio. In spite of simplifications, the results of the conducted numerical calculations are qualitatively in good agreement with field data. For tunnel advances in <b>permeable</b> <b>ground,</b> calculations under drained conditions are generally acceptable. The decision, whether drained or undrained material behavior predominates, depends primarily on the permeability of the ground and loading time or rather loading velocity and therefore cannot be made in general. When the tail void is filled simultaneously with its appearance, the ground is loaded suddenly. Although the ground is permeable, the sudden loading can cause a temporary change of pore water pressure in the ground. What again has an impact on the behavior of tunnel and ground. For this reason a drained condition in the calculation of shield tunnels below the ground water table in <b>permeable</b> <b>ground</b> is not always appropriate. In order to investigate the influence of pore water pressure on the effect of the sudden load due to the tail void grouting, calculations with a two-phase formulation were compared with calculations with an one-phase formulation. The results showed that the temporary change of pore water pressure due to the tail void grouting influences the behavior of the surrounding ground and the tunnel lining. Based on the results of a strong influence of pore water pressure on the behavior of the surrounding ground and of the tunnel lining, the effects of the permeability of the ground on the interaction of the tail void grouting with the surrounding ground and tunnel lining were analyzed. It was clarified that the magnitude of the permeability and its anisotropy has an effect on this interaction. Especially, the critical grouting pressure as a limit between grouting pressures which lead to an increase of settlements, showed a dependence on the density of the ground and the permeability. Whether the grouting pressure exceeds its critical value or not, determines the effect of the tail void grouting on the ground deformation and the tunnel lining considerably. Furthermore the results showed that anisotropy of permeability causes an increase of the critical grouting pressure. Generally, the tail void grouting with high grouting pressure cannot revoke existing surface settlements but reduce the surface settlements. Moreover, the increase of the grouting pressure causes a reduction of bending moments in the tunnel lining. The outcome of the tail void grouting was highly influenced by the densification of the surrounding soil. For a successful execution of tail void grouting, it is necessary that the grouting pressure does not exceed the critical value...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a novel approach to simulate dynamic flow interactions between storm sewers and overland surface for different land covers in urban areas. The proposed approach couples the one-dimensional (1 D) sewer flow model (SFM) and the two-dimensional (2 D) overland flow model (OFM) with different techniques depending on the land cover type of the study areas. For roads, pavements, plazas, and so forth where rainfall becomes surface runoff before entering the sewer system, the rainfall-runoff process is simulated directly in the 2 D OFM, and the runoff is drained to the sewer network via inlets, which {{is regarded as the}} input to 1 D SFM. For green areas on which rainfall falls into the <b>permeable</b> <b>ground</b> surface and the generated direct runoff traverses terrain, the deduction rate is applied to the rainfall for reflecting the soil infiltration in the 2 D OFM. In built-up areas with drainage facilities allowing rainfall to drain directly from the roof to sewer networks, the rainfall-runoff process is simulated using the hydrological module in the 1 D SFM where no rainfall is applied to these areas in the 2 D OFM. The 1 D SFM is used for hydraulic simulations in the sewer network. Where the flow in the drainage network exceeds its capacity, a surcharge occurs and water may spill onto the ground surface if the pressure head in a manhole exceeds the ground elevation. The overflow discharge from the sewer system is calculated by the 1 D SFM and considered a point source in the 2 D OFM. The overland flow will return into the sewer network when it reaches an inlet that connects to an un-surcharged manhole. In this case, the drainage is considered as a point sink in the 2 D OFM and an inflow to a manhole in the 1 D SFM. The proposed approach was compared to other five urban flood modelling techniques with four rainfall events that had previously recorded inundation areas. The merits and drawbacks of each modelling technique were compared and discussed. Based on the simulated results, the proposed approach was found to simulate floodings closer to the survey records than other approaches because the physical rainfall-runoff phenomena in urban environment were better reflected.

40|$|In {{northern}} Scandinavia {{and other}} cold regions, urban drainage systems are often unable {{to cope with}} the high volumes of melt water which can be sustained for several weeks. High waste water treatment plant inflows, combined system overflows and low water quality are a few problems associated with snowmelt. However, reports detailing urban snowmelt processes are lacking in the hydrological literature. This thesis reports research into the snow hydrology of the City of Luleå, Sweden. There are four objectives: to investigate (a) the relationship between snow and landuse; (b) the effects of urbanisation on snowmelt processes; (c) the effect of melt water on urban hydrology; and (d) the feasibility of modelling urban snowmelt processes. These are met in a series of five appended papers. Papers I and II investigate snowmelt sensitivity to the urban environment. Paper III concerns seasonal patterns of the town water balance. Paper IV presents a snow survey that reaffirms the assumptions about snow cover and characteristics made in Papers II and III. Paper V is a literature review that questions the validity of urban runoff routing models on the basis of findings from the earlier papers. Urbanisation is associated with extreme heterogeneity and diminished surface permeability. The urban hydrograph shows high peak flows and rapid responses after short, low intensity events. Snowmelt processes are the same in both rural and urban areas, but climate and snowpack properties differ greatly. Urban snow, for instance, is subject to ploughing. Snowmelt induced runoff generation is further complicated by a more pronounced thermal component of the water balance compared to rain events. Snowpack energy fluxes are greatly influenced by the urban environment. Melt is earlier and more intense due to enhanced radiation to the south of buildings in comparison to snowpacks in open ground or to the shaded north. Urban snow has low albedo and high density than that of rural snow leading to speeded melt. The role of surface type and snow cover characteristics upon storm- and waste water inflow is demonstrated. Predictions of waste water inflow are improved by spatially weighting snow types according to a priori assumptions of snow properties and coverage. For instance, the proportion of undisturbed snow coverage decreases as landuse intensity increases. Snow piles in suburbs tend to be on <b>permeable</b> <b>ground,</b> but {{they are more likely to}} be on sealed surfaces in the central city. There are seasonal differences in runoff volumes and flow pathways to the waste water treatment plant and receiving waters. Increased volumes of runoff, reduced concentration times and long event duration lead to high waste water loads at the treatment plant. The surface water component of sewage originates from direct flow into pipe inlets and infiltration into sewer pipes. Current methods of estimating urban snowmelt, such as the degree-day method, and runoff are found to be problematic. However, a lack of data for developing, testing or operating more sophisticated models restricts urban engineers...|$|E
40|$|In alpine areas, {{the snow}} cover plays an {{important}} role as a water reservoir. Water is stored as snow over the winter and released in spring, recharging mountain aquifers through infiltration. These aquifers are essential, especially for supplying water for human activities during dry seasons. Numerous studies have shown that locally soil frost can drastically reduce the water infiltration. However, we know much less about the hydrological impact of soil frost at a larger scale, in particular with regard to groundwater recharge. This was our motivation for initiating an extensive field experiment in the southern Swiss Alps. Several methods at different spatial scales were adapted to explore (a) the local effect of a partially frozen ground on the snowmelt discharge in an alpine area, (b) the key processes influencing groundwater recharge during snowmelt periods, such as snow cover and soil frost evolution, snowmelt water runoff types, (c) the large-scale effect of soil frost on the aquifer recharge, and (d) winter situations that are critical with respect to flooding. In order to take into account spatial, altitudinal and climatic differences, the field study was run for two winter seasons at Gd St Bernard (2500 m), a site with very high winter precipitation and strong winds, and at Hannigalp above Grächen (2100 m), a ski resort with a rather dry winter climate. The different components of the soil water balance (lateral runoff, deep percolation, liquid soil water content) were measured on delimited plots of 5 m 2. Additionally, a dye tracer experiment visualized the snowmelt infiltration patterns into the frozen, respectively non-frozen ground. At Gd St Bernard, investigations of the liquid water content and the soil temperature were additionally conducted at two secondary sites, differing in their orientation, so as to gain a better insight of the spatial soil frost expansion. Finally, an analysis of the water-table variation at the village of Grächen (some 500 m below Hannigalp) during the snowmelt was carried out for a 10 -year time period, including our experimental seasons. We complemented our field investigations by using a numerical soil-snow-atmosphere transfer model that simulates the seasonal development of the soil frost and the snow cover, as well as lateral and vertical water flow in the top soil. This model was used as an upper boundary condition to a 2 -D groundwater model, to calculate the outlet flow {{at the base of a}} simplified alpine aquifer. The two winters investigated had contrasting meteorological conditions, which resulted in intriguing differences and similarities with respect to the soil physical conditions: the first one having a thick snowpack and hardly any soil frost, and the second one with hardly any snow until January and a deep and persistent soil frost. In spite of a very thick snowpack, the water balance measurements from winter 2000 / 2001 showed for both sites zero to low surface and subsurface flow due to the fact that soil frost was local and the soil permeability high. During the next winter, approximately 25 % of the total meltwater run off laterally. The soil infiltration capacity was mainly reduced by the presence of a basal ice sheet, caused by the freezing of meltwater after a mid-winter snowmelt event. The field data were used to calibrate and validate a physically-based one-dimensional model. To allow an accurate parameter setting for the water repellent soil of Hannigalp, laboratory infiltration experiments on soil columns were additionally carried out. Using the resultant information, the model predicted correctly most measured soil parameters, in particular good matching was observed between measured and simulated snowmelt discharge. At Gd St Bernard, the simulated results were less satisfactory, especially during the first winter, when large discrepancies were noted between measured and simulated lateral runoff. Apart from the shortage in the soil parameter characterization, the deviation was a result of the simplified description of the experimental field. The model was, for example, not able to simulate surface runoff generated by a steep slope under unfrozen conditions, as the soil surface is considered by the model to be flat. Nevertheless, results were accurate enough to reproduce the occurrences of snowmelt events and the accumulated values of snow-melt discharge pathways under frozen conditions. Long-term weather data were used to simulate the soil frost depth at both sites. The simulation results showed that the probability of the occurrence of frozen soils was lowest on slopes with south or north exposure. On southerly exposed plots, the heat stored in the soil during the summer inhibited the development of deep and persistent soil frost, while most pore ice thawed due to underneath heating. On north plots, the building of soil frost was rare, as early snowfall insulated the ground from the atmosphere. However, during snow-poor winters, the frost penetrated deep into the ground, and the low underneath heat flux at that location hardly affected the frost depth until snowmelt. The snow depth and average soil temperature were hence the two components affecting the frost depth extent. The altitude soil frost variation was related to the spatial extent of these two components. The higher the altitude, the higher the precipitation and the lower the mean air/surface temperature. Simulating the whole Grächen recharge area, seasonal soil frost was rare between 1800 m and 2000 m, as the snowpack was thick enough to insulate the ground, and the soil was warm enough to inhibit deep soil frost. In lower areas, the shallow snowpack enabled the soil to freeze during most winters, whereas at higher areas, deep and persistent soil frost was simulated due to the low underneath heating. A 10 -year water-table depth record was used to examine possible large-scale effects of seasonal soil frost. We noted that the water-table rise at snowmelt was lowest at the end of winters with extensive soil frost. However, such winters were characterized by low precipitation, and reduced snow cover. In contrast, winters with little soil frost were mostly snow rich. Consequently, only a reduced number of winters were directly comparable. Considering these winters, the reduction in the water-table rise at snowmelt due to seasonal soil frost varied only between 10 and 30 %, as, during snowmelt, most meltwater was able to re-infiltrate into the very <b>permeable</b> <b>ground</b> in lower unfrozen areas. We may assume that a soil with a smaller infiltration capacity can increase the influence of the soil frost on the aquifer recharge. Finally, we investigated the effect of a changing climate on the hydraulic and thermic regimes at different altitudes in the area of Grächen. We assume an increase in the air temperature of 2 °C generates deeper soil frost on lower areas, as the resultant smaller snow cover does not insulate the soil from the atmosphere any more. However, it does reduce the soil frost on higher, snow rich areas, due to the warmer air temperature. As a whole, minor changes were simulated on the mean groundwater recharge, as more/less meltwater was able to infiltrate in higher/lower areas. By increasing additionally the precipitation by 15 %, the soil frost diminished slightly over the whole catchment. By combining both climate change scenarios, we may expect an increase in extreme events, as, on the one hand, the rainfall intensity increases, and, on the other hand, rain on snow events over frozen soils occurs more often in lower areas. In practice, this work shows the importance of better investigating the hydrothermal behaviour of alpine regions. Such a knowledge is necessary, as more and more efforts are put into managing efficiently, durably and globally the available water resources. This work stresses also the necessity to consider seasonally soil frost in alpine risk management. As an example, flooding is mostly a consequence of strong rain precipitation at high altitudes combined with heavy snowmelt. Obviously, the risk of extreme runoff events increases during frozen winters, when the soil infiltration capacity is further reduced by the soil ice. Also, it has been shown that unstable slopes are mostly related to specific hydrogeological situations, like strong precipitation, which induces a sharp increase in the underneath water circulation. The melt water in spring is hence a potential activating factor, and a frozen soil may reduce the risk of sliding, as less water infiltrates into the ground...|$|E
