25|$|Unfortunately, Leblond’s {{first attempt}} to use {{autoradiography}} failed, the reason being that the radioiodine-128 isotope, with its extremely short half-life (25 minutes), disintegrated so quickly that too little radioactivity remained to be detected by the <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Current color films do {{this with}} three layers of {{differently}} color-sensitive <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> coated on one strip of film base. Early processes used color filters to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip Technicolor) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., Dufaycolor) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.|$|E
25|$|The first motion {{pictures}} were photographed using a simple homogeneous <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> that yielded a black-and-white image—that is, an image {{in shades of}} gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the luminous intensity of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, Leblond found that, when {{he poured}} liquid <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> on a {{histological}} section containing a radio element, the emulsion was eventually activated by the radio-element; and if thereafter routine photographic development and fixation {{were applied to}} the emulsion-covered section, black silver grains appeared in the emulsion wherever it overlay sites containing a radio-element. This liquid emulsion approach {{has been used to}} develop a new High Resolution Autoradiography procedure characterized by close contact between emulsion and section. Such close contact makes it possible to localize the radio-elements in the section at high resolution, so that radio-elements can be localized at high magnification in the light microscope.|$|E
25|$|Between 1883 and 1886, Muybridge {{made more}} than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia {{under the auspices of}} the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter Thomas Eakins briefly worked {{alongside}} him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favoured the use of multiple exposures superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope. The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> speeds then available. Towards the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.|$|E
500|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, Creutz {{accepted}} an offer from Seitz {{to come to the}} Carnegie Institute of Technology as an associate professor, and help create a nuclear physics group there. Creutz in turn recruited a number of young physicists who had worked with him at Princeton and on the Manhattan Project in Chicago and Los Alamos, including Martyn Foss, Jack Fox, Roger Sutton and Sergio DeBenedetti. Together, with funding from the Office of Naval Research they built a 450 MeV synchrotron at the Nuclear Research Center near Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. For a time, [...] This put them at the forefront of research into nuclear physics, allowing physicists there to study the recently discovered pi meson and mu meson. A visiting scholar, Gilberto Bernardini, created the first <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> of a meson.|$|E
50|$|It {{was these}} origins {{that led to}} the {{miniaturization}} and adaptability of <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsions,</b> and consequently paved the way for social and action photography and cinematography.|$|R

25|$|Hurter and Driffield began {{pioneering}} {{work on the}} light sensitivity of <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsions</b> in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.|$|R
2500|$|Typically, a lens is used {{to focus}} the light {{reflected}} or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically [...] "developed" [...] into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on {{the purpose of the}} photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> film {{sometimes}} {{appears to}} exaggerate {{the color of the}} light, as it does not respond to lighting color in the way human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white {{may turn out to be}} very blue or orange in a photograph. The color balance may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral color print. [...] The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the [...] "wrong" [...] light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger. [...] Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.|$|E
2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new {{panchromatic}} <b>photographic</b> <b>emulsion</b> was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E

In this work we study two particular procedures, silver halide sensitized gelatin and fixation-free rehalogenating bleaching applied to two new commercial silver halide emulsions: the BB- 640 plates from Holographic Recording Technologies and Slavich PFG- 01 plates.
