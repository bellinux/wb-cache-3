5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} two {{applications}} of MCCR model for analyzing and forecasting actual field data for two gas reservoirs <b>producing</b> <b>from</b> layered and compartmentalized reservoirs.

5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> {{acetaldehyde}} {{using the}} Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers are <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce toxic substances into nontoxic honey <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> nontoxic nectar.

5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat is <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> the collisions {{that created}} the body, by the decay of radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} eighty T28E1s were <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> July to August 1942 by White, {{all of which}} had a mount lacking {{protection}} for the gun combination and crew.

5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass {{numbers from}} 245 to 260), the most studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are <b>produced</b> <b>from</b> rare einsteinium (253Es and 255Es respectively), that therefore limits their availability.|$|E
