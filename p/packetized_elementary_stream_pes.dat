50|$|<b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Stream</b> (<b>PES)</b> is a {{specification}} {{defined by}} the MPEG communication protocol (see the MPEG-2 standard) that allows an elementary stream to be divided into packets. The elementary stream is packetized by encapsulating sequential data bytes from the elementary stream inside PES packet headers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Stream</b> (<b>PES)</b> is a {{specification}} in the MPEG-2 Part 1 (Systems) (ISO/IEC 13818-1) and ITU-T H.222.0 {{that defines}} carrying of elementary streams (usually {{the output of}} an audio or video encoder) in packets within MPEG program streams and MPEG transport streams. The elementary stream is packetized by encapsulating sequential data bytes from the elementary stream inside PES packet headers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to detect errors in Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) {{transport}} stream. DMB uses the MPEG- 4 standard for encapsulating <b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Stream</b> (<b>PES),</b> and uses the MPEG- 2 standard for assembling them {{in the form of}} transport stream packets. Recently many research works have been carried out about video stream error detection. They mostly do this by focusing on some decoding parameters related to frame. Processing complexity can be a disadvantage for the proposed methods. In this thesis, we investigated syntax error occurrences due to corruption in the header of the video transport stream. The main focus of the study is the video streams that cannot be decoded. The proposed model is implemented by filtering video and audio packets in order to find the errors. The filters investigate some sources that can affect the video stream playback. The output from this method determines the type, location and duration of the errors. The simplicity of the structure is one of advantages of this model. It can be implemented by three simple filters for detecting errors and a “calculation unit” for calculating the duration of an error. Fast processing is another benefit of the proposed model...|$|E

50|$|<b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Streams</b> (PES) are <b>elementary</b> <b>streams</b> <b>packetized</b> into {{packets of}} {{variable}} lengths, i.e., divided ES into independent chunks where {{cyclic redundancy check}} (CRC) checksum was added to each packet for error detection.|$|R
50|$|Program Streams (PS) are {{concerned}} with combining multiple <b>packetized</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>streams</b> (usually just one audio and video PES) into a single stream, ensuring simultaneous delivery, and maintaining synchronization. The PS structure {{is known as a}} multiplex, or a container format.|$|R
50|$|To {{generate}} the PS, the multiplexer will interleave the (two or more) <b>packetized</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>streams.</b> This is done so the packets of the simultaneous streams {{can be transferred}} over the same channel and are guaranteed to both arrive at the decoder at precisely the same time. This {{is a case of}} time-division multiplexing.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>elementary</b> <b>stream</b> (ES) {{as defined}} by the MPEG {{communication}} protocol is usually the output of an audio or video encoder. ES contains only one kind of data, e.g. audio, video or closed caption. An <b>elementary</b> <b>stream</b> {{is often referred to as}} [...] "elementary", [...] "data", [...] "audio", or [...] "video" [...] bitstreams or streams. The format of the <b>elementary</b> <b>stream</b> depends upon the codec or data carried in the stream, but will often carry a common header when packetized into a <b>packetized</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|R
50|$|Program streams {{are created}} by {{combining}} one or more <b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Streams</b> (PES), which have a common time base, into a single stream. It is designed for reasonably reliable media such as disks, in contrast to MPEG transport stream which is for data transmission in which loss of data is likely. Program streams have variable size records and minimal use of start codes which would make over the air reception difficult, but has less overhead. Program stream coding layer allows only one program {{of one or more}} <b>elementary</b> <b>streams</b> to be packaged into a single stream, in contrast to transport stream, which allows multiple programs.|$|R
50|$|A {{transport}} stream encapsulates {{a number of}} other substreams, often <b>packetized</b> <b>elementary</b> <b>streams</b> (PES) which in turn wrap the main data stream of an MPEG codec, as well as any number of non-MPEG codecs (such as AC3 or DTS audio, and MJPEG or JPEG 2000 video), text and pictures for subtitles, tables identifying the streams, and even broadcaster-specific information such as an electronic program guide. Many unrelated streams are often mixed together, such as several different television channels, or multiple angles of a movie. Each stream is chopped into (at most) 188-byte sections and interleaved together; because of the tiny packet size, streams can be interleaved with less latency and greater error resilience compared to program streams and common containers such as AVI, MOV/MP4, and MKV, which generally wrap each frame into one packet. This is particularly important for videoconferencing, where even one large frame may introduce unacceptable audio delay.|$|R

40|$|This volume {{presents}} a parametric packet-based audiovisual quality model for Internet Protocol TeleVision (IPTV) services. The model {{is composed of}} three quality modules for the respective audio, video and audiovisual components. The audio and video quality modules take as input a parametric description of the audiovisual processing path, and deliver {{an estimate of the}} audio and video quality. These outputs are sent to the audiovisual quality module which provides an estimate of the audiovisual quality. Estimates of perceived quality are typically used both in the network planning phase and as part of the quality monitoring. The same audio quality model is used for both these phases, while two variants of the video quality model have been developed for addressing the two application scenarios. The addressed packetization scheme is MPEG 2 Transport Stream over Real-time Transport Protocol over Internet Protocol. In the case of quality monitoring, that is the case for which the network is already set-up, the audiovisual stream is encrypted either at the level of <b>Packetized</b> <b>Elementary</b> <b>Stream</b> or of the Transport Stream. The presented model became standardized under the ITU-T P. 1201 and P. 1201. 2 recommendation...|$|R
