500|$|Because of the {{theoretical}} benefits, especially a simplified front-wheel drive mechanism, {{attempts have been made}} to construct a rideable <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> bike. The Bendix Company built a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> bicycle, and the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned the construction of a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> motorcycle: both proved to be unrideable. Rainbow Trainers, Inc. in Alton, Illinois, offered US$5,000 to the first person [...] "who can successfully ride the rear-steered bicycle, Rear Steered Bicycle I". One documented example of someone successfully riding a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> bicycle is that of L. H. Laiterman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on a specially designed recumbent bike. The difficulty is that turning left, accomplished by turning the rear wheel to the right, initially moves the center of mass to the right, and vice versa. This complicates the task of compensating for leans induced by the environment. Examination of the eigenvalues for bicycles with common geometries and mass distributions shows that when moving in reverse, so as to have <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> they are inherently unstable. Other, purpose-built designs have been published, however, that do not suffer this problem.|$|R
5000|$|The 928 {{included}} several other innovations {{such as the}} [...] "Weissach Axle", a simple <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system that provides passive <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> to increase stability while braking during a turn, and an unsleeved, silicon alloy engine block made of aluminium, which reduced weight and provided a highly durable cylinder bore.|$|R

50|$|Although an {{uncommon}} drive layout, {{it has been}} used in the past, by Buckminster Fuller in his concept Dymaxion car, which was able to turn within its wheelbase due to <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|A non-Lotus {{innovation}} in the Impulse was {{the development of the}} Nishiboric passive <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.|$|R
50|$|His voiturette {{was made}} by Cie des Automobiles du Sud Ouest of France in 1899. The Leon Bollee-like 3-wheeler had dos-a-dos seating {{for two and a}} 3 ½ hp {{horizontal}} single-cylinder engine. It also had the bizarre feature of front-wheel drive and <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mazda New Zealand again {{assembled}} {{a range of}} four-door sedan and five-door hatchback models, supplemented by the newly available wagon, and imported the coupe and a top five-door version, both with electronically controlled <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> Ford New Zealand's Telstar line was similar, including the wagon and imported <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> models, but without the coupe. The wagon's arrival enabled Ford to drop the UK-sourced Sierra wagon from local assembly, simplifying model sourcing. The NZ-specification cars, though imported CKD, shared much of their specifications with uncatalyzed European models including the modified tail lamp assemblies with the mandatory-for-Europe fog light lenses though the bulbs and wiring were not included. This and later generations would also be imported used from Japan in later years, greatly widening the choice of models and specifications available in this market.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of forklift operation is {{that it must have}} <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver’s traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. While steering, as there is no caster action, it is unnecessary to apply steering force to maintain a constant rate of turn.|$|R
50|$|The {{steered wheels}} on a velomobile {{will hit the}} fairing if steered sharply enough. Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for {{aerodynamics}} and width. Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse turning circle than an equivalent unfaired cycle. In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle. Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, {{but it is hard}} to build a stable vehicle using only <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The Velayo uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it was produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles steered all wheels; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels. However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.|$|R
5|$|The <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> {{was dropped}} from the {{production}} car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|R
50|$|All FX50 models ordered {{with the}} Sport package (FX50S) come {{equipped}} with Active Steering package. This package features a planetary gearset {{on the steering}} shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. The package also includes a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system that induces up to one degree of steer to the rear wheels, to provide increased handling response for the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Four-wheel car {{steering}} is modelled by a single-track {{model with}} nonlinear tire characteristics. A generic control law for robust decoupling of lateral and yaw motion by yaw rate feedback to front-wheel steering is derived. Ideal steering dynamics are achieved by velocity-scheduled lateral acceleration feedback to front-wheel steering. For robust yaw stabilization a velocity scheduled yaw-rate feedback to <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is given, {{by which the}} linearized system gets velocity independent yaw eigenvalues...|$|R
5000|$|The F07 Gran Turismo is {{the first}} 5 Series to be {{available}} in a fastback body style. The F10 is also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch transmission (in the M5), active <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (called [...] "Integral Active Steering"), electric power steering, double wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called [...] "Black Panel Display") and automatic parking (called [...] "Parking Assistant").|$|R
5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To ensure vehicle {{stability}} in critical and dangerous working conditions, a vehicle stability control strategy is proposed, {{which is to}} generate compensating yaw moment by using the combined action of active <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and differential braking. A corresponding fuzzy controller for the proposed control strategy is designed. To verify the control effect of fuzzy controller, the numerical simulation by using vehicle dynamic model is performed in critical condition. The simulation {{results show that the}} designed fuzzy control system can efficiently prevent the vehicle to lose driving stability during critical turning...|$|R
50|$|In August 2008, {{a variant}} of the Vito was {{approved}} by the Public Carriage Office for use as a licensed London 'black cab'. The Vito taxicab includes electric sliding doors, electric steps and seating for six people. The Vito's <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> enables it to meet the PCO's strict Conditions of Fitness requirements including a 25 ft turning circle and wheelchair accessibility. The vehicle, a variation of the 'Traveliner' model, is built by Penso in Coventry. The rear wheel steer system is licensed from one80, and it is distributed through Eco City Vehicles subsidiary KPM-UK Taxis.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of the TMS and the self-stability it exhibits suggests that the design envelope of rideable bikes is larger than previously thought. For example, <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> {{may not be as}} impossible as has been claimed. In the case of the TMS bike, the authors explain that the front assembly center of mass is lower than the rear frame center of mass - so it falls faster in a lean; and it is in front of the steering axis so it tends to steer the front end {{in the direction of the}} lean.|$|R
40|$|Four-wheel {{steering}} {{systems for}} cars are decoupled {{in order to}} split the control problem into two parts: i) the steering problem in which the driver only has to keep a mass point on his planned path and ii) the yaw stabilization problem. The decoupling and stabilization problems are robustly solved by yaw rate feedback. Four-wheel car steering is modelled by a single-track model with nonlinear tire characteristics. A generic constant yaw-rate feedback law for decoupling of lateral and yaw motion is derived. For robust yaw stabilization a velocity scheduled yaw rate feedback to <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is given, by which the linear {{part of the system}} gets velocity independent yaw eigenvalues...|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Porsche {{announced}} {{changes to}} the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to 520 hp on the Turbo, and 560 hp on the Turbo S, giving them a 0-60 mph time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that will steer the rear wheels {{in the opposite direction}} at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling. During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.|$|R
50|$|Scott had {{the honor}} of the first test drive, taking it around the LM. The Rover had both front and back {{steering}}, but Scott found that only the <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> was working (mysteriously the front steering would be working {{at the start of the}} second EVA). Other difficulties came from how their space suits did not bend very much when they sat down. When training on Earth, their body weight had forced the suits down, but on the Moon, they ended up reclining in the seats. Apart from the steering there were no other problems and the crew set about loading up the Rover for their first geological traverse.|$|R
50|$|Camera dollies {{have several}} {{steering}} mechanisms {{available to the}} dolly grip. The typical mode is <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> where the front wheels remain fixed, while the wheels closest to the operating handle are used to turn. A second mode, round steering, causes the front wheels to turn {{in the opposite direction}} from the rear wheels. This mode allows the dolly to move in smooth circles and is frequently used when the dolly is on curved track. A third mode, called crab steering, is when the front wheels steer {{in the same direction as}} the rear wheels. This allows the dolly to move in a direction diagonal to the front end of the dolly.|$|R
50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering — that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using clutches and brakes, to bring about a change of course or direction.|$|R
5000|$|Porsche {{introduced}} the 991 GT3 at the Geneva Motor Show in 2013. The 991 GT3 features a new 3.8 litre {{direct fuel injection}} (DFI) flat-six engine developing [...] at 8,250 rpm, a Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) double-clutch gearbox and <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The engine {{is based on the}} unit fitted in the 991 Carrera S, but shares only a few common parts. All other components, particularly the crankshaft and valve train, were specially adapted or developed for the 991 GT3. For example, the 991 GT3's engine uses titanium connecting rods attached to forged piston, in order to allow the engine to reach up to 9,000 rpm. The dual-clutch gearbox is another feature specially developed for the 991 GT3, based on sequential manual transmissions used in racing cars.|$|R
25|$|At its debut, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} model {{was shown in}} rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving Eco to Sport S and Sport S+ which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.|$|R

An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.These designs, such as the Python Lowracer, a recumbent, usually have very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and positive or even negative trail. The builder of a bike with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|R
50|$|John Isaac Thornycroft, {{the naval}} engineer, also formed the Thornycroft Steam Carriage and Van Company which built its first steam van in 1896. This was {{exhibited}} at The Great Exhibition, and could {{carry a load}} of 1 ton. It was fitted with a Thornycroft marine launch-type boiler (Thornycroft announced a new boiler designed for their steam carriages in October 1897). The engine was a twin-cylinder compound engine arranged so that high-pressure steam could be admitted to the low-pressure cylinder to give extra power for hill-climbing. A {{modified version of the}} steam wagon with a 6-cubic-yard tipper body was developed for Chiswick council in 1896 and went into service as a very early self-propelled dust-cart. While the original 1896 wagon had front-wheel drive with <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> the tipper dust-cart had rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steering. The Thornycroft tipper was built by the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company, though engined by Thornycroft.|$|R
5000|$|The Dymaxions {{aerodynamic}} bodywork {{was designed}} for increased fuel efficiency and top speed, and its platform featured a lightweight hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-wheel drive (a rare RF layout), and three wheels. With steering via its third wheel at the rear (capable of 90° steering lock), the vehicle could steer itself in a tight circle, often causing a sensation. Fuller noted severe limitations in its handling, especially at high speed or in high wind, due to its <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (highly unsuitable for anything but low speeds) and the limited understanding {{of the effects of}} lift and turbulence on automobile bodies in that era [...] - [...] allowing only trained staff to drive the car and saying it [...] "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements." [...] Shortly after its launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxions driver. Subsequent investigations exonerated the prototype.|$|R
2500|$|Along {{with these}} chassis refinements, Sport package {{equipped}} models came with firmer rear shocks, bigger front brake calipers, and larger [...] rotors all around (up from 12.6/12.1-inch front/rear). Sport package equipped cars {{also get a}} viscous limited slip differential. An all-new Active Steering package can be ordered for sport package equipped models. It features a planetary gearset on the steering shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. A <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system that induces up to one degree of rear steer is also included in this package. The Active Steering package includes even stiffer shocks than the sport package at all four corners and the ride has been repeatedly reported as being too stiff for most customers except the most [...] "enthusiastic" [...] drivers. Base and Journey model [...] tires bump up from 215s to 225s, while the [...] upgrade (included in sport or wheel package) with 225/50-ZR18 front and 245/45-ZR18 rear is now a size smaller in front and larger in back than the 1st gen model's all-around 235/45R18s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of increasing the vehicle driving stability at a higher speed. One of the ways how to achieve higher stability is using the 4 WS system. Mathematical description of vehicle general movement is a very complex task. For simulation, models which are aptly simplified are used. For the first approach, so-called single-truck vehicle model (often linear) is usually used. For the simulation, we have chosen to extend the model into a two-truck one, which includes the possibility to input more vehicle parameters. Considering the 4 WS system, it is possible to use a number of potential regulations. In our simulation model, the regulation system with compound coupling was used. This type of regulation turns the rear wheels depending on the input parameters of the system (steering angle of the front wheels) and depending on the output moving quantities of the vehicle, most frequently the yaw rate. Criterion for compensation of lateral deflection centre of gravity angle is its zero value, or more precisely the zero value of its first-order derivative. Parameters and set-up of the simulation model were done in conjunction with the dSAPACE software. Reference performances of the vehicle simulation model were made through the defined manoeuvres. But the simulation results indicate that the <b>rear-wheels</b> <b>steering</b> can {{have a positive effect on}} the vehicle movement stability, especially when changing the driving direction at high speed...|$|R
40|$|Some {{peculiarities of}} dry {{friction}} {{that represent the}} outcomes of several well-known physical phenomena but that are insufficiently accurately and simply explained in the scientific literature, are analyzed in this paper. The authors research into {{the reasons for the}} oscillation of strings of bowed string instruments in furtherance of the laws of mechanics; they also explain differences in the sound produced by strings of bowed and plucked instruments; they study the reasons for the motor car skid and provide their recommendations how to overcome it. The recommendation to rotate the steering wheel in the direction of skidding rather than vice versa as the one could expect from the viewpoint of common sense, gives rise to confusion and even protest of drivers (mainly, the new ones) and drastic consequences. Let us once again emphasize that this driving pattern refers to <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering</b> cars (so-called "classics"). As for frontwheel drive cars, one can turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the skid without retarding the throttle, but it is also advisable to release the brake of the front wheels and fulfill the braking by the rear wheels only.

40|$|AbstractThe {{goal of the}} Human Power Team {{from the}} TU Delft and the Free University of Amsterdam is to break the world speed record in unpaced cycling (Sam Whittingham, 133. 28 km/h). The design of such a faired {{recumbent}} bicycle is a challenge. The Delft design, called VeloX (Human Power Team (2013)), is a fully-faired monocoque front-driven recumbent bicycle, with minimized air drag and maximized space for a big and strong athlete. However, front driven bicycles have the disadvantage that the front driving induces unwanted steering and that the frontal area of the bicycle cannot be reduced any further. A solution would be <b>rear-wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> A common thought is that a rear-wheel steered bicycle cannot be laterally self-stable, and therefore hard to control. However, recent research (Knoll et al. (2012)) has shown that one can design a rear-wheel steered bicycle which shows a stable forward speed range. Based on these results a rear-wheel steered recumbent bicycle has been designed, within the existing design constraints. Although not self-stable, this design shows a mildly lateral unstable behavior in the desired forward speed range of 0 to 40 m/s (0 to 144 km/h). Computer simulations demonstrate that the bicycle can be stabilized by adding a human controller model (Schwab et al. (2013)) to the bicycle model. For a set of expected lateral perturbations (side wind perturbations) it is shown that rider steer torque stays within human bounds, both in magnitude and in frequency.
