500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|The song's {{production}} is primarily centered around hi-NRG beats, [...] "stuttering synthesizers", and hard snares. Robbie Daw of Idolator {{noted that the}} [...] "opening, pulsating synths are a straight-up throwback to the 'Poker Face' intro— albeit slightly sped up— while the handclap-laden chorus swells and soars with the same pop frenzy that made 'Paparazzi' such a delight." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described the song's composition as [...] "brilliantly camp– all squelchy synths and juddering beats" [...] and likened it to a [...] "ridiculous glam-rock song given a techno makeover". The chorus has been noted to contain [...] "a solid mixture of EDM-influenced pop, glitchy k-pop-lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of The Fame" [...] and features Gaga singing the lines, [...] "Give me the thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on) / <b>Put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> up make 'em touch (Make it real loud)". Her vocal acrobatics during the song's verses have been compared to those of David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Grace Jones.|$|E

500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set {{to appear on the}} album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When I took a step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
500|$|The next track, [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{features}} rapper Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan {{and discusses}} the disappointment of the group's debut album not achieving the coveted [...] "five-mic" [...] rating from The Source: [...] "I gotta hit the Source / I need my other half mic / because that Southernplayalisticadillacmusik {{was a classic}} right?". [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes. Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song [...] "dimensional, like you could actually <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> through the song." [...] "Synthesizer" [...] contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton. Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track [...] "raw and woozy", dubbing it the [...] "weirdest moment of the record". On the seventh track, [...] "Slump", Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. One of the few tracks that doesn’t have Andre on it, since he is the [...] "unique" [...] one of the group, while Big Boi is more of the traditional gangster. On [...] "West Savannah", Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating [...] "You might call us country, but we's only Southern".|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Further, Pallett writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title.

[...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey's [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1996), while [...] "Somebody's Somebody", in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one's arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on [...] "Reflection", which Partridge characterized it as the song that [...] "sums up the album." [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] is deemed the most [...] "sexual" [...] track on Christina Aguilera, a hip hop-influenced song which features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself. [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> On Me", an R song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of sex: [...] "I just know / when you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on me / I feel sexy / and my body turns to gold." [...] "Blessed" [...] features elements of gospel, while [...] "Love Will Find A Way" [...] features an R groove and was compared to Carey's songs [...] "Emotions" [...] (1991) and [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993).

2500|$|While {{initially}} {{signed as}} a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first {{made a name for}} himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music. Among his work for other artists, Thicke co-wrote [...] "Love Is on My Side" [...] on Brandy's eponymous debut album; he also wrote for 3T's Brotherhood, and collaborated with Jordan Knight, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on several songs in Knight's 1999 album Jordan Knight including the Billboard top 10 hit [...] "Give It to You". According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him. He also co-wrote the song [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> on Me" [...] for Christina Aguilera's debut album and co-wrote and produced three songs for Mýa's sophomore release, Fear of Flying. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song [...] "Fall Again" [...] with Walter Afanasieff, which was intended to be a track on Michael Jackson's 2001 album Invincible, but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004 as an album track of his limited edition box set The Ultimate Collection. As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005.|$|E

[...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was later re-recorded for its single release, replacing the [...] "lighter" [...] version for a more [...] "funky" [...] R version. Peiken also re-wrote with Roche the single version for the track [...] "Come on Over", first produced by Johan Aberg, Paul Rein and Aaron Zigman. According to herself, [...] "We're {{going to give it}} more of an edge, R it up a little, maybe rock it out a little, give it a lot of different new directions and get it out there." [...] Aguilera also recorded a cover of All-4-One's song [...] "I Turn to You", written by Diane Warren. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers (who would eventually broke into the scene as the producers who launched Rihanna's career) wrote and produced two tracks, while the then up-and-coming Robin Thicke co-wrote and co-produced [...] "When You <b>Put</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> on Me". Franne Golde (who previously worked with Whitney Houston) also wrote a song for Aguilera. At the final stages, producer and songwriter David Frank presented a song called [...] "Genie in a Bottle", which Aguilera almost didn't record, [...] "because {{there were a lot of}} other artists out there that were after this song, so we had to fight a little bit to get it," [...] she claimed. With Heather Holley, Aguilera also co-wrote a track called [...] "I Will Be", which she said was inspired by Mariah Carey's [...] "Vanishing". Producer of the track [...] "So Emotional" [...] revealed that Aguilera in-between recordings [...] "she was only listening to Mariah Carey and Brandy, putting on her walk man and practicing their riffs and runs, before she did her ad-libs.|$|E
