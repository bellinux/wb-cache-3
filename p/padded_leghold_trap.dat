40|$|A case {{of severe}} golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) {{predation}} on domestic sheep was documented on seven South Dakota ranches {{during the spring}} of 1993. One hundred forty-two lambs and one ewe were verified as being killed by eagles during a six-week period. In an effort to resolve the depredation problem, <b>padded</b> <b>leghold</b> <b>traps</b> were used to capture 21 golden eagles in or near the lambing pastures. The captured eagles were translocated and released approximately 322 km northeast of the capture area. Predation on lambs ceased following the relocation effort...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 8700 As appears {{typical in}} the field of {{conservation}} biology, the current study has parallel aims. The first is to improve both the limited toolbox and the biological information available for the conservation of a vulnerable species. The second is to compare and contrast the integrative, systematic and objective approach idealised by conservation biology with the traditional simplistic, or even ad hoc, approaches to conservation that persist for economically unimportant taxa. This thesis involves the gathering of information on the basic biology of otters and its synthesis into a logical modelling framework relating otter populations to the Irish landscape so as to optimise conservation measures. The thesis is presented as a series of published papers and manuscripts. Otters have been extremely difficult to capture and mark efficiently and humanely and research on some aspects of their biology was impeded as a consequence. I present and evaluate a novel trapping technique involving Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) trap alarms coupled with <b>padded</b> <b>leghold</b> <b>traps.</b> The trapping method was highly efficient compared with the most popular trap currently in use. Stress and trauma were minimised by removing animals from their traps within a matter of minutes...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparent}} {{increase in}} coyote-human conflicts, notably attacks on humans, demonstrates that such incidents are not rare in California. The authors discuss coyote attacks on 53 humans, resulting in 21 instances of human injury, {{over the last}} decade. These illustrate repeated, predictable pre-attack coyote behavior patterns. Specific changes in human environments and in human behavior that have contributed to coyote attacks are discussed. Case histories of attacks reveal contributing factors and suggest appropriate corrective and preventive actions. <b>Padded</b> <b>leghold</b> <b>traps</b> {{have been the most}} effective and efficient tool in removing problem coyotes and changing the behavior of coyotes to fear humans and the urban environment. Long-term solutions will require changes in human behavior. Humans must come to view large mammalian predators as a potential hazard.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two techniques}} for capturing American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias), {{and other large}} wading birds in aquatic habitats. One technique involved using # 3 <b>padded</b> jaw <b>leghold</b> <b>traps</b> modified by replacing both factory coil springs with weaker # 1. 5 coil springs, to reduce the closing force of the jaws, and replacing the factory chain with a length of aircraft cable and an elastic shock cord, to minimize injury caused by lunging. The second technique involved using a modified portable rocket net that can be set in shallow water. We captured 142 American White Pelicans and 23 Great Blue Herons using these two techniques. We describe situations best suited for the optimum use of each technique. Both methods are humane and cost, labor, and time efficient...|$|R

40|$|The Wildlife Services (WS) Program manages wildlife/human {{conflicts}} {{by using}} an integrated approach employing some vertebrate pesticides. These are used in such small quantities that private industry cannot afford to register and produce them profitably. On behalf of WS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) maintains about 30 federal and state pesticide registrations, containing seven active ingredients, with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These include: the Compound 1080 Livestock Protection Collar, DRC- 1339 Concentrates (Starlicide), Gas Cartridges (carbon and sodium nitrate), the M- 44 (sodium cyanide), {{and a number of}} baits and concentrates containing Strychnine Alkaloid and Zinc Phosphide. In 1988 Congress amended the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, requiring reregistration of almost all older pesticides. Reregistration had an extensive impact on the WS Program. Over 400 studies, with an estimated cost of about $ 14 million, were requested by EPA for APHIS products. Through negotiations with EPA, repackaging of old data, and obtaining data waivers for inappropriate studies, National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) and APHIS personnel reduced the data requirements to about 250 studies costing $ 3 million. In addition, the NWRC managed three Consortia that generated funds and data to maintain Starlicide, strychnine and zinc phosphide products held by APHIS, private industry, and state agencies. APHIS is now entering the final stages of reregistration. Carbon, sodium nitrate, sodium cyanide, Compound 1080, and Starlicide have been reregistered. The Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED), with an appended product-specific data call-in notice, was received for strychnine in March 1997 and the remaining data are being generated.
