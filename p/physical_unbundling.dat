40|$|Next Generation Access Networks {{will enable}} much higher bandwidths than copper based access networks. Although {{technological}} progress provides for higher bandwidth on copper as well, {{most experts agree}} that next generation access networks finally will be based on fibre optic cables in the entire or part of the access networks. In order to accomplish the migration towards Next Generation Access Networks, high investment is needed and various models for co-operation and co-financing are tried out worldwide. What does the deployment of fibre optic cables in the access networks mean for the wholesale market and competition? Unbundling of copper cables has been the basis for infrastructure based competition in telecommunications networks especially in the European environment for more than a decade. Unbundling of fibre is an option in case of point to point architectures. Current solutions of Fibre-to-the-Curb and Fibre-to-the-Building technologies rely of sharing of fibre infrastructures and make <b>physical</b> <b>unbundling</b> cumbersome. Does this mean the end of <b>physical</b> <b>unbundling</b> and is bitstream access the wholesale product of the future...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding competition and industry structure {{in the context of}} Fiber to the Home (FTTH). We present engineering cost models, which indicate that FTTH is a decreasing cost industry, thereby making facilities based competition an unlikely outcome. Non-facilities based competition (or service level competition) in FTTH can happen in data-link layer (or transport) services via unbundled dark fiber (i. e. unbundled network elements) and in higher layer (voice, video and data) services via logical layer unbundling (or open access). FTTH architectures differ in {{the extent to which they}} support unbundling and therefore the extent of non-facilities based competition in FTTH depends on the architecture of the shared network over which multiple service providers offer service. Among the four different FTTH architectures considered, the curbside single-wavelength Passive Optical Network architecture (PON) that has isolated pole-mounted splitters has the most economical fiber plant but permits unbundling only at the logical layer. Consequently, though a PON supports ‘open access’ based competition in higher layer services like voice, data and switched digital video, it does not facilitate competition in data-link layer services or in the provision of analog broadcast video services. In complete contrast, the Home Run architecture has the highest initial (fiber related) capital cost, but permits unbundling of both the physical plant and at the logical layer. The Home Run architecture therefore supports a per subscriber choice of data-link layer services (via UNE based competition) as well as competition in higher layer voice, video and data services (via open access). This work further identifies deployment strategies, which can facilitate <b>physical</b> plant <b>unbundling</b> at costs much lower than the Home Run architecture. <b>Physical</b> plant <b>unbundling</b> is made possible by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple distribution fibers (or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). Ideally, both passive splitters and active electronics can be deployed at an OFAP. OFAP architectures further lead to higher utilization of splitter and Optical Line Termination (OLT) ports in markets that have less than 100 % penetration thereby providing the service provider with a real option to (i) defer investment in OLT ports (ii) deploy multiple data-link layer technologies and (iii) effectively phase in new technologies - under both monopoly and competition...|$|R
40|$|An upgrade at the <b>physical</b> layer {{regarding}} <b>unbundling</b> {{and dynamic}} bandwidth provisioning of a wavelength division multiplexed access network is presented. The capability of a reflective modulator {{to act as}} a photodetector is exploited and allows a tandem configuration to be used at the optical network unit (ONU) for flexible switching of the detection and modulation branch. Consequently, a mechanism for service operator selection and for dynamic bandwidth partitioning up to twice the nominal data rate is provided. The scheme is experimentally evaluated for different kinds of modulators and shows, together with a full-duplex transmission at 10 Gb/s, additional operation modes, featuring unidirectional downstream and upstream burst-mode transmission with up to 20 Gb/s for ONUs based on a combination of a semiconductor optical amplifier and a reflective electro-absorption modulator. © 2011 Optical Society of America...|$|R
