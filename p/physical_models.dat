5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E

5|$|The opening beauty pass {{of the new}} Enterprise was the {{responsibility}} of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, who handled all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action bluescreen elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise-D effects for Generations, but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50mm lens instead of the 35mm used for Generations because the smaller lens made the new Enterprises dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture {{a high level of}} detail with <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>modelling</b> {{has a long}} {{established}} {{history for}} the investigation of metal forming and other manufacturing processes. In recent times however its place and importance has diminished somewhat as {{a direct consequence of}} advances made in numerical modelling techniques. This paper re-examines the place of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> and by means of selected examples demonstrates the benefits of the approach. <b>Physical</b> <b>modelling</b> often provides an indirect representation of the physics under consideration and may often involve scaling and the use of cheaper substitute materials. A question posed that has in some respects contributed to the diminution of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> is whether the <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> is representative of the physics involved. Related to this question is a new approach to scaled experimentation that has appeared in the recent literature. The new approach is founded on the scaling of space itself and although the idea that space expands and distorts is not new to physics (e. g. cosmology and general relativity) its application to <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> is considered completely novel. The scaling concept enables the physics of processes to be projected into a scaled space and vice versa, thus providing quantification of the validity of any <b>physical</b> <b>model.</b> This aspect fortifies a particular weakness in the <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> approach making its reappraisal particularly timely. Selected numerical and experimental trials are being designed to showcase and reveal the benefits, validity and renewed importance of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling...</b>|$|R

25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do {{not add up to}} 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of the}} software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E
