A generic remanufacturing plan for mobile phones is developed. For the planning of remanufacturing capacities and production programs, a linear optimization model is introduced. To support the planner in the periodic adaptation of an existing remanufacturing facility under quickly changing product, process, and market constraints, discrete-event simulation is applied. Uncertainties regarding quantity and conditions of mobile phones, reliability of capacities, processing times, and demand are considered. The simulation model is generated by an algorithm using results from the linear optimization approach.

5|$|With {{his newly}} {{acquired}} flotillas, the Flanders Flotilla′s commander - Admiral Ludwig von Schröder - decided {{to launch a}} raid in the Dover Strait against the Dover Barrage {{as well as any}} Allied shipping that could be found in the Channel.

Facing Schröder′s 23 boats, the Dover Barrage was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht Ombra, and the naval trawler H. E. Straud. The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage′s anti-submarine nets were armed with only a single rifle each for defence.

50|$|In the United States an {{estimated}} 513,000 {{women and girls}} had experienced FGM or were at risk as of 2012.

50|$|Food {{stocks in}} the cities in the western Netherlands rapidly ran out. The adult rations {{in cities such as}} Amsterdam dropped to below 1000 {{kilocalories}} (4,200 kilojoules) a day by the end of November 1944 and to 580 kilocalories in the west by the end of February 1945. Over this Hongerwinter ("Hunger winter"), a number of factors combined to cause starvation in especially the large cities in the West of the Netherlands. The winter in the month of January 1945 itself was unusually harsh <b>prohibiting</b> <b>transport</b> by boat for roughly a month between early January 1945 and early February 1945. Also, the German army destroyed docks and bridges to flood the country and impede the Allied advance. Thirdly, Allied bombing made it extremely difficult to transport food in bulk, since Allied bombers could not distinguish German military and civilian shipments. As the south-eastern (the Maas valley) and the south-western part of the Netherlands (Walcheren and Beveland) became one of the main western battlefields, these conditions combined to make the transport of existing food stocks in large enough quantities nearly impossible.|$|R
