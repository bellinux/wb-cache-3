25|$|After the {{publication}} of MELTS, Ghiorso continued to improve and extend it {{with the help of}} colleagues such as Mark Hirschmann, Paul Asimow, Pete Reiners and Victor Kress. After they identified some fundamental problems with the theory at high pressure, they developed pMELTS, a model for high pressures (1-3 gigapascals (GPa)), and published it in 1995. Asimow and co-authors published phMELTS, a model for mid-ocean ridge basalts that incorporated the effect of water content. In 1998, Ghiorso, Hirschmann and Tim Grove established the Library of Experimental <b>Phase</b> <b>Relations</b> (LEPR), an online database for experimental results on solid-melt equilibria. With Gil Gualda, he modified MELTS to work better with rhyolite, a silicate-rich series of rocks, and released rhyolite-MELTS.|$|E

40|$|Josephson {{junctions}} with topological insulator weak links can host {{low energy}} Andreev bound states {{giving rise to}} a current <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> that deviates from sinusoidal behaviour. Of particular interest are zero energy Majorana bound states that form at a phase difference of π. Here we report on interferometry studies of Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) incorporating topological insulator weak links. We find that the nodes in single junction diffraction patterns and SQUID oscillations are lifted and independent of chemical potential. At high temperatures, the SQUID oscillations revert to conventional behaviour, ruling out asymmetry. The node lifting of the SQUID oscillations is consistent with low energy Andreev bound states exhibiting a nonsinusoidal current <b>phase</b> <b>relation,</b> coexisting with states possessing a conventional sinusoidal current <b>phase</b> <b>relation.</b> However, the finite nodal currents in the single junction diffraction pattern suggest an anomalous contribution to the supercurrent possibly carried by Majorana bound states, although we also consider the possibility of inhomogeneity.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a influência das posições prona e supina em recém-nascidos prematuros pós-síndrome do desconforto respiratório, respirando espontaneamente e em estado de sono ativo, sobre variáveis de padrão respiratório, movimento toracoabdominal e saturação periférica da hemoglobina pelo oxigênio. MÉTODOS: Estudo quase experimental. Doze prematuros com peso > 1. 000 g no momento do estudo foram estudados nas duas posições, em ordem randomizada. A pletismografia respiratória por indutância foi utilizada para avaliação do padrão respiratório (volume corrente, frequência respiratória, ventilação minuto, fluxo inspiratório médio) e do movimento toracoabdominal (índice de trabalho respiratório, relação de fase inspiratória, relação de fase expiratória, relação de fase respiratória total e ângulo de fase). A oximetria de pulso registrou a saturação periférica de oxigênio. Para a análise estatística foram realizados os testes t de Student para amostras pareadas ou Wilcoxon. Foi considerado significativo p OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effect of prone and supine {{positions}} on breathing pattern variables, thoracoabdominal motion and peripheral oxygen saturation of hemoglobin of premature newborn infants recovering from respiratory distress syndrome, while breathing spontaneously and in rapid eye movement sleep. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study. Twelve preterms weighing > 1, 000 g at enrollment were studied in both positions, in random order. Respiratory inductive plethysmography was used to analyze breathing pattern (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow) and thoracoabdominal motion (labored breathing index, <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in inspiration, <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in expiration, <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in total breath and phase angle). Pulse oximetry {{was used to evaluate}} peripheral oxygen saturation. Student's t test for paired samples or the Wilcoxon test were used for statistical analysis. Significance was set at p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 9, 167 respiratory cycles were analyzed. The prone position was associated with significant reductions in labored breathing index (- 0. 84 ± 0. 69; p = 0. 001; 95 %CI - 1. 29 to - 0. 40), <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in inspiration (- 27. 36 ± 17. 55; p = 0. 000; 95 %CI - 38. 51 to - 16. 20), <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in expiration (- 32. 36 ± 16. 20; p = 0. 000; 95 %CI - 42. 65 to - 22. 06) and <b>phase</b> <b>relation</b> in total breath (- 30. 20 ± 14. 76; p = 0. 000; 95 %CI - 39. 59 to - 20. 82).
