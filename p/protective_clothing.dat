5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of {{radioactive}} contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear <b>protective</b> <b>clothing.</b> In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The element, {{like other}} lanthanides, has no {{biological}} role. Promethium-147 can emit X-rays during its beta decay, which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> should be used.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{radiative}} properties of personal <b>protective</b> <b>clothings</b> worn during firefighting operations by firemen. Several intervention jackets are tested coming from different Fire and Rescue Services in France. The present study focuses on the spectral absorptivity of these equipments over visible–IR domains. The spectral absorptivity in the IR range is mainly responsible for the conversion of radiative transfer coming from the flame into heat flux through the protective jacket. This work shows that the mean absorptivities of different equipments are high, close to 90 %, which penalizes the thermal protection. This study demonstrates that the colored textile has a weak effect on the radiative properties {{and then on the}} thermal protection. On the contrary, the dyeing mode can decrease the absorptivity, hence improving the thermal protection of jackets, a dyed jacket being more efficient in the present test than a jacket made of fibers dyed before weaving. Finally, this paper presents mean absorptivities based on Planck's averages for reference temperatures between 800 K and 1400 K, allowing to compare different personal <b>protective</b> <b>clothings...</b>|$|R

5|$|The middle {{child of}} three boys born seven years apart, Icke {{was born in}} Leicester General Hospital to Beric Vaughan Icke and Barbara J. Icke, née Cooke, who were married in Leicester in 1951. Beric {{had wanted to be}} a doctor, but the family had no money, so he joined the Royal Air Force as a medical orderly. He was awarded a British Empire Medal for gallantry in 1943 after an {{aircraft}} crashed into the Chipping Warden air base in Northamptonshire. Along with a squadron leader, Beric ran into the burning aircraft, without <b>protective</b> <b>clothing,</b> and saved the life of a crew member who was trapped inside.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear <b>protective</b> <b>clothing,</b> including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to their random nonwoven counterparts, woven filter media possess much higher regularity and precision. However, {{they are more}} expensive and their application is in general only justified where high-tech requirements have to be met. As a matter of course, the woven manufacturer is very much interested in understanding the complex interplay of geometrical, flow and filtration properties, being the prerequisite for further optimization of his products. The Fraunhofer ITWM software GeoDict is especially tailored to virtually generate and characterize filter media and, therefore, reveal the aforementioned interplay by means of computer simulation. During the last two years, substantial progress and extensions {{have been made to}} the software to satisfy industrial demands concerning technical woven. This paper gives an overview on the latest developments in the generation of woven structures with WeaveGeo, a tool of the GeoDict Software. It is organized by application covering metal wire meshes and filter media for <b>protective</b> <b>clothings...</b>|$|R

25|$|To {{provide the}} end user {{with a minimum}} {{standard}} of protection, suitable <b>protective</b> gloves, <b>clothing,</b> and a respirator with organic-vapour cartridges is normally worn.

Frequent analysis of workers' serum acetylcholinesterase activity is also helpful with regards to occupational safety, because the action of parathion is cumulative. Also, atropine {{has been used as a}} specific antidote.|$|R
