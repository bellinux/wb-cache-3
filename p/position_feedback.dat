40|$|BACKGROUND: Portable {{respiratory}} inductive plethysmography (RIP) {{is promising}} for noninvasive monitoring of breathing patterns in unrestrained subjects. However, its use has been hampered by requiring recalibration after changes in body position. OBJECTIVES: To facilitate RIP application in unrestrained subjects, {{we developed a}} technique for adjustment of RIP calibration using <b>position</b> sensor <b>feedback.</b> METHODS: Five healthy subjects and 12 patients with lung disease were monitored by portable RIP with sensors incorporated within a body garment. Unrestrained individuals were studied during 40 - 60 min while supine, sitting and upright/walking. Position was changed repeatedly every 5 - 10 min. Initial qualitative diagnostic calibration followed by volume scaling in absolute units during 20 breaths in different positions by flow meter provided position-specific volume-motion coefficients for RIP. These were applied during subsequent monitoring in corresponding <b>positions</b> according to <b>feedback</b> from 4 accelerometers placed at the chest and thigh. Accuracy of RIP was evaluated by face mask pneumotachography. RESULTS: <b>Position</b> sensor <b>feedback</b> allowed accurate adjustment of RIP calibration during repeated position changes in subjects and patients as reflected in a minor mean difference (bias) in breath-by-breath tidal volumes estimated by RIP and flow meter of 0. 02 liters (not significant) and limits of agreement (+/- 2 SD) of +/- 19 % (2, 917 comparisons). An average of 10 breaths improved precision of RIP (limits of agreement +/- 14 %). CONCLUSIONS: RIP calibration incorporating <b>position</b> sensor <b>feedback</b> greatly enhances the application of RIP as a valuable, unobtrusive tool to investigate respiratory physiology and ventilatory limitation in unrestrained healthy subjects and patients with lung disease during everyday activities including position change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A forbidden-region virtual fixture (FRVF) is a computer-generated {{constraint}} that displays {{position or}} force limitations to a robot manipulator or operator, {{in order to}} prevent motion into forbidden regions of the workspace. We compare nine FRVFs on each of four common telemanipulator control architectures: position forward, position exchange, <b>position</b> forward/force <b>feedback,</b> and <b>position</b> exchange/force <b>feedback.</b> A one-degree-of-freedom telemanipulation system was used in an experiment designed to simulate users working near a known forbidden region. The metrics of tracking, safety, and submittance were used to analyze the performance of the system with six different users. The results indicate that different FRVF architectures perform best {{for each of the three}} metrics. No single FRVF scheme is the best over all metrics, so selection of an FRVF architecture should be an application-dependent weighting of the three metrics. Across all control architectures, the results indicate that a very strong FRVF at the slave device in combination with no FRVF at the master device leads to poor telepresence. I...|$|R
