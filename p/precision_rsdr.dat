40|$|A new HPLC method with {{fluorescence}} detection using pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide as a post-column derivatising agent {{has been developed}} to determine aflatoxin M- 1 in milk and cheese. The detection limits were 1 ng/kg for milk and 5 ng/kg for cheese. The calibration curve was linear from 0. 001 to 0. 1 ng injected. The method includes a preliminary C- 18 -SPE clean-up and the average recoveries of Aflatoxin M- 1 from milk and cheese, spiked at levels of 25 - 75 ng/kg and 100 - 300 ng/kg, respectively, were 90 and 76 %; the <b>precision</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 1. 7 to 2. 6 % for milk and from 3. 5 to 6. 5 % for cheese. The method is rapid, easily automatable and therefore useful for accurate and precise screening of aflatoxin M- 1 in milk and cheese. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a method using high {{performance}} liquid chromatography to quantify LSD, in blotter papers seized in Minas Gerais, was optimized and validated. Linearity, precision, recovery, limits of detection and quantification, and selectivity were the parameters {{used to evaluate}} performance. The samples were extracted with methanol:water (1 : 1) in an ultra-sound bath. The linearity between 0. 05 and 20. 00 &# 956;g/mL (0. 5 and 200. 0 &# 956;g of LSD/blotter) was observed with satisfactory mean intra and inter assay <b>precision</b> (<b>RSDr</b> = 4. 4 % and RSD R = 6. 4 %, respectively) and with mean recoveries of 83. 4 % and 84. 9 % to the levels of 1. 00 and 20. 00 &# 956;g/mL (10 and 200 &# 956;g LSD/blotter). The limits of detection and quantification were 0. 01 and 0. 05 &# 956;g/mL, respectively (0. 1 and 0. 5 &# 956;g of LSD/blotter). The samples of blotters (n = 22) were analyzed and the mean value of 67. 55 &# 956;g of LSD/blotter (RSD= 27. 5 %) was found. Thus, the method used showed satisfactory analytical performance, and proved suitable as an analytical tool for LSD determination in illicit samples seized by police forces...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} high-performance liquid chromatography-UV (HPLC-UV) method, {{based on}} the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) Official method 2000. 02, was developed and validated for the high-throughput analysis of patulin in in vitro experiments on apple puree agar medium (APAM). The importance of repeating the ethyl acetate extraction step at liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was examined, {{as well as the}} extent of patulin degradation during the sodium carbonate clean-up. In addition to this alkaline clean-up, the efficiency of using an Oasis HLB or C- 18 cartridge as solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up was compared. This resulted in a two-step ethyl acetate LLE, followed by an Oasis HLB SPE clean-up, without alkaline clean-up conditions. The method was fully validated for APAM, cloudy apple juice, and apple puree. Average patulin recoveries at levels of 100, 500, and 1000 mu g kg(- 1) of APAM varied between 95 and 113 % over 3 independent days, with an interday <b>precision</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> of 5 to 10 %. Recovery experiments carried out with the spiked apple juice (at 50 mu g kg(- 1)) and apple puree (10 mu g kg(- 1)) showed average recovery rates laying between 80 - 101 % (RSDR = 12 %) and 77 - 100 % (RSDR = 9 %), respectively. This method offered a detection limit of 3 - 4 mu g kg(- 1) and a quantification limit of 5 - 8 mu g kg(- 1) for APAM, apple juice, and puree...|$|E
40|$|A densitometric Thin-layer Chromatographic (TLC) {{method of}} {{carotenoids}} such as astaxanthin, lutein, and B-carotene {{have been established}} and validated for quantitative determination of carotenoids in fancy carp serum. This study {{can be used in}} the evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of carotenoids in fancy carp serum. Analyses of carotenoids were performed on TLC glass plates pre-coated with silica gel 60 as the stationary phase. Linear ascending development was carried out in a twin trough glass chamber saturated with mobile phase consisting of petroleum ether-diethyl ether-acetone(75 : 15 : 10, v/v/v) at a temperature of 25 ± 2 o C. TLC scanner was used for spectrodensitometric scanning and analysis inabsorbance mode at 450 nm. The system was found to give compact spots for astaxanthin, lutein, and b-carotene (R f values of 0. 21, 0. 17 and 0. 97, respectively). The method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, LOD, LOQ and HORRAT value. The linear regression analysis data of astaxanthin, lutein, and b-carotene for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship with r 2 = 0. 999, 0. 998 and 0. 998, respectively, in a concentration range of 0. 01 - 6. 50 ug/spot with respect to the peak area. <b>Precision</b> (% <b>RSDr)</b> of astaxanthin, lutein, and b-carotene was 2. 93, 3. 34, and 2. 61, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 011, 0. 023 and 0. 026 μg/spot, respectively. The additionally limit of quantization (LOQ) was 0. 036, 0. 075 and 0. 085 μg/spot, respectively. The percent recoveries of astaxanthin, lutein, and b-carotene spiked to sample blank showed an average of percent recoveries for astaxanthin (0. 3 - 2. 0 mg/ml) of 91. 70 %, for lutein(0. 2 - 3. 0 mg/ul) of 90. 47 %, and for b-carotene (0. 1 - 1. 0 mg/ul) of 102. 25 %. In all carotenoids, the HORRAT values were below the critical value. Therefore, this method enables simple, rapid, economical and precise quantitative determination of carotenoids in fancy carp serum for evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters. It is possible to use the established method for the routine analysis of carotenoids in serum...|$|R
40|$|Cyclamate {{is widely}} used as intense {{sweetener}} in the European Union. The absence of a maximum limit {{for the use of}} cyclamate in tabletop sweeteners and the growing demand for this type of product highlights the importance of developing robust analytical methods for the determination of its content to understand if the consumption of tabletop sweeteners can {{have a negative impact on}} human health. The present work aimed at the optimisation and validation of an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical method for cyclamate determination in tabletop sweeteners based on the procedure of European Standard EN 12857. The validated method was then applied to the determination of this sweetener in different types of tabletop sweeteners (liquid, powder and tablets). Both standards and samples solutions were submitted to a derivatisation procedure which converted cyclamate to N,N-dichlorocyclohexylamine. The derivatised product was separated and quantified using a reversed-phase column, a mobile phase composed of water (20 %) and methanol (80 %), isocratic flow of 1 mlmin(- 1), and detection by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 314 nm. The analytical method was internally validated according to the following validation parameters: working range, linearity, limits of detection and quantification, sensitivity, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), and uncertainty. This method proved to be specific and selective for the determination of this sweetener, showing repeatability, RSDr 3 %, intermediate <b>precision,</b> <b>RSDR</b> 3. 3 %, and recovery rates from 92 % to 108 % for the different tabletop sweeteners. The method uncertainty was 9. 4 %. The concentration of cyclamate in the samples varied significantly, from 2. 9 % to 73. 9 %, which demonstrated that a possible excessive consumption of one of the analysed sweeteners can lead to exceeding the acceptable daily intake for cyclamate. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

No presente trabalho, um método utilizando cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência foi otimizado e validado para quantificar o LSD em selos apreendidos em Minas Gerais. A linearidade, precisão, recuperação, limites de detecção e quantificação e seletividade foram os parâmetros de desempenho avaliados.
