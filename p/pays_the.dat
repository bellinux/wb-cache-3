5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that <b>pays</b> <b>the</b> medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not have learned the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it <b>pays</b> <b>the</b> hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike.
