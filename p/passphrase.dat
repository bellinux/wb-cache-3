40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a distributed computing platform {{to carry out}} large scale dictionary attacks against cryptosystems compliant to the OpenPGP standard. Moreover, we {{describe a}} simplified mechanism to quickly test <b>passphrases</b> that might protect a specified private key ring. Only <b>passphrases</b> that pass this test complete the (much more time consuming) full validation procedure. This approach greatly reduces {{the time required to}} test a set of possible <b>passphrases.</b> Index Terms — OpenPGP, Volunteer computing, Middleware. I...|$|R
2500|$|Once a user is {{logged on}} successfully, {{access to his}} own EFS {{encrypted}} data requires no additional authentication, decryption happens transparently. Thus, any compromise of the user's password automatically leads to access to that data. Windows can store versions of user account <b>passphrases</b> with reversible encryption, though {{this is no longer}} default behaviour; it can also be configured to store (and will by default on the original version of Windows XP and lower) Lan Manager hashes of the local user account <b>passphrases,</b> which can be attacked and broken easily. It also stores local user account <b>passphrases</b> as NTLM hashes, which can be fairly easily attacked using [...] "rainbow tables" [...] if the passwords are weak (Windows Vista and later versions don't allow weak passwords by default). To mitigate the threat of trivial brute-force attacks on local <b>passphrases,</b> older versions of Windows need to be configured (using the Security Settings portion of Group Policy) to never store LM hashes, and of course, to not enable Autologon (which stores plaintext <b>passphrases</b> in the registry). Further, using local user account <b>passphrases</b> over 14 characters long prevents Windows from storing an LM hash in the SAM – and has the added benefit of making brute-force attacks against the NTLM hash harder.|$|R

25|$|Random {{passwords}} {{consist of}} a string of symbols of specified length taken from some set of symbols using a random selection process in which each symbol is equally likely to be selected. The symbols can be individual characters from a character set (e.g., the ASCII character set), syllables designed to form pronounceable passwords, or even words from a word list (thus forming a <b>passphrase).</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the federal}} {{criminal}} case of United States v. Fricosu addressed whether {{a search warrant}} can compel a person to reveal an encryption <b>passphrase</b> or password. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued {{that this is a}} violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the Fifth Amendment. In 2012, the court ruled that under the All Writs Act, the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.|$|E
25|$|In Windows 2000, XP or later, the user's RSA {{private key}} is {{encrypted}} using a hash of the user's NTLM password hash plus the user name – {{use of a}} salted hash makes it extremely difficult to reverse the process and recover the private key without knowing the user's <b>passphrase.</b> Also, again, setting Syskey to mode 2 or 3 (Syskey typed in during bootup or stored on a floppy disk) will mitigate this attack, since the local user's password hash will be stored encrypted in the SAM file.|$|E

The cables were passed by Assange to his three media partners, plus El País and others, and published in stages from November 28, 2010, {{with the names of}} sources removed. WikiLeaks said it was the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain. WikiLeaks published the remaining cables, unredacted, [...] on September 1, 2011, after David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian inadvertently published the <b>passphrase</b> for a file that was still online; Nicks writes that, consequently, one Ethiopian journalist had to leave his country, and the U.S. government said it had to relocate several sources.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{incident}} in December 2006, (see In re Boucher), involving US customs agents who seized a laptop PC that allegedly contained child pornography, indicates that US government agencies find it [...] "nearly impossible" [...] to access PGP-encrypted files. Additionally, a magistrate judge ruling {{on the case}} in November 2007 has stated that forcing the suspect to reveal his PGP <b>passphrase</b> would violate his Fifth Amendment rights i.e. a suspect's constitutional right not to incriminate himself. The Fifth Amendment issue was opened again as the government appealed the case and a federal district judge ordered the defendant to provide the key.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, after media {{reported}} the hidden pre-installation of Superfish adware on some Lenovo notebooks, a researcher found a trusted root certificate on affected Lenovo machines to be insecure, as the keys {{could easily be}} accessed using the company name, Komodia, as a <b>passphrase.</b> [...] The Komodia library was designed to intercept client-side TLS/SSL traffic for parental control and surveillance, {{but it was also}} used in numerous adware programs, including Superfish, that were often surreptitiously installed unbeknownst to the computer user. In turn, these potentially unwanted programs installed the corrupt root certificate, allowing attackers to completely control web traffic and confirm false web sites as authentic.|$|E
50|$|If <b>passphrases</b> {{are chosen}} by humans {{they are usually}} biased by {{frequency}} of particular words in natural language. In the case of four word phrases, actual entropy rarely exceeds 30 bits. On the other hand, user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that and encouraging users to use even 2-word <b>passphrases</b> {{may be able to}} raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits.|$|R
5000|$|In cryptography, a brute-force attack {{consists}} of an attacker trying many passwords or <b>passphrases</b> {{with the hope of}} eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and <b>passphrases</b> until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.|$|R

After the first few days' release of the US diplomatic cables starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcasting company CBS predicted that [...] "If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files.

50|$|First the <b>passphrase</b> {{and salt}} are hashed together, {{yielding}} an MD5 message digest.

The output of the last of these rounds is the resulting <b>passphrase</b> hash.|$|E

50|$|If {{the words}} or {{components}} of a <b>passphrase</b> {{may be found in}} a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the <b>passphrase</b> is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack. This is a particular issue if the entire phrase {{can be found in a}} book of quotations or phrase compilations. However, the required effort (in time and cost) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the <b>passphrase</b> and how randomly they are chosen and ordered in the <b>passphrase.</b> The number of combinations which would have to be tested under sufficient conditions make a dictionary attack so difficult as to be infeasible. These are difficult conditions to meet, and selecting at least one word that cannot be found in any dictionary significantly increases <b>passphrase</b> strength.|$|E
