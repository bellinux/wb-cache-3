40|$|Alternative {{material}} flow strategies in logistics networks have crucial {{influences on the}} overall performance of the networks. Material flows can follow push, pull, or hybrid systems. To get the advantages of both push and pull flows in networks, the decoupling-point strategy is used as coordination mean. At this point material pull has to get optimized concerning customer orders against pushed replenishment-rates. To compensate the ambiguity and uncertainty of both dynamic flows, fuzzy set theory can practically be applied. This paper has conceptual and mathematical parts to explain {{the performance of the}} push-pull flow strategy in a supply network and to give a novel solution for optimizing the <b>pull</b> <b>side</b> employing Conwip system. Alternative numbers of pallets and their lot-sizes circulating in the assembly system are getting optimized in accordance with a multi-objective problem; employing a hybrid approach out of meta-heuristics (genetic algorithm and simulated annealing) and fuzzy system.

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} in the backward district of Perambalur, which is a less resource-endowed district of Tamil Nadu, with the following objectives: (i) to identify the major causes and empirically determine the key correlates of agricultural labour migration in the study area, and (ii) to identify the causes for rural out-migration. The {{study has been}} conducted by taking landless (group I) and landed (group II) respondents. The Garatte ranking {{of the causes of}} migration has revealed that of the ten push factors and ten pull factors (both economic and non-economic), lack of continuous employment at place of origin is at the first rank with mean score of 77 and 78 per cent for group I and group II, respectively, followed by low wages at place of origin and economic condition of the family. On the <b>pull</b> <b>side</b> also, economic reasons, viz. availability of job at destination has achieved the first rank with mean score of 75 for group I and 74 for group II, followed by hope of getting a job and higher wages. In the case of non-economic reasons, surplus labour availability at places of origin has received maximum scoring on the push side and skill development on the <b>pull</b> <b>side.</b> The study has concluded that though both economic and non-economic reasons are responsible for migration of agricultural labourers, economic reasons are stronger. Not only that, push forces of migration have been identified more strong than pull forces in catalyzing migration. The study has given some policy implications also for consideration of policymakers in Indian agriculture.
