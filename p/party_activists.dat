5|$|In the {{national}} capital, Delhi, {{political and social}} organisations launched street protests and burnt Raj's effigy, while members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Poorvanchal cell held a demonstration demanding that the dismissal of the Maharashtra government. In Allahabad, SP workers tried to obstruct the movement of trains in protest. In Uttar Pradesh's capital, Lucknow, Nationalist Congress <b>Party</b> <b>activists</b> burnt an effigy of Raj. In Patna, capital of Bihar, RJD's youth wing staged a demonstration against Raj and the MNS. Thackeray's effigies were burnt also in Jamshedpur {{in the state of}} Jharkhand.|$|E
5|$|When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he {{authorized}} the decision upholding {{the conviction of}} leaders of the Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist <b>Party</b> <b>activists</b> as unconstitutional in the case of Yates v. United States. Another such case was Watkins v. United States.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his <b>party,</b> <b>activists</b> became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E

5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, {{he found himself in}} a hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with <b>party</b> <b>activists</b> from undisclosed locations.|$|E

25|$|The {{shop steward}} {{movement}} worried many right-wingers, {{who believed that}} socialists were fomenting a Bolshevik revolution in Britain. A Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was founded, but it attracted only existing left-wing militants, with the British Socialist Party and Workers Socialist Federation joining many Socialist Labour <b>Party</b> <b>activists</b> in it.|$|E
25|$|Rubio {{initially}} won his U.S. Senate {{seat with}} strong Tea Party backing, but his 2013 support for {{comprehensive immigration reform}} legislation led {{to a decline in}} that support.

25|$|Events soon {{made the}} MWIU wholly irrelevant. Just as {{the passage of}} the National Industrial Recovery Act had led to a {{spontaneous}} explosion in union membership among coal miners in 1933, thousands of longshoremen now joined the fledgling ILA locals that reappeared on the West Coast. The MWIU faded away as <b>party</b> <b>activists</b> followed the mass of West Coast longshoremen into the ILA.|$|E

25|$|Griffin's BNP also {{established}} an annual Red, White and Blue festival, {{which was based}} on the 'Blue Blanc Rouge' organised by France's National Front. The festival brought <b>party</b> <b>activists</b> together and aimed to promote a more family friendly image for the group, although it also provided a venue for white power skinhead bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord. Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party's 2001 festival.|$|E
25|$|While {{his support}} was strong among the local Virginia <b>party</b> <b>activists</b> who weigh heavily in primaries, {{it was not}} enough to triumph over his late-entering primary opponent, James Webb, who benefited from a strong {{military}} background, the support of well-known blogs such as the Daily Kos, and the endorsements of several national Democratic leaders. These endorsements for Webb, including that of Charles Schumer, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, were unusual for a primary and reflected Webb's perceived strengths as a candidate over Miller's.|$|E
25|$|In Florida, 1964 was {{the year}} when a Republican {{candidate}} for governor polled more than 36.1% in the general election, another sign of changing politics. It was a strong showing for relative newcomer Claude R. Kirk, Jr., a Democrat-turned-Republican from California, as he ran against veteran Democratic U.S. Senator Spessard Holland, the former governor {{and head of the}} Florida Democratic establishment. Trying to build up recognition and support, Kirk appealed to Cramer to address meetings held during the delegate and national committeeman races, and thus became acquainted with Republican <b>party</b> <b>activists.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Food Stamp Plan—a {{major new}} welfare program for urban poor—was {{established}} in 1939 to provide stamps to {{poor people who}} could use them to purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943, but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers and wholesalers, as well as farmers. Thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, however, Tea <b>Party</b> <b>activists</b> in the House tried to end the program, {{now known as the}} Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, while the Senate fought to preserve it.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{strongly}} opposed Obama's 2009 {{economic stimulus package}} and 2010 health care reform bill. The Tea Party movement, formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the Obama administration. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea <b>Party</b> <b>activists,</b> who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as Bob Bennett in Utah and Lisa Murkowski in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} campaign was overshadowed by allegations of planned electoral fraud, irregularities and the controversial involvement of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan {{in the electoral}} process. Numerous politically motivated acts of violence and vandalism targeted <b>party</b> <b>activists,</b> candidates, vehicles and campaign offices. Prospects of electoral fraud was particularly significant during the election, due to the extensive fraud allegations made during the 2014 local elections {{and the fact that}} opinion polls suggested that the governing AKP may lose its parliamentary majority. Various irregularities throughout the campaign, {{such as the use of}} state funds by AKP politicians for campaigning, media bias, forced participation for the government's electoral rallies, incorrect voter data and the use of bogus opinion polls also raised concerns about the fairness of the election.|$|E
