5|$|Admission {{continues}} to be via the Eleven Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme which {{is administered by the}} Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over-subscribed, <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

An agreement was inked with a top school in China, Beijing's The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, in which classrooms will be leased. A total of four batches of students make their way to the campus every year, staying for up to two months. <b>Priority</b> <b>is</b> given to scholars of HCI's Bicultural Studies Programme and Humanities Programme. Students in the campus take lessons together with students from China in partner schools, carry out community involvement activities, and take field trips to cities such as Xi'an, Tianjin and Shanghai.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were (1) to identify older women's health priorities for promoting physical, {{psychological and social}} well-being; and (2) to measure {{the extent to which}} women perceive that their health <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> being met. A qualitative methodology using 3 focus group sessions with 36 community-dwelling women aged 65 year and older was used to elicit older women's health <b>priorities.</b> <b>Priorities</b> <b>were</b> categorized into three groups: disease-related priorities, disability-related priorities, and psychosocial-related <b>priorities.</b> A questionnaire <b>was</b> developed to quantify the extent to which women perceive that these different <b>priorities</b> <b>are</b> being addressed. The survey was administered to a convenience sample of 609 community-based women aged 55 [...] 93 years (mean age 70 +/- 9 years) attending outpatient medical clinics. Unaddressed disability-related <b>priorities</b> <b>were</b> most prevalent. Women aged 75 years and older were significantly less likely to perceive that their <b>priorities</b> <b>were</b> unmet compared to younger mature women (OR 0. 564; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 387 [...] 0. 821) when adjusting for other health and socio-demographic variables. The implications of these findings and opportunities for improving preventive health care for older women are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains {{the energy}} of the {{students}} at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher's stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> to defeat Victor.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{wanted to}} make a game that was cinematic, yet {{distinguished}} from actual films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, says that his top <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> to have the player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real-time computing on the Nintendo 64 console and do not use prerendered full-motion video. Miyamoto's vision required this real-time architecture for the total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes, regardless of whether the console had a vast medium like CD-ROM on which to store prerendered versions. Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game, based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi. He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto said the real-time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust the storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to the final few months of development, instead of waiting on a repeated prerendering process. The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma.|$|E

5|$|The {{settings}} for {{the stories are}} primarily high fantasy worlds, with the producers opting not to use a dark or science fiction-based setting. An exception is Xillia 2, which mostly {{took place in a}} modern setting, and explored darker themes than usual. This direction was confirmed as a one-off experiment for the series. The main characters {{play a key role in}} the Tales games, as it is partially through them that the main theme of each entry is depicted. For Abyss, it was decided to take a risk and create an unorthodox protagonist that would be initially unlikable. For Vesperia, the team opted to raise the age limit of the target audience, showing this in the game by making the main protagonist a more mature type. A female main protagonist was included for the first time in Xillia in the form of Milla Maxwell alongside male protagonist Jude Mathis, although at the time it was stated that there were no solid plans to create a game with a single female protagonist. A sole main female character, called Velvet, was eventually included in Berseria. The way the characters interact with each other during the narrative forms one of the core aspects of designing each game. Another main <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> for players to see a part of themselves in the characters.|$|E
