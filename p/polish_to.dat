5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 {{that he would not be}} returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> the script.|$|E

The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

25|$|Polish dance music, {{especially}} the mazurka and polonaise, were popularized by Frédéric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere. These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms {{are more common}} in the northeast and duple-time dances like the krakowiak come from the south. The polonaise comes from the French word for <b>Polish</b> <b>to</b> identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy, who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called chodzony. The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of Polish music.|$|E
25|$|Blackface was an {{important}} performance tradition in the American theater for roughly 100 years beginning around 1830. It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in The Black and White Minstrel Show, which ended in 1978, and in Are You Being Served?s Christmas specials in 1976 and finally in 1981. In both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later greasepaint or shoe <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface.|$|E

The action sequences, though reminiscent of the game, are not repetitive nor silly. This is a very serious movie and it was treated as such." [...] The Fandom Post agreed saying [...] "the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> the work." [...] Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com. Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes.|$|E

500|$|The first shoe <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> {{resemble}} the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, Kiwi and Wren's. An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was Kiwi. Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making [...] "boot polish" [...] {{in a small}} factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored color. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. Black {{and a range of}} colors became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson.|$|E
500|$|When CD Projekt was founded, {{their biggest}} {{challenge}} was overcoming video game piracy. The company {{was one of}} the first in Poland to localize games; according to Iwiński, most of their products were sold to [...] "mom-and-pop shops". CD Projekt began partial localization for developers such as Seven Stars and Leryx-LongSoft in 1996, and full-scale localization a year later. According to Iwiński, one of their first successful localization titles was for Ace Ventura; whereas previous localizations had only sold copies in the hundreds, Ace Ventura sold in the thousands, establishing the success of their localization approach. With their methods affirmed, CD Projekt approached BioWare and Interplay Entertainment for the Polish localization of Baldur's Gate. They expected the title to become popular in Poland, and no retailer would be able to translate the text from English version to <b>Polish.</b> <b>To</b> increase the title's popularity in Poland, CD Projekt added items to the game's packaging and hired well-known Polish actors to voice its characters. Their first attempt was successful, with 18,000 units shipped on the game's release day (higher than the average shipments of other games at the time).|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with this}} {{perceived}} debasement of his comic book creation, Marvel’s Stan Lee {{pushed for a}} new story and screenplay, written for Cannon by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. The variation on the origin story had Otto Octavius {{as a teacher and}} mentor to a college-aged Peter Parker. The cyclotron accident which [...] "creates" [...] Spider-Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force. [...] "Doc Ock" [...] reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities, anti-gravity effects, and bilocation which threatens to engulf New York City and the world. Joseph Zito, who had directed Cannon’s successful Chuck Norris film Invasion USA, replaced Tobe Hooper. The new director hired Barney Cohen to rewrite the script. Cohen, creator of TV's Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Forever Knight, added action scenes, a non-canonical comic for the villain, gave Doc Ock the catch phrase, [...] "Okey-dokey", and altered his goal from the Fifth Force to a quest for anti-gravity. Producer Golan (using his pen name [...] "Joseph Goldman") then made a minor <b>polish</b> <b>to</b> Cohen's rewrite. Zito scouted locations and studio facilities in both the U.S. and Europe, and oversaw storyboard breakdowns supervised by Harper Goff. Cannon planned to make the film on the then-substantial budget of between $15 and $20million.|$|E
