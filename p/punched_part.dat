For locking the die, T bolts are used and so this plate contain 'T - slots into which t- bolts are slid in. These slots are placed diagonally and with a slot {{horizontal}} to the longer side of the plate, is the general practice. These slots run up to a central hole made in the plate, the hole being large enough to accommodate another bush with a hole, the hole being used for dropping the <b>punched</b> <b>part</b> {{to the bottom of the}} press. The top of the tool butted against a vertical sliding ram with a clamping system which accommodates only a particular diameter of a threaded cylindrical member called the [...] "shank" [...] of the tool. The bottom portion of the tool is locked to the bottom bed plate and the top portion of the tool is locked to the sliding ram. Top and bottom portions of the tool are generally guided by suitable pillar and bush assemblies, which gives safety to the punching elements of the tool.|$|E

Laser machined surface was characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively by means of scanning surface topography instrument. A 20 μm thick aluminum sheet was micro-punched using a testing machine as a drive and a gasket material for support. The gasket followed the micro-punched disk during all the shearing process, collapsing under the punching load. This simple forming process was defined to reduce the micro-part distortion and to avoid the fabrication of a micro-die.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on injection molded polypropylene parts with microchannels and through-holes. The quality of the microchannels and through-holes was observed with optical microscope and SEM images. A part-to-part variation analysis was conducted for ten parts by averaging the channel height, channel width, and hole diameter measurements obtained with an optical profilometer. The results were compared to a research study previously conducted on hot embossed and through-hole <b>punched</b> <b>parts.</b> The walls of the injection molded microchannels were observed to be smoother than the hot embossed microchannels, but ridges were detected on the outmost channels of the injection molded parts which resulted in measurement errors. The through-holes of the injection molded parts formed completely, without burrs or flash, {{in contrast to the}} through-hole <b>punched</b> <b>parts</b> where the quality of the hole varied by the substrate material. The average variance ratio of the channel height and width of the injection molded parts was 0. 83 % and 0. 21 % respectively, when the sites containing ridges (sites 1 and 4 of the top side) {{were not included in the}} calculation. The average channel height variance ratios were approximately the same for injection molding and hot embossing, while injection molding had less than half the variance ratio for the channel width. The hole diameter variance ratios of the injection molded parts averaged 0. 094 %, making it better than the other dimensions. No consistent expansion or shrinkage rate was observed in the injection molded parts, but the hot embossed sites primarily experienced shrinkage. by Nancy Diaz. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{fast growing}} market for micro {{technical}} products requires parts with increasing complexity. While {{sheet metal forming}} enables low cost mass production with short cycle times, it {{is limited by the}} maximum degree of deformation {{and the quality of the}} cut edge. The technology of warm forming partially eliminates these deficiencies. This operation takes place at elevated temperatures before structural transformation is initiated. It combines characteristic advantages of traditional cold and hot forming processes. Lasers as heat sources provide a high, selective and controllable energy input. The general difficulty of a uniform temperature distribution during the heating process can be reached by using an Axicon which generates an annulus on the sheet metal surface. The temperature of the workpiece, measured by a pyrometer, is tuned by a PI-Controller. A tool incorporating a multistage operation die is used for the manufacturing of up to three parts at the same time. The tool is integrated into a hydraulical press.

40|$|From {{industrial}} electrical machine production {{it is well}} known, that {{processing of}} non-oriented electrical steels causes changes in the lattice and microstructure that also affect the magnetic structure. While applying these manufacturing techniques (punching or laser fusion cutting), mechanical and thermal stresses are induced due to elastic and plastic deformation or temperature gradients within the material. For more than 15 years, fusion cutting with CO 2 -lasers enabled a flexible and wear-free production but mostly for prototypes and small batches. Ten years ago, the development of fraction limited solid-state lasers started and thus enabled laser remote cutting. Nowadays, industry demands sheet thicknesses between 0. 35 mm and 0. 5 mm {{due to the fact}} of eddy current loss reduction. Concerning this context, best choice is laser remote cutting (LRC). Within this work, latest results are presented in terms of resulting cutting speed, cutting edge quality and magnetic properties. Cutting speed of LRC beats laser fusion cutting with keeping the high rate of flexibility. The magnetic material properties of laser remote cut laminates are identical or even better to conventional <b>punched</b> <b>parts.</b> Therefore, the manufacturer has been given the possibility to tweak his process towards perfect magnetic behavior or high output volume.

40|$|International audienceSome {{parts of}} {{electrical}} machines are built from stacks of thin steel sheets, {{for which the}} coarse grain microstructure allows for minimizing magnetic losses. The fabrication process of these <b>parts</b> usually involves <b>punching</b> operations that generate important defects on the edges. Since these alterations {{may result in a}} degradation of the fatigue strength, this study aims at elaborating on a fatigue design strategy for such <b>punched</b> <b>parts.</b> To reach this objective, high cycle fatigue tests are performed on different specimens with either punched or polished edges. The results show a significant decrease of the fatigue strength for punched specimens. Scanning electron microscope observations of specimen facture surfaces reveal that defects on punched edges are at the origin of the fatigue cracks. The influence of temperature is also investigated. Fatigue tests are performed at ambient temperature (20 °C) and at 180 °C. According to the experimental results, no significant influence on the median fatigue strength is observed. Since crack initiation always occur on the edges, additional investigations are performed to characterize how edges are altered by punching operations. Residual stresses are determined on punched edges using x-ray diffraction techniques. As a consequence of punching, important tensile residual stresses exist along the loading direction. In association with the stress concentration caused by geometrical defects, residual stresses promote crack initiation and fast crack propagation. For a better understanding of crack initiation, edge geometries are scanned with a 3 D optical profilometer, allowing us to identify the critical defect. It is found that the typical defect size is comparable to the grain size...|$|R

40|$|Abstract——- The {{greatest}} challenge faced by an engineer is {{to overcome the}} energy wasted due to friction in any mechanical process.

This paper introduces the basic construction of an Electromagnetic assisted punching machine to carry out the punching operation. The punching force is generated by an electromagnetic coil wound around a metal core. Since the proposed design replaces Mechanical or hydraulic drive with an electromagnetic actuator, the setup is capable of perfectly controlling the force generated by the controlling the power supplied. The micro punching setup is designed to <b>punch</b> small <b>parts</b> at a precisely controlled rate of power consumption and thus the process becomes a low friction, high efficiency process.

40|$|Abstract. Punching {{portions}} of the sheet are sandwiched between the ceramic billets during rapid resistance heating to prevent hardening of these portions. When the heating temperature is locally {{lower than that of}} the austenitic transformation, i. e. below 800 ºC, this portion is not hardened without occurrence of martensitic transformation, and thus cold <b>punching</b> of hot-stamped <b>parts</b> becomes easy. The ceramic billets are made of alumina and the heat transfers to the billets. The temperature distribution just after resistance heating, the hardness distribution of the hot-stamped sheet, the cold punching load, the quality of the punched hole, etc. were measured. Hardening of punching portions was successfully prevented by sandwiching between the ceramic billets. The cold punching load for the local prevention of hardening was half of that without local prevention and the delayed fracture was also prevented, whereas the drop in hardness around the sheared edge became larger than that for laser cutting...|$|R

As the <b>punch</b> forms the <b>part,</b> the urethane deflects and allows the material to form around the punch. This bending method has a number of advantages.

40|$|Abstract: Multi-point forming (MPF) is an {{advanced}} flexible manufacturing technology for three-dimensional sheet metal forming. The substance of MPF is replacing the conventional solid dies {{by a set}} of discrete punches called ‘‘punch group’’. Because the reconfigurable discrete <b>punches</b> are used, <b>part</b> manufacturing costs are reduced and manufacturing time is shortened. However due to the discrete contacts between the workpiece and punches, the dimple defects occurred, which are inevitable and particular for MPF. For thick plate, the surface defect is the mainly dimple defect during its MPF process. In this study, elastic cushion was proposed to prevent these surface defects. The dynamic explicit finite element method was chosen to implement the simulation of MPF process. The Hill’s anisotropic yield criterion was used to describe the workpiece material behavior, and the elastic cushion was described with using the hyperelastic material model. The method to determine each punch position to construct forming surface was introduced. The MPF process with and without using elastic cushion was simulated to study the effect of the elastic cushion on preventing the surface defects. The relevant experiment was implemented, and it verified that the elastic cushion is effective method to suppress the surface defects during the thick plate MPF process. 1...|$|R
