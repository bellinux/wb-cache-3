5|$|Leaving {{his wife}} Greta {{and their two}} {{children}} in Britain, O'Leary returned to Canada in March 1921 with the purported intention of rejoining the RNWMP, newly renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. For unknown reasons, this plan came to nothing and after some months giving lectures on his war service and working in a publishing house, O'Leary joined the Ontario Provincial Police, charged with enforcing the prohibition laws. In 1924, with his family recently arrived from England, O'Leary left the Ontario police force and became a <b>police</b> <b>sergeant</b> with the Michigan Central Railway in Bridgeburg, Ontario, receiving £33 a month.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research examined the leadership styles {{and professional development}} practices of a police department, the reflective experiences of <b>police</b> <b>sergeants</b> as they transition from being patrol officers, {{and the perception of}} <b>police</b> <b>sergeants</b> of their career development. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following essential questions: (a) What are the self-reported and observed leadership styles and practices of <b>police</b> <b>sergeants</b> at the Echo Bay police department? (b) To what extent do <b>police</b> <b>sergeants</b> practice the tenants of transformational leadership, and (c) How do police departments develop the leadership competencies of their <b>police</b> <b>sergeants.</b> The researcher used four different techniques (a) in-depth interviews, (b) focus groups, (c) direct observations, and (d) a survey as part of the qualitative component of the research and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire as part of its selection activity. The results using a coding process revealed some major themes that indicated that sergeants used idealized attributes, individualized consideration, inspirational motivation; all features of transformational leadership. The studied police department promoted professional development by offering tuition reimbursement, job enhancement, and job enrichment. The research revealed that the police department had an informal talent management system which included: coaching, mentoring, job rotation, and job expansion. The researcher recommended that further research should include the entire command structure (patrol officer to commissioner) and, most importantly, the institutionalization of a talent management system in which patrol officers are exposed to leadership development early in their careers to help navigate the complex law enforcement landscape of the 21 st century...|$|R
5|$|Forensic {{anthropologist}} Clyde Snow {{learned of}} the massacre {{during his visit to}} Zagreb in October 1992. Snow travelled there as a United Nations (UN) team member sent to investigate reports of war crimes. In a meeting Snow had with the dean of the Zagreb University School of Medicine, he was introduced to a former soldier who claimed to have survived the massacre and told Snow where it took place. Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted <b>Police</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull in the mud. A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local <b>police</b> <b>sergeant</b> visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after his}} release, Alfano left Naples and went from village to village to elude arrest. The Carabinieri located him in San Leucio, near Caserta, {{but he managed}} to escape.

He disembarked on March 17, 1907, in New York disguised {{as a member of the}} ship's crew, posing as a stoker. In New York he began to run a gambling den in the basement of 108 Mulberry Street. He became one of the primary underworld targets of <b>police</b> <b>sergeant</b> Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department, who believed Alfano to be a big player in the New York branch of the Camorra.|$|E

5|$|In a Philippines {{rife with}} {{corruption}} and poverty, hitmen Mario (Joel Torre) and Daniel (Gerald Anderson) are prisoners who are frequently released and paid to perform hits for their boss, Thelma (Vivian Velez). Mario spends his earnings on his law school tuition {{for his daughter}} (Empress Schuck), and for his estranged wife, Lulette (Angel Aquino). Daniel, the younger and most reckless partner, pays remittances {{to his family and}} spends the rest on goods and privileges inside prison.

After the pair murder drug lord Tiu and return to prison, Tiu's murder case is assigned to National Bureau of Investigation Agent Francis Coronel (Piolo Pascual) through the agent's father-in-law Congressman Manrique (Michael de Mesa). Coronel's father, also a police officer, died amid rumors of corruption. When Coronel and his partner Bernabe (Rayver Cruz) arrive at the local precinct, they clash with Philippine National <b>Police</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Joaquin Acosta (Joey Marquez), a twenty-year veteran who believes the case was taken from him for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Martyrs– William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien– {{were members}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an {{organisation}} dedicated to ending British rule in Ireland. They were executed for the murder of a police officer in Manchester, England, in 1867, during an incident that became known as the Manchester Outrages. The trio {{were members of}} a group of 30–40Fenians who attacked a horse-drawn police van transporting two arrested leaders of the Brotherhood, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, to Belle Vue Gaol. <b>Police</b> <b>Sergeant</b> Charles Brett, travelling inside with the keys, was shot and killed as the attackers attempted to force the van open by blowing the lock. Kelly and Deasy were released after another prisoner in the van took the keys from Brett's body and passed them to the group outside through a ventilation grill; the pair were never recaptured, despite an extensive search.|$|E

5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A <b>police</b> <b>sergeant</b> was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E
5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a <b>police</b> <b>sergeant,</b> in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A <b>police</b> <b>sergeant</b> tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
