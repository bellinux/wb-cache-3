30|$|Regarding the 13 and 10 {{nucleotide}} variants respectively cloned from human- and mosquito-obtained samples, {{the majority}} of sequences were identical to the consensus sequence. Hu 2 variant which constituted the largest population and was mostly derived from two dengue <b>patients</b> (<b>ID</b> 36 and ID 47). Regarding mosquito-derived sequences, variant m 1 was the master sequence among two mosquito samples (11 of 28 : 8 from mos 275 and 3 from mos 56). Both of the largest populations, hu 2 and m 1, were classified in the same clade (C 1) (Fig.  3). Several other minor variants were identified within this clade: hu 1, hu 3, hu 4, hu 5, m 2, m 3, m 4, m 6, and m 7. Variants hu 6 and hu 7, derived from dengue <b>patients</b> <b>ID</b> 37 and ID 41, were the second and the third most abundant variants, respectively, while m 8 was the second most abundant variant (8 / 28) isolated from mosquito samples. These variants from humans (hu 6 and hu 7) and mosquitoes (m 8) were grouped in clade C 2 together with minor variants m 9 and m 10 (Fig.  3). Among 14 sequences obtained from mos 56, two major lineages, classified into clades C 1 and C 2, {{were responsible for the}} greater variation and higher mean diversity of mos 56 (Tables  1, 2). The third clade (C 3) contained only one variant from mosquitoes (m 5) along with six human variants (hu 8, hu 9, hu 10, hu 11, hu 12, and hu 13) derived from the other two dengue <b>patients</b> (<b>ID</b> 45 and ID 50). Among six dengue patients, three major clusters (C 1, C 2, and C 3), each representing samples from two dengue patients, were clearly identified. Of the six individual dengue <b>patient</b> samples, four (<b>ID</b> 36, 45, 47, and 50) contained three variants (Table  2) and two (ID 37 and ID 41) were represented by identical sequence among all clones analyzed. Consequently, dengue virus quasispecies were present in all individual human samples except for ID 37 and ID 41. To further confirm the existence of dengue quasispecies in human samples, however, a higher number of clonal sequences need to be isolated from each sample.|$|R
40|$|Pneumonia due to {{infection}} with Candida spp. is extremely rare {{even though these}} yeasts are commonly cultured from respiratory secretions. The diagnosis of pneumonia due to Candida spp. should be made only by demonstrating tissue invasion of a biopsy specimen. Physicians might misinterpret the presence of Candida spp. in respiratory secretions as being the etiological agent of pneumonia. This study describes the practice of limiting identification (ID) of rapidly growing yeasts (i. e., Candida spp.) in respiratory secretions {{and its impact on}} patients. Before November 2001, rapidly growing yeasts found in respiratory secretions were identified to the species level. After November, rapidly growing yeasts were reported as “yeasts, not Cryptococcus. ” The group of patients with respiratory secretions processed before November 2001 is called the full ID group (n = 267); the group with samples processed after that date is called the limited ID group (n = 77). Full <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> had an average length of hospital stay of 12. 1 days/patient; that of limited <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> was 10. 1 days/patient, a decrease of 2 days/patient (P = 0. 02). The full <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> had an average cost of $ 9, 407 /patient; that of limited <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> was $ 6, 973 /patient, a decrease of $ 2, 434 /patient (P = 0. 03). Antifungal medications were used in 103 of 267 (39 %) full <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> and in 16 of 77 (21 %) limited <b>ID</b> <b>patients,</b> a decrease of 18 % (P = 0. 004). Limited <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> had a mortality rate of 14. 3 %; that of full <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> was 18. 7 %, a decrease of 4. 4 % (P = 0. 37).

40|$|Intellectual Disability (ID) is {{characterized}} by deficits in intellectual functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, and learning. As new avenues are emerging for treatment of genetically determined ID (such as Down's syndrome or Fragile X syndrome), {{it is necessary to}} identify objective reliable and sensitive outcome measures for use in clinical trials. We developed a novel visual analogical reasoning paradigm, inspired by the Progressive Raven's Matrices, but appropriate for Intellectually Disabled patients. This new paradigm assesses reasoning and inhibition abilities in <b>ID</b> <b>patients.</b> We performed behavioural analyses for this task (with a reaction time and error rate analysis, Study 1) in 96 healthy controls (adults and typically developed children older than 4) and 41 genetically determined <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> (Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome and ARX mutated patients). In order to establish and quantify the cognitive strategies used to solve the task, we also performed an eye-tracking analysis (Study 2). Down syndrome, ARX and Fragile X patients were significantly slower and made significantly more errors than chronological age-matched healthy controls. The effect of inhibition on error rate was greater than the matrix complexity effect in <b>ID</b> <b>patients,</b> opposite to findings in adult healthy controls. Interestingly, <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> were more impaired by inhibition than mental age-matched healthy controls, but not by the matrix complexity. Eye-tracking analysis made it possible to identify the strategy used by the participants to solve the task. Adult healthy controls used a matrix-based strategy, whereas <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> used a response-based strategy. Furthermore, etiologic-specific reasoning differences were evidenced between <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> groups. We suggest that this paradigm, appropriate for <b>ID</b> <b>patients</b> and developmental populations as well as adult healthy controls, provides an objective and quantitative assessment of visual analogical reasoning and cognitive inhibition, enabling testing for the effect of pharmacological or behavioural intervention in these specific populations...|$|R

Method: Eighty-three nurses, working in oncology or a related field (i. e. palliative care) were recruited. Perceptions of caring for patients with and without an ID were measured, alongside potentially confounding information about participant demographic characteristics and perceived stress. Results: Participants felt less comfortable communicating with <b>patients</b> with an <b>ID</b> about their illness (F(1, 82) = 59. 52, p < 0. 001), more reliant on a caregiver for communication (F(1, 82) = 26. 29, p < 0. 001), and less confident that the patient's needs would be identified (F(1, 82) = 42. 03, p < 0. 001) and met (F(1, 81) = 62. 90, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Patient {{identification}} (ID) {{errors in}} point-of-care testing (POCT) can cause test results {{to be transferred}} to the wrong patient′s chart or prevent results from being transmitted and reported. Despite the implementation of patient barcoding and ongoing operator training at our institution, <b>patient</b> <b>ID</b> errors still occur with glucose POCT. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a solution to reduce identification errors with POCT. Materials and Methods: Glucose POCT was performed by approximately 2, 400 clinical operators throughout our health system. Patients are identified by scanning in wristband barcodes or by manual data entry using portable glucose meters. Meters are docked to upload data to a database server which then transmits data to any medical record matching the financial number of the test result. With a new model, meters connect to an interface manager where the <b>patient</b> <b>ID</b> (a nine-digit account number) is checked against patient registration data from admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) feeds and only matched results are transferred to the patient′s electronic medical record. With the new process, the <b>patient</b> <b>ID</b> is checked prior to testing, and testing is prevented until ID errors are resolved. Results: When averaged over a period of a month, ID errors were reduced to 3 errors/month (0. 015 %) in comparison with 61. 5 errors/month (0. 319 %) before implementing the new meters. Conclusion: <b>Patient</b> <b>ID</b> errors may occur with glucose POCT despite patient barcoding. The verification of patient identification should ideally take place at the bedside before testing occurs so that the errors can be addressed in real time. The introduction of an ADT feed directly to glucose meters reduced <b>patient</b> <b>ID</b> errors in POCT...|$|E

The allele and genotype frequency were significantly different between the patients with diabetic nephropathy and control groups (p< 0. 001). In the nephropathic <b>patients,</b> <b>ID</b> and DD genotypes were present in 37. 2 and 40. 6 % of patients respectively as compared to 42. 4 and 21. 2 % in those of control groups. The D allele was present in 55. 5 % of the nephropathic patients and 44. 4 % of the normal controls. Therefore, percentage of DD genotype and D allele was significantly higher in nephropathic patients compared to normal controls...|$|R
