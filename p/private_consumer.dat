In pointed contrast to Reinhold Wagnleitner's Coca-colonization and the Cold War (1994) and Victoria de Grazia's Irresistible Empire (2005), Logemann argues that, for all the noisy commentary, pro and con, about postwar Americanization, West Germans shaped their version of the affluent society according to deeply held and distinctly un-American values. Rather than a sweeping homogenization of the developed world, postwar affluence ran along [...] "different paths to consumer modernity"....Instead of the [...] "consumer-as-citizen" [...] (whom Lizabeth Cohen, in The Consumer's Republic 2003, defined as the main social type in postwar America), West Germans promoted the social consumer who practiced [...] "public consumption," [...] which Logemann defines as [...] "the provision of publicly funded alternatives to <b>private</b> <b>consumer</b> goods and services in areas ranging from housing to transportation or entertainment" [...] (p. 5).|$|E

We find that business customers have a higher elasticity of demand than <b>private</b> <b>consumers,</b> where postpaid customers {{tend to have a}} higher demand elasticity than prepaid customers.

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to research}} the <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception and to analyse the impact acquisition in private banking has or might have on <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception. A literature review discovered that existing {{research in the field}} of <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception is relatively rare and no studies were discovered that dealt with <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception and, in particular, the influence of an acquisition. In addition to that, <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception is not defined by any literature. Hence, there is a gap in existing literature and the literature review resulted in research questions which were analysed and discussed by gathering primary data. A holistic case study based on the Swiss and German private banking market was used to gather primary data. This type of case study offers the researcher a holistic view(Patton, 1990) on the present subject as it considers all parties which have an influence on the topic under investigation. The first phase of the case study consisted of nonparticipant observation at a finance fair. <b>Private</b> banking <b>consumers,</b> relationship managers and consultants were observed. In the next phase semi-structured interviews were undertaken with relationship managers, banking managers, private banking clients and lawyers. Both phases were qualitative in its nature. Based on the findings it was established that <b>private</b> banking <b>consumers</b> have expectations on private banking. If the private banking service provider is able to fulfil or exceed these expectations the client perceives this as "satisfaction". Determinants of <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception were elicited. These determinants are defined as categories and sub-categories of different criteria used by the consumer to evaluate a perceived service. Apart from that, the research findings revealed that acquisition can influence all <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception determinants depending on the context of the acquisition. The independent advice of private banks as well as retaining the relationship manager was found to be of primary concern to the clients during an acquisition process. A model of <b>private</b> banking <b>consumer</b> perception was developed from the primary data results. With the knowledge gained from this research private banks are better able to understand bank consumers’ expectations and perceptions. This contributes to higher levels of competitiveness for banks as customers’ needs can be better met, and client movements during an acquisition process reduced...|$|R

40|$|This Note {{discusses}} first, {{whether the}} judicially created public interest {{element of a}} <b>private</b> <b>consumer</b> protection case can be justified by {{the language of the}} Consumer Protection Act and, second, assuming some justification for the element can be found, whether the public interest test, as delineated in Anhold v.

Safeco Title Insurance Co. serves a purpose intended by the legislature. ” This Note concludes that the public interest element is unnecessary because it hinders and often prevents consumer litigation of private damage actions under the Act. Moreover, the public interest element cannot be justified by any other policy reason. The legislature should take action to clarify, for the courts and the public, what elements of proof are to be required of a <b>private</b> <b>consumer</b> who brings a suit under the Washington Consumer Protection Act. Specifically, the legislature should eliminate the judicially created public interest requirement and legislate clear criteria for determining whether a particular consumer’s cause of action will fall within the Consumer Protection Act...|$|E
