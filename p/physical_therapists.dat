Other studies showed LVA surgeries reduce the severity of lymphedema in breast cancer patients. In particular, a clinical study of 1,000 cases of lymphedema treated with microsurgery from 1973 to 2006 showed beneficial results.

500|$|People with Huntington's {{disease may}} see a {{physical}} therapist for non-invasive and non-medication-based ways of managing the physical symptoms. <b>Physical</b> <b>therapists</b> may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. Walking aids may be prescribed as appropriate. <b>Physical</b> <b>therapists</b> also prescribe breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques {{with the development of}} respiratory problems. Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington's disease have been produced by the European HD Network. Goals of early rehabilitation interventions are prevention of loss of function. Participation in rehabilitation programs during early to middle stage of the disease may be beneficial as it translates into long term maintenance of motor and functional performance. [...] Rehabilitation during the late stage aims to compensate for motor and functional losses. For long-term independent management, the therapist may develop home exercise programs for appropriate people.|$|E
