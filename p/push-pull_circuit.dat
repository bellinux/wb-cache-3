The symmetrical <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit</b> cancels out and reduces even-order distortion products compared with a single-ended circuit.

5000|$|Using modern passive components, {{and modern}} sources, whether digital or analogue, and wide band loudspeakers, it is {{possible}} to have tube amplifiers with the characteristic wide bandwidth and [...] "fast" [...] sound of modern transistor amplifiers, including using <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuits,</b> class AB, and feedback. Some enthusiasts, such as Nelson Pass, have built amplifiers using transistors and MOSFETs that operate in class A, including single ended, and these often have the [...] "tube sound." ...|$|R
50|$|In analog {{push-pull}} {{power amplifiers}} the two output devices operate in antiphase (i.e. 180° apart). The two antiphase outputs {{are connected to}} the load in a way that causes the signal outputs to be added, but distortion components due to non-linearity in the output devices to be subtracted from each other; if the non-linearity of both output devices is similar, distortion is much reduced. Symmetrical <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuits</b> must cancel even order harmonics, like f2, f4, f6 and therefore promote odd order harmonics, like (f1), f3, f5 when driven into the nonlinear range.|$|R
5000|$|It {{had higher}} {{inherent}} intermodulation distortion than the pentode. It {{could be reduced}} by adopting an ultra-linear design in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit.</b> This connection links the screen grids to taps on the output transformer. Negative feedback also reduced harmonic and intermodulation distortion.|$|E
50|$|Most modern valve guitar {{amplifiers}} use a class AB1 <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit</b> {{with a pair}} {{of power}} pentodes or beam tetrodes, 6L6 or EL34 but occasionally KT88, 6550, or the lower-power EL84 in Ultra-Linear connection. The output stage is preceded by a voltage amplification stage (pentode or twin triode) and a phase-splitter (twin triode). Twin triodes with two identical sections in one envelope are used, usually the noval types 12AT7, 12AU7, or 12AX7 or equivalents, less usually the octal 6SN7.|$|E
50|$|Power-frequency {{transformers}} {{may have}} taps at intermediate {{points on the}} winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as arc furnace transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit.</b> Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the tube}} was {{intended}} for operation in VHF circuits, such as TV sets and FM tuners, as an oscillator/frequency converter, but it also found wide use in audio as a driver and phase-inverter in vacuum tube <b>push-pull</b> amplifier <b>circuits.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Push-pull</b> <b>circuits</b> {{are widely}} used in many {{amplifier}} output stages. A pair of audion tubes connected in push-pull is described in Edwin H. Colpitts' US patent 1137384 granted in 1915, although the patent does not specifically claim the push-pull connection. The technique was well-known at that time [...] and the principle had been claimed in an 1895 patent predating electronic amplifiers. Possibly the first commercial product using a push-pull amplifier was the RCA Balanced amplifier released in 1924 for use with their Radiola III regenerative broadcast receiver. [...] By using a pair of low-power vacuum tubes in push-pull configuration, the amplifier allowed {{the use of a}} loudspeaker instead of headphones, while providing acceptable battery life with low standby power consumption. The technique continues to be used in audio, radio frequency, digital and power electronics systems today.|$|R
5000|$|The long-tailed pair was {{developed}} from earlier knowledge of <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit</b> techniques and measurement bridges. An early circuit which closely resembles a long-tailed pair {{was published by}} British neurologist Bryan Matthews in 1934, and {{it seems likely that}} this was intended to be a true long-tailed pair but was published with a drawing error. The earliest definite long-tailed pair circuit appears in a patent submitted by Alan Blumlein in 1936. By the end of the 1930s the topology was well established and had been described by various authors including Frank Offner (1937), [...] Schmitt (1937) and Jan Friedrich Toennies (1938) and it was particularly used for detection and measurement of physiological impulses.|$|E
50|$|A {{push-pull}} converter {{is a type}} of DC-to-DC converter, a switching converter {{that uses}} a transformer to change the voltage of a DC power supply. The distinguishing feature of a push-pull converter is that the transformer primary is supplied with current from the input line by pairs of transistors in a symmetrical <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit.</b> The transistors are alternately switched on and off, periodically reversing the current in the transformer. Therefore current is drawn from the line during both halves of the switching cycle. This contrasts with buck-boost converters, in which the input current is supplied by a single transistor which is switched on and off, so current is only drawn from the line during half the switching cycle. During the other half the output power is supplied by energy stored in inductors or capacitors in the power supply. Push-pull converters have steadier input current, create less noise on the input line, and are more efficient in higher power applications.|$|E
40|$|A {{servo-motor}} as {{an element}} of automatic control system requires good efficiency, {{but it is more}} important to have a fast response to an input signal. This paper discribes the combinational circuit of thyristor and flip-flop, and on-off control servomotor by the thyristor that inserted to the control phase. The thyristor is controled by pulse that originated from the saturable reactor. Outline of the paper is as follow, 1. From the equivalent circuit of half-wave <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit,</b> the optimum leading capacity of control phase has been calculated and compared with the experiments. 2. Experiments on full-wave <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit</b> has been performed and a circuit improvement has been dicussed. 3.

5000|$|There is no valve analog of the {{complementary}} devices {{widely used in}} [...] "totem pole" [...] output stages of silicon <b>circuits.</b> <b>Push-pull</b> valve topologies therefore require a phase splitter.|$|R
40|$|SummaryPheromone {{responses}} are highly context dependent. For example, the C.  elegans pheromone ascaroside C 9 (ascr# 3) is repulsive to wild-type hermaphrodites, attractive to wild-type males, and usually neutral to “social” hermaphrodites with reduced {{activity of the}} npr- 1 neuropeptide receptor gene. We show here that these distinct behavioral responses arise from overlapping <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuits</b> driven by two classes of pheromone-sensing neurons. The ADL sensory neurons detect C 9 and, in wild-type hermaphrodites, drive C 9 repulsion through their chemical synapses. In npr- 1 mutant hermaphrodites, C 9 repulsion is reduced by the recruitment of a gap junction circuit that antagonizes ADL chemical synapses. In males, ADL sensory {{responses are}} diminished; in addition, a second pheromone-sensing neuron, ASK, antagonizes C 9 repulsion. The additive effects of these antagonistic circuit elements generate attractive, repulsive, or neutral pheromone responses. Neuronal modulation by circuit state and sex, and flexibility in synaptic output pathways, may permit small circuits to maximize their adaptive behavioral outputs...|$|R
50|$|Mainstream modern {{loudspeakers}} give good {{sound quality}} in a compact size, but {{are much less}} power-efficient than older designs and require powerful amplifiers to drive them. This makes them unsuitable for use with valve amplifiers, particularly lower-power single-ended designs. Valve hi-fi power amplifier designs since the 1970s have had to move mainly to class AB1 <b>push-pull</b> (PP) <b>circuits.</b> Tetrodes and pentodes, sometimes in ultra-linear configuration, with significant negative feedback, are the usual configuration.|$|R

Push-pull amplifiers display drain efficiencies > 40 %, output power > 5 W over a bandwidth of 3. 5 to 8. 5 GHz at 2 dB compression levels, and under CW conditions.

40|$|A {{new form}} of magnetically coupled DC/DC {{converter}} is proposed for medium power applications (250 W to 2 kW), requiring a high-voltage gain, short inductive charging time and galvanic isolation. The proposed converter can be realised using a unique Y-source impedance network and a two-switch <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit</b> with voltage-doubling rectification. The converter's voltage gain is presently not matched by any other converter operating at the same switch duty ratio.

5000|$|Class-A designs can {{be simpler}} than other classes insofar as class -AB and -B designs require two {{connected}} devices in the <b>circuit</b> (<b>push-pull</b> output), each to handle {{one half of}} the waveform whereas class A can use a single device (single-ended).|$|R

50|$|Negative {{feedback}} (NFB) {{was invented}} by Harold Stephen Black in 1927, but initially little used since at that time gain was at a premium. This technique allows amplifiers to trade gain for reduced distortion levels (and also gave other benefits such as reduced output impedance). The introduction of the Williamson amplifier in 1947, which was extremely advanced in many respects including very successful use of NFB, {{was a turning point}} in audio power amplifier design, operating a <b>push-pull</b> output <b>circuit</b> in class AB1 to give performance surpassing its contemporaries.|$|R

40|$|A 2 K-gate DCFL GaAs {{gate array}} has been {{successfully}} fabricated with a WN gate self-alignment GaAs MESFET process. Chip size was 4. 59 mm× 4. 73 mm. A basic cell, consisting of one DFET and three EFET’s, can be programmed as an inverter or a two or three-INPUT NOR gate by personalizing with first- and second-level interconnection and via hole masks. The I/O buffer was implemented with a large DCFL <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit.</b> The unloaded propagation delay time was 42 ps/gate at a power dissipation of 0. 5 mW/gate. The increases in delay time due to various loading capacitances were 11 -ps/fan-in, 16 -ps/fan-out, 59 -ps/ 1 -mm interconnection and 0. 95 ps/crossover (area: 2 μm× 3 μm).

40|$|This work {{presents}} a monolithically-integrated power circuit {{with a single}} control input gate driver based on depletion-mode logic and a 600 V, 150 mOMEGA power HEMT in GaNon- Si technology. The gate driver final-stage is a <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuit,</b> in which the pull-up transistor is indirectly driven through a depletion-load logic inverter, whereas the pull-down transistor is directly driven by the single external control input. Measurements of soft- and hard-switching turn-on transitions in an inductive-load half-bridge at 300 V/ 4 A demonstrate controllability of the turn-on speed by adding an external speedup resistor in parallel to the depletion-load. Gate-charge measurements show a 25 -fold reduction of external pre-driver drive capability requirement during a 400 V turn-on transition, since the main power transistor gate-charge (8. 5 nC) -related losses are provided and dissipated within the GaN power device, and only the pull-down gate driver transistor gate-charge of 0. 34 nC has to be provided externally by the pre-driver circuit...|$|E
50|$|The tube {{is popular}} in hi-fi vacuum tube audio as a low-noise line {{amplifier}}, driver (especially for tone stacks), and phase-inverter in vacuum tube <b>push-pull</b> amplifier <b>circuits.</b> It was widely used, in special-quality versions such as E82CC and 5814A, in pre-semiconductor digital computer circuitry. Use of special-quality versions {{outside of the}} purpose they were designed for may not be optimal; for example, a version for digital computers may be designed for long life without cathode poisoning when mostly switched to low-current mode in switching applications, but with little attention to parameters of interest only for linear applications such as linearity of transfer characteristic, matching between the two sections, microphony, etc.|$|R
5000|$|An {{exception}} to the general rule may {{be made in the}} case of [...] "push-pull", or balanced circuits. A pair of tubes, driven by identical signals 180 degrees out of phase, may share a common unbypassed cathode resistor. Slight differences in tube conduction are then dynamically balanced by bias variations that tend to reduce distortion. This technique is useful in the input circuits of balanced line receivers or <b>push-pull</b> power output <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work reports an {{approach}} to study complementary pairs of bipolar junction transistors, often used in <b>push-pull</b> <b>circuits</b> typically found at the output stages of operational amplifiers. After the data is acquired and pre-processed, an Early modeling approach is applied to estimate the two respective parameters (the Early voltage V_a and the proportionality parameter s). A voting procedure, inspired on the Hough transform image analysis method, is adopted to improve the identification of V_a. Analytical relationships are derived between the traditional parameters current gain (β) and output resistance (R_o) and the two Early parameters. It is shown that β tends to increase with the magnitude of V_a and s, while R_o depends only on V_a, varying linearly with this parameter. Several interesting results are obtained with respect to 7 pairs of complementary BJTs, each represented by 10 samples. First, we have that the considered BJTs occupy a restricted region along the Early parameter space, and also that the NPN and PNP groups are mostly segregated into two respective regions in this space. In addition, PNP devices tended to present an intrinsically larger parameter variation. The NPN group has higher V_a magnitude and smaller s than PNP devices. PNP transistors yielded larger R_o and slightly smaller β than NPN transistors. A pattern recognition method was employed to obtain a linear separatrix between the NPN and PNP groups in the Early space and the respective average parameters were used to estimate respective prototype devices. Two complementary pairs of the real-world BJTs with large and small parameters differences were used in three configurations of push pull circuits, and the respective total harmonic distortions were measured and discussed, indicating a definite influence of parameter matching on the results.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} synthesizing Class AB log-domain filters that satisfy dynamic differential-mode and common-mode constraints simultaneously.

40|$|How {{does the}} {{cortical}} circuitry analyze the visual scene? Here we explore the earliest levels of striate cortical processing: the first stage, where orientation sensitivity emerges, {{and the second}} stage, where stimulus selectivity is further refined. The approach is whole-cell recording from cat in vivo. Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus have circular receptive fields whose subregions, center and surround are concentrically arranged and have the reverse sign, on or off. These neurons supply cortical simple cells, whose receptive fields have on and off subregions that are elongated and lie side by side. Feedforward models hold that orientation sensitivity depends on this thalamocortical change in receptive field structure and an arrangement within subregions such that stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke synaptic responses of the opposite polarity—push–pull. Our work provides support for feedforward models and emphasizes that push–pull is key in the geniculostriate pathway, preserved from retina by thalamic relay cells and reiterated, point by point, by cortical simple cells. Also, we help define the cortical <b>push–pull</b> <b>circuit</b> by identifying inhibitory simple cells. Lastly, separate experiments that compare {{the first and second}} levels of cortical processing suggest that differences in the synaptic physiology of connections at the two (thalamocortical versus intracortical) stages underlie differential selectivity for properties such as motion...|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternate}} to the long-tail pair, the concertina uses a single triode as a variable resistance within a potential divider formed by Ra and Rk {{either side of}} the valve. The result is that the voltage at the anode swings exactly and opposite to the voltage at the cathode, giving a perfectly balanced phase split. the disadvantage of this stage (cf the differential long-tail pair) {{is that it does not}} give any gain. Using a double triode (typically octal or noval) to form a SET input buffer (giving gain) to then feed a concertina phase splitter is a classic push-pull front end, typically followed by a driver (triode) and (triode or pentode) output stage (in ultra linear in many cases) to form the classic <b>push-pull</b> amplifier <b>circuit.</b>|$|R
