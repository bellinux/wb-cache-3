40|$|A <b>Pilot</b> <b>Study</b> to {{evaluate}} methods {{for measuring the}} contribution of UF-bonded building materials to indoor formaldehyde concentrations in newly constructed conventional and manufactured houses was recently conducted by the U.

The <b>Pilot</b> <b>Study</b> followed scientifically designed protocols and evaluated indoor formaldehyde concentrations in a newly constructed, conventionally built, single-family house that contained two different combinations of UF- bonded building materials with known emission characteristics. Higher than expected expenditures in the conventional house resulted in the cancellation of the manufactured housing portion of the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Study.</b> The UF-bonded building materials used in the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Study</b> were fully characterized; environmental conditions in the house were carefully controlled and recorded; and indoor concentrations were measured on a regular basis. 2 Results of the <b>Pilot</b> <b>Study</b> show that initial indoor formaldehyde concentrations in the house...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to define a <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> as a preparatory sociological {{research}} of a special character, having in view the principal research in which questionnaire interviews are used. Explication {{of the concept of}} a <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> is done by pointing to the subject of a <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> as well as to special problems formulated with respect to that subject. A set of questions addressed to respondents and a set of ways these questions are used by interviewers in interviews — are considered to constitute the subject of a <b>pilot</b> <b>study.</b> As special problems of a <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> have been accepted those relating to the correctness of questions addressed to respondents {{as well as of the}} ways these questions are used in an interview. On this basis a <b>pilot</b> <b>study</b> is distinguished from other preparatory studies such as a „reconnaissance” study and a „trial” study. Construed in this way the meaning of the term „pilot study” would be closest to the concept of pretest. All three types of studies can be treated as three consecutive phases preceding a questionnaire-based research...|$|R

25|$|A person's {{strategies}} to respond or {{react to a}} stimulus, and to solve problems, often change over time and over tasks. This generates variations in neural activity from trial to trial within a subject. Across people too neural activity differs for similar reasons. Researchers often conduct <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> to see how participants typically perform for the task under consideration. They also often train subjects how to respond or react in a trial training session prior to the scanning one.|$|E
25|$|Data {{from the}} American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) {{indicate}} that treatment {{for individuals with}} right hemisphere damage tends to focus on areas other than communication, including swallowing, memory, and problem solving. Deficits in language expression, language comprehension, and pragmatics are addressed much less frequently (in 22%, 23%, and 5% of individuals, respectively). The lack of research focusing on communication treatment is cited as a possible explanation for these low percentages. Small-scale and <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> have been conducted {{in recent years to}} fill the identified gaps in the treatment literature. Emerging evidence is discussed below.|$|E

In November 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved large-scale phase 3 clinical trials involving the use of MDMA {{for the treatment of}} PTSD in individuals who do not respond to traditional prescription drugs or psychotherapy. MDMA has also been proposed as an adjunct to substance abuse treatment. In 2017, doctors in the UK began the first clinical study of MDMA in alcohol addiction.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 950 {{students}} {{per year}} participate in educational programs abroad, and nearly 1,300 foreign students and scholars {{from more than}} 85 countries are engaged in academic work and research on campus. The initial <b>pilot</b> <b>studies</b> for the Peace Corps were conducted by Colorado State faculty, and the university is consistently one of the top-ranking institutions in the nation for the recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers. Since 1988, CSU and the Peace Corps have participated in four cooperative master's degree programs in English, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Natural Resources, and Agriculture. The program involves at least 2 semesters of course work at CSU combined with time abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer. Colorado State offers various programs on campus for students interested in international issues. Regional specializations with core courses and electives are available in Asian Studies, Middle East/North Africa Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central Europe Studies. The Global Village Living Learning Community is a housing option for students with international interests.|$|E
