5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, anatomical {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and <b>penetrating</b> head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A <b>penetrating,</b> or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of <b>penetrating</b> {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife wounds and {{shrapnel}} from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within the chest are deep and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from <b>penetrating</b> trauma occurs within the chest. Injury to the cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (front) part of the trachea.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 66 plants in 50 species were inoculated with eggs and juveniles of soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Roots were stained and {{observed}} for penetration {{and development of}} the nematode. Twenty-six plants were not penetrated; twenty-three were <b>penetrated,</b> but there was no development of the nematode; eight were <b>penetrated</b> with some nematode development; two were <b>penetrated</b> and had considerable nematode development, but few nematodes, if any, matured; and seven were <b>penetrated</b> with many nematodes maturing. The penetration of nonhosts may imply some susceptibility and that populations eventually would build up on the <b>penetrated</b> plants. Plants not <b>penetrated</b> may be useful as rotation plants because no reproduction would occur...|$|R
5|$|The new {{cartridge}} was to {{have greater}} range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, {{it was to be}} capable of <b>penetrating</b> body armor.|$|E
5|$|A mutualistic {{association}} {{similar to}} ectomycorrhiza {{but with some}} hyphae <b>penetrating</b> into the plant root cells, termed arbutoid mycorrhiza, is formed by Russulaceae with shrubs of the genera Arbutus and Arctostaphylos, both in subfamily Arbutoideae of the Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} blasting technique called <b>Penetrating</b> Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the remedial works process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E
50|$|While it is {{theoretically}} {{possible for}} Li-Fi {{to be used}} in underwater applications, its utility is limited by the distance light can <b>penetrate</b> water. Significant amounts of light do not <b>penetrate</b> further than 200 meters. Past 1000 meters, no light <b>penetrates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M430 and M430A1 are 40×53mm HEDP {{cartridges}} {{akin to the}} low-velocity M433. They {{differ in}} how much armor they can <b>penetrate,</b> with the M430 being able to <b>penetrate</b> 51 mm of steel plate, and the M430A1 being able to <b>penetrate</b> 76 mm.|$|R
50|$|The Type I could <b>penetrate</b> 250mm of armour, {{whereas the}} lighter Type II could <b>penetrate</b> 150mm of armour.|$|R
5|$|Fanny {{opened the}} door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly {{described}} as a neck brace) prevented the blade from <b>penetrating</b> his jugular vein. He eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face.|$|E
5|$|If I Be Lifted Up– Christ {{is portrayed}} in the clouds, with light {{radiating}} from behind His head as the <b>penetrating</b> eyes seem to follow the viewer around the nave. An extra layer of mottled glass behind the clouds was used by Tiffany.|$|E
5|$|Post-crash {{analysis}} of the crack surfaces showed {{the presence of a}} <b>penetrating</b> fluorescent dye used to detect cracks during maintenance. The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present and should have been detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E

5|$|The Mk.8 APC (Armor-Piercing, Capped) shell weighed 2,700lb (1225kg) and was {{designed}} to <b>penetrate</b> the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships. At 20,000yards (18km) the Mk.8 could <b>penetrate</b> 20inches (500mm) of steel armor plate. At the same range, the Mk.8 could <b>penetrate</b> 21feet (6.4m) of reinforced concrete.|$|R
5000|$|Rape is a {{statutory}} offence in England and Wales. According to the law, rape {{occurs when}} one person <b>penetrates</b> another with their penis {{without the consent}} of the person being <b>penetrated.</b> If a victim is forcefully <b>penetrated</b> with an object, this is classed as [...] "Sexual Assault by Penetration".|$|R
5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of <b>penetrating</b> the armor of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.|$|E
5|$|The contact call {{is a very}} quiet, {{thin and}} high-pitched sit, but the most {{distinctive}} call is a <b>penetrating</b> tsree, with a vibrato quality, sometimes repeated {{as a series of}} notes. The male's song begins with srrih, srrih followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{findings from the}} ice survey were a positive reading from the metal detector, coupled with a significant echo from the Ground <b>Penetrating</b> Radar, both from the small area where the frame is assumed to have sunk.|$|E

5|$|Tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is {{damage to}} the tracheobronchial tree (the airway {{structure}} involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or <b>penetrating</b> trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.|$|E
5|$|Tungsten's many alloys have {{numerous}} applications, including {{incandescent light}} bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in <b>penetrating</b> projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts.|$|E

5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. Virginia did not open fire {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland. Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without <b>penetrating,</b> although later some of Cumberlands payload lightly damaged Virginia.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with <b>penetrating</b> trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the <b>penetrating</b> injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E

50|$|Pycnidiospores are {{released}} during rainy periods. When the spores {{make contact with}} wounds or broken branches, they germinate and <b>penetrate</b> deep into the tree to produce cankers. Infection hyphae typically <b>penetrates</b> through the parenchyma phloem intracellularly {{but they can also}} <b>penetrate</b> intercellularly through uni and multiceliate xylem ray cells and paranchyma cells. Later, the fungus will produce mycelial mats of stroma and mycelial pegs.|$|R
