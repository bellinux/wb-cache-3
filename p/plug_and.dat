5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} no speaker audio for {{services}} like web radio even though the speaker works fine when used as a telephone. This error {{may be due to}} a malfunctioning switch sensing the headphone <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> different handling of this information by different apps.|$|E
5|$|The {{connector}} {{mounted on}} the host or device is called the receptacle, and the connector attached to the cable is called the plug. The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term male to represent the <b>plug,</b> <b>and</b> female to represent the receptacle.|$|E
5000|$|The Swiss {{standard}} SN SEV 1011:2009 <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> socket-outlets {{for household}} and similar purposes. defines a hierarchical system of <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets including both single and three phase connectors. Sockets will accept plugs {{with the same}} or fewer number of pins and the same or lower ratings. Single phase Swiss <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets are described in AC power <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets ...|$|R
50|$|Lewden <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets are metal bodied {{waterproof}} <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets made by Lewden. The pin {{arrangements of}} the smaller single phase varieties {{are the same as}} BS 1363 <b>and</b> BS 546 <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets. These <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets will mate with normal <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets of the same pin arrangement but they are only waterproof when a Lewden plug is used in a Lewden socket and the screw ring is properly tightened (sockets have a metal cover that screws on to waterproof them when not in use).|$|R

5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> may do so either immediately or after several hours.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
2500|$|A Statutory Instrument, the <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1987 was {{introduced}} to specifically regulate <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech <b>plug,</b> <b>and</b> reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E

5|$|USB 3.0 {{introduced}} Type-A SuperSpeed <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> receptacles {{as well as}} micro-sized Type-B SuperSpeed <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> receptacles. The 3.0 receptacles are backward-compatible {{with the}} corresponding pre-3.0 plugs.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{standards}} {{based on two}} round pins with centres spaced at 19mm are in use in continental Europe and elsewhere, {{most of these are}} listed in IEC/TR 60083 <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. There is no European Union regulation of domestic mains <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets, the Low Voltage Directive specifically excludes domestic <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets. EU countries each have their own regulations and national standards, for example some require child-resistant shutters, others do not. CE marking is neither applicable nor permitted on <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} Windows 2000 marked {{a shift in}} the user {{experience}} between the Windows 9x series and the Windows NT series. Windows NT 4 suffered from a lack of support for USB, <b>Plug</b> <b>and</b> Play, and DirectX, preventing its users from playing contemporary games. Windows 2000 featured an updated user interface, and better support for both <b>Plug</b> <b>and</b> Play, and USB.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets without {{additional}} {{control or}} surge protection circuits {{are outside the}} scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and controlled by National regulations, and therefore must not be CE marked. In the UK the legal requirements for <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets are listed in Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1768, The <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994. This regulation lists the requirements for all domestic <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets; including socket outlet units (power strips), see Electrical Equipment - Requirements for Plugs & Sockets etc. - Guidance notes on the UK Plugs & Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1768).|$|R

25|$|In 1986, the International Electrotechnical Commission {{published}} IEC 60906-1, a specification for a <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> socket {{that look}} similar, {{but are not}} identical, to the Swiss <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> socket. This standard was intended to one day become common for all of Europe and other regions with 230 V mains, but the effort to adopt it as a European Union standard was put on hold in the mid-1990s.|$|E

This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> play). In a <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{arrangement}} remains {{to have the}} male plug on the cable and the female socket mounted {{in a piece of}} equipment: the original intention of the design. A considerable variety of line <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> panel sockets is available, including plugs suiting various cable sizes, right-angle <b>plugs,</b> <b>and</b> both <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets in a variety of price ranges and with current capacities up to 15 amperes for certain heavy duty [...] in versions intended for loudspeaker connections.|$|R
25|$|De facto {{standards}} became formalised as official {{national and}} international standards. Old installations with obsolete sockets exist. The International Electrotechnical Commission in 1934 established technical committee TC 23 for electrical fittings. Only two meetings were held before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. In Europe, since 1951 the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEE) has published a standard (CEE 7 Specification for <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> Socket-Outlets for Domestic and Similar Purposes) describing the <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets used. In 1953 the CEE published Technical Report 83 (later 60083), which was a listing of <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets then in use.
