The government has attempted to increase research productivity by shifting funding from institutional support to competitive grants, supporting mainly research on issues relevant to economic development, and encouraging applied research institutes to earn their money by selling the technology they produce. The paper finds that while competitive grants programs have probably increased the effectiveness of China's agricultural research system, the reliance on commercialization revenue to subsidize research and make up for falling <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> has weakened the system.

40|$|Much {{consideration}} {{has been}} given {{over the years to}} what may be described as the 'negative' aspect of budgeting; that budgets may constrain innovation and learning, and that budgetary pressure may lead to unintended behavioural side effects. In contrast to this, the present study examines the extent to which budgets have a more positive, 'comforting' role to play in the individual's work experiences. We argue that managers confronted with uncertainties associated with role ambiguity may respond by becoming positively committed to achieving budgetary targets as budgets offer a source of structure and certainty. We find that the use of budgets as an antidote to role ambiguity is a powerful influence on the manager's budgeting behaviour. We test the strength of this effect and we find that <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> brought on by the experience of role ambiguity may over-ride the potential for recognised explanatory variables such as leadership style, the expectations of the superior, and occupational socialisation, to inform managers' budgeting behaviours in these circumstances. Budgets, it seems, may be as useful to the individual as they are problematic...|$|R

Growing changes in business competition, daily operation, new strategy and technology are driving transformation in employees productivity and the future business environment that have significant impacts to organizations. Many organizations are demanding for proactive entrepreneurs with a dynamic team, who can run and steer their businesses to becoming more cost-efficient, which may lead to increased efficiency of firm performance. Literatures in management accounting recognize the important role of Management Accounting Practices (MAP) in Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This study examines the relationships between <b>budgetary</b> participation, <b>commitment</b> and performance measures through the tools and techniques of MAP in firm performance. A case study approach with heavy reliance on semi-structured interview was used, where 16 informants who are key decision makers and officer from different management levels were interviewed in the case study. Other sources of evidence have also been sought to enhance the desirability of the findings discussed. Our findings revealed that usefulness of MAP in the company improved employees’ accountability and firm performance. It also showed that <b>budgetary</b> participation and <b>commitment</b> from employees’ accountability have improvement activity when using MAP. This is directed towards helping others in achieving the desired business results by strategically positioning themselves into MAP in making informed decisions in their business undertaking.

This paper measures comprehensively for the first time housing affordability of tenants in the Netherlands with respect to rent and fuel in order to gain insight in the ways this ongoing <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> can be calculated. Starting point is the expenditure-to-income ratio, which is usually used in the Netherlands to represent the affordability of housing consumption. For 2012 its components-incomes, rents and fuel costs-are separated out. The absence of a socially acceptable benchmark for &# 039;affordable&# 039; versus &# 039;unaffordable&# 039; housing and the fact that lower-income households pay relatively more on rent and energy than those with a higher income (Engel&# 039;s Law) call for an alternative method to measure affordability. The residual income approach is shown to be useful in identifying households with housing and energy affordability problems, once social norms have been established for the relationship between income, rent and energy expenses. It is concluded that even energy expenses by themselves can push households over the affordability threshold, in the situation where rents are considered as affordable...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{document}} the process by which decisions are made in California about implementing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) projects, and to consider ways for "mainstreaming" ITS in the sense of evaluating ITS projects alongside non-ITS projects. The transportation planning and decision process is reviewed and described as a base for judging the efficacy of decisions with respect to the adoption of (ITS) projects. The decision process is complex and varied, involving government agencies at federal, State, regional, and local levels, but the process seems to be workable and suitable. In practice, however, critical information for making decisions does not appear to be available to decisionmakers at the points in the process when they need it. In particular, information on the impacts of ITS projects and the expected benefits appears to be missing from planning and project information documents such as Project Study Reports. Although generic claims for benefits in the form of delay savings, accident reductions, and other user or environmental benefits are sometimes provided, they are not quantified and are not specific to the particular project. Costs, on the other hand, are usually very specific, because they represent a <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment.</b> Good decisions, however, call for better information on what benefits the specific costs will generate. Providing better information on benefits does not need to take major effort, and precise answers are not essential; any estimates would be better than what is provided currently, and the processes and methods for generating the information can be improved with experience and streamlined at the same time. A few examples of the type of analysis that would be helpful are presented in the context of two California ITS projects. Some recommendations are offered for moving toward improved information for making decisions about ITS projects, allowing them to be compared with other transportation investment on an equal footing. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Researchers {{have long}} {{recognized}} the importance of a central government’s political “commitment” in order to mount an effective response to HIV. The concept of political commitment remains ill-defined, however, and little guidance has been given on how to measure this construct and its relationship with HIV-related outcomes. Several countries have experienced declines in HIV infection rates, but conceptual difficulties arise in linking these declines to political commitment as opposed to underlying social and behavioural factors. Methods This paper first presents a critical review of the literature on existing efforts to conceptualize and measure political commitment to respond to HIV and the linkages between political commitment and HIV-related outcomes. Based on the elements identified in this review, the paper then develops and presents a framework to assist researchers in making choices about how to assess a government's level of political commitment to respond to HIV and how to link political commitment to HIV-related outcomes. Results The review of existing studies identifies three components of commitment (expressed, institutional and <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment)</b> as different dimensions along which commitment can be measured. The review also identifies normative and ideological aspects of commitment and a set of variables that mediate and moderate political commitment that need to be accounted for in order to draw valid inferences about the relationship between political commitment and HIV-related outcomes. The framework summarizes a set of steps that researchers can follow in order to assess a government's level of commitment to respond to HIV and suggests ways to apply the framework to country cases. Conclusions Whereas existing studies have adopted a limited and often ambiguous conception of political commitment, we argue that conceiving of political commitment along a greater number of dimensions will allow researchers to draw a more complete picture of political commitment to respond to HIV that avoids making invalid inferences about the relationship between political commitment and HIV outcomes. </p...|$|R

We focus on the monitoring period commencing with the adoption of the Revised Action Plan in August 2011 until March 2013. Where necessary, we have included policy development prior to the reporting period. The report is based on a data set and information gathered through desk research, information requests directed to the relevant agencies and interviews with public officials, including mayors, and NGOs. In addition, we have prepared case studies of five policies {{to assess the impact of}} key flagship policies on the ground: Individual integration in education, activation works, municipal firms, Roma health mediators and the programme of lower-standard housing. The cases studies draw on desk research complemented with qualitative empirical research in four localities in eastern and central Slovakia. The report finds that the implementation of NRIS and Revised Action Plan greatly suffered from administrative and personal changes brought by the early parliamentary elections in March 2012. Both documents were prepared by the previous administration. The incumbent high ranking officials including the newly appointed Government Plenipotentiary for Romani Communities (GPRC), Peter Pollák, have made no statements suggesting their solid support for these policies. We have seen, for instance, no palpable progress in ensuring sustainable <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitments</b> to the implementation of the Revised Action Plan and the NRIS. Instead, Pollák has introduced principles of the so-called "Roma Reform [...] the Right Way" ("Rómska Reforma [...] Správna Cesta").

40|$|Initially {{off to a}} slow start, European Union (EU) {{consular}} crisis management cooperation eventually developed as a response to exogenous factors. Given that guaranteeing the safety of one’s citizens is seen as one of the core responsibilities of the nation state, however, the EU’s Member States still seem reluctant to transfer this responsibility to the European level and the EU institutions. At times equated with propaganda, both the terminology and practice surrounding public diplomacy has received increased attention recently. Though not always labelled as such, public diplomacy efforts have gradually been stepped up by national foreign ministries and the EU institutions. Against the backdrop of this renaissance for consular affairs and public diplomacy, the current study examines EU action in the field of {{consular crisis}} management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, potentially affecting the alleged (internal) lack of support for the project of an ever closed Union among the EU citizens, as well as serving the EU’s public diplomacy purposes vis-à-vis foreign audiences. On the basis of legal provisions, budget allocations and proven action thus far in the field of public diplomacy efforts related to EU consular crisis management cooperation, a number of conclusions are suggested: According to existing legal provisions, there is considerable scope for EU efforts in this field. Though it could potentially later be challenged by Member States and/or other EU institutions, the so-called institutional prerogative – which is often used as the legal basis for <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitments</b> in the field of information and communications by the European Commission – could be applied also to EU public diplomacy efforts in this area, i. e. (increasingly) funded through the Community budget. Though the enabling legal conditions are in place, and a number of budget lines exist {{that could be used to}} this end, to date a very limited number of initiatives have been realised. Looking at existing data regarding public opinion and EU consular cooperation, it seems that EU citizens (though to a varying degree, depending on the EU Member State and other demographical variations) would welcome an increased role for the EU in the area. Regarding public diplomacy, recent developments cannot be confined to the EU alone, but tend to be part of a broader trend which can be labelled the “societization” of traditional diplomacy, characterised by closer links between diplomacy and society. In terms of the limits of EU consular crisis management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, constraints include the issue of responsibility, the distribution of credit and blame, national sensitivities, and differences in Member States’ resources and representation. Finally, arguing that the potential for European efforts in the field of consular crisis management as a tool of effective EU public diplomacy (both within the Union and outside) is great, it is surprising that not more attention is given to the area – especially in light of the Commission’s discourse on delivering tangible benefits to the EU’s citizens. To move from action as a mere response to exogenous factors to a situation where it is part of an EU policy of deliberate public diplomacy, the Union still has a long way to go...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{reconstruction}} of Banda Aceh after the disastrous earthquake and tsunami of December, 2004. It fits the investigation within a framework derived from the literature on disaster studies and disaster recovery. The fundamental issue addressed in the thesis is the delays apparent in the reconstruction process even though a new government agency (BRR, or the Aceh and Nias Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency) was created to expedite reconstruction. The questions that underpin the research {{are concerned with the}} factors that hinder and support effective and speedy reconstruction; the thesis then reaches conclusions and makes recommendations {{on the basis of this}} investigation. The study used a number of research approaches, including interviews with 50 members of the community, with public figures, with representatives of donor organizations and NGOs from abroad and with national, provincial and local government officials. The interviews were supported by data from focus group discussions, as well as official reports and documents and the wider literature. The author was also able to use participant observation to support and guide the other research methodologies. The author was able to work closely with BRR in discussing in the field problems and obstacles that faced the implementation of BRR programs. The field work for the study was carried out in two six-month periods in 2005 and 2006. The research showed the approach needed for an effective reconstruction program in Aceh should enhance communication among stakeholders, build stronger coordination mechanisms amongst these stakeholders, build an effective bureaucracy working within an effective governance system, improve community involvement in the recovery process, strengthen the local government capacity and increase the level of practical and effective commitment from donors and NGOs. These are all aspects that have been listed in the literature as components of effective reconstruction after natural disasters. In general, the thesis research supports these conclusions. An issue that was of special significance in Banda Aceh was the impact of the level of international sympathy and support. Although this is a feature of many international disaster responses the reconstruction in Banda Aceh showed how critical is the actual level of delivery of assistance compared to the level of promises of assistance. The general recovery process faced obstacles that arose from the presence and absence of factors that can aid reconstruction: lack of communication among stakeholders, lack of coordination among stakeholders, ineffective bureaucracy, lack of community participation, lack of human resources, and unfulfilled promises to the communities. However, the case study showed that factors that strongly support the rehabilitation and reconstruction in Aceh are the strong <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> by central government, strong financial support from donors and NGOs and the powerful mandate of BRR to aid the reconstruction. A special circumstance that applied in Banda Aceh was the ceasefire agreements in the preceding civil strife and the agreement of both sides to assist in the reconstruction. The role of BRR has been very significant and effective in the implementation of the reconstruction programs, in the light of these constraints and opportunities. However, BRR faced many challenges. BRR was less successful than intended in re-housing tsunami victims. The reasons for this are indicated in the research findings, but some of the difficulties arose from cultural differences between BRR staff and the local population. The thesis used an institutional framework based on the work of Healey (2002) and Van Horen (2005). Through this, several forms of community assets (or capital) are identified that need to be in place for full community sustainability, and thus are needed as the basis for recovery after natural disasters. These forms of capital were used to assess the optimal framework for Aceh’s recovery and reconstruction. Physical and natural assets are the most obvious assets impacted on by a natural disaster such as the Aceh tsunami. Economic assets are not so immediately obvious but nonetheless are still important. These are also assets that are relatively easily identified and addressed (although often imperfectly) by international aid agencies. Human and relational capitals were shown in the case of Banda Aceh to be of particular importance and so should be flagged as a concern for post-disaster reconstruction. Similarly the strong Muslim ethic of the Aceh community was identified as being fundamental to the approach that should be used in reconstruction; in this way the spiritual aspects of cultural capital was seen as especially important in Aceh. Both Healey (2002) and van Horen (2005) recognize the governance framework within which these assets are utilized as critical for the development of values such as transparency and accountability...|$|R

40|$|The United States and Canada {{share the}} longest common border and largest {{bilateral}} trading {{relationship in the}} world. Recent trading agreements [...] CUSTA, NAFTA and WTO [...] have enhanced trade by encouraging elimination of many remaining trade barriers. However, one cause for concern {{about the effectiveness of}} these trade agreements has been the frequency of Canadian-U. S. trade disputes over bilateral wheat and barley trade arrangements and trade flows. To some extent, these disputes have arisen because of differences in and lack of harmonization between the domestic and trade policies implemented by the two countries, although other political factors have also clearly been important causes of these disagreements. Since 1986, many dimensions of the agricultural policies of both countries have undergone radical changes, perhaps especially with respect to small grains and oilseeds. Here we provide assessments of whether important aspects of the two countries' domestic and trade grains and oilseeds have converged toward harmonization since implementation of the Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. It {{should also be noted that}} many of the changes in each countries' agricultural policies cannot be attributed to free trade agreements. Rather, they reflect government responses to <b>budgetary</b> pressures, <b>commitments</b> under international trade agreements, changes in the relative political importance of rural and urban voters, and other factors. Changes in General Levels of Support Producer Subsidy Equivalents are indicators of the proportion of total revenues from sales of a crop resulting from government subsidies and other income support policies such as tariffs. U. S. producer subsidy equivalents for wheat and other grains have declined substantially from their 1993 - 1995 average levels as a result of the decoupling of income support payments under the 1996 FAIR Act. Similarly, the average wheat, other grains and oilseeds producer subsidy equivalents reported for Canada over the same period overstate current producer subsidy equivalents because of the elimination of Canadian grain transportation subsidies in 1995. Thus, generally, levels of government support for wheat and small grains have fallen quite considerably both in the U. S. and in Canada, indicating some movement in the direction of policy harmonization for these commodities. Farm Income Supports Over the past twenty years, farm income support in Canada has been delivered throughseveral different programs. Increasing budgetary pressures and a greater focus on market orientation led to the elimination of the Gross Revenue Insurance Program and the western grain transportation subsidies by 1996. The only current direct income support program is the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), which provides modest subsidies on interest rates paid to farmers on moneys they themselves pay into an income stabilization account. In the United States during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, changes were made to the deficiency payment/loan rate farm income support programs for wheat and small grains that tended to reduce the size of government payments to wheat and barley producers. Then, in 1996, the FAIR Act changed the entire farm income support mechanism, largely decoupling direct government payments to producers of those crops from current production decisions. In summary, the distortionary effects of Canadian and U. S. income support programs for wheat and other grains have been substantially curtailed, especially over the past three years. Similarly, the distortionary effects of Canadian income support programs for oilseeds have also been reduced toward the relatively modest levels associated with the U. S. oilseeds program, which has changed relatively little over the past ten years. There has been convergence in this area of farm policy. Grain Marketing and Export Subsidy Programs To the extent that U. S. export subsidy programs have become subject to GATT disciplines and funding for the U. S. export enhancement program has been reduced, the U. S. has moved toward a less distortionary set of trade policies for grains and oilseeds. The removal of freight subsidies has also moved Canada's grains trade policy in a less distortionary direction. However, Canada's export marketing board policy for wheat and barley (operated through the Canadian Wheat Board) has not changed in recent years. With respect to export credit guarantees, both countries operate roughly comparable programs, although under the GSM- 103 program, the U. S. is able to offer somewhat longer term (3 - 7 year) lines of credit. These programs have been subject only to relatively modest changes over the past ten years. On balance, there has probably been less harmonization of U. S. and Canadian export policies than of the two countries' income support programs. Thus, export policies, particularly the existence of the U. S. export enhancement program and the marketing powers of the CWB, will continue to be part of bilateral trade issues. agricultural policy, harmonization and convergence, grains, oilseeds, International Relations/Trade, Q 1,...|$|R
40|$| {{currently}} has three podcast series associated with hid General Psychology course and another podcast series for his Animal Behaviour course as an enhancement for Honors student. His podcasting {{efforts have been}} recognized in the press {{as well as on}} many Internet sites, and his podcasts have been in the top 100 of Apple iTunes higher education podcasts {{as well as on the}} “Featured Podcasts” lists. In 2007, he received the Campus Technology Innovator Award in Podcasting. He received the honor of University of Connecticut Teaching Fellow (1997 - 1998), and, in 1999, his work in multimedia instructional design and classroom implementation was recognized with the Chancellor’s Information Technology Award. In 2005, he received the University of Connecticut Undergraduate Student Government Educator of the Year Award. Miller provided statistics on the number one thing that students are purchasing and that included iPod’s. With this in mind, Miller started to develop podcasts for his students. Some his research was based on findings from the student monitor lifestyle media study that can be accessed from the [URL] website. Some of main reasons Miller took on this initiative included: •	To enhance course enhancement •	Add depth/content •	Promote interaction between students and professors and among students themselves •	Student-generated content •	“Shrink” a large class •	Deliver content •	Review sessions •	Snow days/holidays Unanticipated outcomes included: •	International audience •	Language tool •	Re-diagnosis Another outcome that Miller didn’t expect was the affect it would have on students. One student who was planning on studying abroad inquired with Miller on what it would take to do a podcast of his studies abroad. Some of the pros of doing so included the ability to reflect on unique experiences, audio diary to share, and observe one’s own maturations. Cons included problems with accessing equipment aboard and availability of a server to download the podcast to. Miller also gave some examples of how podcasts could be used at various post-secondary institutions. For example a podcast of campus information to students to give pre-tour information and interview other students to give a feel for campus life. The benefit in doing this might be that visitors might be less overwhelmed when taking actual tour and it may attract applicant as well. He also provided some ideas on how admission officers and registrars could use podcasts. This included: •	Transfer students o	Student interviews o	Freshmen impressions o	Exiting seniors •	Scholarships/loans •	Diversity interviews •	Course updates newscasts •	Cancellations/additions/changes •	One-minute SIS tips o	Lifting holds o	Adding/deleting courses o	Changing course grades o	Early-warning system Miller also touched on how to set up podcasts and where to find resources in order to do so. BREAKOUT SESSION # 5 – The A, B, Cs of Writing Good Instructions Susan Eveland from the University of Oregon presented this session on how to improve your print and web instructions. The session covered reading style theory, gave a lot of examples for clear writing, tips for meeting reader expectations, and plenty of tips and tricks for editing. Some of the main points that I took away from the session was that: •	Serif is easier for the human eye to read •	Use simple, strong words •	Use a active voice •	Proof read backwards – one sentence at a time •	If you want to get the reader’s attention you should use text that is bold, left justified and larger font for headings in order to get noticed Eveland also touched on considering who you audience is and what their reading style is. BREAKOUT SESSION # 6 – Pay It Forward: Implementing Imaging in Support of Enrollment Services This session was presented by David Mason from California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo who examined the components of implementing a complete imaging and content management system in support of enrollment services. Included was the methodology for examining existing business processes, managing change in the departments, creating system workflow to support processes, ensuring business needs drive the technology, and choosing appropriate implementation schedules. Also discussed what how to document existing business processes in a way that facilitates conversion to workflow was. Mason gave an overview of assembling the appropriate team, identifying core business processes, the acquisition process, designing productive workflows, and planning and effective schedule. He also touched on things to do before you begin a workflow project. This included: •	Change Management o	Link to existing plans o	Incorporate natural flows/changes o	Leverage key players •	Clarify business objectives •	Have a clearly defined scope •	Obtain a <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> •	Write it down! Metrics also play a key part in being able to relay the benefits of taking on such a project. California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo uses PeopleSoft as their SIS and ImageNow for their document imaging system. CONCLUSION I found the 2008 AACRAO Technology conference very informative and interesting. I think is important for the Registrar’s office at Athabasca University to keep abreast of the technological advances in delivering courses as well as other services to students and staff. This conference did exactly that and I hope we can adopt and learn from some of these technologies that were presented. Using technology to develop integrated student systems and services is critical to the success and survival of today's modern university. The AACRAO Technology Conference brings together technology practitioners and managers from the offices of: * Admissions * Bursar * Enrollment management * Financial aid * Registration * Central IT departments supporting student services More than 500 participants come to share ideas, information, and solutions on the practical application of technology in support of student services.
