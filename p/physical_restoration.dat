40|$|Recent {{national}} {{reviews of}} river restoration {{have called for}} rigorous, quantitative evaluations of project success. Meta-analysis represents one tool for testing the efficacy of common restoration practices due to its ability to integrate multiple small-scale, poorly replicated studies and to determine what ecological and methodological factors explain variable responses. We used meta-analysis to test whether <b>physical</b> habitat <b>restoration</b> increases macroinvertebrate density and richness. The assumption that macroinvertebrate communities benefit from habitat improvements, sometimes called the ‘field of dreams’ hypothesis, is an underlying tenant of many restoration projects, despite the paucity of quantitative tests. We then compared our results to experimental evaluations of the niche availability hypothesis; the core theory underlying the field of dreams hypothesis. A {{review of the literature}} identified 53 studies, of which 28 met our selection criteria. Of those, only 10 had sufficient replication necessary to calculate a variance-weighted effect size. For these 10 studies, adding boulders or large woody debris (LWD) significantly increased richness relative to upstream controls, while density increases approached significance. LWD additions had more significant, positive impacts on macroinvertebrate density and richness than boulder additions. Analysis of all studies, both replicated and unreplicated, corroborated results of the 10 replicated studies. Compared to experimental tests of the niche availability hypothesis, <b>physical</b> habitat <b>restoration</b> resulted in lower density and richness increases; however, only richness responses to boulder additions were significantly lower...|$|R

2500|$|The {{negative}} effects of channelization on stream and riparian health can be lessened through <b>physical</b> <b>restoration</b> of the stream channel. [...] This {{can be accomplished by}} restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly. This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features. Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale. The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc. In addition, stream channel modification can be extremely costly.|$|E

40|$|Properties of {{the soil}} profile {{fundamentally}} control water-limited ecosystems. Soil water availability affects vegetation dynamics of plant communities, but is also affected by these communities in return. Understanding this eco-hydrological interplay {{and the role of}} <b>physical</b> soil <b>restoration</b> is crucial for successful rehabilitation and management of post-mining landscapes in semi-arid areas. However, uncertainties exist in both the mathematical description of plant communities within ecological submodels and the predictability of future rainfall events. This study uses information gap decision theory combined with an ecohydrological system model to investigate how both uncertainties impact decision-making in the context of ecosystem rehabilitation. A range of management strategies are investigated to identify the optimal soil thickness for successful rehabilitation of native plant communities in Central Queensland. The results emphasise that thicker soils can counterbalance uncertainty in mathematical description of plant communities by increasing the simulated survival probability of plant communities. However, the influence of thicker soils on the robustness of plant communities against a change in future rainfall amount is rather marginal. By allocating an economic value for restoring a particular thickness of soil layer, these results can be used to evaluate the costs of ecosystem re-establishment with regard to two target measures – the survival probability of the plant community and their robustness against climate change...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} Chechen population growth {{in the context of}} the protracted Russo-Chechen conflict. It argues that the conflict was the main causative reason for the growth of the Chechen population. This hypothesis was confirmed by fieldwork, which allowed for the detection of a positive correlation between the nation’s demographic growth and the perception of the own physical existence as endangered. The results of fieldwork demonstrated that the majority of the informants connected high Chechen birth rates with the necessity of <b>physical</b> survival, <b>restoration</b> of losses, and strengthening the nation numerically. The threat to Chechen ethnic identity did not show as strong correlation with demographic growth as did the threat to physical existence. Nevertheless, Chechen ethnic identity, which favours resistance to a foreign rule, was confirmed to be the crucial variable in determining the demographic dynamics of the nation. This in turn suggested an additional correlation: in the context of an existential threat salient ethnic identity would prompt a population growth. The latter, in such cases, is considered as a way of continuing the resistance in a non-violent way. The restoration of the losses experienced and the survival of the nation is seen as a victory and at the same time as a preparation for the next outbreak of violence. With all of this in mind, this thesis suggests considering Chechen demographic growth as the reaction (which itself was determined by ethnic identity) to the existential threat imposed by Russia...|$|R

We sampled terrestrial arthropods with pitfall traps in late spring at nine sites selected to reflect little or no human disturbance and diverse histories of human activity (livestock grazing, chemical contamination, <b>physical</b> disturbance, <b>restoration).</b> Our evaluation of 56 assemblage attributes - measured as taxa richness or the relative abundance of key taxonomic, trophic, or ecological groups - sought measures that varied systematically with human influence. From 21 attributes that did vary significantly with disturbance, we selected 8 for a T-IBI. This Idaho T-IBI correlated significantly with human influence across the nine sites. We compared this index with an independently developed T-IBI, also comprising eight metrics, from three years' study at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. Six metrics were identical in both indexes. Combining our Idaho and Hanford results, we propose a nine-metric T-IBI for shrub-steppe lands. Concordance of metrics and the index in two widely separated shrub-steppe environments suggests that T-IBI offers an effective means of measuring biological condition. Parallels in this terrestrial system with the extensive aquatic work applying the same principles further suggest that this T-IBI could be effective in guiding conservation and restoration decisions in shrub-steppe landscapes.

40|$|River {{restoration}} {{projects in}} gravel-bed rivers {{are becoming increasingly}} sophisticated and complex as river managers and scientists attempt to deliver the goals of catchment- scale ecosystem restoration. With increased sophistication, come the dual challenges of recognizing and responding to the uncertainty inherent in the restoration process. Uncertainty is rarely explicitly recognised in current restoration projects and, where it is, the scope and definition are limited. In this paper we argue that uncertainty is a fundamental element of river restoration and that the sources of uncertainty are varied. A typology for understanding and communicating uncertainty in terms of these sources is presented. One of the myths surrounding uncertainty {{is the notion that}} being uncertain is the same as not knowing anything. In fact, when uncertainty is expressed as a statement of plausible outcome and/or significance, expressing uncertainty is a very informative statement of knowledge. The significance of uncertainty is explored conceptually and quantified for two contrasting examples from two gravel-bed river restoration projects. Respectively, these demonstrate that uncertainty in the conceptual model applied to a restoration project can have significant impacts on the restoration process and that unreliability uncertainties can affect the design of bankfull channel dimensions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approaches to incorporating uncertainty in river restoration projects, and argues for one that embraces uncertainty. We present an approach for embracing geomorphic uncertainty in <b>physical</b> habitat <b>restoration,</b> that uses coupled habitat and landscape evolution models to define the plausible outcomes for a given restoration project...|$|R
