40|$|CNC <b>machining</b> <b>centers,</b> {{as the key}} {{device in}} modern {{manufacturing}} industry, are complicated electrohydraulic products. The reliability {{is the most important}} index of CNC <b>machining</b> <b>centers.</b> However, simple life distributions hardly reflect the true law of complex system reliability with many kinds of failure mechanisms. Due to Weibull model’s versatility and relative simplicity and artificial neural networks’ (ANNs) high capability of approximating, they are widely used in reliability engineering and elsewhere. Considering the advantages of these two models, this paper defined a novel model: Weibull neural network (WNN). WNN inherits the hierarchical structure from ANNs which include three layers, namely, input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Based on more than 3000 [*]h field test data of CNC <b>machining</b> <b>centers,</b> WNN has been successfully applied in comprehensive operation data analysis.

A methodology for implementation of statistical process control is developed and evaluated by implementing it in a section of the <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> which has the biggest benefit. Gages are evaluated and control charts are established in that section. Operators are trained in the standard operating procedures related to the different components of SPC. The standard operating procedures are developed to be portable such that SPC can be used in various sections of the <b>machining</b> <b>center.</b> Findings include cost saving benefits and scrap rate reduction of approximately 50 % can be achieved for the entire <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> by the implementation of statistical process control. A training matrix is developed to train different people of the company on the concepts of SPC. Implementing SPC in a high volume <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> has proved to deliver value in reduction of scrap, quality improvement, ability to react to changes for the new hires and other benefits.
