A substantive {{difference between the}} TSQL2 proposal and what was adopted in SQL:2011 {{is that there are}} no hidden columns in the SQL:2011 treatment, nor does it have a new data type for intervals; instead two date or timestamp columns can be bound together using a [...] declaration. Another difference is replacement of the controversial (<b>prefix)</b> <b>statement</b> modifiers from TSQL2 with a set of temporal predicates.|$|E

30|$|This subset {{represents}} a single SPARQL sub-query. All words inside the subset are the FILTER operator variable, which {{are to be}} searched for {{in the description of}} the images. The complete query is generated as follows: The query is initialized as just the prefix values {{in the beginning of the}} program. Every time the program runs, it generates a query string containing the <b>prefix</b> <b>statements</b> as the ‘SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE’ statement. Because every element of the list is a sub-query, the function adds ‘select * where ?identifier s 0 :description ?value.’ to the existing query. Every element in the list is a subset containing different combinations of the keywords. Once it is an element of the list, it considers every tuple in the subset to filter the description. The ‘FILTER (REGEX(STR(?value),“’ is then added to the query, which is followed by the keyword present in the tuple.|$|R
50|$|All TEX <b>statement</b> labels were <b>prefixed</b> with a (!). <b>Statement</b> labels were {{in general}} ignored unless {{referenced}} by a goto or call statement. One notable feature of TEX was {{the ability to}} call or goto labels in other files. Coupled with the TEX SUBS mode meant that TEX could create new scripts via line editing, save and then call or goto labels in these scripts dynamically.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the setting of}} an extensive formalisation {{of the theory of}} sequences (finite and infinite lists of elements of some data type) in the Prototype Verification System pvs. This formalisation is based on the characterisation of sequences as a final coalgebra, which is used as an axiom. The resulting theories comprise standard operations on sequences like composition (or concatenation), filtering, flattening, and their properties. They also involve the prefix ordering and proofs that sequences form an algebraic complete partial order. The finality axiom gives rise to various reasoning principles, like bisimulation, simulation, invariance, and induction for admissible predicates. Most of the proofs of equality statements are based on bisimulations, and most of the proofs of <b>prefix</b> order <b>statements</b> use simulations. Some significant aspects of these theories are described in detail. This coalgebraic formalisation of sequences is presented as a concrete example that shows t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} thesis was to conduct {{experimental}} analyses of the emotional impact of cognitive defusion techniques on positive and negative thoughts about the self. Part I of the thesis investigated the impact of defusion on explicit self-report measures. Experiment 1 examined the emotional impact of a brief defusion technique on positive and negative self-statements. In this case, defusion was manipulated {{through the use of}} pro- or anti-defusion instructions and <b>prefixing</b> the <b>statements</b> with defused or non-defused phrases (e. g. “I am having the thought that I am a bad person”). The results indicated that the defusion-related instructions had little or no impact on the explicit ratings, but the defusion <b>prefix</b> decreased <b>statement</b> discomfort while increasing statement believability and willingness. Indeed, this effect occurred only for negative statements, but positive statements remained unchanged on all measures. In Experiment 2, participants’ personalised self-statements were targeted for more direct intervention that involved defusion, thought control or placebo. In each case, the impact of instructions versus exercise was also assessed. In these findings, there was some superiority of defusion exercise over instructions, although defusion was generally associated again with decreased discomfort. However, willingness did not change and the believability of the statements now decreased. Thought Control overall decreased discomfort but had no impact on believability or willingness. No changes were associated with Placebo. Part II of the current thesis attempted to examine the utility of defusion in the context of both explicit and implicit measures. Experiments 3 through 6 employed the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) to determine the most suitable types of self-relevant stimuli that could be targeted by the implicit measure while being susceptible to a defusion intervention. Participants’ responses to positive and negative words were compared in the context of I AM versus I AM NOT (Experiment 3); I AM versus OTHERS ARE (Experiment 4); and I AM versus I SHOULD BE (Experiment 5). The results indicated strong positive implicit self-regard across all three contexts, although I AM versus I SHOULD BE showed the weakest levels of implicit positive self-regard, relative to the other two experiments. Experiment 6 replaced the target words with whole statements (e. g. ‘I am so alone that it hurts’) to determine if this would be associated with lower levels of implicit self-regard and indeed it was. Experiment 7 provided a preliminary exploration of the susceptibility of the Statement-IRAP to defusion with groups of individuals with different levels of experience with defusion. Undergraduates (with no experience with defusion) were compared with a group of therapists (with considerable defusion experience). Although both groups reported strong implicit positive self-regard, those with more defusion experience were associated with stronger implicit outcomes. Experiment 8 investigated the impact of a defusion intervention or Placebo on implicit self-regard in individuals with no prior history of defusion. The data indicated that defusion increased implicit positive self-regard more than Placebo. The results presented here offer one of the first comprehensive experimental analyses of the impact of defusion on both explicit and implicit measures. Overall, the findings highlight the positive emotional benefits of defusion, relative to other more traditional coping strategies...|$|R
