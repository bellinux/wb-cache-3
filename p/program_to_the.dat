5|$|Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, {{published}} in 1890, was very influential in justifying the naval <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> civilian {{government and to}} the general public. With {{the closing of the}} frontier, some Americans began to look outwards, to the Caribbean, to Hawaii and the Pacific, and with the doctrine of Manifest Destiny as philosophical justification, many saw the Navy as an essential part of realizing that doctrine beyond the limits of the American continent.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, whistle-blower Avon Hudson {{disclosed}} {{details of}} the Maralinga testing <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian media at risk of incarceration. His disclosures related to the inadequacy of clean-up measures, persistent contamination and associated health risks of ionizing radiation. Hudson gave testimony to the Royal Commission into British nuclear tests in Australia in 1984 and 1985 and has since continued {{to work as a}} spokesperson for nuclear veterans in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Clarín {{newspaper}} {{attributes the}} success of the <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actors' performances, the subplots, production initiatives, and the original treatment of stories. The work of the supporting cast was also praised, including Carla Peterson, Fabiana Garcia Lago, and Marcelo Mazzarello. The newspaper La Nación praised the show's mix of sitcom humor and telenovela drama, and equated the dramatic episodes to the works of renowned telenovela authors Abel Santa Cruz, Alberto Migré, and Delia Fiallo.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{interfaces}} {{allows for}} a programming style called <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interface. The idea behind this approach is <b>to</b> base <b>programming</b> logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. <b>Programming</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.|$|R

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E

5|$|On September 12, 1998, Willow Creek Transit Center opened {{along with}} the rest of the Westside MAX line. The {{park-and-ride}} lot was filled to 67% capacity on average within a few months of the MAX line's opening. In 1999, library officials proposed moving the Books by Rail <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> busier Willow Creek station, but the move did not occur and the program was later canceled due to reduced library funds and a failed library funding levy. By December 1999, Willow Creek was the second-busiest station in terms of boardings on the Hillsboro portion, averaging 2,313 per day. The park-and-ride lot was the fifth busiest on the MAX system by March 2000.|$|E

5|$|Some {{claim that}} the FVdG {{influenced}} strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established {{on a national level}} until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing Der Syndikalist (The Syndicalist) in Berlin as a replacement for Die Einigkeit. On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its <b>program</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the National Assembly.|$|E
