40|$|The {{ability to}} {{construct}} <b>programs</b> in an incremental fashion is a premise of popular <b>programming</b> paradigms such as modular <b>programming,</b> object-oriented <b>programming,</b> and interactive <b>programming.</b> Incremental <b>program</b> development amounts to filling the holes of well-planned <b>program</b> contexts with new experimental components, or assembling new <b>programs</b> from previously developed and thoroughly tested components, {{or a combination}} of both.
