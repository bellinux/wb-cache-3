40|$|Background: The photopatch test is used {{to detect}} photoallergic {{reactions}} to various antigens such as sunscreens and drugs. <b>Photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis</b> can be caused due to antigens like parthenium, fragrances, rubbers and metals. The photopatch test does not contain these antigens. Therefore, the Indian Standard Series (ISS) along with the Standard photopatch series from Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Sweden was used to detect light induced antigens. Aim: To detect light induced antigens in patients with <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Methods: This study was done in a descriptive, observer blinded manner. Photopatch test and ISS were applied in duplicate on the patient's back by the standard method. After 24 hours, readings were recorded according to ICDRG criteria. One side was closed and other side irradiated with 14 J/cm 2 of UVA and {{a second set of}} readings were recorded after 48 hrs. Result: The highest positivity was obtained with parthenium, with 18 out of 35 (51 %) patients showing a positive patch test reaction with both photoallergic contact dermatitis and photoaggravation. Four patients (11 %) showed positive patch test reaction suggestive of contact dermatitis to potassium dichromate and fragrance mix. Six patients had contact dermatitis to numerous antigens such as nickel, cobalt, chinoform and para-phenylenediamine. None of these patients showed photoaggravation on patch testing. Conclusion: Parthenium was found to cause photoallergy, contact dermatitis with photoaggravation and contact allergy. Hence, photopatch test and UV irradiated patch test can be an important tool to detect light induced antigens in patients with <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Parthenium {{dermatitis}} is {{a widespread}} and distressing dermatoses in rural and urban India caused by the air borne allergen of the Compositae weed Parthenium hysterophorus. Parthenium dermatitis has been thought to be mediated solely by type IV hypersensitivity, but recently a combined immediate (type I) and delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity mechanism has been postulated in the initiation and perpetuation of parthenium dermatitis, especially in sensitized subjects with an atopic diathesis. Initially, the exposed sites of the body are involved. Later {{in the course of}} the disease, unexposed sites may get involved. Various clinical presentations have been described in parthenium dermatitis. Typically, it presents as an air borne contact dermatitis (ABCD) involving the eyelids and nasolabial folds Other presentations include a photodermatitis (essentially a pseudo photodermatitis), atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative <b>dermatitis,</b> hand <b>dermatitis.</b> <b>Photosensitive</b> lichenoid <b>dermatitis</b> and prurigo nodularis are rarer presentations. Uncommon presentations have been described in parthenium dermatitis. They include prurigo nodularis-like lesions and photosensitive lichenoid eruption. Three cases are presented, two of whom presented as polymorphic-like lesions and one as prurigo nodularis. All three patch tested positive to parthenium on Day 2. Prick testing was positive in two of the three patients. Parthenium dermatitis mimicking polymorphic light eruption has not been reported. Histopathology revealed vasculitis in the lesional skin in two of the patients. Although leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been reported earlier from the prick-tested site, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of vasculitis in lesional skin of parthenium dermatitis...|$|R

40|$|A {{man whose}} {{psoriasis}} was well controlled on methotrex-ate treatment developed pellagra-like <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis</b> {{when he started}} taking haloperidol. Reactivation of his dermatitis was observed with methotrexate as a recall photosensitivity phenomenon. This false photosensi-tivity reaction of methotrexate is an important but rarely encountered adverse effect. A possible interaction be-tween methotrexate and haloperidol is emphasised. Methotrexate {{has been associated with}} a variety ofcutaneous adverse reactions, of which recall or reacti-vation of acute sunburn response is a peculiar reaction. This has also been termed as a false photosensitivity reaction. 1 – 4 Methotrexate is also well known for its interaction with other drugs. Pellagra-like dermatitis, an adverse reaction of many cytotoxic drugs like 6 -mercaptopurine, 5 -fluorouracil, and azathioprine, however, has not been reported with the use of methotrexate. 5 Although phenothiazines are commonl...|$|E

40|$|Autoantibodies to Ro/SSA {{occur in}} {{nearly half of}} the {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus and are associated with lymphopenia, <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and pulmonary and renal disease, which suggests that they have an immunopathologic role. The majority of Ro/SSA precipitin-positive patients produce serum antibodies that bind to the 60 -kD and 52 -kD Ro/SSA proteins. We previously isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone that encodes the 52 -kD form of the human Ro/SSA protein. In the present study, we have determined the chromosomal location of the gene by in situ hybridization {{to the end of the}} short arm of chromosome 11. Hybridization of portions of the cDNA probe to restriction enzyme-digested DNA indicated the gene is composed of at least three exons. The exon encoding the putative zinc fingers of this protein was found to be distinct from that which encodes the leucine zipper. An RFLP of this gene was identified and is associated with the presence of lupus, primarily in black Americans...|$|E
40|$|Autoantibodies to Ro/SSA are {{commonly}} found in sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome. The presence of these antibodies is related to lymphopenia, <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and pulmonary and renal disease, suggesting {{that they have an}} immunopathologic role [1 - 6]. We previously isolated a cDNA clone which encodes the 52 -kD human Ro/SSA protein. In this study we have determined the number and location of epitopes recognized by SLE sera using recombinant proteins encoded by the full-length or overlapping subclones of this cDNA. An immunodominant epitope was detected using Western blots and ELISA on the NH 2 -terminal side of this protein's putative leucine zipper. The data suggest that 11 amino acids are critical for the recognition of this molecule by these autoantibodies. Although the titres of anti- 52 -kD Ro/SSA antibodies vary between different patient sera, no heterogeneity in the location of antigenic epitopes to which their autoantibodies bound was detected. This homogeneous pattern of reactivity to a single rather than multiple regions of this protein is unusual for lupus autoantigens which have been identified, and suggests that these antibodies may have arisen as by a cross-reaction to an epitope on another molecule...|$|E
40|$|Antinuclear {{antibodies}} (ANA) {{are found}} in the majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here the only documented case, out of a series of 38 patients, in which SLE was diagnosed {{in spite of the fact}} that we failed to demonstrate any type of autoantibodies. A 25 -year-old black woman presented with 6 of the 11 criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for classification of SLE, between August 1984 and April 1985, i. e. malar rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, pleurisy and pericarditis, renal insufficiency and nephrotic syndrome, anemia and leukopenia. Renal biopsy revealed mesangial glomerulonephritis, tubulonephritis and many tubuloreticular inclusions in the capillary endothelium highly suggestive of SLE. Four ANA determinations were performed during the 8 months of observation which were all negative, as were all other antibodies (anti-nDNA, -Sm, -RPN, -Ro, -La). The outcome was very favourable under prednisone and cyclophosphamide. In the rare cases of ANA negative SLE (5 - 10 %) <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is the prominent feature and renal or central nervous system involvement is less frequent. Those patients usually have other types of autoantibodies (especially anticytoplasmic) which was not the case in our patient. This indicates that the absence of autoantibodies does not rule out SLE...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} voriconazole in {{the treatment}} of extensive cases of chromomycosis. Chromomycosis is a chronic infection, which is extremely difficult to eradicate, and is caused by dematiaceous (dark-colored) fungi which affect the skin and subcutaneous tissues, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi being the major etiologic agent. Drugs such as itraconazole, terbinafine, posaconazole and amphotericin B have been employed with variable results. Methods: We treated three Caucasian male patients (ages 44, 57 and 77 years), two were farmers and one a trash collector, with long-standing (20, 10 and 21 years of disease, respectively) and extensive chromomycosis (one lower limb affected, at least) due to Fonsecaea pedrosoi. All patients had received previous therapy with the formerly indicated drugs itraconazole and terbinafine for several months either without or with incomplete response. After that, we started treatment with voriconazole per os 200 mg twice a day. Results: The patients were treated with voriconazole for 12 months until there was clinical and mycological improvement. Clinical response was evident after 30 - 50 days. One patient developed visual abnormalities and tremors, and the voriconazole was reduced to 200 mg/day without impairment of the clinical and mycological response. The same patient presented <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis</b> after 12 months of therapy and the voriconazole was stopped. All patients showed elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) during the treatment without clinical relevance. Moreover, our three patients obtained partial response with this therapy. Conclusions: This is the first report with a case series of chromomycosis treated with voriconazole. Despite its high cost, voriconazole is a safe and possibly promising drug for use on extensive chromomycosis refractory to conventional treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background : Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multiorgan involvement. The skin {{is the second}} most commonly affected organ. SLE with skin lesions can produce considerable morbidity resulting from painful skin lesions, alopecia, disfigurement, etc. Skin lesions in patients with lupus may be specific (LE specific) or may be non specific (LE non specific). Acute cutaneous LE (Lupus specific) has a strong association with systemic disease and non-specific skin lesions always indicate disease activity for which patients present to rheumatologists and internists. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the cutaneous manifestations of SLE is essential for most efficient management. Aims: The aims of this study were to evaluate the patterns and prevalence of skin lesions in patients with SLE and to assess the relationship between skin lesions and other systemic involvement. Materials and Methods: At the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, IPGME&R in Kolkata, 150 patients with SLE fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria of the American Rheumatology Association (updated 1982) were examined and followed-up for cutaneous manifestations between January 2002 and January 2007. Results: Skin lesions were important clinical features. About 45 patients (30 &#x 0025;) presented with skin lesions although all patients had skin lesions during the follow-up period. Skin changes noted were as follows: Lupus specific lesions: malar rash in 120 patients (80 &#x 0025;), <b>photosensitive</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in 75 patients (50 &#x 0025;), generalized maculopapular rash in 40 patients (26. 67 &#x 0025;), discoid rash in 30 patients (20 &#x 0025;), subacute cutaneous {{lupus erythematosus}} (SCLE) in 5 patients (3. 34 &#x 0025;), lupus profundus in 5 patients (3. 34 &#x 0025;). The lupus non-specific lesions were non-scarring alopecia in 130 patients (86. 67 &#x 0025;), oral ulcers in 85 patients (56. 67 &#x 0025;), vasculitic lesions in 50 patients (33. 34 &#x 0025;), bullous lesions in 15 patients (10 &#x 0025;), Raynaud&#x 2032;s phenomenon in 10 patients (6. 67 &#x 0025;), pyoderma gangrenosum in 2 patients (1. 34 &#x 0025;), erythema multiforme in 10 patients (6. 67 &#x 0025;), and nail fold infarcts in 2 patients (1. 34 &#x 0025;); however, mucosal discoid lupus, lichenoid discoid lupus, livedo reticularis, sclerodactyly, etc. were not detected. Patients having lupus-specific skin lesions e. g., malar rash were associated with systemic involvement, whereas those having lupus non-specific skin lesions were associated with disease flare. Conclusions: Skin lesions in patients with SLE are important disease manifestations and proper understanding is essential for diagnosis and efficient management...|$|E
