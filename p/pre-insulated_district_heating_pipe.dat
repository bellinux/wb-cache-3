40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{mechanical}} loads and moisture related problems with a potential to critically harm the functionality of <b>pre-insulated</b> <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> and pipe joints. Directly buried pipeline bends are investigated with respect to limiting deformations from a thermally induced lateral displacement. A new approach is introduced; stating that very large deformations of the insulation foam are tolerable as long as overheating of the casing pipe is avoided. A local increase in heat losses and loss of axial shear stiffness is not critical, but a too high temperature will accelerate the rate of deterioration of the polyethylene material. Measurements indicate that the earth pressures required to reach critical deformations {{are not likely to}} develop in regularly compacted backfill materials. Problems related to backfilling with reused excavated soil containing coarse-grained materials are of particular interest. The lifetime implications from large stones causing deep indentations in the casing pipe wall are studied. A conceptual framework for the force interaction between a laterally displaced pipe and a stone adjacent to it is presented, along with tests on the long-term strength of severely strained polyethylene. The risk for obtaining deep indentations depends on the compaction of the backfill, and is greatest in materials compacted to "ordinary" levels. There is an obvious temperature dependence in the expected lifetime. To avoid the combination of indentations and an elevated casing pipe temperature, compaction of backfill material containing large stones should be avoided around pipeline bends. The strength of pipe joints to axial movements through coarse-grained backfill material is studied experimentally. It is concluded that electro-fusion welded sleeves are superior to other types. But with a simple external protection, consisting of a polyethylene net, the much cheaper single-sealed non-shrinking sleeve can be used in very tough backfill materials. The consequences of a leaking joint seal are investigated experimentally and analytically. Homogeneous and defect-free PUR foam will act as a moisture barrier, protecting the medium pipe from water. Air-gaps or voids in the foam may promote an inflow of groundwater by a "breathing effect" caused by temperature variations. Hence in order to improve the performance of the joints, efforts should be made to develop the methods for foam injection to ensure a complete filling of the joint space. Vapour diffusion in plastics <b>pipes</b> <b>heating</b> systems and in cooling systems is studied analytically. In heating systems with polyethylene medium pipes, vapour will diffuse outward and possibly condensate and accumulate in the colder parts of the insulation foam. Calculations indicate that the increase in heat losses during the first 50 years of service is about 25 - 30 %. In cooling pipes, vapour passing in from saturated soil will condense in the colder insulation. Simplified calculations show that condensation of water starts almost immediately...|$|R

In recent decades a number of high performance insulation materials have been developed. This paper presents an investigation of high performance insulation materials in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes.</b> Three different paths were chosen as the most promising; mixing aerogel granulates in polyurethane foam, hybrid insulation with layers of aerogel blankets within the polyurethane, or hybrid insulation with vacuum insulation panels. The thermal conductivity of aerogel have been measured to as low as 13 mW/(m∙K) and the thermal conductivity through the center of a vacuum insulation panel can be as low as 4 mW/(m∙K). These can be compared to polyurethane which has a thermal conductivity around 25 - 26 mW/(m∙K).

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>District</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are usually}} polyurethane-(PUR) -insulated {{and the outside}} is {{protected}} by a polyethylene (HDPE) casing. The permeability of the cell gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and cyclopentane) in the PUR foam and in the HDPE casing was determined for a temperature range of 20 – 60 C (PUR) and 5 – 40 C (HDPE). From the results, {{it was concluded that}} the casing acts as the main diffusion barrier for carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen, whereas the main diffusion barrier for diffusion of cyclopentane is due to the PUR foam.

40|$|In {{order to}} move towards a {{sustainable}} society we need {{to increase the efficiency}} of our use of available resources, not only in economic terms but also in ecological terms. <b>District</b> <b>heating,</b> the utilisation of centrally produced heat for space heating and domestic hot water generation, has the potential to contribute to the eco-efficient use of energy resources in the parts of the world where space heating is needed. The introduction of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> has reduced the environmental impact from local heat production in urban areas. However, in order to fit into a sustainable society, <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> must be continuously developed according to the increasing demands on activities in a society moving towards sustainability. Our technical improvements must result in environmental improvements. This thesis focuses on the environmental performance of the distribution system - the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes.</b> The purpose of this research is to understand how the distribution system can be improved. The information presented in this thesis can be used to identify possibilities for improving the environmental performance of different life cycle phases of the distribution system as well as a baseline when evaluating new technical developments. The heat losses during use of the pipes are of large importance for the environmental impact of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes.</b> Such <b>heat</b> losses can be modelled if the mass transfer parameters for gases in the polyurethane insulation and the polyethylene casing are known. The diffusion coefficients, the permeability coefficients and the solubility coefficients and their temperature dependence have been determined for cyclopentane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen. The same parameters have been studied for the blowing agent alternative HFC- 365 mfc at room temperature. The long-term thermal performance of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> has been modelled using effective permeabilities for the pipe construction. Environmental consequences of heat losses during the use phase of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> have been compared with the impacts from production of the pipes and from construction of the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> network. The use of the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> is the most important of the studied life cycle phases. Thus, {{it is very important to}} minimise heat losses from the <b>pipes.</b> The <b>heat</b> losses will for some <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> increase notably during use due to foam ageing. Regarding the production of the pipes, the environmental performance can be improved mainly by using more material efficient pipe constructions, and for the construction of the piping network mainly by decreasing the excavation work. However, such improvements must be done in a way not jeopardising the insulating capacity. Twin-pipes, using two media pipes in the same casing pipe, will for smaller dimensions give better material efficiency and less need for excavation compared to the use of two single pipes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} sparse <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> conditions and explore how to improve them. Few sparse areas are <b>heated</b> by <b>district</b> <b>heat,</b> which reflects the economic competitiveness. A method {{that could be used}} by the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> companies to identify the boundaries of profitable <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> is presented. Important key figures are identified when investigating the boundaries of competitive <b>district</b> <b>heat.</b> This method was identified using data gained from research on sparse areas in Göteborg, Sweden and demonstrates what to focus on in order to improve competitiveness. It is concluded that distribution heat losses must decrease in future connected sparse areas to be an efficient and competitive heating alternative. The insulation properties of flexible <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes,</b> widely used when connecting sparse areas, are an important issue when improving the energy efficiency. The long term insulation properties of flexible <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> are experimentally investigated by studying the cell gas transport in semi-flexible polyurethane foams. The results show that the insulation properties are impaired more rapidly than for traditional straight pipes. The flexibility of the material is partly achieved at the cost of faster gas transport. An effective diffusion barrier hindering this gas transport is thus important. A new method to determine the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of flexible <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> is presented. The method is {{based on the fact that}} the temperature decline of hot water in a <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> placed in cool water depends on the thermal conductivity of the polyurethane foam. The temperature decline of the water inside the service pipe is measured and modelled numerically. The difference between measured and calculated temperatures is used to determine the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and the specific heat by fitting.

40|$|AbstractApart {{from the}} higher initial cost for using vacuum {{insulation}} panels (VIPs) in buildings {{there is still}} hesitation among architects and engineers whether these materials will withstand long-term use in buildings with a service life of 80 - 100 years. To evaluate the long-term performance, further investigations are needed. VIPs {{have been used in}} buildings since the 1990 s and there already exists experience from using them in various applications. This paper presents the experiences from two field studies of a previously non-insulated wall with VIPs and a <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> with hybrid VIP/PUR insulation. Measurements of the relative humidity in the wall showed that there is low risk of condensation in the VIP layer. Temperature measurements in the wall during the period 2010 to 2015 show no signs of deterioration of the VIPs. The same conclusion was made based on the temperature profiles in the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> during the period 2012 to 2015.

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of hot water}} in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> gives rise to energy losses. In order to minimise heat losses and maintain a high water temperature most <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> produced today are insulated with rigid polyurethane foam. The polyurethane foam has a very low thermal conductivity, {{which is due to}} the porous structure and the low conducting gases trapped in the cells of the foam. Over a considerable part of a pipe's lifetime the gas content of the foam alters. This is due to diffusion. The insulating gases diffuse out of the foam simultaneously as the air components, which are more conductive, diffuse into the cells of the foam, having consequences for thermal conductivity. As the cells of the foam eventually become air-filled, the thermal conductivity of the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> increases by about 30 %. The level of thermal conductivity and its rate of degradation can be interpreted as a cost or gain, economically and environmentally, when examining alternative pipe solutions. The overall concern of this work has been to enable the prediction of long-term thermal performance of both new and existing pipes. Methods for determining current thermal conductivity of a pipe already exist, whereas conditions for predicting the rate of change are lacking. This thesis focuses on determining of the gas transfer process in the insulating and casing materials, a factor which is considered decisive for the issue. A methodology, which is applicable to both new and existing pipes of various dimensions, is proposed. It includes experimental determination of gas permeability in polyurethane foam, and gas permeability in the high-density polyethylene casing, which surrounds the foam. Since it takes years for the diffusion processes to take place, one challenge has been to obtain results of reasonable accuracy within a reasonable amount of time. Polyurethane foam for insulating purposes formerly contained CFC- 11 or similar chlorofluorocarbons. Due to their ozone depleting potential, CFCs have now been abandoned by a majority of the polyurethane producing countries and less ozone depleting alternatives are in use. In <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> produced in Europe, cyclopentane has become the dominating alternative. Experimental results presented in this thesis concentrate on the relevant cell gases for cyclopentane-blown foam: nitrogen, oxygen, cyclopentane and carbon dioxide (the latter a co-blowing agent during foam production). The results of the thesis emphasise the importance of understanding the gas transport processes of each of the cell gases in order to accurately determine long-term thermal performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{for reducing the}} energy consumption in society has increased during the last decades due to an increased environmental awareness. One way to decrease the energy losses in the building sector {{is to improve the}} thermal insulation of building envelopes and installations and thereby decrease the heat losses. This thesis analyzes two types of novel insulation with low thermal conductivity; aerogel blankets and vacuum insulation panels. The thesis aims to investigate the possible benefits from using these novel insulations, but also to evaluate new considerations related to the high insulation performance. The insulations have been tested in two applications: 1. 	A wooden stud wall with aerogel blankets as insulation 2. 	Hybrid insulated <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> where aerogel blankets or vacuum insulation panels have been wrapped around the carrier pipe and polyurethane have been used to fill the rest of the casing pipe. Thermal properties and moisture properties have been measured in laboratory by guarded heat flow meter, guarded hot pipe, transient plane source and wet cup method. <b>District</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> with vacuum insulation panels have also been measured in field. The measured properties have been used in numerical simulations to evaluate the heat losses and the risk of moisture related damages for both applications. The studies show promising results for aerogel blanket insulated walls where the wall thickness was reduced by 40 percent compared to a conventional Swedish wall. However, the effect on the moisture conditions from the thermal bridges through the studs has to be considered in order to avoid damages. For <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes,</b> the vacuum insulation panels showed the most promising results with a decrease in the heat losses by 15 to 25 percent depending on the dimensions of the pipe and the thickness of the vacuum insulation panels. In hybrid insulation double pipes with vacuum insulation, the position of the thermal bridges {{at the edges of the}} panel has a large impact on the total heat losses. The thesis also examines some challenges when measuring the properties of the novel insulation. The thermal conductivity of aerogel blankets improves with an increased compression of the samples. The properties of the curved vacuum insulation panels used in the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> are difficult to measure since there is an impact from the thermal bridges along the edges, which might be influenced by surrounding materials...|$|R

40|$|In nano-porous thermal {{insulation}} {{there is a}} strong relation between the pressure and the thermal conductivity, even at pressures close to atmospheric pressure. This thesis presents research on applications of nano-porous insulation in hybrid insulation <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> and in building walls. A concept of hybrid insulation <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> has been investigated where the innermost layers of insulation consists of nano-porous insulation and the outer layers consists of polyurethane foam insulation. The concept has been investigated through a mix of laboratory measurements, field measurements and simulations. The presented research indicates that vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) can be used in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> to reduce the heat losses. For the evaluated configurations the heat losses were reduced by a magnitude of 30 %. The heat losses from the supply pipe in a twin pipe were reduced by 50 %. The two main considerations with using vacuum panels in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> are the thermal bridges and the long term performance. It is shown that the position of the thermal bridges in the panels has a large effect on the thermal performance of the twin pipes and the results indicate a preferred configuration to minimize heat loss. The thesis presents a model to evaluate the long term performance of the VIPs through temperature measurements. After three years of field measurements on pipes connected to a <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> network with temperatures up to 90 C, {{there is no sign of}} any uncontrolled deterioration of the VIPs. Results from the investigation show that the use of aerogel can reduce the thickness of a load bearing stud wall with 40 % compared to the use of conventional insulation. If done wrong, this can lead to some new consideration regarding mold growth risk. The fact that the thermal conductivity of nano-porous insulation is strongly influenced by the pressure in the pore gas can be used to create variable insulation, where the thermal properties of the insulation is changed to match the current circumstances. By putting the insulation in a diffusion tight bag, connected to a vacuum pump, the pressure in the material can be changed and thereby the thermal conductivity. The pressure was varied in a fumed silica and an aerogel blanket sample between 1 kPa and atmospheric pressure, which gave a variation in the thermal conductivity of 1. 5 for the aerogel blanket and 3 for the fumed silica. Transient measurements during evacuation and refilling show that the thermal performance will be influenced by some transient effects, such as influence from the temperature of the inserted air, but the time scale is too small to have any large effect on the energy performance. When the variation is used in simulations of the energy use for an office building, an interesting result is that a variable construction gave a higher optimum U-value, corresponding to thinner walls...|$|R
40|$|When several {{production}} units provide a <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> network, water is pumped from different directions. When the {{flows from the}} plants finally meet in the network, the water can be completely still. These places are called zero flow zones. In <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> networks with several plants, which also have different supply temperatures, large and frequent temperature fluctuations can occur when the zero flow zones move. This may cause wear on the pipes, a phenomenon called low cycle fatigue. For this reason {{it is important to}} examine where and when zero flow zones that cause temperature changes occur. The purpose of this thesis was therefore to investigate how temperature changes caused by zero flow zones influence Fortum’s <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> network. Simulations in the software TERMIS and literature reviews regarding temperature variations in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> were used. The results showed that low cycle fatigue in <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> is rare. The design criteria that the European standard, EN 13941, contain are well proportioned.

40|$|<b>District</b> <b>heating</b> can {{contribute}} to increased energy efficiency in society. The environmental impact can be reduced by minimising the heat losses in the <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> during distribution of the heat to the customers. Today, {{the most commonly used}} type of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> has a steel or copper media pipe, surrounded by polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation and a protective outer casing of polyethylene. The heat losses increase over time due to diffusion of blowing agents out of and air into the insulating foam. In this thesis, the long-term environmental and thermal performance of different insulating materials was studied. The diffusion mechanisms of cyclopentane, a commonly used blowing agent in PUR foam, were compared to those of a new gas, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 -pentafluorobutane (HFC- 365 mfc). The performance of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam as a possible replacement alternative to PUR foam was also investigated. The environmental impact from global warming, acidification and resource depletion was studied for the first three phases (pipe production, network construction and network use) of the life-cycle of different pipe alternatives by means of life-cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA-study of PET foam insulated pipes is theoretical, since only foam boards can be produced today. The diffusion characteristics of HFC- 365 mfc in PUR foam were found to be similar to those of cyclopentane. <b>District</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> insulated with HFC- 365 mfc blown PUR foam may have less environmental impacts due to heat losses than cyclopentane blown foam, but the high global warming potential of HFC- 365 mfc render its use questionable. If it is assumed that the entire HFC- 365 mfc content in the PUR foam were to be released to the atmosphere, the use of this gas for pipe insulation can not be justified as an option to cyclopentane blown foam. The determined effective diffusion and solubility coefficients of blowing agents and air are lower in PET foam than in PUR foam. The environmental performance of pipes insulated with high-density carbon dioxide blown PET foam (157 kgm 3) is similar to pipes insulated with carbon dioxide blown PUR foam (86 kgm 3). If PET foam of lower density could be produced, it would be a potential competitor to pipes insulated with cyclopentane blown PUR foam. A future trend towards increased recycling of PET can be expected in Europe, possibly as a result of increased PET consumption and current regulations. Recycled PET has also the advantage of a lower price than virgin PET and PUR...|$|R

A method for solvent extraction with subsequent gas chromatographic analysis was developed and found to be advantageous for CFC-blown foam along with a combustion method (the Schoniger method), where the chloride ions formed were determined by titration. The solvent extraction method was successfully applied to blowing agents in CFC-free foams as well. Three methods involving heating and weight-loss determination were evaluated. They are easy to use, but corrections for thermal decomposition of the polymer are needed. About half of {{the total amount of}} CFC- 11 in the investigated polyurethane foams from <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> was found to be dissolved in the polymer matrix...|$|R
40|$|IWAGPR 2017, 9 th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar, EDIMBOURG, ROYAUME-UNI, 28 -/ 06 / 2017 - 30 / 06 / 2017 The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{determine}} the characteristics of an algorithm for point extraction from hyperbolic reflections in Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) data with different acquisition settings. Analysis is performed on a series of experimental radargrams that were collected in real conditions, on the same location. Two <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> DN 250 in a trench, covered by compacted sand, were scanned and the acquisition was done by using a 900 MHz antenna. The pipe depth and the axial distance were measured when the trench was open. Measured dimensions were then compared with the values obtained by the algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam {{is used in}} many different applications because of its high insulating capacity. CFC- 11 has been the predominant blowing agent due to its advantageous properties, especially its low thermal conductivity. To prevent a depletion of ozone in the stratosphere {{and an increase in}} global warming, the use of CFCs and similar compounds is now being phased out. Less environmentally harmful alternatives thus have to be developed. In order to study the performance of blowing agents their concentration and their distribution in the foam must be measured. A method for analysis of the cell gases in rigid foam was developed. Partial pressures of all gases in the cells could thus be determined as well as the amount of condensed blowing agent. Three methods involving heating and weight-loss determination were elaborated for the determination of the blowing agent distribution in rigid foam. A combustion method was also applied and a method for solvent extraction developed. Experiments were performed both on pieces of foam and on powdered foam. The analytical methods were applied in several studies, mainly on rigid {{polyurethane foam}}s blown with CFC- 11, water or cyclopentane. Changes in partial pressures over time were determined and used to calculate effective diffusion coefficients of the different gases in slabs or cylinders, cut from the foam. Slabs or cylinders of different sizes are recommended for gases with widely differing diffusion coefficients. The influence of surface materials, such as the outer polyethylene casing on <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes,</b> on the rate of diffusion was measured. Assessments were made of the amount and distribution of CFC- 11 in old insulating foams. The total remaining amount of CFC- 11 in old <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> in Sweden was estimated at about 2000 tonnes. Treatment of polyurethane foam waste is discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>District</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are known}} to {{degenerate}} with time and in some cities the pipes {{have been used for}} several decades. Due to bad insulation or cracks, energy or media leakages might appear. This paper presents a complete system for large-scale monitoring of <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> networks, including methods for detection, classification and temporal characterization of (potential) leakages. The system analyses thermal infrared images acquired by an aircraft-mounted camera, detecting the areas for which the pixel intensity is higher than normal. Unfortunately, the system also finds many false detections, i. e., warm areas that are not caused by media or energy leakages. Thus, {{in order to reduce the}} number of false detections we describe a machine learning method to classify the detections. The results, based on data from three <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> networks show that we can remove more than half of the false detections. Moreover, we also propose a method to characterize leakages over time, that is, repeating the image acquisition one or a few years later and indicate areas that suffer from an increased energy loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{extremely}} low thermal conductivity of vacuum insulation panels (VIP) leads to less required insulation thickness in different applications. This paper aims to present our research findings {{related to the}} long-term performance of VIPs based on measurements during the last five years. The measurements were performed both in laboratory and in field where the real condition are present. The performance of an exterior wall retrofitted with VIPs and a hybrid insulated <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> were observed. The expected service life of both application are more than 50 years. Thus, the long-term performance of the VIPs is of interest. The results of the evaluation indicate {{that there is no}} considerable performance degradation after five years in the wall application and after three years in the hybrid insulated pipes. The results are promising. However, it is still too soon to make final conclusions of the entire service life performance of the applications...|$|R
