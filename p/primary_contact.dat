The eastern extremity is zoned for <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted.

The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies {{show that}} {{adolescents}} living in residential youth care (RYC) institutions experience more {{mental health problems}} than others. This paper studies how well teachers and <b>primary</b> <b>contacts</b> in RYC institutions recognize adolescents’ mental health problems as classified by The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment diagnostic interviews (CAPA). Methods All residents between 12 and 23 years of age living in RYC institutions in Norway and enrolled in school {{at the time of}} data collection were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Of the 601 available children, 400 participated in the study, namely 230 girls, mean age = 16. 9 years, SD = 1. 2 and 170 boys, mean age = 16. 5 years, SD = 1. 5. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) were used. The sensitivity and specificity of these instruments were studied. Results We observed a significant gap between the mental health problems diagnosed by the CAPA interviews and the problems reported by <b>primary</b> <b>contacts</b> on the CBCL and by teachers on the TRF. The CBCL showed a higher sensitivity than the TRF, whereas the TRF showed a higher specificity than the CBCL. Both <b>primary</b> <b>contacts</b> and teachers classified externalizing problems fairly well such as ADHD in both genders and conduct disorder in girls. Both teachers and <b>primary</b> <b>contacts,</b> however, had more problems detecting internalizing problems. Teachers may have a tendency to view most students as healthy and to underestimate the severity of their problems, whereas <b>primary</b> <b>contacts</b> may tend to overestimate the number of problems and view adolescents as sicker than they really are. Conclusion The Child Welfare System should revise their intake procedures to detect possible problems early on and to introduce the necessary treatment. It is important to identify factors that increase healthy school adaption in order for these adolescents to accomplish school in a proper way since education is important for a successful adult life. © 2016 The Author(s).

25|$|Chiropractic is an {{alternative}} medical practice whose main hypothesis is that mechanical disorders of the spine affect general health via the nervous system, and whose main treatment is spinal manipulation.

Chiropractic treatment has not been shown to be effective for medical conditions other than back pain, and there is insufficient scientific evidence to make conclusions about chiropractic care for autism.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., {{chiropractic}} {{schools are}} accredited through the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) while the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) is the statutory governmental body {{responsible for the}} regulation of chiropractic in the UK. The U.S. CCE requires a mixing curriculum, which means a straight-educated chiropractor may not be eligible for licensing in states requiring CCE accreditation. CCEs in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Europe have joined to form CCE-International (CCE-I) {{as a model of}} accreditation standards with the goal of having credentials portable internationally. Today, there are 18 accredited Doctor of Chiropractic programs in the U.S., 2 in Canada, 6 in Australasia, and 5 in Europe. All but one of the chiropractic colleges in the U.S. are privately funded, but in several other countries they are in government-sponsored universities and colleges. Of the two chiropractic colleges in Canada, one is publicly funded (UQTR) and one is privately funded (CMCC). In 2005, CMCC was granted the privilege of offering a professional health care degree under the Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, which sets the program within the hierarchy of education in Canada as comparable to that of other <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> health care professions such as medicine, dentistry and optometry.|$|E

40|$|The forces {{between two}} cylindrically curved mica {{surfaces}} have been measured in aqueous dextran solution {{in the presence}} of NaCl. At various NaCl concentrations (10 - 4, 10 - 3, 10 - 2 M) we observe an additional attractive contribution to DLVO forces when dextran is added to the aqueous solution. The most striking consequence of this effect is that the jumps into <b>primary</b> minimum <b>contact</b> occur at larger distances and at weaker forces than with pure electrolyte solution; moreover in some cases where hydration forces prevent the jump in <b>primary</b> minimum <b>contact</b> (NaCl 10 - 2 M), the addition of dextran produces this jump.
