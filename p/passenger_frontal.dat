The chest was the most frequently injured body region. The older occupants sustained more injuries to the chest region compared to their younger counterparts and these injuries were predominately skeletal injury induced by seat belt forces. Older occupants had a higher rate of multiple rib fractures compared to younger and middle aged occupants. The increase in the number of rib fractures showed a strong association with increase in intrathoracic organ injury. These results suggest that older occupants are more vulnerable to serious injury to the chest region in frontal impacts.

40|$|From {{accident}} statistics in real-world frontal collisions, {{it has been}} shown that a considerable portion of injuries occur in situations without major passenger compartment intrusions and that these injuries can be attributed to the occupant interaction with the restraint systems. To address these types of injuries, a novel front structure concept is proposed. This structure includes a partly detachable front subframe that can actively be released from the passenger compartment and thereby reduce the crash forces and related decelerations. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of an adaptive front structure on occupant loading in a modern <b>passenger</b> car in <b>frontal</b> crash situations. A simplified finite element model was derived from a full vehicle model in order to run a large simulation matrix spanning from full overlap to small overlap situations. Occupant loading was estimated by using two simplified occupant chest deceleration models, the Volvo Pulse Index and the Occupant Load Criterion. Results suggest that modifying the crash pulse shape can be equivalent to reducing the velocity change in a crash by up to 44 %.

40|$|For the {{protection}} of the unbelted occupants on the front <b>passenger’s</b> seat in <b>frontal</b> crashes the airbag is fired according to FMVSS 208 depending on the occupant’s size or for children at individual stages. For children seated in a rearward facing child seat or OoP (“Out of Position“) situ ations the airb ag should not be fired. A sensor mat on the seat cushion is developed for the classif ication of the occupants on the passenger seat (“Occupant Classification System “ = OCS). The e mployed sensors in the mat are activated based on a resistive measuring principle so that a chara cteristic activation of sensors for particular “classes of occupants “ can be achieved. During the development of such a sensor mat for a particular seat model, a large number of tests with test persons, child seats and special buttock dummies are carried out in order to guarantee a reliable recognition of the seat’s occupancy.

40|$|EuroNCAP {{tests are}} carried out since 1997. The test {{procedure}} in general {{is comparable to the}} EC Directive 96 / 79 with a test speed of 64 km/h. This increased test speed implies a higher frontal stiffness for new vehicle designs in order to achieve a high ranking. This frontal stiffness {{is one of the major}} factors for compatibility in car to car collisions. To support the European 4 th framework compatibility research activity, load cell barriers are used in ENCAP tests carried out at the TNO Crash Safety Centre and TRL. In this paper global force displacement characteristics of a number of different vehicle classes are compared and analysed. It will be made clear that small vehicles in the past known not to be strong can produce comparable force levels as large cars. For compatibility this means that in small car against large car collisions the small car's passenger compartment can stay stable and can offer better protection to the occupants, since from accident analyses it is known that serious injury often is caused by high intrusion into the <b>passenger</b> compartment. For <b>frontal</b> impacts this means that ENCAP tests have driven small cars to increased compatibility for one aspect of compatibility (cabin integrety) at higher speed. MPV's with high masses and little crushable space show more aggressive force displacement characteristics. This car category is expected to behave less compatible hitting small cars or medium size passenger cars. A longer crushable space for this category is desired, which is in conflict with the special look for these vehicles. This trend in stiffer vehicle fronts might result in future modifications of the European side impact barrier, which is currently based on average vehicle fronts of old vehicles.

40|$|While frontal {{collisions}} between Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) {{and passenger}} cars are rare compared to car-to-car frontal crashes, {{they are much}} more severe. Between 43 % and 73 % of all frontal car-to-truck accidents result in fatalities. The severity is due to crash incompatibility between the vehicles that has been generally agreed to arise from differences in mass, stiffness and geometry and it refers not only to car-to-truck collisions but also to most vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. To address incompatibilities between passenger cars and HGVs, Front Underrun Protective Devices (FUPDs) are obligatory equipment for HGVs produced after August 2003. To date, there is insufficient research describing the efficiency of statutory and energy absorbing (e. a.) FUPDs in real traffic collisions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to understand and suggest improvements for the compatibility between trucks and passenger cars through parametric studies of different design and collision configurations where the compatibility between trucks and cars is seen as an indivisible part of overall crash compatibility between vehicles. The focus was the requirements for energy absorbing FUPDs to overcome the unpredictable behaviour of <b>passenger</b> cars in <b>frontal</b> collisions by studying the links between geometry and stiffness as influenced by crash configuration and structural interaction. The bending stiffness of e. a. FUPD cross-beams, their height, and triggering force for energy absorbing elements were found to be important characteristics of e. a. FUPD that influence the outcome in collisions between HGVs and passenger cars. The stable response of vehicle structures was identified as an important issue to understand. A new analysis approach, called the RED method, was developed and presented. Using energy absorption and impact forces calculated in FE simulations, the RED method gives more insight into structural deformation processes than other methods and thereby improves the evaluation of vehicle structures. Information derived from the procedure was used to develop two new assessment criteria - Structural Efficiency and Crash Stability – {{that can be used to}} objectively quantify the crash response of vehicles. Because the method is based on FE crash simulations it can be used in the development as well as production phase of a vehicle crash structure or even other structures where deformation modes are important.

40|$|A {{review of}} the biomechanical and {{epidemiological}} literature on abdomen injury in motor-vehicle crashes was performed. Results of this review demonstrate that (1) there are limited data on abdomen injuries in real-world crashes of newer model airbag-equipped vehicles, (2) there are insufficient useful data on the force-deflection characteristics of the abdomen under loading conditions that represent those that occur to near-side occupants in T-type side impacts, (3) data are needed on {{the response of the}} abdomen to lap-belt loading using realistic belt geometry and loading conditions, and (4) data are needed on the dynamic response of spleen tissue and on failure criteria for spleen and liver tissue. To address the first identified need, analyses of the NASS and CIREN datasets were performed to determine how abdomen injuries occur in frontal and side crashes of airbag-equipped vehicles when seatbelt use is high. Based on the NASS analysis, approximately 19, 000 adult occupants sustain AIS 2 + abdomen injuries each year, with just over half of these injuries occurring in frontal collisions. The risk of abdomen injury is 3 to 8 times higher for unbelted occupants compared to belt-restrained occupants in frontal impacts, but airbag deployment does not substantially affect abdomen injury risk. Overall, seatbelt use reduces abdomen injury risk in side impacts for both near- and far-side occupants. Near-side right-front passengers have the highest risk of AIS 3 + abdomen injuries side impacts, with a risk level that is 2. 7 times higher than for drivers in left-side impacts. The risks of injury to the liver, spleen, kidney, and hollow organs do not vary with occupant age in frontal or near-side impacts. Analysis of the relationship between abdomen injury and rib fractures indicates that the odds of an abdominal injury are much higher if the occupant also sustains AIS 2 + rib fractures. These results indicate that loading conditions likely to cause abdomen injuries are also likely to cause rib fractures, suggesting that the abdomen is rarely loaded in isolation in vehicle crashes. The CIREN dataset was used to analyze occupant contacts with vehicle interior components that were attributed to abdomen injuries. For drivers in frontal impacts, the steering-wheel and lap/shoulder belt were most often coded as the sources of abdomen injury. For right-front <b>passengers</b> in <b>frontal</b> impacts, the airbag, lap/shoulder belt, and instrument panel are commonly coded sources for abdominal loading and injury. The mean deltaV for drivers with abdomen injuries attributed to steering-wheel contact is higher than for abdomen injuries to drivers without steering-wheel contact (57 vs. 47. 5 kph, p= 0. 011). Unbelted drivers restrained by a frontal-impact airbag had greater proportion of steering-wheel contacts than expected, while drivers restrained by both lap/shoulder belts and frontal-impact airbags had fewer steering-wheel contacts than expected. For near-side occupants who sustained both liver and spleen injuries in side impacts, the mean residual lateral door intrusion was 35 cm, while for near-side occupants who sustained only a liver or a spleen injury in side impacts, the mean lateral door intrusions ranged from 22 to 27 cm. Because the risk of abdomen injury is highest for near-side occupants in side impacts, an analysis of FMVSS 214 and SNCAP data was performed to characterize near-side occupant loading by the intruding door in T-type side impacts. Results of this analysis indicate that door velocity at the time of initial contact with the abdomen is between 8 m/s and 12 m/s in these staged tests. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the highest priority for future research on abdomen injuries should be to define abdomen force-deflection characteristics for near-side occupants in T-type impacts using high-speed loading conditions that better represent those that occur in real-world crashes...|$|R
