These Alfa cellulosic nanoparticles were used as reinforcing phase to prepare <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> using carboxymethyl cellulose as matrix. These films were obtained by the casting/evaporation method. The crystallinity of NC was analysed by X-ray diffraction, the dimension of NC by atomic force microscopy, molecular interactions due to incorporation of NC in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) matrix were supported by Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The properties <b>of</b> the ensuing <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> were investigated using tensile tests, water vapour permeability (WVP) study and thermogravimetric analysis. With the progress of purification treatment of cellulose, the crystallinity is improved compared to the untreated fibres; this {{can be explained by}} the disappearance of the amorphous areas in cellulose chain of the plant. Consequently, the tensile modulus and tensile strength of CMC film increased by 60 and 47 %, respectively, in the <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> with 10 wt% of NC, and decrease by 8. 6 % for WVP with the same content of NC.

30|$|The present work {{shows the}} role of MMT in {{physical}} properties and biodegradation <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> An increase in the Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was observed when 1 - 5 % (w/w) of MMT {{was added to the}} PVA/S/CMC. With the increase of the MMT concentration from 0 t o 5 %, the UTS increased 5 from 18.36 to 20.38 MPa, however, the strain to break (SB) decreased noticeably from 35.56 to 5.22 %. The MMT content significantly impacted on the rate of starch solubilistion. The decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 8 – 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. The water uptake ability of blends was decreased significantly as the MMT percentage increased from 0 to 5 % (W/W). At the level of 5 % (W/W) MMT, the films showed the lowest WAC% values and DED% decreased from 27.69 μg/ml h for the film without MMT to 18.95 μg/ml h for that containing 5 % MMT. Based on these results, the PVA:S:CMC:MMT <b>bionanocomposite</b> <b>films</b> show better physicochemical properties than PVA:S:CMC films and they can be potentially replaced of PVA:S:CMC films.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of bio-based and biodegradable nanocomposites has gained attention during recent years for environmental reasons; however, the large-scale {{production of}} these nanocomposites still poses challenges. The {{objective of this}} work has been to prepare bio-based and biodegradable nanocomposites via liquid-assisted extrusion and to gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the process and the relationship between the process, composition, structure and properties. Extrusion is a common industrial process and thus, the development of this technique for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites</b> can promote the commercialization of these materials in future. In this work, nanocomposites based on polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), and chitin nanocrystals (ChNC) with varying nanomaterial content were prepared via liquid-assisted extrusion using a plasticizer as a dispersing and processing aid. This process consists of dispersing the nanomaterial in a liquid composed of water, a plasticizer and/or a solvent, and then feeding this suspension directly into the extruder during the process. To be able to carry out this process successfully, parameters such as the amount of liquid, the liquid feeding rate or the water-to-solvent ratio, among others, should be taken in account. CNF and ChNC were produced from banana rachis waste and crustacean waste, respectively, whereas CNC were available as a commercial product. Glycerol triacetate (GTA) and triethyl citrate (TEC) were used as plasticizers, dispersing and processing aids. The effects of the liquids used during extrusion, the plasticizers and the nanomaterials in the PLA properties were studied. Furthermore, the effects of the cooling rate during the compression molding and the solid-state drawing on the properties of the PLA nanocomposites were investigated. Additionally, the effect of ChNC on the processing and properties of blown films was evaluated. The results presented in this work demonstrated that the use of water and a solvent during the liquid-assisted extrusion did not decrease the molecular weight of the PLA. It was also found that the feeding of nanomaterials in aqueous or aqueous/solvent suspension resulted in PLA micro-composite with lower mechanical properties than PLA. However, when a nanomaterial was fed together with a plasticizer, its dispersion and distribution into the PLA were progressively improved with increasing plasticizer content. The plasticized PLA nanocomposites showed improved properties compared to their respective counterpart without nanomaterials when the plasticizer content was ≥ 7. 5 wt%. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the properties of PLA can be tailored through the composition of the nanocomposite or during the processing. It was observed that the modification of PLA with only plasticizer in high amounts (20 wt%) resulted in enhanced elongation at break and toughness but it had negative effects on the thermal and mechanical properties; however, the incorporation of nanomaterials minimized these effects. The addition of a small amount of nanomaterial (1 wt%), either CNF, CNC or ChNC, to plasticized PLA resulted in enhanced mechanical properties. It was also demonstrated that the cooling rate during compression molding and the solid-state drawing significantly affected the crystallinity of the PLA nanocomposites and, thus, their final properties. The fast cooling rate during compression molding resulted in more flexible and transparent materials than when a slow cooling rate was used, and as a result, PLA films with different mechanical properties were obtained. The drawing of the PLA/CNF nanocomposite at a drawing temperature slightly above the Tg, a high draw speed and at the highest drawing ratio, resulted in the highest mechanical properties. It was also found that the increased toughness after adding CNF to the plasticized PLA or after drawing the PLA/CNF nanocomposite, was attributed to the occurrence of massive crazing effect as a result of the presence of CNF and its effect on the crystallinity and/or on the spherulite growth. Finally, 6 kg of plasticized PLA nanocomposite with 5 wt% of ChNC was prepared and used as a masterbatch to produce bio-nanocomposite blown films. The nanocomposite material showed easier processability during the film-blowing process when compared with the reference material without nanocrystals. In addition, the nanocomposite blown films exhibited higher tear and puncture strength, lower fungal activity and lower electrostatic attraction properties, which are favorable in packaging applications.   In conclusion, this thesis shows that the liquid-assisted extrusion process is an excellent approach for producing PLA nanocomposites using cellulose and chitin nanomaterials. The results indicated that the addition of these nanomaterials, together with a plasticizer and further processing, can result in PLA nanocomposites with varied properties that can be used for packing applications. It was also shown that the processing technique presented can be a step forward for the large-scale production <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|This {{present study}} reports {{the role of}} {{cellulase}} enzyme in the degradation of nanocomposites. The sodium montmorillonite clay content significantly impacted on the rate of CMC solubilization. Biodegradation behavior of films depends {{on the content of}} nanoparticles, and the decrease of the degradation rate observed in the final stage can be explained to the lower degradability of the MMT-PVA-S-CMC domains that remain in the material. After 4 to 72 h, the variation is almost negligible, nearly zero, as no saccharides and other compounds leached to the solution, as demonstrated before. The reduction of the degradation rate is also influenced by the water uptake ability of these polymers. MMT (0 % to 5 % w/w film) could decrease the WAC% and DED% of PVA/S/CMC/MMT nanocomposite films compared to the PVA/S/CMC films.

In this study, poly (lactic acid) (PLA) bionanocomposites were prepared using the solution casting technique, by incorporating the PLA with the CNW obtained from an oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed no significant changes in the PLA peak positions, which indicates that incorporating the CNW into the PLA did not result in any significant changes in the chemical structure of the PLA. Thermogravimetric analysis, on the other hand, revealed that the bionanocomposites (PLA-CNW) had better thermal stability than the pure PLA. The tensile strength of PLA-CNW increased by 84 % with the addition of 3 parts of CNW per hundred resins (phr), and decreased thereafter. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between the Young's modulus and CNW loading. Elongation at break, however, decreased with the addition of 1 -phr CNW, and remained constant with further addition. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that agglomeration of CNW occurred at 5 -phr loading, consistent with the tensile strength results. Overall, the CNW obtained from OPEFB can enhance the tensile and the thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>bionanocomposites.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
