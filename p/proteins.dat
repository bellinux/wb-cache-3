5|$|<b>Proteins</b> can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular <b>proteins,</b> fibrous <b>proteins,</b> and membrane <b>proteins.</b> Almost all globular <b>proteins</b> are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous <b>proteins</b> are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane <b>proteins</b> often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules {{to pass through the}} cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between <b>proteins</b> whereby the <b>proteins</b> have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted <b>proteins</b> – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such <b>proteins</b> are now known.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding <b>proteins</b> is the DNA-binding <b>proteins</b> that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding <b>proteins</b> seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E

5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for <b>proteins</b> in the TGF-β {{signaling}} pathway. This is a group of <b>proteins</b> that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other <b>proteins,</b> eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of <b>proteins</b> is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor <b>proteins</b> phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor <b>proteins</b> (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD <b>proteins</b> (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these <b>proteins</b> lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related <b>proteins,</b> rather than misfunctioning of the <b>proteins.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although most {{cells have}} other enzymes that can degrade RNA, {{either from the}} 3' or from the 5' end of the RNA, the exosome complex is {{essential}} for cell survival. When the expression of exosome <b>proteins</b> is artificially reduced or stopped, for example by RNA interference, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core <b>proteins</b> of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated <b>proteins,</b> are essential <b>proteins.</b> Bacteria do not have an exosome complex; however, similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase, called the degradosome.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many <b>proteins</b> {{interact}} with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated <b>proteins</b> may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding <b>proteins</b> (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding <b>proteins</b> (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E

5|$|As {{interactions}} between <b>proteins</b> are reversible, and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of different groups of partner <b>proteins</b> to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific <b>proteins</b> is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic <b>proteins</b> Rrp6 and Rrp44 are {{associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different <b>proteins,</b> Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein.

5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated <b>proteins.</b> Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known <b>proteins</b> in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM <b>proteins</b> are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified <b>proteins</b> have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated <b>proteins,</b> including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E
50|$|Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) {{starts the}} {{ubiquitin}}ation process (Figure 1). The E1 enzyme along with ATP binds to the ubiquitin <b>protein.</b> The E1 enzyme then passes the ubiquitin <b>protein</b> {{to a second}} <b>protein,</b> called Ubiquitin carrier or conjugation <b>protein</b> (E2). The E2 <b>protein</b> complexes with a Ubiquitin <b>protein</b> ligase (E3). This Ubiquitin <b>protein</b> ligase recognizes which <b>protein</b> needs to be tagged and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to that <b>protein.</b> This pathway repeats itself until the target <b>protein</b> has a full chain of ubiquitin attached to itself.|$|R

50|$|Glycine {{cleavage}} system H <b>protein,</b> mitochondrial (abbreviated as GCSH) is a <b>protein</b> that {{in humans}} is encoded by the GCSH gene. Degradation of glycine is {{brought about by}} the glycine cleavage system (GCS), which is composed of 4 <b>protein</b> components: P <b>protein</b> (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine decarboxylase), H <b>protein</b> (a lipoic acid-containing protein; this <b>protein),</b> T <b>protein</b> (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring aminomethyltransferase enzyme), and L <b>protein</b> (a lipoamide dehydrogenase). The H <b>protein</b> shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P <b>protein</b> to the T <b>protein.</b> The <b>protein</b> encoded by GCSH gene is the H <b>protein,</b> which transfers the methylamine group of glycine from the P <b>protein</b> to the T <b>protein.</b> Defects in this gene are a cause of nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH). Two transcript variants, one protein-coding and the other probably not protein-coding,have been found for this gene. Also, several transcribed and non-transcribed pseudogenes of this gene exist throughout the genome.|$|R
5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} that over 250 human <b>proteins</b> contain prion-like domains (PrLD).

40|$|Functional <b>protein</b> {{analysis}} often {{calls for}} lengthy, laborious in vivo <b>protein</b> expression and purification, {{and can be}} complicated {{by the lack of}} stability of the purified <b>protein.</b> In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a simplified procedure for functional <b>protein</b> analysis on magnetic particles using cell-free <b>protein</b> synthesis of the catalytic subunit of human cAMP-dependent <b>protein</b> kinase as a HaloTag ® fusion <b>protein.</b> The cell-free <b>protein</b> synthesis systems provide quick access to the <b>protein</b> of interest, while the HaloTag technology provides efficient, covalent <b>protein</b> immobilization of the fusion <b>protein,</b> eliminating the need for further <b>protein</b> purification and minimizing storage-related stability issues.

5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications.

5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} <b>proteins</b> of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like <b>proteins</b> from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these <b>proteins</b> are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two <b>proteins</b> are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated <b>proteins</b> (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete <b>proteins.</b> By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E
40|$|<b>Protein</b> S is a vitamin K-dependent plasma <b>protein</b> {{which serves}} as the {{cofactor}} for activated <b>protein</b> C. <b>Protein</b> S circulates in both an active, free form and in an inactive complex with C 4 b-binding <b>protein.</b> To elucidate the role of <b>protein</b> S in disease states and during oral anticoagulation, we developed a functional assay for <b>protein</b> S that permits evaluation {{of the distribution of}} <b>protein</b> S between free and bound forms and permits determination of the specific activity of the free <b>protein</b> S. In liver disease, free <b>protein</b> S antigen is moderately reduced and the free <b>protein</b> S has significantly reduced specific activity. In disseminated intravascular coagulation, reduced <b>protein</b> S activity occurs due to a redistribution of <b>protein</b> S to the inactive bound form. During warfarin anticoagulation, reduction of free <b>protein</b> S antigen and the appearance of forms with abnormal electrophoretic mobility significantly decrease <b>protein</b> S activity. After the initiation of warfarin, the apparent half-life of <b>protein</b> S is 42. 5 h.

Fifty-seven relatives were <b>protein</b> C (37) or <b>protein</b> S deficient (20). Thromboembolic events occurred in 30 % of <b>protein</b> C deficient and in 35 % of <b>protein</b> S deficient persons, compared with 3 % and 0 % in their normal controls respectively (P < 0. 05). In <b>protein</b> C deficient persons, the median thromboembolic event-free survival was 55 years, while in <b>protein</b> S deficiency this interval was 33 years (P = 0. 047). In the <b>protein</b> C deficient group 64 % of the initial events occurred spontaneously, as did 71 % in the <b>protein</b> S deficient group. Recurrent thromboembolic events were more often associated with concomitant risk factors than the initial events: 64 % and 50 % in persons with <b>protein</b> C or <b>protein</b> S deficiency respectively. These findings suggest a substantial role for these risk factors in triggering thromboembolic events in deficient persons. <b>Protein</b> C antigen and <b>protein</b> S antigen levels were similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic deficient persons.
