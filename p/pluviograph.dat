40|$|Australia {{is typical}} of many {{countries}} in that it has an extensive network of rainfall recording stations which record rainfall data in various forms ranging from a daily time step down to 6 -min resolution. However, while the length of historical daily records is often large, {{there are very few}} 6 -min (<b>pluviograph)</b> records available of significant length. Not only does this lack of significant short time scale data impose a major obstacle in the application of a Monte Carlo approach to risk estimation, it also inhibits the application of rainfall simulation models that use this data for direct calibration. While the advent of numerous stochastic rainfall models provides methods for extending historical rainfall records, without adequate historical rainfall data available for calibration their accuracy is questionable. This paper describes {{the development of a new}} technique which significantly extends the applicability of stochastic point rainfall models that require historical data for calibration. The technique uses a new ‘master–target’ scaling relationship. A model calibration is undertaken at a ‘master’ site with a long <b>pluviograph</b> record, which is then scaled to the ‘target’ site using the information from the target site in form of either a short <b>pluviograph</b> or a daily rainfall record. This approach removes the need for significant <b>pluviograph</b> data at the ‘target’ site and enables the stochastic rainfall model to be applied at sites with either short <b>pluviograph</b> or daily rainfall records. The master–target scaling technique is demonstrated using an existing high-resolution point rainfall model based on wet-dry alternating storm events. Extensive testing using numerous pairs of Australian sites demonstrates its validity...|$|E

40|$|Les théories classiques {{concernant}} les processus générateurs des écoulements rapides permettent mal d'expliquer la soudaineté de la montée de crue dans des petits bassins versants élémentaires, situés sur le versant sud du Mont Lozère (sud du Massif Central, France). Des études portant sur les conditions de genèse de ces crues « cévenoles » ont montré les conditions particulières d'apparition de tels événements: dans ces milieux de moyenne montagne granitique méditerranéenne, les formations superficielles sont peu épaisses et très filtrantes et les abats d'eau considérables; les surfaces saturées, seules capables de générer un ruissellement important, progressent, contrairement à ce qui s'observe habituellement, d'amont en aval des versants; ce type de fonctionnement empêche dans un premier temps toute arrivée d'eau jusqu'au drain principal et ce n'est que lorsque, de proche en proche, l'ensemble du bassin est quasi saturé que la crue se déclenche, entraînant immédiatement des débits importants. Ce modèle de fonctionnement hydrologique se vérifie bien lors de la crue du 22 septembre 1992, responsable de nombreux dégâts et de pertes en vies humaines dans le sud de la France. The {{southern and}} western {{edges of the}} French « Massif Central » are frequently subject to very high floods, known as « crues cevenoles ». They mainly occur during Autumn, and they are characterized by particularly sudden and high flows. Genesis conditions for these types of floods have been studied in a small experimental basin located on Mont Lozère. The Latte River basin (20 ha) is located between 1200 and 1400 m above sea level. Bedrock is granite, covered with sandy, weakly weathered soil, ranging in depth from 0 to 1 m, generally thinner on {{the upper part of}} the slopes. Infiltration capacity is very high, generally over 70 mm. h- 1 (and locally more than 135 mm • h- 1), as indicate by rainfall simulation (COSANDEY et al., 1990). The basin was previously covered with a 70 year old spruce forest but the forest was cut down between 1987 and 1990, without evident effects on flood genesis conditions (COSANDEY and BERNARD-ALLEE, 1992; COSANDEY, 1993). Rainfall is recorded by a network of three <b>pluviographs.</b> Facing the rainy winds coming from the Mediterranean sea, the basin receives about 1900 mrn of annual rainfall; large storm events, particularly in Autumn, can produce more than 400 mm of rain (e. g., in November 1986) with very high intensities (about 60 to 90 mm. h- 1 during half an hour one time every year; an intensity of 170 mm. h- 1 was observed during half an hour during an exceptional rainfall event of 22 September 1992). A V-notch weir was built at the outlet of the catchment, and the discharge measured using a hydrograph. During « cévenoles floods » discharge can reach 2 m 3 • s- 1 • km- 2. Initial observations showed that the rising of the flood waters is always sudden and rapid, suggesting the existence of a threshold above which the flood can occur. Previous studies have shown that this threshold is not simply related tothe amount of rain. For example' in November 1986 discharge remained very slow, after more than 110 mm rain (fig. 3). In another case, in October 1987, 36 mm was sufficient to initiate flooding (COSANDEY, 1993 a). In fact this threshold depends on the total water storage within the basin; it can be calculated as the sum of potential maximum values of both the soil and ground water content and is equivalent to 270 mm (COSANDEY and DIDON-LESCOT, 1990). Flood generation processes include the following:The high infiltration capacity of soils does not allow the formation of Hortonian runoff, despite high intensities of rainfall. Rapid flow can occur only in conformity with the « saturated contributing areas » theory (DUNNE and BLACK, 1970). But here saturaton begins on {{the upper part of the}} slopes where the soils are thinner; runoff which occurs does not reach the stream because it can infiltrate downslope, where the soils are thicker. Saturated surfaces progressively extend downslope; from the moment where the saturated zones join the stream, runoff can contribute to rapid flow. At this moment, flood waters arise suddenly. Figure 4 shows the different steps of the extension of the saturated areas within the basin, and the model of streamflow generation:- When it does not rain, the water table is drained by the stream. - A small amount of rain can be sufficient to make the water table arise in the bottom of the valley; this saturated area becomes a source of rapid flooding, but the volumes remain very small. - If the rain continues, new saturated areas occur where the soil is thinner, mainly upslope. But runoff generated on these areas infiltrates downslope; this runoff may cause a rise in water level and an extension of saturated surfaces, but it cannot join directly to the stream, and it does not contribute to rapid flow. Discharge remains very low. - If the rain persists, saturated areas extend downslope, and finally join the saturated areas in the bottom of the valley. From this moment infiltration is impossible, and runoff generated by the whole slope contributes to the rapid flow directly or as piston-flow. The flood starts to form and increases rapidly; discharge becomes very high. This model allows us to understand why, when floods begin, they are immediately important if rainfall continues. This hydrological pattern has produced about 10 « crues cévenoles » during the studied period (1981 - 1992), with flood peaks around 300 - 500 l• s- 1 (1300 to 1500 l • s- 1 • km 2). During the particularly high intensity event of 22 September l 992, the peak flood reached 1500 l • s- 1 (7. 5 m 3 • s- 1 • km 2). The question is to assess if hydrological processes able to produce such a discharge are the same as those described here, and if the hypothesis of a threshold can be well verified. When the rain tregan on 2 l September at 6 pm, the basin was under very dry conditions. The second part of August and September had been dry. Soil water content was quite low (about 9 mm) and the base flow discharge, 5 l • s- 1, indicates, according to Maillet'law (ROCHE, 1967) a groundwater storage of about 5 mm (COSANDEY. 1993 a) : 256 mm of rain would be needed to reach the threshold of 270 mm. From Monday, 6 pm to Tuesday, 4 : 20 am the amount of rain was about 140 mm with medium intensities. Discharge remained very low (fig. 5; COSANDEY 1993 b). Total soil water content within the basin was about 162 mm. Intensities then became very important, with 65 mm rain in half an hour. A flood occurred, with only a small peak (170 l • s- 1) despite the high value of rainfall intensities. The water storage was about 227 mm, and the threshold had not been reached. The discharge decreased from the moment that rainfall intensities became lower. About 40 mm of rain were needed to reach the threshold, and this was exceeded at 5 : 52 am. A rainfall event with similar characteristics (65 mm in half an hour) then produced a peak flood estimated at 1500 l • s- 1 • km 2, seven times higher than previously reported. Rainfall stopped quickly, and the flow decrease was rapid. Nevertheless a small rainfall event of 10 mm over 15 min was sufficient to produce a peak of 334 l • s- 1, This particularly high rainfall event demonstrated that, despite very high intensities, no important flood can occur when the basin is not completely saturated and the total water content is less than 270 mm. It is important to note that this hydrological pattern concerns a very small (20 ha) first-order basin. Flood genesis conditions are very different downstream, mainly due to the combination of tributary floods...|$|R

A preliminary analysis involving the substitution of nearby stations for the Sydney Observatory Hill record suggests that the method performs well in preserving sub-daily rainfall characteristics across the full range of historical exceedance probabilities. Furthermore, an analysis of the factors which determine whether a daily/sub-daily record at one location is substitutable for that at another location suggests that the two stations must be at similar latitudes, with differences in longitude, elevation and distance to coast found to be less important. The analysis therefore suggests that the non-parametric continuous simulation approach is likely to perform well in representing the historical rainfall pattern at ungauged locations, and as such comprises a potentially viable approach in the generation of extended synthetic sequences for use in rainfall-runoff modelling and design flood estimation.

URBS is a semi-distributed non-linear runoff routing model, and one of several industry models used for design flood estimation for small to very large catchments. The integration of Monte Carlo Simulation and the URBS run-off routing model, here named the URBS-Monte Carlo Simulation Technique (UMCST), has been demonstrated for small to medium sized catchments (Rahman et al., 2002 a). The purpose of the paper is to extend the UMCST to large catchments containing several <b>pluviograph</b> stations and gauging stations.

A theoretical development that relates long-term averaged sediment delivery to the statistics of rainfall and catchment parameters will be presented. The derived flood frequency approach was adapted to investigate the problem of regionalization of the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) across the Basin. SDR, a measure of catchment response to the upland erosion rate, was modeled by two lumped linear stores arranged in series: hillslope transport to the nearest streams and flow routing in the channel network. The theory shows that the ratio of catchment sediment residence time (SRT) to average effective rainfall duration {{is the most important}} control in the sediment delivery processes. In this study, catchment SRTs were estimated using time of the concentration for overland flow multiplying by an enlargement factor which is a function of particle size. Rainfall intensity and effective duration statistics were regionalized by using long-term measurements from 195 <b>pluviograph</b> sites within and around the Basin. Finally, the model was implemented across the MDB by using spatially distributed soil, vegetation, topographical and landuse properties under GIS environment.

This paper shows the results of the analysis of 4 years of precipitations measured with a <b>pluviograph</b> on the study area, and the processing of these data with soft-wares pertaining to ORSTOM (PLUVIOM and ARES). In spite of the short time of the registrations, we could show that the climate is C(w 1) (w) -subhumid temperature with an ustic hydric regime in the classification of Koeppen modified by G. Benavides, as other authors have previously showed, but the total precipitation level for the agricultural season is much lower than what was considered: 620 mm/year instead of 700 / 800 mm/year. With this amount of water, we cannot really expect a very corn high production. In relation to the agressivity of the rain, all the rains give a total value of a Rus. Due to the very brief duration of the rains, the maximum intensity during 5, 10 or 15 minutes should be taken as a reference instead of 30 minutes to calculate the R coefficient. The variability of the events is very high during the same year and between years, difficulting the comparison of agronomic studies. (Résumé d'auteur) ...|$|E
40|$|The point {{rainfall}} model presented extends previous work on event-based rainfall models and overcomes {{some of their}} shortcomings. The model uses event-based data and can be calibrated using rainfall data substantially affected by missing or corrupted values. Particular attention was given to adequately simulating extreme storm rainfall events for use in hydrological risk assessment. The model is capable of simulating the inter-event time, storm duration, average event intensity and intra-event temporal characteristics. Conditioning of the average event rainfall intensity on rainfall duration and time of year is {{a feature of the}} model. Rainfall events are disaggregated using a conditional random walk on a dimensionless mass curve. <b>Pluviograph</b> data in 6 min increments from three Australian capital cities (Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne) was used to calibrate the model parameters. It was found that the constrained random walk parameters were almost identical for the three cities. The model was tested using statistics not used in its calibration and the simulated intensity–frequency–duration extreme rainfall statistics compared very favorably with observed values. In addition, simulated aggregated statistics compared favorably with observed statistics from 30 min to monthly durations. The simulated annual rainfalls significantly underestimated the observed variability for Brisbane and Sydney, whereas satisfactorily reproduced the Melbourne variability. An explanation is offered for these differences. Theresa M. Heneker, Martin F. Lambert and George Kuczera[URL]...|$|E
40|$|The January 2011 {{flash flood}} at Toowoomba, Australia was {{substantially}} larger than other high ranking observed floods. Flood frequency analysis (FFA) is often performed with limited hydrological data so {{the occurrence of}} an exceptional flood provides valuable data. Peak 1. h rainfall intensities during the storm varied from 1000. year ARI across the catchment. Average recurrence interval (ARI) estimates of the resulting streamflow peak discharge were 220. year ARI for a General Extreme Value distribution fitted to the Annual Series and 450. year ARI based on a log-Pearson 3 distribution. An independent method {{referred to as the}} Rational Monte Carlo method (RMC) was developed in order to provide an independent check of the ARI estimate. The RMC method is a simple derived distribution approach where the Rational equation links observed rainfall intensity at a reference <b>pluviograph</b> to the peak flood discharge. The RMC 2011 flood ARI estimate was 475 - 515. years, comparable with the log-Pearson 3 method. Although the proposed method has limitations, the RMC approach shows promise as an alternative and independent FFA method for urban catchments. For all methods, the ARI estimates were sensitive to whether the January 2011 peak discharge was included in the analysis. Overall, the study highlights the inherent difficulty in extrapolating ARI estimates beyond the range of the available historical record. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{aimed at}} automatic detection and digitalisation of the rainfall signal recorded by float based rain gauges on paper strip charts is presented. The algorithm consists of several steps that gradually {{lead to the}} desired goal. The rainfall signal is extracted from the digital image of the strip chart. By cooperation of moving average method and curve edge following method the rainfall curve is detected and uniquely determined - in each image column there is one single point representing the rainfall curve plotline. From the curve plotline high resolution rainfall time series is obtained. Beside image analysis techniques {{in the design of}} the algorithm, the mechanical features of the recording instrument have been taken into consideration. The availability of high resolution rainfall time series is required in many applications, including rainfall classifcation, analysis of extreme rainfall events, calibration of raifall-runoff models, weather prediction models and many research projects. The algorithm has been tesed on 58 <b>pluviograph</b> strip chart images. The comparison between the data obtained by the proposed algorithm and the official data from the Environmental Agency of the Republic of Slovenia shows that the algorithm usually accurately detects the rainfall curve and consequently an accurate rainfall time series is obtained. Since it is not always 100 % reliable it should be used as a component of a system that would enable the inspection of the detected curve and when required it should also enable interactive changing of the parts needing correction...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the throughfall, stemflow, and surface runoff compared to rainfall in a fragment of the Atlantic Rainforest. Rainfall was measured through a rain gauge and a <b>pluviograph</b> installed on a tower above the forest canopy. To quantify the throughfall, six plots of 20 x 20 m were laid, with 25 pluviometers five meters spaced from each other, for each plot. To measure the stemflow, collectors were adapted on the tree trunks having ≥ 15 cm circumference. For the runoff estimate, three plots were established with areas of 13. 71 m², 14. 79 m² and 14. 86 m². The plots were demarcated with galvanized iron sheets. Based on the results, it can be concluded that forests play an important role in the hydrological cycle: from the total precipitation (1182. 6 mm), one portion is intercepted by the tree canopy and evaporated back into the atmosphere; another portion (958. 1 mm) corresponding to 81 % of the total precipitation, passes through the canopy and hits the ground. The stemflow was 10. 8 mm, corresponding to 0. 9 % of the total rainfall. The runoff was 15. 5 mm, which corresponds to 1. 3 % of the rainfall. The vegetation has an important role in reducing the runoff volume on the soil surface...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{scientific and technical}} description of the modelling framework and the main results of modelling the long-term average sediment delivery at hillslope to medium-scale catchments over the entire Murray Darling Basin (MDB). A theoretical development that relates long-term averaged sediment delivery to the statistics of rainfall and catchment parameters is presented. The derived flood frequency approach was adapted to investigate the problem of regionalization of the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) across the Basin. SDR, a measure of catchment response to the upland erosion rate, was modeled by two lumped linear stores arranged in series: hillslope transport to the nearest streams and flow routing in the channel network. The theory shows that the ratio of catchment sediment residence time (SRT) to average effective rainfall duration {{is the most important}} control in the sediment delivery processes. In this study, catchment SRTs were estimated using travel time for overland flow multiplied by an enlargement factor which is a function of particle size. Rainfall intensity and effective duration statistics were regionalized by using long-term measurements from 195 <b>pluviograph</b> sites within and around the Basin. Finally, the model was implemented across the MDB by using spatially distributed soil, vegetation, topographical and land use properties under Geographic Information System (GIs) environment. The results predict strong variations in SDR from close to 0 in floodplains to 70 % in the eastern uplands of the Basin. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Summertime (December–February) {{rainfall}} over northwestern Australia {{has increased}} significantly {{since the middle}} of the twentieth century. As a prerequisite to understanding the observed trend, this investigation examines the broad characteristics of rainfall and identifies the physical mechanisms by which rainfall in the region is initiated. This is achieved using a combination of in situ, spaceborne, and numerical reanalysis datasets. Hourly <b>pluviograph</b> data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) - 3 B 42 dataset show dis-tinctly different diurnal cycles of rainfall in different geographical subregions; near the coast, rainfall rates peak in the midafternoon, whereas inland (near the maximum rainfall trend) the rainfall rate is largest overnight. These data also indicate that most of the summertime rain falls in events lasting 2 – 5 days. Analysis of the ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) demonstrates that convergence into the continental heat low controls the diurnal cycle of rainfall but cannot explain the synoptic variability. Composites of wet and dry conditions from ERA-Interim expose synoptic-scale differences in the envi-ronmental flow. Prior to rain falling in the interior of northwestern Australia, there is a distinct shift in the origins of low-level air parcels, such that air with high convective available potential energy is advected from the tropical maritime regions, rather than from over the continent. Preliminary analysis suggests that these flow changesmay be linked to transient synoptic disturbances such asmidlatitude cyclones andmonsoon lows. Rather than reflecting a large-scale change in the ocean state, these results imply that the observed increase in rainfall may be linked more closely to changes in the synoptic weather systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall-runoff is {{the active}} agent of soil erosion which often {{resulted}} in land degradation {{and water quality}} deterioration. Its aggressiveness to induce erosion is usually termed as rainfall erosivity index or factor (R). R-factor {{is one of the}} factors to be parameterized in the evaluation of soil loss using the Universal Soil Loss Equation and its reversed versions (USLE/RUSLE). The computation of accurate R-factor for a particular watershed requires high temporal resolution rainfall (<b>pluviograph)</b> data with less than 30 -minutes intensities for at least 20 yrs, which is available only in a few regions of the world. As a result, various simplified models have been proposed by researchers to evaluate R-factor using readily available daily, monthly or annual precipitation data. This study is thus aimed at estimating R-factor and to establish an approximate relationship between R-factor and rainfall for subsequent usage in the estimation of soil loss in Cameron highlands watershed. The results of the analysis showed that the least and peak (critical) R-factors occurred in the months of January and April with 660. 82 and 2399. 18 MJ mm ha - 1 h - 1 year - 1 respectively. Also, it was observed that erosivity power starts to increase from the month of January through April before started falling in the month of July. The monthly and annual peaks (critical periods) may be attributed to increased rainfall amount due to climate change which in turn resulted to increased aggressiveness of rains to cause erosion in the study area. The correlation coefficient of 0. 985 showed that there was a strong relationship rainfall and R-factor...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{seasonal}} and inter-annual changes {{exist in}} rainfall amount and intensity in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. These changes {{are expected to}} have significant effect on rainfall erosivity and soil erosion by water, but the magnitude of the impact is not well quantified because of the non-linear and dynamic nature of the relationship between rainfall amount and rainfall erosivity. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} model spatial and temporal variations in rainfall erosivity and impacts on hillslope erosion across NSW. We developed a daily rainfall erosivity model for NSW to calculate monthly and annual rainfall erosivity values by using gridded daily rainfall data for a continuous 53 -year period including a baseline period (1961 – 90) and a recent period (2000 – 12). Model parameters were improved based on their geographic locations and elevations to be truly geo-referenced and representative of the regional relationships. Monthly and annual hillslope erosion risk for the same periods was estimated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. We produced finer scale (100 -m) maps of rainfall erosivity and hillslope erosion through spatial interpolation techniques, and implemented the calculation of rainfall erosivity and hillslope erosion in a geographic information system by using automated scripts so that it is fast, repeatable and portable. The modelled rainfall erosivity values were compared with <b>pluviograph</b> calculations and previous studies, and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency is > 0. 90. Outcomes from this study provide not only baseline information but also continuous estimates of rainfall erosivity and hillslope erosions allowing better monitoring and mitigation of hillslope erosion risk in NSW.

40|$|AbstractFor {{stormwater}} system design, flood estimation {{and many}} other environmental assessment tasks, design rainfall is an essential input. Estimation of design rainfall is generally made using a regionalization technique based on a regional database of observed rainfalls. Many countries have derived their own generalized design rainfall data, which are generally expressed {{in the form of}} intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves. In Qatar, situated in an arid region, the existing IDF data were developed in 1991 using a limited data set. This paper presents the development of new IDF data for the State of Qatar using the method of L-moments and the index regional frequency analysis approach. The daily rainfall data from 32 stations located in Qatar and nearby Gulf countries have been used to form a homogeneous region. It has been found that the Pearson Type 3 distribution best fits the 24 -h duration annual maximum rainfall data in the Qatar region. For the ungauged case, a prediction equation is developed where mean annual maximum rainfall is expressed as a function of climatic and physiographic characteristics. From a leave-one-out validation, it has been found that the developed prediction equation can estimate mean annual maximum rainfall with a median relative error of about 5. 5 %. Finally, an approximate method is used to obtain design rainfalls for other durations due to the limitations of continuous <b>pluviograph</b> data in Qatar. The new set of IDF curves is based on a much bigger dataset than the existing 1991 IDF curves. It is expected that the new IDF curves will have wider application in Qatar and will provide a statistically sound basis for storm water design, flood and environmental studies. The method can be applied to other middle-eastern states and similar arid countries in the world...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in a Pinus elliottii plantation, established in 1984, located in the Rio Negro Forest Research Station- Rio Negro – Paraná, owned by the Paraná Federal University, Paraná State, Brazil. The research objectives were to analyze the correlations between the FMA and FMA+ fire danger indices and the fine fuel moisture, and develop mathematical models to estimate the fuel moisture based on these indices. The meteorological variables were obtained from a SIMEPAR weather station, located 50 km away, and from a <b>pluviograph</b> and a thermo-hygrograph installed in the study area. The dead forest fuels were collected from 30 x 30 cm plots, between 12 noon and 2 : 00 PM, and classified as: AA – surface layer; AB – intermediate layer; AC – lower layer; and B -woody material with 0. 7 to 2. 5 cm diameter. The total fuel load varied from 3185. 50 to 4266. 01 g. m- 2. The fire danger indices were daily calculated and the values obtained in the fuel colleting days were used to calculate the correlations. The correlation coefficients between relative humidity and fuel classes were 0. 42; 0. 36; 0. 32; and 0. 41 for the AA, AB, AC, and B classes, respectively. The correlation coefficients between precipitation and fuel classes were 0. 57; 0. 38; 0. 34; and 0. 15 for the AA, AB, AC, and B classes, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the fuel classes and the FMA+ were - 0. 53; - 0. 56; - 0. 63; and 0. 81 for the classes B, AB, AA, and AC, respectively. The FMA+ was the most efficient variable in modeling development to estimate dead forest fuel moisture...|$|E

Hydrological characteristics of catchments : The systematic description and classification of catchment characteristics has never been adequately treated in any hydrological text. This paper summarises available measures for the quantitative description of catchments and points to aspects of catchment mensuration where deficiencies occur. Measures and definitions of catchment characteristics which have appeared in hydrological literature are described in 5 groups, these being topographical characteristics, vegetation, soils, climatic characteristics, and human effects. The characteristics of a catchment such as the unit hydrograph which are contained in the streamflow record are noted, and areal and temporal variations in characteristics are briefly discussed.

40|$|Assessment of the {{potential}} for mungbean cropping in the Australian monsoon tropics required a model that could predict pre-harvest seed quality from long-term climatic data. Empirical relations between seed quality and pre-harvest weather were developed from field-grown mungbean using 22 sowings over 3 seasons. Seed quality reflected visual symptoms of weather damage expressed as the percentage of undamaged seed. A minimum exposure to rainfall was required before seed quality was reduced. After this minimum was exceeded, the effect of additional rainfall was cumulative and the percentage of unweathered seed decreased proportionally until a maximum was reached whereby all susceptible seed was weather damaged. The percentage of unweathered seed was best predicted {{as a function of the}} cumulative duration of rainfall events. Exposure to at least 300 min of rainfall was required before seed quality was downgraded. Exposure to 4000 min of rainfall was required to reach the maximum threshold. The linear decline in the percentage of unweathered seed was accurately predicted with independent data (r 2 = 0. 84) by a function that combined the cumulative duration of rainfall and the standard deviation of evaporation. This function reflected the weathering process, that is, cumulative exposure to moisture and the extent of drying of the atmosphere between rainfall events. Alternatively, where <b>pluviograph</b> data were unavailable, combining the sum of rainfall events (> 0. 5 mm) with the standard deviation of evaporation and mean daily solar radiation was also highly correlated with the proportion of unweathered seed; accurate predictions were made using independent data during crop ripening (r 2 = 0. 93) and after ripening (r 2 = 0. 72). Weather damage was sensitive to the timing of reproductive development relative to rainfall; adjusting climate variables for cohort-specific exposure removed the confounding effects caused by the daily ripening of pods. Time to flowering was accurately predicted, 2 – 3 days from observed, using mean daily photoperiod and temperature. As expected, rate of progress from flowering to the first ripe pod and crop maturity was dependent on photoperiod, temperature, and moisture availability. The proportion of pods ripe on any day was highly (P < 0. 01) correlated with the proportion of the pod-ripening phase completed...|$|E
