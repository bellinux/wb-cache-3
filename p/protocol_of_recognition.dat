In a sample of 183 bees we pre-selected 100 workers belonging to 12 intra-colonial patrilines and re-identified them by 25 size-free wing characters. Re-identification {{was carried out by}} Self Organizing Map (SOM) reclassification and conventional discriminant analysis (DA) using the <b>protocols</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> (data for training and testing the model are equal or slightly modified by white noise), and prediction (test data are unknown to the model). SOM <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> wing shaping was found to be more robust than that resulting from DA. If the test data were altered by white noise, SOM recognition success was 100 % within a range of 3 % modification which corresponded to the overall measurement error; under these conditions DA success was less than 40 %. The SOM prediction capacity was tested using four test-training data ratios and reached 90 % under a two-step reclassification protocol...|$|R

40|$|Face <b>recognition</b> {{technology}} is <b>of</b> great significance for applications involving {{national security and}} crime prevention. Despite enormous progress in this field, machine-based system is still far from the goal of matching the versatility and reliability <b>of</b> human face <b>recognition.</b> In this paper, we show that a simple system designed by emulating biological strategies of human visual system can largely surpass the state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled face recognition. In particular, the proposed system integrates dual retinal texture and color features for face representation, an incremental robust discriminant model for high level face coding, and a hierarchical cue-fusion method for similarity qualification. We demonstrate {{the strength of the}} system on the large-scale face verification task following the evaluation <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> the Face <b>Recognition</b> Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 2 Experiment 4. The results are surprisingly well: Its modules significantly outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts, such as Gabor image representation, local binary patterns, and enhanced Fisher linear discriminant model. Furthermore, applying the integrated system to the FRGC version 2 Experiment 4, the verification rate at the false acceptance rate of 0. 1 percent reaches to 93. 12 percent.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of rights {{restitution}} as {{an arrangement that}} establishes boundaries, and how those boundaries are translated, challenged, and exceeded. Following the guidelines of International Humanitarian Law and its version contained in the Law of Victims and Land Restitution (1448 / 2011), the Colombian government established a wide network of professionals in charge of registration and reparation for claimants registered as victims of the armed conflict (7, 999, 963 people in April 2016). In these procedures <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and reparation, technologies like forms and protocols become crucial for the mediation of rights restitution. As a starting point, I trace the trajectories <b>of</b> technologies <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and reparation across assistance centres, governmental offices and sessions of psychosocial assistance. I am interested in functionaries and applicants’ experiences <b>of</b> forms and <b>protocols,</b> the procedures <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and reparation, and the circulation of official numbers as narratives of rights restitution. Drawing on Science and Technology Studies, a central concern of this thesis is to ask what technologies <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and reparation assemble. I interrogate the translation of experiences of pain and mobility into numbers and the circulation of those numbers by state representatives. I also explore some of the material forms of organisation developed by registered and unregistered interlocutors, as arrangements {{beyond the boundaries of}} state interventions. I describe how some of those alternative orders translate state interventions and enact spaces of material justice. Instead of reproducing the notion of reparation as a cornerstone of rights restitution in transitional justice societies, I suggest that a different sort of Reparation might occur beyond the boundaries of post-conflict statehood and within its intersections with alternative arrangements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the theme <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in Hegel's account of self-consciousness, {{suggesting that there}} are unresolved difficulties with {{the relationship between the}} normative sense <b>of</b> mutual <b>recognition</b> and phenomenological cases <b>of</b> unequal <b>recognition.</b> Recent readings <b>of</b> Hegel deal with this problem by positing an implicit distinction between an 'ontological' sense <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> as a precondition for autonomous subjectivity, and a 'normative' sense <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> as embodied in rational social and political institutions.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> as {{a link between}} organisations, work and subjectivity. Looking at {{relations}} <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> offers a focus for analysing the multiple ways subjects are being addressed, (re-) positioned or indeed constituted by organisations, {{and a way to}} approach the dialectics of control and resistance. This is especially promising for service work in which interaction and thus intersubjectivity {{is an integral part of}} the labour process even though the work itself may be routinised. The paper first sketches the theoretical place <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> as a concept, then analyses the relations <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in service work, and finally, it explores some empirical examples of labour conflicts in call centres in terms <b>of</b> struggles for <b>recognition.</b> It will be shown how both the inherent contradictions <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and the multiplicity <b>of</b> relations <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> shape labour conflicts in a symbolic and normative way.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in terms <b>of</b> individuals’ capacity for conflict. Our goal is to overcome various shortcomings {{that can be found}} in both the positive and negative conceptions <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> We start by analyzing paradigmatic instances of such conceptions—namely, those put forward by Axel Honneth and Judith Butler. We do so in order to show how both positions are inadequate in their elaborations <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in an analogous way: Both fail to make intelligible the fundamental nexus between relations <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and individuals’ capacity for conflict. We then move on to reconsider aspects of Hegel's view of recognition—ones that, from our viewpoint, have been unjustly neglected in the debate about recognition: his focus on the constitution <b>of</b> relations <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> in conflict and on the status of being an author <b>of</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> On this basis, we then spell out in a more systematic way what we take to be a more convincing conception <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> This puts us in the position to gesture at some consequences of this conception in practical contexts, above all with regard to the justification, role and structure of political institutions...|$|R
