50|$|Between 1938 and 1940 {{the control}} {{trailers}} were all rebuilt into driving motor cars, {{and the doors}} converted to air-operation with passenger <b>push-button</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1964 was {{not only}} the first model for the Barracuda but also the last model year entirely for <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> of the {{optional}} Torqueflite automatic transmission, so the 1964 models were the only Barracudas so equipped. It also marked the first use of the smaller [...] "TorqueFlite 6" [...] (A904) transmission behind a V8.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{increased}} as the new-for-1955 V8 was enlarged from 352 to 374 cubic inches, with a corresponding upgrade in horsepower ratings. A new electronic <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> for the Ultramatic automatic transmission was offered {{as an option}} on the Four Hundred (and Patrician series, standard on Caribbean), the push-buttons located on a pod mounted via a stalk off the steering column. Although sophisticated, it proved troublesome. A simpler column-mounted selector was standard.|$|E
50|$|The flying aircar in Episode 3, {{with the}} <b>push-button</b> <b>controls,</b> {{is based on}} the aircars used by the Pirate Captain's guards in the Tom Baker serial The Pirate Planet (1978).|$|R
50|$|Countertop or bartop {{cabinets}} {{are usually}} only {{large enough to}} house their monitors and control panels. They are often used for trivia and gambling-type games, and are usually found installed on bars or tables in pubs and restaurants. These cabinets often have touchscreen controls instead of traditional <b>push-button</b> <b>controls.</b> They are also fairly popular with home use, {{as they can be}} placed upon a table or countertop.|$|R
50|$|The revised ZL {{series of}} 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; {{it was only}} at the end of 1986 that the {{carburettor}} version of the Fairlane was deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new tail lights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with <b>push-button</b> <b>controls</b> {{at either end of the}} instrument binnacle. The FE series LTD was also released in October 1984.|$|R
50|$|Ten further DG {{class engines}} - nine built by Vulcan Foundry {{and one by}} RS&H - were given 'A'-grade {{overhauls}} to work as trailing B-units for the rebuilt locomotives. These locomotives did not receive new cabs, and as such {{were not to be}} driven in regular service although photographs from this time show these locomotives were sometimes driven in regular service rather than turn a re-cabbed locomotive around. A number of other locomotives of this type also received the updated Westinghouse 26L brake system and NZR designed <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> stand.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time, the Bronco was {{available}} with <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> for its four-wheel drive {{as an option}} starting in 1987. [...] The Bronco carried over the 4.9L inline-six, 5.0L V8, and 5.8L [...] "HO" [...] V8 from 1986. In 1987, the inline-six was given fuel injection, with the 5.8L HO gaining the configuration in 1988. [...] For 1987, two Mazda-produced 5-speed manual transmissions replaced the previous 4-speed (depending on engine); the C6 3-speed automatic was phased {{out in favor of}} the AOD 4-speed automatic and the heavier-duty E4OD 4-speed automatic (the latter becoming the sole automatic in 1991).|$|E
50|$|Prior to mechanisation, {{the locks}} were {{operated}} by capstans, each with four poles, {{which had to}} make seven full revolutions to open or close a gate. Each gate leaf had two capstans, one to open it and another to close it. There were 36 capstans on the flight, and 126 revolutions were required for a boat to travel up or down the complete flight. With the advent of hydraulic rams and <b>push-button</b> <b>control,</b> transit times through the flight have been reduced from just over half a day to 90 minutes. The base plinths of the original capstans can still be seen, although the capstans themselves have been removed.|$|E
50|$|The Mercury Division of Ford Motor Company (later, in 1957, the Lincoln-Mercury Division), {{followed}} suit with its purely mechanical <b>push-button</b> transmission <b>control</b> system in 1957.|$|R
50|$|On many Cadillac {{models of}} the 1950s and '60s, the antenna could be raised and lowered by pulling out or pushing in on the radio's volume control knob. The Lincoln Continental of the late 1960s had <b>push-button</b> <b>controls</b> {{integrated}} into the factory radio. But most cars had a separate control that often was not even located near the car radio. And sometimes the control on early models was not even labeled, e.g., the late 1960s, early '70s Ford Thunderbird control was integrated into a courtesy light module on the dash panel.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{time between}} 1949 and 1950, Musser {{designed}} and built a predecessor to the drum machine, alliteratively called the [...] "Musser Maestro Marimba Metron", or more simply the [...] "Rhythm Machine." [...] The machine, used by Musser to accompany performances and lessons, measures 1.5 feet wide and about 3 feet square. Manufactured using vacuum tube technology, it plays 13 electronically generated rhythmic accompaniments such as the bolero, waltz, rhumba, cha-cha, tango, samba, and beguine. In addition to the pre-set loops, percussion sounds can be activated using <b>push-button</b> <b>controls,</b> which show wear from Musser operating them with his mallets while playing.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{of both the}} sedan and coupe models saw a brand new instrument panel design, with a central gauge cluster (now with a standard engine temp gauge), and more ergonomic driver controls. Fan and windshield wiper controls were now mounted on rotary-style switches {{on either side of}} the instrument panel, and the HVAC controls received a new <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> layout. Other changes included reworked interior door panels. Also, starting in 1986 a driver's side airbag was optional, a rarity then for an economy level car. On Tempo LX and AWD, the interior received chrome and wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Topaz models featured the tachometer-equipped gauge cluster and a front center armrest standard.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{experiments}} in design also benefited Skipjack {{by allowing the}} vessel to be built with improved steel. Areas from the control room (featuring <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> of pneumatic and trim systems), to the anchor (streamlined to reduce drag and flow noise) were changed {{in the development of}} the new submarine. To power the new class, the Westinghouse S5W reactor plant was introduced, the third generation of submarine reactors since the launch of the [...] The improved core life allowed the ship to travel at full power for 90,000 to 100000 mi. Nuclear power had already been employed on the Nautilus and the follow-on Skate class, but the 15,000 hsp plant was such an advance that it entirely changed a submarine's capability. Furthermore, although the S5W reactor was thirty percent bigger than the S1W plant on Nautilus, the reactor compartment on Skipjack occupied but twenty feet of the ship's 252 ft total length. (This reactor proved so successful that it became the [...] "standard" [...] reactor plant for almost all submarines until the Los Angeles class.) Finally, the design of the core was such that it became the new standard of accessibility.|$|E
40|$|The Manufacturing Processes (ME 201) {{class in}} the Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department at Christian Brothers University (CBU) is a {{required}} course for all ME students. This class combines traditional machining, advanced machining (CNC), and rapid prototyping techniques with field trips and hands-on projects. One {{of the highlights of}} this class is the manufacturing bowl {{at the end of the}} semester. Students are divided into four groups to compete in the knowledge of manufacturing. The winning group is selected by means of the double-elimination process. A gaming device that consists of a console and two <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> boxes is created for the competition. Seven sets of multiple-choice questions are created in PowerPoint presentations. Prior to the end of the semester, a final project is assigned to have each group of students design their own trophy for the competition. This project illustrates students ’ creativity, their ability to work as a team and their manufacturing skills. The competition serves as a review of materials covered in the class. It boosts up the interest and motivation of students in the area of manufacturing processes...|$|E
50|$|The cabin of {{the third}} {{generation}} Saga incorporates several major changes and additions. All door cards and dashboard panels are new, and feature faux-stitching texture in some areas. The centre console, air-con vents, glove box, seats, gear lever enclosure and instrument binnacle have also been redesigned. The revised interior door handles have been moved slightly forwards and upwards. Proton has also fitted a new single-DIN head unit on the Standard and Executive variants. The central tunnel cover has been revised and all variants now feature twin USB charging ports behind the handbrake, along with a storage compartment to store the device that is being charged. The <b>push-button</b> <b>controls</b> on the centre console are also new.|$|R

2500|$|... 1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Oldsmobile Fiesta wagons (based on the 88 platform, but {{retaining}} {{most of the}} 1961 wagon's rear styling) {{each had}} their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. [...] Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and trim. [...] Heaters became standard equipment on all models, and the <b>push-button</b> <b>controls</b> were located {{to the right of}} the steering wheel column. [...] Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called [...] "Summer Ventilation", which replaced the pull level type vents. [...] This control panel was located on the left of the steering column. [...] Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch. [...] These cars also sported round dash vents for the A/C airflow deliver. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with [...] "OLDSMOBILE" [...] lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model's nomenclature on the insert.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The study {{examined}} young adult smokers' neural response to graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette packs using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Methods: Nineteen young adult smokers (M age 22. 9, 52. 6 % male, 68. 4 % non-white, M 4. 3 cigarettes/day) completed pre-scan, self-report measures of demographics, cigarette smoking behavior, and nicotine dependence, and an fMRI scanning session. During the scanning session participants viewed cigarette pack images (total 64 stimuli, viewed 4  s each) that varied based on the warning label (graphic or visually occluded control) and pack branding (branded or plain packaging) in an event-related experimental design. Participants reported motivation to quit (MTQ) in response to each image using a <b>push-button</b> <b>control.</b> Whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional images were acquired during the task. Results: GWLs produced significantly greater self-reported MTQ than control warnings (p < . 001). Imaging data indicate stronger neural activation in response to GWLs than the control warnings at a cluster-corrected threshold p < . 001 in medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex. There {{were no significant differences in}} response to warnings on branded versus plain cigarette packages. Conclusions: In this sample of young adult smokers, GWLs promoted neural activation in brain regions involved in cognitive and affective decision-making and memory formation and the effects of GWLs did not differ on branded or plain cigarette packaging. These findings complement other recent neuroimaging GWL studies conducted with older adult smokers and with adolescents by demonstrating similar patterns of neural activation in response to GWLs among young adult smokers...|$|E
40|$|The {{touchscreen}} {{user interface}} is an inherently dynamic device that is becoming ubiquitous. The touchscreen’s {{ability to adapt}} to the user’s needs makes it superior to more traditional haptic devices in many ways. Most touchscreen devices come with a very large array of sensors already included in the package. This gives engineers the means to develop human-machine interfaces that are very intuitive to use. This thesis presents research that was done to develop a best touchscreen interface for driving an industrial crane for novice users. To generalize the research, testing also determined how touchscreen interfaces compare to the traditional joystick in highly dynamic tracking situations using a manual tracking experiment. Three separate operator studies were conducted to investigate touchscreen control of cranes. The data indicates that the touchscreen interfaces are superior to the traditional <b>push-button</b> <b>control</b> pendent and that the layout and function of the graphical user interface on the touchscreen plays a roll in the performance of the human operators. The touchscreen interface also adds great promise for allowing users to navigate through interactive textbooks. Therefore, this thesis also presents developments directed at creating the next generation of engineering textbooks. Nine widgets were developed for an interactive mechanical design textbook that is meant to be delivered via tablet computers. Those widgets help students improve their technical writing abilities, introduce them to tools they can use in product development, as well as give them knowledge in how some dynamical systems behave. In addition two touchscreen applications were developed to aid the judging of a mechanical design competition. M. S...|$|E

50|$|Bush Radio started {{trading in}} 1932. They worked with BWBF on {{producing}} specially adapted sets {{which included the}} Bakelite-cased DAC10 which was issued in 1950. This set had five top-mounted <b>push-button</b> <b>controls,</b> medium- and long-wave preset stations and was smaller and easier to move than the Magnum sets.BWBF collaborated with Roberts Radio in the early 1950s to produce new models suitable for those whose lack of vision meant they had difficulty using a standard set. The use of transistors to amplify sound instead of vacuum tubes meant that the radio could be much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio and was more shock resistant. This advance in technology, coupled with modifications to mainstream sets that improved usability for visually impaired users, resulted {{in a series of}} sets being produced by Roberts from the early 1950s onwards. The R55 issued in 1954 had a turntable mounted into the base of the set for easy turning and also had top mounted controls. The R303, R600 and R505 incorporated both these features and were manufactured in the trademark red leather, specifically customized for BWBF. The R505 issued in 1974 also had a specially adapted waveband switch.|$|R
5000|$|The Fotron was {{a camera}} {{manufactured}} in Glendale, California by the Traid Corporation and sold door-to-door during the 1960s. Aimed primarily at women, it was marketed as a simpler alternative to [...] "complicated" [...] traditional cameras. The Fotron {{had a number}} of innovative features, including a built-in electronic flash, rechargeable battery, motorized film advance, and <b>push-button</b> exposure <b>control.</b> It used standard 828 rollfilm packaged in a proprietary snap-in cartridge. However, due to its high price (ranging from $150 USD to almost $500) and the fact that film had to be returned to the manufacturer for processing, the Fotron is often regarded as something of a scam.|$|R

5000|$|The Royal Futura was {{designed}} by Laird Fortune Covey. A design patent was applied for in 1957 and granted in 1958. The design differs from previous Royal portable typewriters in several ways. The most obvious difference is its curved and aerodynamic shape, {{but there were also}} key construction and materials differences. The Futura had aluminum body panels; this reduced the carrying weight to 22 pounds and provided limited rust protection. In addition to the aluminum body panels, the Futura had a corrugated steel front panel and welded steel internals and frame. The keys were plastic and designed in the recently adopted “Tombstone” style. Two red “Magic Margin” buttons were located on top of the carriage and - on some models - 'tab set' and 'tab clear' keys could be found on the front panel. A plastic red 'Royal' logo also on the front panel doubled as the <b>push-button</b> latch <b>control</b> to open the top of the machine and allow access to the ribbon and internal controls. The Futura had four rubber feet to hold the typewriter in place, an acrylic paper table, and a steel carriage return lever.The standard typeface on all Royal Futura models was [...] "Merit". [...] This typeface was available in Pica (10 characters per inch) and Elite (12 characters per inch). Keyboards were offered in English and French character sets. Other important design features included a 'Carriage Lock Lever' to protect the typewriter during travel by centering and immobilizing the carriage; a 'Ribbon Color Selector' that could be switched from black ribbon to red ribbon to stencil; 'Segment Shift', which allowed for the character basket rather than the carriage to move when the shift key was pressed; and a 'Clear Writing Line' that permitted an unobstructed character view while typing.|$|R
