50|$|The {{drills and}} <b>pipe</b> <b>pushing</b> {{machines}} {{were used to}} bury a series of 3 in diameter pipes, each at a shallow angle to a maximum depth of about 8 ft. Each pipe was about 55 ft long and they were placed at intervals of 25 ft in an overlapping pattern such that {{the lower end of}} the first pipe would end up about 15 feet underground; the next pipe would then be pushed into the ground behind the first so that the upper end of that pipe would overlap with {{the lower end of the}} earlier pipe. The pipes were packed with explosives which when detonated would produce a very effective anti-tank obstacle about 28 ft wide and 8 ft deep with loose soil at the bottom. This ditch would be sufficient to either stop a tank altogether or to force it be exposed to anti-tank weapons for several minutes as it effected a crossing. <b>Pipe</b> <b>pushing</b> machines were used to drill into the approaches to bridges or embankments and left ready for instantaneous demolition.|$|E

50|$|Using {{just a few}} {{parts per}} million of the drag reducer helps to reduce the {{turbulence}} inside the pipe. Because the oil pushes up against the inside wall of the <b>pipe,</b> the <b>pipe</b> <b>pushes</b> the oil back down causing a swirling of turbulence to occur. When the polymer is added, it interacts with the oil and the wall to help reduce the contact of the oil with the wall.|$|R

This is a process often called pipe jacking and is repeated until the Microtunneling machine reaches the reception shaft. As the machine advances, more tunnel liner or <b>pipe</b> is <b>pushed</b> from the starting shaft, through the entry eye. Thus, {{the speed of the}} advancing machine is controlled by the speed at which the pipe is inserted into the entry eye via the extension of the hydraulic rams in the jacking frame.|$|R

50|$|At {{a meeting}} with senior British {{engineers}} at Aldershot, McNaughton suggested that the pipes {{might be used to}} construct surprise obstacles in front of a German advance. This would be accomplished by <b>pushing</b> <b>pipes</b> into the ground at a shallow angle and packing them with explosives ready to be detonated. The pipe could be easily and quickly pushed by a hydraulic jack fitted to a tank transporter, numbers of which were available. According to McNaughton's biographer, John Swettenham, he got the idea of using hydraulic jacks from the bootleggers of Windsor, Ontario who, during the prohibition, <b>pushed</b> <b>pipes</b> from a brewery to other premises where drink could be safely loaded.|$|R
5000|$|... {{eliminates}} the Differential sticking. Differential sticking {{is when the}} drill pipe is pressed against the well-bore wall so that part of its circumference will see only reservoir pressure, while the rest {{will continue to be}} pushed by well-bore pressure. As a result, the pipe becomes stuck to the wall, and can require thousands of pounds of force to remove, which may prove impossible. Because the reservoir pressure is greater than the well-bore pressure in UBD, the <b>pipe</b> is <b>pushed</b> away from the walls, eliminating differential sticking.|$|R
30|$|In {{the motion}} {{procedure}} in Fig.  13, a tube tightening mechanism is also activated. Its conceptual diagram {{is shown in}} Fig. 14. It tightens the front tip of the pipe to prevent backward air leak when the seed is shot. Usually, O-rings are used to prevent air leak from sliding portions. However, O-rings generate abrasion and some dusts could attach to the seed. Therefore, to avoid the generation of dusts, we propose the tightening tube mechanism. It is composed of a silicone rubber tube with cylindrical spacers in its inside, and a fixture with an air channel that provides air pressure to the silicone rubber tube from the outside. First, the <b>pipe</b> <b>pushes</b> the seed into the pipeline at a prescribed position (Fig.  15 a- 1). Next, the air chamber is pressurized and the silicone rubber tube is deformed from its outside (Fig.  15 b- 2), which prevents backward air leak when the nozzle of the pipe blows air to shoot the seed (Fig.  15 b- 3). It does not rub against the nozzle while the nozzle pushes the seed into the pipeline. Only when it is activated does it tightens up the pipe and prevents the backward air leak.|$|R

50|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} socket and seals exist. The most modern is the 'push-joint' or 'slip-joint', whereby the socket and rubber seal is designed to allow the pipe spigot to be, after lubrication, simply pushed into the socket. Push joints remain proprietary designs. Also available are locking gasket systems. These locking gasket systems allow the <b>pipe</b> to be <b>pushed</b> together but do not allow the joint to come apart without using a special tool or torch on the gasket.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} system employing a diffusion-limited sampling module and a direct sampling ion trap for {{quantitative assessment of}} subsurface fluids was developed and field tested. The sampling module is deployable with a cone penetrometer. It can be retrieved and/or remain as an implant for an indefinite time period. The device geometry, comprised of two planar membranes enclosing a diffusion cell, provides good implant ruggedness and reliable service in the field. Also, the sampling module is protected within a <b>push</b> <b>pipe</b> housing to extend implant service life. Subsurface volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors, in nanoliter amounts, diffuse through the sampler membrane wall by a diffusion-limited process that is independent of the soil permeability. Sample vapors are transported to the surface for analysis by direct sampling ion trap, or other analytical devices. Metered pressurized or reduced pressure transport (carrier) gas is utilized for sample transport to the surface. The vapors obtained are a function only of the fluid partial pressure and the vapor conductance of the sampler. Thus, quantitative analytical data is obtained regardless of soil conditions. The sampling module was deployed in the field at Dover Air Force Base at depths of 5 to 8. 5 feet by the US Army Site Characterization and Analysis Penetrometer System (SCAPS). Relatively small 1. 75 inch diameter <b>push</b> <b>pipe</b> and the relatively small vapor samples extracted cause minimal soil disturbance which preserves {{the integrity of the}} sampler subsurface surroundings. Analytical results were obtained for the system sampler operating in real time and as an implant where equilibrium was obtained between sampler interior and the external surroundings...|$|R

50|$|The Ice Pigging method {{occupies}} a ‘middle ground’ {{between two of}} the traditional methods of cleaning pipes; that of ‘flushing’, which involves pumping high velocity water through pipes in order to carry away residue, and pigging, forcing a solid object through the <b>pipe</b> to <b>push</b> away any loose material. Ice Pigging utilises the main principles behind these two methods. An ice-water slurry, typically between 50 and 90% ice fraction is introduced to and removed from pipes with little complication, provided the presence of suitable hydrants and valves. The high ice fraction, lends several attributes which are particularly appealing for application in pigging; It is able to hold itself together under continuous shear. If the ice becomes stuck then given enough time it will just melt and be carried away. It is fairly inexpensive to make. It leaves the pipe walls themselves undamaged, and only removes waste residue. Because Ice Pigging is a relatively quick process (when compared to alternative methods), it can be use for a number of applications including: underground pipes for fresh water and sewage, food manufacturing pipe work and many others.|$|R
30|$|Due {{to the low}} {{attenuation}} of {{low frequency}} wave propagating in the porous media, the low-frequency vibration oil extraction technology has a large effective action radius when it is applied in the oilfield (White 1975). Therefore, {{there is a high}} possibility of overlapping in sphere of action of two technologies. Sometimes, the flowing gel injection area may be covered in the range of vibration oil recovery technique, which may cause certain effect on gelling process, ultimate gel strength and gel plugging efficiency. The whole gel injection process combines the ground mix, <b>pipe</b> injection, <b>pushed</b> into the oil layer, flowing in the pore throats, and achieving the stable gel strength finally. In the gel accelerating stage, the gel strength as well as the injecting pressure and friction factor may sharply increase because of the violent disturbance, which could bring severe problems to gel displacement. The construction success rate may be harmed thereby (Junowicz et al. 1972; Broseta et al. 2000), whereas low-frequency vibration also has the functions of increasing internal fluid contact, shear thinning, and improving the seepage velocity inside the porous media (Ma et al. 1996). Considering the above factors, the composite action mechanisms of two technologies become much complex. Research on change of flowing gel rheological property under low-frequency vibration is important for optimizing the profile control and water plugging effects.|$|R
3000|$|Stable laminar regime At {{high yield}} stresses, yield stress forces become {{dominant}} {{and sufficient to}} suspend the particles in the core (Poloski et al. 2009 a, b). Also, particles close to the <b>pipe</b> wall are <b>pushed</b> by the wall shear stress. This regime {{is characterized by the}} presence of solid particle concentration gradient perpendicular to the flow direction (Poloski et al. 2009 a, b; Yokuda et al. 2009; Turian et al. 1987; Peysson 2004; Doron and Barnea 1996; Ibarra et al. 2014; Najmi et al. 2015; Salama 2000; King et al. 2001). Because of this non-uniform particle distribution, this regime is sometimes referred to as heterogeneous flow regime (Peysson 2004; Doron and Barnea 1996; Ibarra et al. 2014; Najmi et al. 2015). This is the most practical solid transport regime for high viscosity and/or high yield stress fluids.|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} steam pipe used in one heavy oil well in China burst. This failure pipe was investigated and analyzed by macroscopic analysis, material tests (including chemical composition, metallurgical analysis & mechanical property) and fracture surface scanning electronic microscopy(SEM) analysis. Then {{it can be}} concluded that the mechanical properties of the burst pipe accord with related standards, and that the fracture surface is a typical brittle fracture. The herringbone stripes were found on the fracture surfaces and pointed to a fracture source where there were over 1. 6 mm deep mechanical damages on the pipe surface. After micro hardness testing near mechanical damage area and the nearby substrate, {{it was found that the}} toughness of mechanical damage area was low. The expanding diameter of the burst pipe was also investigated. Because the residual water in the <b>pipe</b> was <b>pushed</b> by {{high temperature}} steam when the steam was turned on, the speed of water was very fast, and the stress caused by water hammer were higher than yield pressure of the pipe, which is the internal pressure in the pipe and which could produces a maximum hoop stress in the pipe equal to the yield strength of the pipe material, the pipe would be expanded. The fracture surface is a typical brittle fracture. There are two mechanical damages on the fracture source, and the pipe burst because of the mechanical damages and huge impact of water hammer...|$|R

The foundation of the city took place in 1275 by Grötzingen knight Diepold of Bernhausen, Rudolf I of Germany supported and established the city as a fortification against the winning influence of Württembergian Nürtingen. 1304 Grötzingen is first referred in documents as a town, the inhabitants of former village moved into their walls, the former village fell. In 1337 sold Diepold's son the town Grötzingen to Württemberg.From the 14th to the 16th century Grötzingen was seat of office, among them were Aich, Neckartailfingen, Neckartenzlingen, Neuenhausen and Wolfschlugen.In the Schmalkaldic War, the citizens of Grötzingen had in 1546 sold out their guns because they had not enough money.

5000|$|Dottle can be {{produced}} by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of dottle is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor {{to the creation of}} dottle is propylene glycol or [...] "PG". This innocuous preservative used primarily in aromatic tobaccos can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after drying. Smoking the pipe too fast can also produce a foul tasting liquid that collects {{at the bottom of the}} bowl and in the draft hole resulting in [...] "pipe gurgle"; this can be inadvertently tasted. <b>Pushing</b> a <b>pipe</b> cleaner down the stem can remedy this problem to a point.
