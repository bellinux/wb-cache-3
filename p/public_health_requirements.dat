Methods: Manpower planning of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialists is calculated {{on the basis of}} population and institutional necessities. Data is supplied from the databases of HASUDER, ÖSYM, Turkish MoH, YÖK and the Departments of <b>Public</b> <b>Health’s.</b> Results: There are 520 <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialists and 286 <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialization students in Turkey in 2013. Specialization training is supplied at the 57 departments of <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> Nearly half of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialists’ work for Ministry of Health (51 %), while 47 % of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialists works for universities. Totally 2014 specialists are required for Turkey in 2013. This number will be increased to 2365 in 2023. In this situation there is one specialist per 145. 000 people in Turkey in 2013, while it had to be one specialist for per 37. 537 people. According to our findings there will be a serious lack of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialists in 2018. However if <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialization students quota is increased to 200 per year, <b>public</b> <b>health</b> specialist <b>requirement</b> will be almost completed in the institutions of Ministry of Health in 2023.

These arise from the rarity of human infections, minimal documented experience with test delivery and interpretation, the paucity of established commercial or in-house assays, the lack of clinical material for test development and validation, the high level containment required for handling live virus, the ongoing evolution of the viruses, and the high personal and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> for accurate diagnosis.

The community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) provides {{a picture of the}} <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> in the periodontal field, which is essential for national oral health policy-making and specific interventions. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 4000 individuals among rural, semi-urban, and metro population of Gurgaon District, Haryana State, to find out the oral health status and periodontal treatment needs (TNs) using CPITN index. Results: An inference was drawn from the results that among 4000 participants from all the four population groups' maximum, i. e., 63. 80 % of individuals needed TN 2 whereas 18. 20 % of individuals needed TN 3 and 18. 10 % of individuals needed TN 1.

The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. Methods Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents.

Especially regarding {{health promotion}} in the elderly, general practitioners (GPs) have a key role. Nevertheless, evidence suggests a lack of health promotion by GPs, especially in this age group. The aim of our study was to assess self-perceived attitudes, barriers and facilitators of GPs to provide health promotion in the elderly. METHODS: We performed a qualitative focus group study with 37 general practitioners. The focus group interviews were recorded digitally, transcribed literally and analysed with ATLAS. ti, a software program for qualitative text analysis. RESULTS: Among the participating GPs, definitions of health promotion varied widely and the opinions regarding its effectiveness were very heterogeneous. The two most important self-perceived barriers for GPs to provide health promotion in the elderly were lack of time and insufficient reimbursement for preventive and health promotion advice. As intervention to increase health promotion in the elderly, GPs suggested, for example, integration of health promotion into under and postgraduate training. Changes at the practice level such as involving the practice nurse in health promotion and counselling were discussed very controversially. CONCLUSION: Health promotion, especially in the elderly, is crucial but in the opinion of the GPs we involved in our study, there is a gap between <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> and the reimbursement system. Integration of health promotion in medical education may be needed to increase knowledge as well as attitudes of GPs regarding this issue...|$|E

Spatial information is an important aspect of <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> yet the increasing availability of spatial imagery and location-sensitive applications and technologies has brought location-privacy to the forefront, threatening to negatively impact the practice of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> by inhibiting or severely limiting data-sharing. This study begins by reviewing the current relevant legislation as it pertains to <b>public</b> <b>health</b> and investigates the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> community’s perceptions on location privacy barriers to the practice. Bureaucracy and legislation are identified by survey participants as the two greatest privacy-related barriers to <b>public</b> <b>health.</b> In response to this clash, a number of solutions and workarounds are proposed in the literature to compensate for location privacy. However, as their weaknesses are outlined, a novel approach - the multidimensional point transform - that works synergistically on multiple dimensions, including location, to anonymise data is developed and demonstrated. Finally, a framework for guiding decisions on data-sharing and identifying requirements is proposed and a sample implementation is demonstrated through a fictitious scenario. For each aspect of the study, a tool prototype and/or design for implementation is proposed and explained, and the need for further development of these is highlighted. In summary, this study provides a multi-disciplinary and multidimensional solution to the clash between privacy and data-sharing in <b>public</b> <b>health</b> practice.

40|$|Australia’s current <b>health</b> <b>requirement</b> for {{migration}} {{to this country}} is prejudiced against people with a disability and their families, according to this report.  The Committee report makes 18 recommendations to Government to ensure migration assessment across the visa streams is fairer families where a member is {{a person with a}} disability. These recommendations support changes so that: • The theoretical cost of migration known as ‘significant cost threshold’ is modernised to reflect likely actual costs associated with disabilities or conditions. The committee also recommends that information on the costing methodology be made public. • Where a person does not meet the new updated <b>Health</b> <b>Requirement,</b> some visas provide for a waiver to allow for the assessment of the social and economic contributions made by a prospective immigrant or their families.   • Families including skilled immigrants should not be unfairly disadvantaged under the <b>Health</b> <b>Requirement</b> {{as a result of a}} family member having a disability – the ‘one fails, all fail’ rule. • For offshore refugee applicants who have a disability or other health condition, compelling and compassionate visa waivers are relevant considerations, including those applying on a family reunion basis.   • Australia’s migration legislation distinguishes between conditions which may impose a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> risk versus those linked to disability...|$|R
