50|$|This species {{closely resembles}} <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear,</b> {{although}} it has slightly more black on the tail and back, and on the head. The sexes are similar in appearance, a fact first documented by Christensen (1974). A 2010 study found that Cyprus wheatear differs from <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> in fourteen external morphometric characters.|$|E
50|$|The song is distinctive, {{and very}} {{different}} from that of <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear,</b> resembling an insect. It consists of a series of high-pitched buzzing bursts.|$|E
50|$|The Cyprus {{wheatear}} or Cyprus <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe cypriaca) is a small, 14-15 cm long passerine {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae. It was formerly treated as a subspecies (race) of <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> but Sluys and van den Berg (1982) argued that the form deserved full species status, on the basis of differences in biometrics and especially song, and the lack of sexual plumage dimorphism in cypriaca.|$|E
50|$|Oystercatcher, curlew, lapwing, skylark, cuckoo, <b>wheatear,</b> <b>pied</b> flycatcher, siskin and {{hawfinch}} {{are just}} some of the 94 species of birds seen in the area. There are a large variety of butterflies in the countryside around the village, most notably the nationally rare pearl-bordered fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary due to the mixture of upland, woodland and meadow habitats that are found. Common blue, wall brown, speckled wood, and small copper can also be regularly seen as well as many of the more common butterflies. There are many mammals in the area too, red squirrels, roe deer, foxes and badgers can all be regularly seen in woodland.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe pleschanka) is a wheatear, a small insectivorous {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (family Muscicapidae). This migratory central Asiatic wheatear occurs from the extreme southeast of Europe to China, and has been found wintering in India and northeastern Africa. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> has a {{wide range}} across Eastern Europe and Western Asia and is common across that range. There are {{estimated}} to be somewhere between 96,000 and 420,000 individuals in Europe. As Europe forms 5 to 24% of the global range, the total population may be in the region of 400,000-8,400,000 individuals. The population is believed to be stable with no particular threats so the bird is rated as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] by Birdlife International.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> {{is rather}} shy but is {{conspicuous}} when spotted. It is not gregarious and single birds or pairs {{are found in}} rough, rocky countryside. It likes to perch on a bush or rock, alert and looking around and bobbing its tail up and down. When it spots a prey item it swoops {{down to the ground}} briefly to pick it up before returning to its perch. Its diet consists of small invertebrates such as ants, grasshoppers, beetles, flies and moths and their larvae, spiders and mites, and seeds are also eaten.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Oenanthe {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek oenos (οίνος) [...] "wine" [...] and anthos (ανθός) [...] "flower". It refers to the {{northern}} wheatear's return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom. Pleschanka is the Russian name for the <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> and refers to the white cap (plesch is a bald spot on the head). [...] "Wheatear" [...] is not derived from [...] "wheat" [...] or any sense of [...] "ear", but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of [...] "white" [...] and [...] "arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.|$|E
5000|$|The male is a boldly marked white-and-black bird. The white crown {{tinged with}} brown {{contrasts}} with the black face and throat and white rump. The female is browner, and the head is washed with sandy buff. Females are darker than the females of the northern wheatear, look smaller and show less white on the rump. The tail feathers are white with characteristic black markings, which form an inverted black [...] "T" [...] pattern that resembles {{the tail of the}} black-eared wheatear. This 14 cm bird nests in open, stony, sparsely vegetated regions, laying four to six eggs in a hole, under a stone or in a rock crevice. The <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> primarily eats insects but will also take seeds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> is {{native to}} Southeast Europe and Western Asia. The {{breeding}} range extends from Romania and Bulgaria to Siberia, Altai and Mongolia and southwards to the Caucasus, Transcaspia, Turkestan, Iran and Afghanistan. It occurs at altitudes of up to 2,000 m in the Altai and up to 3,000 m in the Tien Shan.It migrates to Northeast Africa, passing through Southwest Asia on the way. In the breeding season it is found in rough open country, steppes with scant vegetation, stony slopes and hilly country. In its winter quarters it is found in similar locations with rock, scree and on plains with thorny scrub. It sometimes visits grassy areas and gardens. It has occurred as a vagrant in Italy, Heligoland and Scotland.|$|E
50|$|Kaliakra (Калиакра) is a {{long and}} narrow {{headland}} in the Southern Dobruja region of the northern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, 12 km east of Kavarna, 60 km northeast of Varna and 65 km southwest of Mangalia. The coast is steep with vertical cliffs reaching 70 m down to the sea.Kaliakra is a nature reserve, where dolphins and cormorants can be observed. It sits on the Via Pontica, a major bird migration route from Africa into Eastern and Northern Europe. Many rare and migrant birds can be seen here in spring and autumn and, like much of this coastline, is home to several rare breeding birds (e.g. <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> and a local race of European shag). The rest of the reserve also has unusual breeding birds; saker falcon, lesser grey shrike {{and a host of}} others.|$|E
50|$|The crown, nape {{and neck}} of the adult male <b>pied</b> <b>wheatear</b> are pale brown, the {{feathers}} having pale tips and white bases. The mantle and scapulars are black with buff tips to the feathers. The back, rump and upper tail-coverts are creamy-white. The central pair of tail feathers are black with white bases but the rest are white with black tips, the outer pair having rather more black than the rest. There is a narrow buff-coloured line extending {{from the base of}} the beak to over the eye and the lores, ear coverts, chin, throat and upper breast are black. The rest of the breast is buff, the belly creamy-buff and the underwing coverts and axillaries are black tipped with white. The wing feathers are black with tips and edgings of creamy-buff. The bird moults in late summer and by the following year, the edges of the feathers are abraded and the crown and nape are white and the mantle, scapulars and wings black. The beak, legs and feet are black and the eyes dark brown. The length is about 5.75 in.|$|E
