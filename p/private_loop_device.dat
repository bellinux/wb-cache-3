40|$|This memo was {{discussed}} at the T 11 Working Group on Friday, April 12 th. The group agreed that I should present it at the SCSI- 3 Streaming Commands working group in May and return to T 11 with a resolution in June. The goal is to add the text, if any, to the Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) <b>Private</b> <b>Loop</b> <b>Device</b> Attach (PL-DA) {{that is needed to}} insure support for tape devices on FC-AL. The T 11 working group recognizes that there is both a need for such support and also an opportunity for tape vendors to attempt to resolve any existing protocol or implementation oddities that may be characteristic of current SCSI tape drives. Tape Issues This paper describes one approach to adding SCSI- 3 tape support to FC-PLDA. It includes a summary of the relevant tape and FC-AL issues, suggests a scenario for handling bit errors on the loop, and lists some features of SCSI and FC-AL that must be supported for this scenario to work properly...|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, the <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> is erroneously {{referred}} to as loopback device, but this term is reserved for a networking device in operating systems. The concept of the <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> is distinct.|$|R
50|$|A <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> {{may allow}} {{some kind of}} data {{elaboration}} during this redirection. For example, the device may be the unencrypted version of an encrypted file. In such a case, the file associated with a <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> may be another pseudo-device. This is mostly useful when this device contains an encrypted file system. If supported, the <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> is {{in this case the}} decrypted version of the original encrypted file and can therefore be mounted {{as if it were a}} normal filesystem.|$|R
50|$|Various Unix-like {{operating}} systems provide the <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> functionality using different names.|$|R

50|$|The {{compressed}} <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> (cloop) is {{a module}} for the Linux kernel. It adds support for transparently decompressed, read-only block devices. It {{is not a}} compressed file system.|$|R
50|$|Cryptoloop {{can create}} an {{encrypted}} file system within a partition or from within a regular file {{in the regular}} file system. Once a file is encrypted, it can be moved to another storage device. This is accomplished by making use of a <b>loop</b> <b>device,</b> a pseudo device that enables a normal file to be mounted {{as if it were}} a physical device. By encrypting I/O to the <b>loop</b> <b>device,</b> any data being accessed must first be decrypted before passing through the regular file system; conversely, any data being stored will be encrypted.|$|R
5000|$|... /dev/loopN {{is often}} {{restricted}} in deployments (as <b>loop</b> <b>devices</b> use kernel threads {{which might be}} a security issue), which restricts the ability to mount disk images. A work-around is to use FUSE.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} a new electrosurgical instrument (Lap <b>Loop</b> <b>device)</b> that amputates the uterine corpus from the cervix during a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) and to compare the time required for cervical amputation with traditional methods. Methods: This comparative trial was conducted at the University of Louisville and Norton Healthcare Hospitals, Louisville, KY. The patients comprised 29 women scheduled for hysterectomy for benign conditions. All patients underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. The Lap <b>Loop</b> <b>device</b> was used in 17 patients to section the cervix. Conventional methods with either laparoscopic monopolar scissors or Harmonic scalpel were used in 12 patients...|$|R

50|$|Roland and Digitech loop pedals {{entered the}} market in 2001, {{around the same time}} DJ mixing gained popularity. When the 2002 Repeater {{introduced}} real-time studio <b>looping,</b> <b>looping</b> <b>devices</b> became affordable enough for aspiring at-home composers to enjoy.|$|R
50|$|Other methods exist; {{the method}} laid out before {{is the one}} {{implemented}} by StegFS, {{but it is possible}} to steganographically hide data within image (e.g. PNGDrive) or audio files- ScramDisk or the Linux <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> can do this.|$|R
50|$|Wagner's {{performances}} {{in several countries}} (Switzerland, UK, Sweden, Japan, Australia, USA) have gained him international recognition for his unique and musical approach to live looping. His main instrument is an electric guitar which he processes with <b>looping</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Unix {{or similar}} systems the dd {{program can be}} used to create disk images, or to write them to a {{particular}} disk. It is also possible to mount and access them at block level using a <b>loop</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{operating}} {{systems such as}} Linux and macOS have virtual drive functionality built-in (such as the <b>loop</b> <b>device),</b> while others such as older versions of Microsoft Windows require additional software. Starting from Windows 8, Windows includes native virtual drive functionality.|$|R

50|$|The {{intelligibility}} of an individual's own vocalization can {{be adjusted}} with audio-vocal reflexes using their own hearing (<b>private</b> <b>loop),</b> or it {{can be adjusted}} indirectly in terms of how well listeners can hear the vocalization (public loop). Both processes are involved in the Lombard effect.|$|R
50|$|Party lines remain {{primarily}} {{in rural areas}} where local loops are long and <b>private</b> <b>loops</b> uneconomical when spread sparsely over a large area. Privacy is limited and congestion often occurs. In isolated communities, party lines have been used without any direct connection to the outside world.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though her}} musical career {{started with a}} band, she {{made a name for}} herself with her One Woman Orchestra Show Project, which was created after a long process of self-dedication to <b>loop</b> <b>devices.</b> She records all {{required}} sounds for the song live on stage, and creates the live cover by means of <b>loop</b> <b>devices.</b> Her show was of completely live covers of world known hits. Her name was known by larger audience when she was seen on famous TV shows Disko King as guest musician and Turkey Got Talent as semi-finalist contestant. Her talent took attention of many musicians as well as Gökhan Kırdar’s {{who is one of the}} first DJs of Turkey. Meanwhile, she took stage with him as guitarist, she performed her Byb Berlin show in many national and international festivals.|$|R

50|$|The {{files on}} a live CD ISO image can be {{accessed}} in Microsoft Windows with a disk image emulator such as Daemon Tools, or in Unix variants by mounting a <b>loop</b> <b>device.</b> Later versions of Windows (i.e. Windows 8 and later), and software available for earlier versions, allow an ISO to be mounted as a volume.|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} microwave synthesizers based on type-II loops has been analyzed, with a realistic {{description of the}} <b>loop</b> <b>devices.</b> In this way it has been possible to simulate incidental frequency modulation, which is commonly observed in practice. A 2 - 3 GHz synthesizer with a JK flip-flop phase detector has been simulated and measured with very good agreement...|$|R
5000|$|Even by {{the early}} 90's, when {{dedicated}} loop machines first went on sale, the term [...] "live looping" [...] {{had not yet been}} coined. The first dedicated <b>loop</b> <b>device</b> was the Paradis LOOP Delay. The Paradis and other models had volatile memories, forcing composers to develop fresh loops live in front of their audiences — and thus, live looping came into existence.|$|R
50|$|J.D. Walter (born July 2, 1967 in Abington, Pennsylvania), is a {{progressive}} jazz vocalist who currently lives in New York City. Walter's style has drawn comparisons to Betty Carter, Nat King Cole, and Milton Nascimento.
