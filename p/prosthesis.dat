5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the <b>prosthesis</b> is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his <b>prosthesis.</b> Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental <b>prosthesis</b> that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or composite <b>prosthesis.</b> The most commonly used <b>prosthesis</b> designs are the Austin Moore <b>prosthesis</b> and the Thompson <b>Prosthesis.</b> More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar <b>prosthesis)</b> has also been used. The monopolar <b>prosthesis</b> has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{deficiency}} at birth, disease or trauma, {{there are people who}} have no limbs from the hip joint downwards. These people have no possibillity of locomotion without the use of other devices such as wheelchairs or hip disarticulation <b>prostheses.</b> As these <b>prostheses</b> are used by people of all ages, people who are different in their grade of physical activities and their weights, the <b>prostheses</b> are subject to different stresses related to these different circumstances. The European Level 2 Draft Standard prEN 12523 : 1966 “External limb <b>prostheses</b> and external orthoses- requirements and test methods ” contains strength requirements for lower limb <b>prostheses.</b> These requirements shall be verified, where appropriate, by the application of the International Standard IS 0 10328 “Prosthetics- Structural testing of lower limb <b>prostheses</b> ” and ISOPDIS 15032 “Prosthetics: Structural testing of hip prostheses”.

40|$|Conclusions: Provox Vega <b>prostheses</b> {{demonstrate}} good short-term feasibility, {{and their}} optimized airflow-resistance design offers laryngectomy patients indwelling voice <b>prostheses</b> with more choices in outer diameters without sacrificing (too) much in voice quality. Objectives: Technological progress enables improvement of in vitro airflow characteristics of voice <b>prostheses</b> {{and design of}} voice <b>prostheses</b> with smaller outer diameters. This could potentially improve voice quality in users of Provox 2, and avoid diminished voice quality in users of <b>prostheses</b> with smaller outer diameters. Methods: This was a prospective clinical phase I/feasibility study of three newly designed indwelling voice <b>prostheses</b> (Provox Vega 22. 5 (Provox 2 successor), 20, and 17 Fr). Assessments consisted of patients' self-reported voice and speech, perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis, maximum phonation time, loudness, speech rate, pull-out force and adaptation of the tracheoesophageal (TE) puncture to smaller diameter voice <b>prostheses.</b> Vega 22. 5 was assessed in 15 patients (all Provox ActiValve users, observation period 3 weeks), and 16 patients with Vega 20 / 17 (2 weeks each). Results: No voice <b>prostheses</b> problems were encountered. Half of the patients with Vega 22. 5 preferred that for its better voice quality.

40|$|Background: New joint {{replacement}} <b>prostheses</b> {{are being}} continually {{introduced into the}} market. The underlying purpose of {{the introduction of new}} devices is to improve patient outcomes. This study was undertaken to determine how many new <b>prostheses</b> were associated with improved patient outcomes. Data were obtained from a comprehensive national database. Outcome analysis was performed on all new hip and knee <b>prostheses</b> introduced into the market between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007, and used on at least 100 occasions. The findings were compared with the combined results of the three best performing established hip and knee <b>prostheses</b> with a minimum duration of follow-up of five years. The principal outcome measures were the rate of revision per observed component years and the time to first revision, with use of Kaplan-Meier estimates of implant survivorship. Results: Most <b>prostheses</b> introduced into the market during the study period were used on fewer than 100 occasions. Analysis of those that had been used in a sufficient number of procedures showed that 27 % (nine of thirty-three) of the hip replacements and 29 % (eight of twenty-eight) of the knee replacements had a significantly higher rate of revision than the established <b>prostheses.</b> None of the newer <b>prostheses</b> had a lower rate of revision than the established <b>prostheses.</b> Conclusion: This study indicates that there was no benefit to the introduction of new <b>prostheses</b> into this national market during the five-year study period.
