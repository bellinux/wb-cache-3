5|$|In mathematics, {{a matrix}} is a {{rectangular}} array of numbers or other data. In physics, a matrix {{model is a}} <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves {{the notion of a}} matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> flower, {{such as an}} orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Pocock {{lists the}} vernacular names ye and nigálya ponya (Nepal); thokya and thongwa (Limbu); oakdonga or wakdonka and woker (Bhotia); saknam sunam (Lepcha). Nigálya may {{originate}} from the Nepali word निङालो niṅālo or nĩgālo meaning a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> small bamboo, namely Arundinaria intermedia, but also {{refers to a}} kind of small leopard, or cat-bear. The word pónya may originate from the Nepali word पञ्जा pajā meaning claw, or पौँजा paũjā meaning paw of an animal. Nigálya pónya may translate to bamboo claw or paw.|$|E

The spin-statistics theorem binds two <b>particular</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> combinatorial symmetry with two <b>particular</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> spin symmetry, namely bosons and fermions.|$|R
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard {{is hard to see}} in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster {{was based on the}} wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E

5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster {{was based on the}} wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|The same {{experimental}} data shows that time {{as measured by}} clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the meaning}} of a {{compound}} noun is a specialization of {{the meaning of}} its head. The modifier limits the meaning of the head. This is most obvious in descriptive compounds (known as karmadharaya compounds in the Sanskrit tradition), in which the modifier is used in an attributive or appositional manner. A blackboard is a <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> board, which is (generally) black, for instance.|$|E
