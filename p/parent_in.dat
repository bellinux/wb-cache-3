40|$|<b>In</b> 2004, <b>parents</b> and {{teachers}} from selected Title I schools in Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS), Miami, Florida were surveyed {{to determine the}} extent to which their perceptions of school quality in high-performing high-minority high-poverty schools compared to the perceptions of <b>parents</b> {{and teachers}} <b>in</b> low-performing high-minority high-poverty schools. Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission. (2) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to assessment and monitoring of students achievement. (3) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to parent/community participation. (4) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to safe and orderly environment. (5) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to teachers taking part in decision-making and teachers having control over portions of the school 2 ̆ 7 s instructional budget. (6) Significant differences existed in the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools and the perceptions of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to increased opportunities for student. (7) <b>Parents</b> <b>in</b> the low-performing schools rated 7 of the 9 attributes as needing attention, except for High Expectations (x¯ = 4. 06) and Emphasis on Basic Skills (x¯ = 4. 25). (8) Teachers in low-performing schools rated 9 of the 11 attributes of school effectiveness as needing attention except for Clear and Focused Mission (x¯ = 4. 21) and Professional Development (x¯ = 4. 06). (9) <b>Parents</b> <b>in</b> high-performing schools rated their schools higher compared to <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> low-performing schools.

40|$|The rate {{of adult}} and {{childhood}} obesity has doubled {{and in some}} countries tripled worldwide {{over the last few}} decades. The rise can likely be attributed to an assortment of factors such as an increase in the amount and accessibility of soft drinks and processed foods (increased energy intake) and less time spent exercising inside and outside of schools (decreased energy expenditure). A body of research exists on the public’s awareness of obesity in the United States, but limited research has been done on the perceptions of obesity in Japan. A survey using the Qualtrics software was sent to <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Japan and in Colorado to understand the differences between perceptions in these locations (n= 71, Colorado= 47, Japan= 24). T-tests and an ANOVA test revealed that <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Colorado view obesity as a greater problem than <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Japan. <b>Parents</b> <b>in</b> both Colorado and Japan believed increased energy intake (fast food, junk food, and soda consumption) significantly contributed to childhood obesity and believed that parents were primarily responsible for reducing the problem. Fewer <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Japan believed watching television and playing video games and spending time on the Internet contributes to childhood obesity than <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Colorado. More <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Japan believed a lack of places to exercise contributes to childhood obesity than <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Colorado. Tax based interventions were least supported, and school-based interventions were most supported by <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> both locations.

5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to occupational injury compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a <b>parent</b> <b>in</b> the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

One area that has not evaluated the relevance of the TPB is that of therapists 2 ̆ 7 attitudes for involving <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> treatment. The current study examined the feasibility of Ajzen 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior for explaining whether or not therapists include <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> treatment. Participants in this study were therapists with at least one-year experience in treating youth under the age of 11. It was hypothesized that all of the variables of the TPB would be significant predictors of therapists 2 ̆ 7 intention to include <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> treatment. Overall, results of this study provided support for the role of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting therapists 2 ̆ 7 inclusion of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> youth treatment although subjective norm was not a significant predictor of intention and subsequent inclusion of <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> youth treatment. Results of posthoc analyses reveal that there are several therapist demographic characteristics that are related to TPB constructs. Specifically, coursework and training in Family Systems was found to be related to positive attitudes about involving <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> treatment. Also, therapists in practice settings were much more likely to intend to include <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> youth treatment than those in school settings. In addition, therapists 2 ̆ 7 estimate of the percentage of the percentage of time others in the field include <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> youth related treatment was significant predictor of their ratings of subjective norm. These results highlight the importance of the relationship between therapist training and orientation and attitudes toward parental involvement. They also highlight the importance of examining precursors to the development of TPB constructs. Clinical implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
