40|$|Description: <b>Perennial</b> <b>sowthistle</b> is a vigorous, deep-rooted perennial, {{spreading}} by {{seeds and}} creeping roots. The plant contains a bitter, milky juice. Stems branch only {{near the top}} of the plant. Lower leaves grow up to a foot long and are deeply lobed. Upper leaves are smaller, often unlobed, clasp the stem, and are slightly toothed. The smooth, erect flowering stems can grow up to 4 - 6 feet tall. <b>Perennial</b> <b>Sowthistle</b> rhizomes (horizontal underground stems) can spread more than 6 feet in one growing season and in established stands, the roots can reach up to 10 feet deep. New plant shoots can emerge from rhizomes buried up to 2 feet deep. Flowers, stalks, and bracts are covered with gland-tipped hairs. The flowers open two to three hours after sunrise and close around noon. A flowering stalk may have 20 seed heads during the flowering season, which lasts from June to September, though usually only a few flower at the same time. The plant may produce nearly 10, 000 seeds per year. Impacts: Sowthistle can have a negative impact on rangelands, pastures, wastelands, roadsides, cultivated fields, and disturbed areas. This species can cause economic losses in cropland due to reduced crop yields...|$|E
40|$|Three new {{polycyclic}} ethanones, named alternethanoxins C-E, {{were isolated}} {{together with the}} well-known and closely related alternethanoxins A and B, from the solid culture of Alternaria sonchi, a fungal pathogen proposed for <b>perennial</b> <b>sowthistle</b> (Sonchus arvensis L.) biocontrol. Alternethanoxins C-E were characterized by spectroscopic methods (essentially NMR and HRESI MS) as 2 '-dihydroxymethyl- 2, 5, 6, 6 '-tetrahydroxy- 3 '-methoxy-biphenyl- 3 -carboxylic acid methyl ester, 1, 4, 6, 9, 10 -pentahydroxy- 7 -methoxy- 6 H-benzo[c]chromene- 2 -carboxylic acid methyl ester, and 7, 9 -dihydroxy- 2 -methoxy- 9 H- 4, 8 -dioxa-cyclopenta[def]phenanthrene- 5 -carboxylic acid methyl ester. When assayed on leaf segments of weeds (Sonchus arvensis and Elytrigia repens), alternethanoxins A and C showed phytotoxic activity inducing notable necrotic lesions. Alternethanoxins C and D possess notable antimicrobial activity when tested against Bacillus subtilis (MIC 10 μg/disc) and Candida tropicalis (MIC 25 μg/disc). Alternethanoxins A and B had low activity against these microbes, while alternethanoxin E was inactive...|$|E

40|$|Field pea can {{be grown}} {{on a wide range}} of soil types, from light sandy to heavy clay. Field pea has {{moisture}} requirements similar to those of cereal grains. However, peas have lower tolerance to saline and water-logged soil conditions than cereal grains. Peas most often will die after 24 to 48 hours in a water-logged condition. Poorly drained and saline or alkaline soils The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. should be avoided when growing peas. Field peas are most often grown on recrop following small grain with residual nitrogen levels of 30 to 40 pounds per acre. Being a legume, field pea will fix the majority of required nitrogen if the proper rhizobia are present. Residual nitrogen will also be present for the succeeding crop. Fields that have a history of perennial weed problems such as quackgrass, Canada thistle, <b>perennial</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> and field bindweed should be avoided. Residual herbicides such as Tordon, Finesse, Amber, Ally, Peak, Assert, and Curtail will severely damage pea seedlings. These herbicides can remain in the soil from two to five years after application, and consulting the label of these herbicides for rotational restrictions prior to seeding pea is a must. Dry peas are a cool-season annual crop, classified as a grain legume or pulse. Dry peas emerge and perform well planted in a variety of seedbeds including direct seeding into grain residue. Dry peas typically are grown following winter wheat o...|$|E
40|$|Weeds infest {{economically}} important crops causing marked {{losses in}} agrarian production, forests, and ornamental heritages. Weed pests, including parasitic plants, have always being recognised {{as one of}} the most serious agricultural and environmental problems due to competition with the growth of agrarian crops and forest plants by subtraction of water, nutrients, light and by the serious obstacles they represent for agronomic activities. A number of weed management strategies have been followed in agriculture production, including mechanical, cultural, chemical, and biological strategies. The use of soil physical mechanical and cultural methods do not provide a satisfactory solution to weed problems. On the other hand, the use of chemical pesticides differing widely in respect to spectrum, unit activity, crop safety, toxicology, and environmental effects has increased herbicidal resistance and environmental and toxicological concerns raise a question mark over their large scale use. Consequently, many efforts were focused on the development of alternative strategies based on the use of natural products and in particular on the use of fungal phytotoxins alone as natural herbicides and/or in combination with fungal producers in a more efficient and integrated management. Fungal phytotoxins are secondary metabolites that belong to different classes of naturally occurring compounds. They play an important role in the induction of disease symptoms in agrarian and forest plants and weeds. This thesis reports on the isolation, purification and chemical and biological characterization of phytotoxins produced by four fungi proposed as potential mycoherbicides for the biological control of some noxious weeds: a) Diaporte gulyae and D. kongii, fungi proposed as potential mycoherbicides of Carthamus lanatus L. ssp. lanatus, a widespread winter-growing annual weed of both pastures and crop throughout Australia introduced from the Mediterranean region. b) Alternaria sonchi, fungus evaluated as a possible biocontrol agent of Sonchus arvensis L., commonly called <b>perennial</b> <b>sowthistle,</b> a plant species considered to be an important weed in Europe and North America as it infests many habitats such as cultivated fields, roadsides, pastures and rangelands, railway embankments, and lawns. c) Phoma chenopodiicola, fungus proposed as potential mycoherbicide for the control of Chenopodium album (common lambsquarters or fat-hen), one of the most successful colonizing species, which has been reported to infest plantations of sugar beets, potatoes, maize, cereals, and vegetables all over the world...|$|E
