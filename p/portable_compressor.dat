At 40 ft a winze was sunk 30 ft and a small underhand stope, 16 ft by 21 ft, produced ore valued from $18.00 to $40.00 per ton. Fifty feet below, a crosscut was driven to the vein, and a drift along the vein extended north 50 ft. The last 15 ft showed a vein 4 ft to 6 ft aide with 3 ft of quartz and sulfides.

40|$|Operators {{of natural}} gas {{pipeline}} systems routinely reduce line pressure and discharge gas from pipeline sections to ensure safe working conditions during maintenance and repair activities. Typically, operators block the smallest possible linear section of the pipeline and depressurize it by venting gas to the atmosphere. In 2004, an estimated 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane was vented to the atmosphere during routine maintenance and pipeline upsets. Using pump-down techniques to lower gas line pressure before performing maintenance and repair activities is {{an effective way to}} reduce emissions and yield significant economic savings. Pipeline pump-down techniques involve using in-line compressors either alone or in sequence with portable compressors. Using in-line compressors is almost always justifiable because there are no capital costs, and payback is immediate. The cost-effectiveness of also using a <b>portable</b> <b>compressor</b> to increase gas recovery, however, depends greatly on site-specific factors and operating costs. Another alternative is to install an ejector. An ejector is a venturi nozzle that uses high-pressure gas as motive fluid to draw suction on a lower pressure gas source, discharging into an intermediate pressure gas stream. The ejector can be installed on vent connections up and down stream of a partly closed valve, or between the discharge and suction of a compressor which creates the necessary pressure differential. Regardless of the pump-down technique selected, emission reductions are directly proportional to how much pipeline pressure is reduced before venting occurs. On average, up to 90 percent of the gas in the pipeline can be recovered for sale instead of being emitted. Pipeline pump-down techniques are most economical for larger volume, higher pressure gas lines and work most effectively for planned maintenance activities and cases in which sufficient manifolding exists to connect a <b>portable</b> <b>compressor.</b> Many Natural Gas STAR Partners have realized significant economic savings by using pump-dow...|$|E

Some systems even cool the water before it enters the system. This improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water, the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water. From this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{request of}} freshwater in coastal areas due to intense anthropization has intensified {{the research on}} saltwater intrusion. A sustainable groundwater management requires the estimation of some fundamental aquifer parameters (such as hydraulic conductivity) and their variability in order to quantify the magnitude and direction of groundwater fluxes. In case of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers also the vertical variability of groundwater quality is fundamental since seawater is characterized by elevated density and viscosity with respect to freshwater and this feature induces density driven flow within the aquifers. For these reasons there is the need of cost- and time-effective techniques to define real physical parameters and dynamics of the aquifer. In this study we present the methodology developed via straddle low pressure packers to characterize simultaneously vertical hydraulic gradients, permeability, and groundwater quality in standard fully penetrating piezometers. The methodology uses two inflatable packers to isolate a window of 0. 2 m. The original instrument has been modified by positioning a Levelogger LTC Solinst within the sampling window. The Levelogger monitors head, temperature and electrical conductivity every 1 second. In line with the packers is connected a centrifuge pump with a flow controller. The system is set at the desired depth within the piezometer and the packers are inflated by a <b>portable</b> air <b>compressor.</b> Before to start the pumping test, the inflated packers system is left to stand until the piezometric equilibrium, monitored by phreatimeter, is reached. Once the piezometer equilibrium is restored and the point head measurement is recorded, a constant rate pumping test is performed using a flowmeter; or whenever the flux is very low, the outflow rate can be monitored by a litre counter and chronometer. The methodology has been applied on several piezometers of the regional monitoring network of the Emilia-Romagna Regio. The 2 ” piezometers are fully screened with a geotextile sock instead of gravel pack, to prevent short-circuits during the pumping tests. The Levelogger LTC records simultaneously the piezometric drawdown induced by pumping and any variations in temperature and electrical conductivity within the aquifer window isolated by the packers. From these data, the equivalent freshwater head and intrinsic permeability values can be derived. During the pumping test the piezometric head can also be monitored by Leveloggers placed {{above and below the}} packers; this allows to verify if there is any pressure drop within the piezometer due to a defective isolation of the packers. Finally, groundwater sample can be collected as soon as the pumping test has completed without removing the straddle packer. The use of a Hydrolab flow cell connected to the Hydrolab MS- 5 probe also permits to acquire in situ the other hydrochemical parameters (i. e. dissolved oxygen, pH, and redox potential), which are not recorded by the Levelogger. The results of pumping test obtained using the packers system have been compared with the intrinsic permeability calculated by pedotransfer formulas. The comparison shows a general agreement along each piezometer profile. Although, the major discrepancies have been found in peat layers, where the grain size characterization is particularly challenging due to the organic nature of these sediments. The proposed methodology is relevant for a detailed characterization of coastal aquifer parameters and flow dynamics. Application of this integrated method permits to simultaneously perform groundwater sampling, groundwater quality control and aquifer testing. Intrinsic permeability and multilevel equivalent freshwater heads can be easily calculated from acquired data and vertical gradient in the aquifer can be highlighted. Moreover this technique makes the data available during the monitoring phases and it can be integrated with other techniques of vertical investigations. It is a cost- and time-effective technique that is able to optimize the phase of aquifer characterization with the phase of groundwater monitoring and sampling. The major issue associated with the presented technique is the hydraulic tightness of the packers that has to be verified before each measure; once that is done, the methodology allows multilevel groundwater sampling in a single monitoring campaign...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Meenu Padmanabhan and Savithramma P. Dinesh-Kumar 1 Corresponding author ([savithramma. dinesh-kumar@yale. edu](mailto:savithramma. dinesh-kumar@yale. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION The {{inherent}} RNA silencing {{mechanism in}} plants has been effectively manipulated {{as a tool}} for the targeted down-regulation of genes. Numerous methods have been employed to initiate this homology-based RNA degradation process, but all rely on the activity of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) corresponding to the gene of interest. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has gained acceptance as the tool of choice for transient induction of silencing. It involves creation of engineered viruses carrying sequences corresponding to the host gene to be silenced. Infection leads to synthesis of viral dsRNA, an intermediate step in viral replication. This activates the anti-viral RNA silencing pathway, resulting in down-regulation of the host gene transcript. While several VIGS vectors have been developed, the Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) provides the most robust results in terms of efficiency, ease of application, and absence of disease symptoms. Engineered TRV vectors carrying host-derived segments are transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is then introduced into the plant. This protocol outlines a simple procedure for introducing the TRV-based binary vectors pTRV 1 and pTRV 2 into solanaceous plants such as *Nicotiana benthamiana* and *Solanum lycopersicon* (tomato), as well as *Arabidopsis*. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol is an updated version of [Delivery of dsRNA into Plants by VIGS Methodology]([URL] (Burch-Smith et al. 2006 a). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** - *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*, strain GV 2260 or GV 3101, containing pTRV 1 - *GV 2260 is ideal for silencing in N. benthamiana, whereas GV 3101 is used for tomato and Arabidopsis*. - *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*, strain GV 2260 or GV 3101, containing pTRV 2 alone (empty plasmid; negative control), pTRV 2 with a fragment of the *phytoene desaturase* gene (PDS; positive control), or pTRV 2 with a fragment of the target gene - *To ensure efficient VIGS, use of both positive and negative controls is advised. PDS silencing leads to a visible bleached phenotype that can be easily scored (Fig. 1) *. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Silencing of the phytoene desaturase gene (PDS) using VIGS. N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium containing either the empty vector TRV 2 (TRV 2 -Empty Vector) or TRV 2 with a PDS fragment (TRV 2 -NbPDS) and photographed 12 d post-infiltration. Plants with the empty TRV vector appear similar to healthy uninoculated plants, whereas TRV 2 -NbPDS-inoculated plants have newly emerged leaves with the photobleached phenotype characteristic of PDS silencing. - Infiltration medium - Luria Broth (LB) liquid medium containing appropriate antibiotics - Plant of interest, e. g., *N. benthamiana* (four-leaf stage), *S. lycopersicon* (two-leaf stage), or *Arabidopsis* (three- to four-leaf stage) ### Equipment - Air <b>compressor,</b> <b>portable</b> (e. g., Campbell Hausfeld) (for spray inoculation; see Step 6. v) - Airbrush, artist’s (e. g., Paasche V- 180 or equivalent) (for spray inoculation; see Step 6. v) - Beaker, plastic, 500 mL (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. vii) - Centrifuge - Desiccator, 240 -mm diameter (Bel-Art Products) (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. ix) - Incubator preset to 26 ¡C - Gloves, latex (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. iii) - Growth carts - Razor blade (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. ii) - Shaker - Spectrophotometer - Syringe, needleless, 1 mL (for syringe infiltration; see Step 6. i) - Vacuum pump (Fisher-Biotech FB-DVP- 0352 or equivalent) (for vacuum infiltration; see Step 6. ix) ### METHOD **Preparing Agrobacterium** 1. Inoculate *Agrobacterium* GV 2260 or GV 3101 containing the TRV 1 and TRV 2 vectors in LB containing appropriate antibiotics. Grow the culture overnight at 26 ¡C with shaking. - *Five milliliters of Agrobacterium culture is sufficient to inoculate three to four plants. The culture volume can be scaled up {{based on the number of}} plants to be used for silencing*. - Collect the cells by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 - 30 min. Resuspend the *Agrobacterium* pellet in infiltration medium. - Adjust the OD 600 to 1. 0 for *N. benthamiana* infiltration, 1. 5 for *Arabidopsis* infiltration, or 1. 5 - 2. 0 for tomato infiltration. If the vacuum infiltration method (see Steps 6. vii- 6. x) is used for introducing *Agrobacterium*, adjust the OD 600 to 0. 4 for pTRV 1 and 0. 2 for pTRV 2. - Incubate the cultures at room temperature for 3 - 6 h. - *A minimum of 3 h ensures sufficient activation of the Agrobacterium Vir genes that enhance transformation efficiency*. **Infiltration of Agrobacterium** 5. Mix the *Agrobacterium* cultures containing TRV 1 and TRV 2 1 : 1 just before infiltration. 6. Introduce *Agrobacterium* into the leaves of the plants of interest using one of the following methods: *Use the spray inoculation or vacuum infiltration methods for VIGS in tomato plants*. - Syringe infiltration: - i. Load a 1 -mL needleless syringe with the *Agrobacterium* mixture. - ii. Using the corner of a razor blade, gently nick the underside of the lower two leaves of the plant. - iii. Place the mouth of the syringe on the nick. Create a seal on the other side of the leaf by placing a finger from the other gloved hand just beneath the nick. - iv. Using minimal pressure, inject the *Agrobacterium* culture into the leaf. Repeat this step until the two lower leaves has been completely infiltrated. - *When performing multiple silencing experiments, take care to avoid cross-contamination. Use fresh gloves and syringes for each infiltration*. - Spray inoculation: - v. Load the *Agrobacterium* solution into an artist’s airbrush that is attached to a pressure compressor set to 80 psi. - vi. Spray the ventral side of the two lower leaves from a distance of ~ 8 in. for 1 - 5 sec. - Vacuum infiltration: - vii. Transfer the culture into a 500 -mL beaker. - viii. Turn the plant upside down. Submerge the plant completely inside the *Agrobacterium* solution. - ix. Place the beaker containing the submerged plant inside a vacuum desiccator attached to a vacuum pump. - x. Evacuate the chamber using a maximum vacuum of 29. 5 cm Hg for 90 sec. 7. Grow the plants in growth carts. Maintain at an ambient temperature of 25 ¡C (for *N. benthamiana*) and ~ 21 ¡C (for tomato and *Arabidopsis*). - *For *N. benthamiana*, VIGS efficiency is high under continuous light, whereas a 16 -h light/ 8 -h dark cycle is ideal for tomato and *Arabidopsis*. * 8. Visualize the VIGS phenotype 6 - 10 d post-infiltration. - *The upper (i. e., uninoculated) leaves of plants infiltrated with the positive control (TRV 2 -PDS) should develop a bleached phenotype indicating efficient silencing (Fig. 1). Plants infiltrated with the TRV 2 empty plasmid should resemble healthy uninoculated plants*. 9. Quantify the RNA levels of the silenced genes using northern blot hybridization or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Uniform silencing is not observed. **[Step 8]** - **Solution**: Multiple factors can affect the efficiency of VIGS: - 1. Growth conditions: Agrobacterium transformation efficiency is optimal at 16 ¡C- 21 ¡C, whereas VIGS efficiency for N. benthamiana is good at ~ 23 ¡C- 25 ¡C. Tomato plants show drastically reduced VIGS efficiency at temperatures above 21 ¡C. For *Arabidopsis*, short day conditions (8 h light/ 16 h dark) are suboptimal for VIGS induction. - 2. Age of the plant: If the plants are older than the stages indicated above, this can lead to a decrease in efficiency. - 3. Gene fragment chosen for silencing: Fragments of 300 - 1500 bp have been used successfully to induce VIGS. Silencing efficiency is reduced below 300 bp, whereas with longer fragments there is a strong possibility of the insert being lost from the recombinant virus. Different gene fragments can show variability in VIGS efficiency. Try to insert fragments from different regions within the same gene. ### DISCUSSION Elucidation of plant gene function has conventionally employed the use of stable insertions in the gene of interest. Homology-based silencing techniques have proven to be an attractive alternative that can overcome some of the limitations seen with gene knockouts. dsRNA can be introduced into plants either as stable hairpin-RNA-synthesizing transgenes or by infection with recombinant viruses that carry segments of plant genes (Baulcombe 1999; Wang and Waterhouse 2002). The advantage of VIGS is that it precludes the need for laborious and time-consuming plant transformation. It is possible to silence multiple classes of closely related genes, as well as genes where true knockouts are embryo-lethal. It is also more amenable to high-throughput studies and has been used successfully in model and non-model host systems (Lu et al. 2003; Burch-Smith et al. 2004; 2006 b; Constantin et al. 2004; Fofana et al. 2004; Ding et al. 2006). TRV has been perfected as a VIGS vector: It provides robust silencing, has a broad host range, can infect meristematic tissue, and produces only mild disease symptoms (Ratcliff et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002; Burch-Smith et al. 2006 b). Using Agrobacterium to introduce TRV to the host also overcomes the need for cumbersome in vitro transcription of viral RNA or biolistic delivery. Recently, the Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus has been adapted for VIGS in *Arabidopsis* and provides robust silencing following simple mechanical inoculation with a plasmid-carrying engineered virus (Pflieger et al. 2008). Despite these advantages, it must be noted that VIGS provides only transient silencing and can only lead to reduced transcript accumulation and not a complete loss of transcript. ### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS VIGS work in the Dinesh-Kumar lab was supported by NSF. ### REFERENCES 1.
