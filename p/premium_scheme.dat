40|$|With {{the share}} of {{renewable}} energies within the electricity sector rising, improving their market (i. e. inclusion in the allocative processes of the electricity market) and system integration (i. e. enhanced responsibility for grid stability) is of increasing importance. To transform the energy system efficiently while ensuring security of supply, {{it is necessary to}} increase the alignment of renewable electricity production with short- and long-term market signals. By offering plant operators a premium on top of the electricity market price, premium schemes represent a potential option for achieving this, and have been implemented by several EU member states. This paper focuses on the case study of the German market <b>premium</b> <b>scheme,</b> which has been adopted as part of the 2012 amendment of the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Building on an evaluation of early experiences, we discuss whether the market premium in its current design improves market and/or system integration, and if it seems suitable in principle to contribute to these aims (effectiveness). Also, potential efficiency gains and additional costs of “administering integration” are discussed (efficiency). While market integration in a narrow sense (i. e. exposing renewables to price risks) is not the purpose of the German <b>premium</b> <b>scheme,</b> it has successfully increased participation in direct marketing. However, windfall profits are high, and the benefits of gradually leading plant operators towards the market are questionable. Incentives for demand-oriented electricity production are established, but they prove insufficient particularly in the case of intermittent renewable energy sources. It seems therefore unlikely that the German market <b>premium</b> <b>scheme</b> in its current form can significantly improve the market and system integration of renewable energies. To conclude, we provide an outlook on alternative designs of premium schemes, and discuss whether they seem better suited for addressing the challenges ahead...|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. We {{consider}} the universal prediction {{problem in the}} context of an insurance game. Imagine the natural frame work of an insurance company where we assume only two players are in the insurance game: insurer and insured. In each round, the insurer sets a <b>premium</b> <b>scheme</b> to be paid by the insured to pay for the losses incurred to the insured. Losses are assumed to be integer valued i. i. d random variables. The setup and framework of this thesis are from [1]. There is no information about the underlying distribution of the losses but the underlying distribution is assumed to belong to a known class of distributions P. Losses can be unbounded as well and the game proceeds for an in nite number of rounds. The insurer can observe the losses without setting premiums for a nite time, but is required to enter the game with probability 1 no matter what the (unknown) source is. The objective is to set <b>premium</b> <b>scheme</b> such that the probability that the loss exceeds the premium can be made arbitrarily small over the in nite time window. Collections of distributions which allow such premium schemes are called insurable, and were completely characterized in [1]. Using their characterization, we show the insurability of the collection MH of distributions that are monotone and whose entropy is bounded by a given H > 0. For the collection MH, we propose an insurance scheme that grows super exponentially in the number of rounds the game has gone on thus far and show that it is essentially the best we can do...|$|E

40|$|Germany {{has been}} a leader in {{governmental}} support for renewable energies, which now represent about 27 % of electricity generation. In 2012 (voluntary) / 2014 (obligatory), the country changed from a xed Feed-In Tari (FIT) to a Market <b>Premium</b> <b>Scheme</b> (MPS) for wind power projects. One aim of this adjustment was to align the supply of generated wind electricity with the demand for it, e. g. through more system-friendly wind turbine technology choices. However, based on a wind investment model, I show that the MPS fails to convey strong enough incentives to project developers to alter their investment decision. Furthermore, I analyze an additional change in the reference location model, as it plays an integral part in both the xed FIT and the MPS. The investment model indicates that such a policy manages to incentivize the deployment of more system-friendly wind power technologies. Additionally, I consider a policy approach that is optimized with respect to a future energy system. This policy provides investors with even stronger incentives to adapt their technology choices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} real options method to analyse the defer option value and optimal {{investment}} timing for solar photovoltaic projects in China. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to examine investment behaviours under different market systems and support schemes. This paper further investigates the interaction of technological progress and support schemes. Four scenarios are designed, and the corresponding real options models are established. In the case study, we find that electricity market reform enhances the defer option value in the short term but makes the owners of solar PV projects postpone their investment. Nevertheless, the government can stimulate investment by implementing appropriate support schemes. Additionally, the impacts of different support schemes vary according to the market system. The impacts of feed-in tariffs and price premiums are similar in a regulated market but are different in a free market. The price <b>premium</b> <b>scheme</b> greatly promotes the defer option values in the short term, but the feed-in tariff scheme excels in the long term. A feed-in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected execution time and its variance than the price premium.

40|$|The double ageing of the {{population}} leads to income redistribution from future to present generations as net payments to social health insurance are negative at young age and positive at old age. Economists arguing in favour of flat health insurance premiums combined with ageing provisions often neglect {{the transition from the}} pay-as-you-go to funded system. Using a generational accounting approach we analyze a reform to funded premiums, taking into account the transition. Furthermore, we implement a tax-transfer scheme designed to protect low income persons facing higher payments in the <b>premium</b> <b>scheme.</b> Our calculations reveal that under the current pay-as-you-go system German social health insurance burdens future generations by almost 30 percent of GDP. Funding could reduce this burden to 5 percent of GDP but would involve higher payments up to 700 Euro p. a. for the present generations. A delay of the reform would increase the burden for future generations again and benefit baby boomers born before 1970. We conclude from a public-choice perspective that {{it will be difficult to}} implement even a delayed reform to a more funded health insurance system.

40|$|Offshore wind {{projects}} require large investments. Therefore, {{they currently}} need governmental support to become competitive and economically attractive for investors. There {{is a general}} consensus that a feed-in <b>premium</b> <b>scheme</b> would be most adequate to support offshore wind generation in the North Sea. With increasing distance from shore, scarcity of adequate cable routes, and an increasing need to reduce cost, cross-border projects between two or more North Sea states come into discussion. After discussing different support schemes, we argue that existing nationally oriented instruments have to be amended to become applicable to cross-border projects envisioned in the North Sea. In order to support our arguments quantitatively, we introduce a novel optimization framework that is able {{to account for the}} impact of implementing different types of feed-in premium based wind supporting schemes (generation-based and capacity-based) {{on the development of the}} offshore grid in the North Sea region. For a given level of support for wind development, an optimal plan includes the grid and offshore wind capacities. The transmission capacities are set in such a way that the congestion revenue collected throughout the life time of the project pays off the investment cost of building the grid. At the same time, the remuneration of the offshore wind farms pays off the unsubsidized initial investment cost of building the wind farms, provided that the premium level is selected adequately. Numerical simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and appraise the quality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper will end with an outlook of how such a joint support scheme might be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Germany changed {{renewable}} remuneration {{for wind}} power from a fixed Feed-In Tariff (FIT) to a floating Market <b>Premium</b> <b>Scheme</b> (MPS) in 2012. One {{aim of this}} adjustment was to better align the supply of generated wind electricity with the demand for it, e. g. through more system-friendly wind turbine technology choices. In energy systems with a high share of variable renewable energies, such turbines produce a higher share of their production at lower wind speeds and thus can {{reduce the need for}} alternative flexibility options like back-up capacity, storage, grid extensions and demand side measures. However, based on a wind power investment model, I show that the MPS fails to convey strong enough incentives to project developers to significantly alter their investment decisions as long as these base their investments on current electricity market price profiles and are limited by their access to risk-averse project finance. One reform proposal to support the installation of system-friendly turbines is a change in the production volume-based benchmark approach which plays an integral part in both the fixed FIT and the MPS. The investment model indicates that such a revised policy can incentivize the deployment of moderately more system-friendly wind power technologies at some locations. An alternative option is to shift to a production value-based benchmark approach. It directly reflects the future additional market value of system-friendly turbines in today's remuneration structure. Thus, this approach sets incentives also for investors without perfect foresight - or with financing constraints - to deploy more systemfriendly turbines that meet the requirements of power systems with increasing shares of wind power...|$|E
