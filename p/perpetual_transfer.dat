Three great 16 th-century {{structural}} changes are analyzed: {{the process of the}} <b>perpetual</b> <b>transfer</b> of tutelage of the Orders to the Portuguese Crown; the introduction of individual service as a means of servants gaining access to the Military Orders; and the adoption of statutes dealing with purity of blood and occupation...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} three select examples of avant-garde poetry books—Mayakovsky’s and Rodchenko’s "About This" (1923), Mayakovsky’s and Rozhkov’s "To the Workers of Kursk" (1924 - 7) and Nezval and Teige’s "Alphabet" (1926), all illustrated by photomontages or diverse techniques involving photographic material. By way of three distinct case studies, it examines the avant-garde photo-poetry {{works from the}} angle of the bioscopic book, a concept envisaged in a programmatic manner by El Lissitzky in 1923. Through historically contextualized close readings, the analysis proposes that the 1920 s bioscopic book should be understood as a theoretical, if not visionary, concept of a visual technology approximated in the series of experiments within the avant-garde photo-poetry genre. The dissertation conceptualizes the bioscopic book as an alternative cinematic apparatus through examining its materiality and dynamic conceptual design. By elaborating on different avant-garde “programs,” embodied in the medium’s conceptual design, the analysis demonstrates how these three selected examples, despite being differently designed apparatuses, all invite the reader/viewer to operate as a producer by joining the collective authorship of the poet and graphic designer in conducting <b>perpetual</b> <b>transfer</b> from one medium to another. In managing such interpretative transduction from one semiotic system to another, this dissertation argues, the reader/viewer both takes part in the topography of the bioscopic book and becomes a part of its conceptual-material circuit. The reader/viewer participates in the re-creation of the cinematic “projection” by setting the alternating current of the bioscopic book in motion. I argue that the bioscopic book is a technology “programmed” to function as a “suggestion apparatus” for a two-way communication between the different media and the reader/viewer, who herself becomes a channel, a medium, an active “influencing machine,” a prosumer. The dissertation offers a theory of the bioscopic book concept as a technology for 1) the formulation and re-production of “montage thinking” as a new cognitive model by which we interact with the outside world, 2) the augmentation of intermedial and interpersonal dialogue, and 3) the transformation of readers/viewers into prosumers...|$|E

60|$|And it was then, just then, {{that there}} arose in Rome that unpremeditated change in its form of {{government}} {{which resulted in the}} self-assumed dictatorship of Cæsar, and the usurpation of the Empire by Augustus. The old Rome had had kings. Then the name and the power became odious--the name to all the citizens, no doubt, but the power simply to the nobility, who grudged the supremacy of one man. The kings were abolished, and an oligarchy was established under the name of a Republic, with its annual magistrates--at first its two Consuls, then its Prætors and others, and occasionally a Dictator, as some current event demanded a concentration of temporary power in a single hand for a certain purpose. The Republic was no republic, as we understand the word; nor did it ever become so, though their was always going on a <b>perpetual</b> struggle to <b>transfer</b> the power from the nobles to the people, in which something was always being given or pretended to be given to the outside class. But so little was as yet understood of liberty that, as each plebeian made his way up into high place and became one of the magistrates of the State, he became also one of the oligarchical faction. There was a continued contest, {{with a certain amount of}} good faith on each side, on behalf of the so-called Republic--but still a contest for power. This became so continued that a foreign war was at times regarded as a blessing, because it concentrated the energies of the State, which had been split and used by the two sections--by each against the other. It is probably the case that the invasion of the Gauls in earlier days, and, later on, the second Punic war, threatening as they were in their incidents to the power of Rome, provided the Republic with that vitality which kept it so long in existence. Then came Marius, dominant on one side as a tribune of the people, and Sylla, as aristocrat on the other, and the civil wars between them, in which, as one prevailed or the other, Rome was mastered. How Marius died, and Sylla reigned for three bloody, fatal years, is outside the scope of our purpose--except in this, that Cicero saw Sylla's proscriptions, and made his first essay into public life hot with anger at the Dictator's tyranny.|$|R
