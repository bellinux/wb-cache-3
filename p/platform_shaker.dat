30|$|The {{extent of}} cell death was {{measured}} by the method by Baker and Mock (1994). In this method, the samples from both control and treated leaf tissues were treated separately with 1  ml 0.25 % solution of Evans blue and the samples were further incubated on a <b>platform</b> <b>shaker</b> at 27  °C and 80  rpm for 20  min. The samples were washed with deionized water in order to remove the traces of the dye from leaf tissues. For the removal of tissues bound dye, the samples were transferred to a 1.5  µl centrifuge tube and treated with 1.5 % aqueous sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The samples were crushed with mortar and pestle and the homogenates thus obtained were then diluted with 0.5 % deionized water and were vortexed for 30  s. The samples were further transferred to the fresh tubes and centrifuged at 9000 g for 3  min.

40|$|Influence of shaking on peritoneal {{transfer}} in rats. To determine {{the role played}} by stagnant peritoneal fluid layers in the diffusion of solutes between peritoneal cavity and blood, we measured peritoneal transfer of urea, creatinine, [14 C]-L-glucose and protein in anesthetized rats shaken at varying rates on an orbital <b>platform</b> <b>shaker.</b> The diffusion transfer rates of the low molecular weight solutes increased dramatically with shaking, with near maximal values obtained at a shaking rate of 250 RPM. The permeability · area product (PA) for each of the low molecular weight solutes increased about fourfold with rapid shaking while the PA of protein increased by only about 50 %. It seems likely that shaking increased PA primarily via reduction of the thickness of stagnant peritoneal fluid layers, although increases in surface area or changes in tissue permeability cannot be excluded with certainty. We conclude that stagnant fluid layers probably are the rate limiting step in diffusive peritoneal transfer of low molecular weight solutes in stationary rats...|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} {{the amount of}} cell death in tomato leaves induced by FA treatment, the methodology of Baker and Mock ([1994]) was followed. The FA-treated and control leaf tissues were submerged in 10 ml plastic beakers containing 1 ml of 0.25 % Evans blue and incubated on a <b>platform</b> <b>shaker</b> at 27 °C and 80 rpm for 20 min. The beaker contents were poured into a small Buchner funnel and the tissues were rinsed well with deionized water until no more blue stain was eluted. The tissues were then transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes. One half ml of 1 % aqueous sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was added in each tube to release the trapped Evans blue from the cells. The tissues were then ground using a pestle-mortar and the homogenates were diluted with 0.5 ml deionized water. The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 9000 g for 3 min. 0.8 ml aliquot of the supernatant was removed and optical density was determined spectrophotometrically (UV-VIS Spectrophotometer 2202, Systronics, India) at 600 nm.|$|E

50|$|In the 1974 {{disaster}} film Earthquake, Lathrop made director Mark Robson’s {{vision of}} the motion picture come true. Robson wanted a natural look for the film, without it being documentary-like. But instead of shooting in natural locations, Earthquake was filmed almost entirely on the Universal Studios sound stages and back-lot due to the extraordinary degree of control deemed necessary to execute the required special effects. To bring the earthquake scenes to life, a shaker mount for the camera was created. Lathrop said it “created an amazing illusion. You’d swear that the ground was going up and down and moving sideways, when, of course, it wasn’t moving at all.” Sets were also built on <b>shaker</b> <b>platforms,</b> which is incredibly costly so “in the sets that were not on <b>shaker</b> <b>platforms,</b> it was difficult to get the actors to move as if they were responding to an earthquake, when there wasn’t one,” he added.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Lead (Pb), {{depending}} upon the reactant surface, pH, redox potential and other factors can bind tightly to the soil with a retention time of many centuries. Soil-metal interactions by sorption, precipitation and complexation processes, and differences between plant species in metal uptake efficiency, transport, and susceptibility make a general prediction of soil metal bioavailability and risks of plant metal toxicity difficult. Moreover, the tight binding characteristic of Pb to soils and plant materials make {{a significant portion of}} Pb unavailable for uptake by plants. This experiment was conducted to determine whether the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), or acetic acid (HAc) can enhance the phytoextraction of Pb by making the Pb soluble and more bioavailable for uptake by coffeeweed (Sesbania exaltata Raf.). Also we wanted to assess the efficacy of chelates in facilitating translocation of the metal into the above-ground biomass of this plant. To test the effect of chelates on Pb solubility, 2 g of Pb-spiked soil (1000 mg Pb/kg dry soil) were added to each 15 mL centrifuge tube.

40|$|Some plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} {{exist within}} root tissue {{and must be}} extracted from the roots to identify and count them. However, efficiency comparisons of methods and solutions have not been published. We have tested if water is a better extraction solution than mercuric chloride-dihydrostreptomycin sulfate for recovery of lance and root-lesion nematodes in corn roots. Also, we have tested if the <b>platform</b> <b>shaker</b> method {{is more effective than}} the Baermann funnel for extracting these nematodes and if there is an interaction between extraction solution and extraction method in recovery of these nematodes from corn roots. In addition, we infected corn roots with root-lesion nematodes alone and compared the number of the nematode extracted from radical and seminal roots versus nodal roots using both methods and solutions described. In the second portion of this thesis, we reported the screen of fifteen corn lines for resistant to Pratylenchus neglectus and Hoplolaimus stephanus. Screening would be the first step to provide sources of resistance for breeding programs. There is a lack of commercial corn lines resistant to root-lesion and lance nematode available. We also compared numbers of root-lesion and lance nematodes present in the radical and seminal roots and nodal roots of the fifteen different corn lines to check correlation between nematode numbers and root type. The third portion of this thesis describes effect of the new seed treatment products available to protect corn roots from plant-parasitic nematodes. Experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 at five different locations in Iowa.

Results revealed that EDTA was the most effective in bringing Pb into solution, and that maximum solubility was reached 6 days after chelate amendment. Additionally, a greenhouse experiment was conducted by planting Sesbania seeds in plastic tubes containing top soil and peat (2 : 1, v:v) spiked with various levels (0, 1000, 2000 mg Pb/kg dry soil) of lead nitrate. At six weeks after emergence, aqueous solutions of EDTA and/or HAc (in a 1 : 1 ratio with the metal) or distilled deionized water were applied to the root zones. Plants were harvested at 6 days after chelate addition to coincide with the duration of maximum metal solubility previously determined in this study. Results of the greenhouse experiment showed that coffeeweed was relatively tolerant to moderate levels of Pb and chelates as shown by very slight reductions in root and no discernable effects on shoot biomass. Root Pb concentrations increased with increasing levels of soil-applied Pb. Further increases in root Pb concentrations were attributed to chelate amendments. In the absence of chelates, translocation of Pb from roots to shoots was minimal. However, translocation dramatically increased in treatments with EDTA alone or in combination with HAc. Overall, {{the results of this study}} indicated that depending on the nature and type of Pb-contaminated soil being remediated, the bioavailability and uptake of Pb by coffeeweed can be enhanced by amending the soil with chelates especially after the plants have reached maximum biomass...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Wall {{shear stress}} (WSS) on {{anchored}} cells affects their responses, including cell proliferation and mor-phology. In this study, {{the effects of}} the directionality of pulsatile WSS on endothelial cell proliferation and mor-phology were investigated for cells grown in a Petri dish orbiting on a <b>shaker</b> <b>platform.</b> Time and location dependent WSS was determined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At low orbital speed (50 rpm), WSS was shown to be uniform (0 – 1 dyne/cm 2) across the bottom of the dish, while at higher orbital speed (100 and 150 rpm), WSS remained fairly uniform near the center and fluctuated significantly (0 – 9 dyne/cm 2) near the side walls of the dish.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 An {{association}} between occupational whole body vibration (WBV) exposure {{and the development}} of lower back pain (LBP) has been established through numerous epidemiological studies. However, the etiological and biomechanical mechanisms of how WBV contributes to LBP and injury are not well understood. Using field-measured occupational WBV exposures in a controlled laboratory setting, this study attempted to expose the human lumbar spine to occupational WBV exposures to better understand the mechanisms of WBV-related low back injury. The occupational exposures selected for this study were those encountered by bus drivers, who are known to have a high prevalence of LBP. Continuous and impulsive WBV accelerations collected at the floor of a bus traversing a standardized route in the Seattle metro area were played into a six-degree of freedom hydraulic <b>shaker</b> <b>platform.</b> Twelve professional drivers sat on an air suspension seat mounted to a six-degree of freedom hydraulic <b>shaker</b> <b>platform.</b> The drivers' response to the continuous and impulsive exposures at the seat and sternum were recorded. The difference between seat- and sternum-measured accelerations were used to calculate the displacement of the spine during the vibrations encountered during continuous and impulsive exposures. Based on these two exposure patterns for the bus drivers, six human lumbar functional spine units (FSUs) were placed in a servohydraulic testing system and continuously exposed to one of the two vibration signatures. A unique staining technique was used to visually differentiate preexisting intervertebral disc damage and damage brought on by cycling the FSU. No discernible damage was found for discs exposed to the continuous WBV while exposing FSUs to the impulsive WBV resulted in endplate fractures and damage to the annulus fibrosis of the intervertebral disc. These findings indicate that, for equal drive times, a more impulsive and intermittent loading signature is more likely to cause injury to components of the low back than a relatively less impulsive and more continuous signature...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, every product {{manufacturing}} industry is continuously driven to develop innovative and sustainable products that differentiate through outstanding performance, customer satisfaction and appealing brand values. Intelligent, mechatronic systems are instrumental to accommodate this increasing demand for product quality, flexibility and customization. Since its intelligent nature {{is essentially the}} raison dëtre of a mechatronic system, {{it is crucial to}} have a seamless integration between the development cycles of the multi-physics hardware and the embedded controls software. In the current industrial practice, this connection is mainly realized by sharing closed, black-box simulation models of the physical design and the control software between departments, enabling the virtual verification of functional requirements long before a first physical prototype is built. This doctoral research demonstrates how model-based methodologies for control and estimation can extend the usage of system models beyond this simulation-based verification of requirements. On the basis of four industrially relevant applications, this thesis analyzes the capabilities of a model-based paradigm for control and estimation to accelerate controls development in the early stage of the design process and to expand the usage of system models into the products operational phase. In a first contribution, this dissertation studies how Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques can accelerate the development process of a hydraulic active suspension system. A second contribution comprises an innovative estimation algorithm for the inertial properties of a road vehicle, which can be employed in an adaptive model-based chassis control system. Combining a control architecture based on Internal Model Control (IMC) with an identification procedure based on Experimental Modal Analysis, a third contribution proposes a vibration control system for a multi-axis hydraulic <b>shaker</b> <b>platform,</b> that is used in the aerospace industry for testing satellites. A final contribution demonstrates the value of MPC methodologies in the control architecture of autonomously driving road vehicles. By positioning model-based control in the industrial context of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), this doctoral research has created a clear interest from several industrial partners in model-based control and the underlying state-of-the-art methodologies. This transfer of state-of-the-art academic methodologies into state-of-the-use industry practice is fully in line with the objectives of the IWT-Baekeland mandate that has supported this doctoral research. 1.
