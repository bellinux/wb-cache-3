5|$|True Detective was {{intended}} to be a novel, but once the project took definite form, Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of Galveston, and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the True Detective pilot script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential <b>pilot</b> <b>series</b> shortly thereafter. He wrote a second True Detective script soon after his departure from The Killing thanks to the support of production company and manager Anonymous Content, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of True Detective. Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After working alone for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.|$|E

500|$|An {{accomplished}} writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto {{delved into}} fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was {{around this time}} that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, {{due to a lack}} of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. [...] "I'd always had plans from the first time I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, I was going to ask how you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential <b>pilot</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
