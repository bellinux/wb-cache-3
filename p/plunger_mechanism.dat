50|$|The mains {{connectors}} of {{the appliance}} plug are two rounded sockets that accept two rounded pins from the appliance. They are unpolarised. The third connection, earth, {{is a large}} metal contact {{on each side of}} the plug body which makes contact with the sides of the plug receptacle, grounding the appliance body. Some appliances using these connectors incorporate a spring and <b>plunger</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a temperature-sensitive release system; if the temperature rises significantly above a preset limit - for example, if a kettle boils dry - the spring is released and (if all goes well) the plunger pushes the plug and socket apart. It must then be allowed to cool and reset manually by forcing the connector back into the appliance.|$|E

Rapid machining is a new technique recently {{made possible by the}} advances in control system technology. It is a technique that has been overlooked by many industries as means of producing rapid prototypes. The rapid prototyping systems work with different techniques using waxes paper and metal powder. The fused deposition modelling (FDM) system using wax was developed in this work. The FDM machine builds the part by extruding semi-molten wax through a heated nozzle in a prescribed pattern onto a platform. The present paper describes the basic system design, and the method of wax deposition. The extrusion jet is mounted on a X-Y-Z table which is controlled by a computer system. Automated control of the <b>plunger</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the platform position allow for accurate parts to be produced. Single layers of wax are built up {{one on top of the}} other to produce the final part shapes. The characteristics of wax were also analysed in order to optimise the model production process. These included wax phase change temperature. ej 201...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies available which {{have been developed to}} large-scale use, mainly in the last decade. Today’s commercially available rapid prototyping systems work with different techniques using paper, waxes, photocurable resins, polymers and new metal powders. This project is concerned with one type of rapid prototyping technology, namely fused deposition modelling, which was initially commercialised in 1991. A new version of the fused deposition modelling system using wax has been designed and used in this work. The present project describes the basic system design, and the method of wax deposition. The FDM machine builds the part by extruding semi-molten material through a heated nozzle in a prescribed pattern onto a platform. The extrusion jet is mounted on a X-Y table which is controlled by a computer system. In conjunction with the automated control of the <b>plunger</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the depositor position, accurate models were produced. Single layers of wax were built up {{one on top of the}} other to produce two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. The characteristics of the wax were also analysed in order to optimise the model production process. These included wax phase change temperature, wax viscosity and wax droplet shape during processing...|$|E

This is achieved by using proper maintenance and design changes for unreliable subsystems and components of a complex system. It is significant to develop a strategy for maintenance, replacement and design changes related to those subsystems and components. An analysis of down time along with causes is essential to identify the unreliable components and subsystems. This paper presents an analysis of failure data of solenoid coils of automatic internal grinding machine used in a bearing manufacturing plant.

40|$|An {{adjustable}} systemic-pulmonary artery (SPA) shunt {{is being}} developed that consists of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft with a screw <b>plunger</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This device would allow full control of flow through SPA shunts used to augment pulmonary blood flow in neonates born with single ventricle physiology. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the changes this mech-anism has on flow fields for a 4 mm and 5 mm adjustable SPA shunt. Two in vitro models were examined; an idealized model with an axisymmetric constriction and a model developed from 3 -D reconstruction of the actual shunt under asymmetric constriction. These models were used to mea-sure the instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) under both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. Recirculation regions and maximum values of velocity, vorticity, and shear stress are compared between the 4 mm and 5 mm models. The results indi-cate that for the idealized model of both shunts, separation regions are much smaller, persisting for approximately 0 - 1. 75 diameters downstream of the constriction, while for the realistic models separation regions of 2. 5 diameters downstream were observed. Additional models of a 4 mm and 5 mm shunt were tested under pulsatile conditions matching Re of 1061 and 849 and a Womersley number of 4. 09 and 5. 12, respectively, as seen in vivo.

40|$|A new membrane-casting {{apparatus}} {{is developed}} for studying macrovoid defects in polymeric membranes {{made by the}} wet- and dry-casting process in low-gravity. Macrovoids are large (10 - 50 micron), open cavities interspersed among the smaller pores in the substructure under the gelled skin surface layer of the cast membrane. Although their occurrence is considered endemic to the wet- and dry-casting process since they can lead to compaction or skin rupture in the membrane process, recent studies suggest several useful applications such as transdermal and osmotic drug delivery systems, miniature bioreactors, etc. However, {{lack of knowledge about}} the macrovoid formation mechanism is an obstacle to further development of applications using them. An on-going debate {{is the role of the}} surface-tension-driven solutocapillary convection during macrovoid formation. The rapid growth of macrovoids within 1 - 5 seconds and the high polymer concentration in and near macrovoids make it difficult to explain the mechanism of macrovoid growth by diffusion alone, which is the widely accepted hypothesis proposed by Reuvers et al. The hypothesis advanced by our research group can explain this rapid growth via a mechanism that involves diffusion from the casting solution in the meta-stable region to the macrovoid enhanced by solutocapillary convection induced by the steep nonsolvent concentration gradient in the vicinity of the macrovoid. Since macrovoid growth is hypothesized to be the interplay of a solutocapillary-induced driving force counteracted by viscous drag and buoyancy, eliminate the latter provides a means for testing this hypothesis. Moreover, free convection mass transfer in the nonsolvent immersion bath used to cause phase-separation in membrane casting complicates developing a model for both the wet-casting process and macrovoid growth. The low-g environment minimizes gravitationally induced free convection thereby permitting a tractable solution to the ternary diffusion equations that characterize membrane formation. NASA's Parabolic Flight Research Aircraft provides a small window of low-g (approximately 25 s) that can be used to study macrovoid development in both wet- and dry-cast membranes if an appropriate casting apparatus is used. This casting apparatus should be able to cast the membrane in both low- and high-g in a manner so that essential one-dimensional mass transfer conditions are achieved to insure lateral uniformity in the membrane. The apparatus used in previous research on membrane casting in low-gravity was operated with the <b>plunger</b> driven <b>mechanism.</b> The spring-loaded <b>plunger</b> pushes the bottom block containing the polymer casting solution well directly under the absorbent chamber located in the upper stationary block. However, membranes made via this casting apparatus often displayed lateral nonuniformities that precluded obtaining quantitative information on the macrovoid growth process. Thus, it was necessary to determine the reason for these structural irregularities observed in the low-g casting apparatus. Both experimental as well as computer simulation studies of the low-g casting apparatus established that the impulsive action of the plunger caused the undesired structural nonuniformities. The simulation results showed that the width-to-depth aspect ratio of the shallow well that contains the casting solution in this apparatus was not an important factor in minimizing this problem. Even for a 40 : 1 (width : depth) aspect ratio, any convection induced by the horizontal motion of the interface of the casting solution will be damped out within 6. 25 x 10 (exp 4) seconds. However, the experimental studies revealed that the impulsive motion of the plunger caused a 'sloshing' of the casting solution that had to be eliminated. Therefore, the plungerdriven mechanism was changed to a cam-driven mechanism that did not cause any impulsive motion of the casting solution. Other refinements to this new membrane-casting apparatus include provision for removing the membranes from the casting wells in a less destructive manner. This was accomplished by using a slit geometry for the casting well that permitted disassembly for removal of the cast membrane. The materials used in the construction of this casting apparatus were chosen to insure wetting at the side walls and to maintain precise control of the thickness of the polymer solution in the casting well. An additional provision in this new casting apparatus is the ability to carry out both wet- as well as dry-casting. As such, this apparatus permitted the first studies of the wet-casting of polymeric membranes in low-g. Both wet- and dry-casting experiments on NASA's KC- 135 research aircraft employing this new membrane-casting apparatus are scheduled in July 2002. The morphology of the resulting membranes will be characterized using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The results of these low-g studies will be reported later...|$|R
