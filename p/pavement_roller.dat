5000|$|TWA Flight 800 was a Boeing 707 {{that crashed}} during take off on runway 25 at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport, Rome at 13:05 GMT {{on a flight}} to Athens International Airport, Greece on 23 November 1964. As the Boeing 707 was at 80 knots, the {{instruments}} for No. 4 engine indicated zero thrust and the thrust reverser deployment light for No. 2 engine illuminated. The crew aborted the takeoff at a speed below V1 at 800-900m down the runway. The aircraft did not slow down {{as quickly as the}} crew expected and veered to the right, whereupon No. 4 engine struck a <b>pavement</b> <b>roller.</b> The aircraft caught fire and traveled another 260m before coming to rest. The accident killed 50 passengers and crew on board, with 23 passengers and crew surviving.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{compaction}} of rod concrete mixes is a {{very complex}} process, envisaging a rapid increase of linear pressures, taking into account constant change in physical-mechanical properties of compacted material. Several hundred models of compacting equipment have been manufactured to date in the world; however, {{for a long period of}} time the models and types of rollers have been created and continue to be so, by the trial and error method, without accounting for the theoretical fundamentals of the process of compaction and specific features of mechanics of the force interaction of a operating element (drum, tire) with the material compacted. Contemporary directions of development of pavement equipment necessitate the creation of machines of the multipurpose use; designing the constructions, the working processes in which incorporate new technologies, ensuring the growing production yield and labor productivity; and careful treatment of economical and material resources. To improve the quality, reliability and competitiveness of the pavement equipment, it is important to create universal <b>pavement</b> <b>roller,</b> capable of compacting the different types of surfacing, automatically changing contact pressures, having wide range of regulation of compacting impacts and designed for work at all stages of the process of compaction of rod concrete mixes. <b>Pavement</b> <b>roller</b> with perforated drums meets these requirements.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop guidelines and criteria for design and construction of overlays on cracked and seated concrete pavements. The main factors which are investigated in this study include number of the seated roller pass, weight of seating roller pass, weight of seating roller, thickness of overlay, fiber content and fiber layer location. Eleven test sections were constructed on I- 65 and twenty two test sections were constructed on US- 31. An extensive investigation was conducted involving both field and laboratory testing. Field investigations included pavement condition survey and non destructive testing (NDT) of the pavements using FWD or Dynaflect. The laboratory investigation focused on physical property testing, complex modulus testing and fatigue testing. Three fiber extraction methods have been developed for this project. Preliminary test Results show good precision of these methods. These fiber extraction methods should be used in future projects. Deflection measurements can be used to determine the appropriate weight and drop height of the breaking head. The Guillotine breaker used in this project is effective in breaking PCC pavement. A 40 ton roller is recommended because the 50 ton roller apprears to “overwork” the crack concrete <b>pavement.</b> <b>Roller</b> passes have no significant effect on the maximum deflections. The optimum roller pass can not be determined exclusively based on the maximum deflections. One to three passes of a 40 ton pneumatic-tired roller is adequate when seating is needed to assure contact of cracked pavement pieces with the subgrade. Use of fiber and the fiber layer location do not have a significant effect on pavement strength in term of the maximum deflection. But use of fiber will delay the crack development. The least cracks were developed in the sections which have fiber in all three layers. It is recommended that fiber be used in all overlay layers. Overlay thickness has an important effect on the maximum deflections and the development of reflective cracks. General trends of crack development showed in the first two years. Cracked and seated sections have less cracks than non cracked and seated sections, with other conditions being the same. The general trends are not obvious after two years. Beams of 3 x 3 in. are recommended to be used for the flexural fatigue tests in the future due to small variability. Addition of fiber increase the fatigue life of overlay mixture. Composite samples with fiber (4. 5 lb) have predicted fatigue life two times greater than those without fiber. Loading frequency and temperature have significant effects on dynamic modulus and phase angle of overlay mixture. The addition of fiber will change the viscoelastic properties of mixture...|$|E
50|$|In 1912, California began paving {{a section}} of the {{historic}} route in San Mateo County. Construction of a two-lane concrete highway began in front of the historic Uncle Tom's Cabin, an inn in San Bruno that was built in 1849 and demolished exactly 100 years later. There was little traffic initially and children used the <b>pavement</b> for <b>roller</b> skating until traffic increased. By the late 1920s, California began the first of numerous widening projects of what later became part of U.S. Route 101.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{pavement}} is {{cost effective}} and beneficial {{because of its}} sustainability and durability. The maintenance and renovation periods for such pavement compared to other pavements are relatively long; however, a significant issue with <b>pavements,</b> especially <b>roller</b> compacted concrete <b>pavements</b> (RCCP), is salt scaling which occurs due to saline solutions such as deicer salts. In the present work, the performance of RCC containing a natural pozzolan called Trass, as a supplementary cementitious material, and an air-entraining agent for salt scaling was investigated. Mechanical and durability tests were performed on specimens containing a {{water to binder ratio}} of 0. 32, with and without Trass, and an air-entraining agent. It was concluded that, Trass could not improve the compressive and tensile strengths, however, the permeability was improved. Moreover, the amount of mass loss due to salt scaling was not decreased. In all concrete mixtures, using a suitable amount of an air-entraining agent to maintain a total air content of 4. 5 – 5 % was found to be necessary for producing RCC containing Trass...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt <b>pavement</b> density from <b>roller</b> {{compaction}} is {{a crucial}} factor in ensuring satisfactory pavement performance. Proper and uniform compaction of the pavement mat is essential in achieving the desired final compacted density. There is a necessity to investigate existing pavement construction practices, and provide more cost-effective modifications to the current scenario. Automation of the paving operation can increase the efficiency {{and quality of the}} operation, lead to reductions in overall project costs and time, and enhance pavement life. A system can be developed through algorithmic planning and real-time guidance strategies, {{and the development of a}} semi-automated path-planning and real-time guidance system that aims towards automating the paving operation. This system accepts relevant paving project inputs, generates appropriate path plans for the compactor, performs a graphical visualization of the generated path plan, and offers real-time guidance capabilities using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology. This system, named AUTOPAVE (v 1. 0), was developed in Microsoft Visual Basic• „¢ programming language and offers a user-friendly and interactive graphical interface. The proposed new system will incorporate state-of-the-art GPS technology to standardize paving operations that are more amenable to rigorous quality control, and can result in considerable reductions in cost and time involved in asphalt pavement construction projects. This system was tested on several actual paving projects, and many operational issues related to the functioning of the system were successfully overcome. ...|$|R
