5|$|Each block {{had access}} to courtyards, known as airing courts, and the asylum was {{surrounded}} by extensive grounds. At {{the end of each}} courtyard were stone rooms used to house incontinent patients, who slept on straw beds. All buildings were made from stone and iron, avoiding the use of wood because of the <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> Hot and cold plunge baths were also included, as Fox saw their use as an important part of treatment, which may have been related to his Quaker beliefs and John Wesley's advocacy of the practice. The total construction cost around £35,000. In addition to the wealthy private patients, paupers funded by parish funds were also admitted and kept in accommodation furthest from the central block, which was for the highest in society.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of a patrol mission all four engines would {{normally}} be running, but, as the aircraft's weight was reduced by the consumption of onboard fuel, up to two engines could be intentionally shut down, allowing the remaining engines to be operated in a more efficient manner. Instead of relying on ram air to restart an inactive engine, compressor air could be crossfed from a live engine to a starter turbine; the crossfeed duct was later discovered to be a <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> Similarly, the two hydraulic systems on board were designed to be powered by the two inner engines that would always be running. Electrical generation was designed to far exceed the consumption of existing equipment to accommodate additional systems installed over the Nimrod's operational service.|$|E

This research was an observational descriptive study, by using cross sectional approach. The variables of this research were <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards,</b> <b>fire</b> prevention policies, procedures, emergency response, fire response team, fire prevention facilities and infrastructure, and level of knowledge of fire prevention workers.

Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the fire {{protection}} program (FPP) is to provide assurance, through a defense-in-depth design, that a fire will not prevent the performance of necessary safe plant shutdown functions and will not significantly {{increase the risk of}} radioactive releases to the environment in accordance with General Design Criteria 3 and 5. The fire protection program consists of fire detection and extinguishing systems and equipment, administrative controls and procedures, and trained personnel. The CMEB review of the fire protection program includes a review of the evaluation of <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> described in the applicant's Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and a review of the description of the fire protection system design showing the system characteristics and layout which define the 'fire prevention" and "fire protection " portions of the program.

Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> in {{the existing}} vehicle fleet and uses failure modes and effects analyses of three generic designs to identify and rank <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> in the Emerging Fuel Vehicle (EFV) fleet. A statistics based predictive quantitative risk assessment framework and estimated uncertainty analysis is presented to predict risk of EFV fleets. The analysis also determines that the frequency of fire occurrence is the greatest factor that contributes to risk of death in fire. These preliminary results predict 420 ± 14 fire related deaths per year for a fleet composed entirely of gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, 910 ± 340 for compressed natural gas vehicles, and 1300 ± 570 for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles relative to the statistical record of 350 for traditional fuel vehicles.

Birds show varying degrees of habituation to pyrotechnics. Studies have shown that lethal reinforcement of pyrotechnic harassment has extended its usefulness (Baxter and Allen 2008).

30|$|Greater {{risk of loss}} of {{life and}} {{property}} in the region will therefore necessitate a greater reliance on fuel treatments to mitigate that risk. Implementation of such treatments would likely be aided by widespread public support in the southwestern United States for prescribed fire and mechanical thinning to ameliorate <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> (Abrams and Lowe 2005, Ostergren et al. 2008). However, as lands are subdivided into increasingly smaller parcels, the potential for effective placement of fuel treatments on a landscape level will become constrained. Additionally, plant communities and the subsequent environmental benefits that they provide will be reduced and fragmented due to land clearing for homes and subsequent supporting services and infrastructure. Land managers must therefore be mindful of these potential losses when implementing fuel treatments in WUI areas.|$|R

30|$|Fire {{records for}} {{exterior}} wall fires with VGS show that fires {{can be very}} serious (White et al. 2014), as reported in a fire incident in Frankfurt, Germany, in a residential building. The fire spread throughout the wall, along the climbing plants, up to the neighboring property (Brandwein 2014). Another incident reported fire in a semi-enclosed beer garden in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, where ferns in VGS caught fire from a candle. The VGS in this fire incident was hand-watered, without a proper irrigation system. Furthermore, some synthetic plants were also integrated into this green wall (McNeilage 2012). These fire incidents highlight the importance of understanding <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> and taking necessary precautions to minimize <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> of VGS. To identify necessary precautions for <b>fire</b> <b>hazards,</b> ignition and <b>fire</b> propagation in VGS should be adequately studied. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to explore the ignitability of vegetation used in VGS and the <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards.</b> The <b>fire</b> behavior of vegetation largely depends upon the amount of fuel present and its moisture content (MC; Graham and McCarthy 2006). Since the MC of vegetation is the most critical parameter affecting ignition, this study explored MC and its effect on the ignitability of vegetation in detail.|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of modem materials, upholstered furniture posses a high fuel load and life safety threat. Due to the rapid growth rate of the organic material and the toxic combustion products, these fires usually lead to hazardous conditions and uncontrollable fires.

The application of the European CBUF programme to New Zealand upholstered furniture is an ongoing initiative of the University of Canterbury. The combustion behaviour of 3 foams combined with 14 fabrics were analysed using the cone calorimeter to provide data to predict full scale furniture fires. The major results that were derived form the Cone Calorimeter results is there is a pronounced fabric effect with regard to flammability and combustion characteristics. Model I from the CBUF programme was applied to New Zealand furniture as to predict <b>potential</b> <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> from these small-scale results. It was found that fabrics that posed the greatest <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> were PE, PP, olefin and viscose which consistently produced high peak HRR, high total heat released and fast times to peak HRR and times to untenable conditions. The foams that posed the greatest <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> when coupled with these fabrics was a standard polyurethane foam and a high density polyurethane foam. The ability of Model I to compensate for foam and fabric chemical compositions was limited which was reflected throughout the results. Its dependence on various experimentally variables limit its ability and power to predict various parameters if unattainable. Model I can be considered a conservative design model with resect to peak HRR, total heat released and time to peak HRR...|$|R
