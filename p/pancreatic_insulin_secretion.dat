40|$|The use of {{arteriovenous}} (AV) concentration {{differences to}} measure {{the production of a}} substance at organ/tissue level by Fick principle is limited to steady state. Out of steady state, there is the need, as originally proposed by Zierler, to account for the nonnegligible transit time of the substance through the system. Based on this theory, we propose a modeling approach that adopts a parametric description for production and transit time. Once the unknown parameters are estimated on AV data, the transition time of the substance can be assessed and production can be reconstructed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{development}} of hyperglycemia {{and the use}} of early parenteral feeding are associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients. We therefore examined the impact of exogenous glucose administration on the integrated metabolic function of endotoxemic mice using our recently developed frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT). We next extended our findings using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model administered early parenteral glucose support. METHODS: Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, 8 - 12 weeks, were instrumented with chronic indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Endotoxemia was initiated with intra-arterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) in the presence of saline or glucose infusion (100 µL/hr), and an FSIVGTT was performed after five hours. In a second experiment, catheterized mice underwent CLP and the impact of early parenteral glucose administration on glucose homeostasis and mortality was assessed over 24 hrs. MEASUREMENTS: AND MAIN RESULTS: Administration of LPS alone did not impair metabolic function, whereas glucose administration alone induced an insulin sensitive state. In contrast, LPS and glucose combined caused marked glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and significantly impaired <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> Similarly, CLP mice receiving parenteral glucose developed fulminant hyperglycemia within 18 hrs (all > 600 mg/dl) associated with increased systemic cytokine release and 40 % mortality, whereas CLP alone (85 ± 2 mg/dL) or sham mice receiving parenteral glucose (113 ± 3 mg/dL) all survived and were not hyperglycemic. Despite profound hyperglycemia, plasma insulin in the CLP glucose-infused mice (3. 7 ± 1. 2 ng/ml) was not higher than sham glucose infused mice (2. 1 ± 0. 3 ng/ml).

40|$|In the <b>pancreatic</b> beta-cell, <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> is {{stimulated by}} glucose {{metabolism}} resulting in membrane potential-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]c). This cascade involves the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi[m]) hyperpolarization and elevation of mitochondrial Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]m) which activates the Ca(2 +) -sensitive NADH-generating dehydrogenases. Metabolism-secretion coupling requires unidentified signals, other than [Ca 2 +]c, possibly {{generated by the}} mitochondria through the rise in [Ca 2 +]m. To test this paradigm, we have established an alpha-toxin permeabilized cell preparation permitting the simultaneous monitoring of [Ca 2 +] with mitochondrially targeted aequorin and <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> under conditions of saturating [ATP] (10 mM) and of clamped [Ca 2 +]c at substimulatory levels (500 nM).

Daintain/AIF 1 is immunohistochemically localized to microglial cells in the central nervous system and to dendritic cells and macrophages in several organs. A particularly dense accumulation of daintain/AIF 1 -immunoreactive macrophages was observed in the insulitis affecting the pancreatic islets of prediabetic BB rats.

Rats were treated with LPS using intraportal infusion while LA was administered orally. Metabolite levels, superoxide levels, inflammatory markers, malondialdehyde content, glutathione content and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) gene expression were all measured using standard biochemical techniques. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> was evaluated by a hyperglycemic clamp technique.

RESULTS: Fructose-induced elevation in plasma C-reactive protein, amylase, superoxide, white blood cell count as well as in hepatic and pancreatic contents of malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 6 were increased in animals treated with LPS and reversed with LA administration. The augmented hepatic gene expression of TLR 4 in fructose-fed rats was further increased in those with intraportal LPS infusion, which was partially reversed by LA administration. Pathological examination showed inflammatory changes and leukocyte infiltration in hepatic and pancreatic islets of animals treated with LPS but were rarely observed in those with LA treatment. In addition to affects on the liver, impaired <b>pancreatic</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> seen in fructose-fed rats was deteriorated in with LPS treatment and partially reversed with LA administration.

Since there are many patients with T 2 D that cannot be controlled by previously developed drugs, it has been necessary to develop new drugs, {{one of which is}} a glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) based therapy. GLP- 1 has been shown to ameliorate diabetes-related conditions by augmenting <b>pancreatic</b> β-cell <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> and having the low risk of causing hypoglycemia. Because of a very short half-life of GLP- 1, many researches have been focused on the development of GLP- 1 receptor (GLP- 1 R) agonists with long half-lives such as exenatide and dulaglutide. Now GLP- 1 R agonists have a variety of dosing-cycle forms {{to meet the needs of}} various patients. In this article, we review the physiological features of GLP- 1, the effects of GLP- 1 on T 2 D, the features of several GLP- 1 R agonists, and the therapeutic effect on T 2 D...|$|R
40|$|SummaryJunD, a {{transcription}} factor of the AP- 1 family, protects cells against oxidative stress. Here, {{we show that}} junD−/− mice exhibit features of premature aging and shortened life span. They also display persistent hypoglycemia due to enhanced <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> Consequently, the insulin/IGF- 1 signaling pathways are constitutively stimulated, leading to inactivation of FoxO 1, a positive regulator of longevity. Hyperinsulinemia most likely results from enhanced pancreatic islet vascularization owing to chronic oxidative stress. Indeed, accumulation of free radicals in β cells enhances VEGF-A transcription, which in turn increases <b>pancreatic</b> angiogenesis and <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> Accordingly, long-term treatment with an antioxidant rescues the phenotype of junD−/− mice. Indeed, dietary antioxidant supplementation was protective against pancreatic angiogenesis, hyperinsulinemia, and subsequent activation of insulin signaling cascades in peripheral tissues. Taken together, these data establish a pivotal role for oxidative stress in systemic regulation of insulin and define a key role for the JunD protein in longevity...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{mechanistic}} {{link between}} focal adhesion remodeling and glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion</b> RONDAS, Dieter, et al. Actin cytoskeleton remodeling {{is well known}} to be positively involved in glucose-stimulated <b>pancreatic</b> β cell <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> We have observed glucose-stimulated focal adhesion remodeling at the β cell surface and have shown this to be crucial for glucose-stimulated <b>insulin</b> <b>secretion.</b> However, the mechanistic link between such remodeling and the insulin secretory machinery remained unknown and was the major aim of this study. MIN 6 B 1 cells, a previously validated model of primary β cell function, were used for all experiments. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed the glucose-responsive co-localization of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin with integrin β 1 at the basal cell surface after short term stimulation. In addition, blockade {{of the interaction between}} β 1 integrins and the extracellular matrix with an anti-β 1 integrin antibody (Ha 2 / 5) inhibited short term glucose-induced phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr- 397), paxillin (Tyr- 118), and ERK 1 / 2 (Thr- 202 /Tyr- 204). Pharmacological inhibition of FAK activity blocked glucose-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling and glucose-induced disruption [ [...] . ] RONDAS, Dieter, et al.
