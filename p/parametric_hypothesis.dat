40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} {{time series analysis}} is the discrimination between non-stationarity and longrange dependence. Most of the literature considers the problem of testing specific <b>parametric</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of non-stationarity (such as {{a change in the}} mean) against long-range dependent stationary alternatives. In this paper we suggest a simple approach, which can be used to test the null-hypothesis of a general non-stationary short-memory against the alternative of a non-stationary long-memory process. The test procedure works in the spectral domain and uses a sequence of approximating tvFARIMA models to estimate the time varying long-range dependence parameter. We prove uniform consistency of this estimate and asymptotic normality of an averaged version. These results yield a simple test (based on the quantiles of the standard normal distribution), and it is demonstrated in a simulation study that - despite of its semi-parametric nature - the new test outperforms the currently available methods, which are constructed to discriminate between specific <b>parametric</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of non-stationarity short- and stationarity long-range dependence.

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>parametric</b> <b>hypotheses</b> {{testing for}} multidimensional Itô processes, possibly with jumps, observed at discrete time. To this aim, we propose {{the whole class}} of pseudo ϕ-divergence test statistics, which include as a special case the well-known likelihood ratio test but also many other test statistics {{as well as new}} ones. Although the final goal is to apply these test procedures to multidimensional Itô processes, we formulate the problem in the very general setting of regular statistical experiments and then particularize the results to our model of interest. In this general framework we prove that, contrary to what happens to true ϕ-divergence test statistics, the limiting distribution of the pseudo ϕ-divergence test statistic is characterized by the function ϕ which defines the divergence itself. In the case of contiguous alternatives, it is also possible to study in detail the power function of the test. Although all tests in this class are asymptotically equivalent, we show by Monte Carlo analysis that, in small sample case, the performance of the test strictly depends on the choice of the function ϕ. In particular, we see that even in the i. i. d. case, the power function of the generalized likelihood ratio test (ϕ=) is strictly dominated by other pseudo ϕ-divergences test statistics. diffusion processes with jumps, Ito processes, power of the test, <b>parametric</b> <b>hypotheses</b> testing, phi-divergences, generalized likelihood ratio test,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The problem under {{consideration}} {{is to determine}} an activation policy of discrete scanning sensors {{in such a way}} as to maximize the power of a simple <b>parametric</b> <b>hypothesis</b> test, which verifies the nominal state of the considered distributed system specified over a given multi-dimensional spatial domain. The optimal locations of sensors are determined based on the Ds-optimality criterion defined on the respective Fisher Information Matrix. The proposed approach exploits the notion of directly constrained design measures recently introduced in modern optimum experimental design theory, which leads to an extremely fast iterative procedure of exchange type. In this work, a general scheme of such an approach leading to maximization of the fault detection efficiency in distributed-parameter systems is delineated and tested via computer simulations regarding an advection-diffusion problem.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the problem}} of signal {{detection}} in Gaussian white noise we show asymptotic minimaxity of kernel-based tests. The test statistics equal L 2 -norms of kernel estimates. The sets of alternatives are essentially nonparametric and are defined as the sets of all signals such that the L 2 -norms of signal smoothed by the kernels exceed some constants ρ > 0. The constant ρ depends {{on the power of}} noise and ρ → 0 as → 0. Similar statements are proved also if an additional information on a signal smoothness is given. By theorems on asymptotic equivalence of statistical experiments these results are extended to the problems of testing nonparametric hypotheses on density and regression. The exact asymptotically minimax lower bounds of type II error probabilities are pointed out for all these settings. Similar results are also obtained for the problems of testing <b>parametric</b> <b>hypotheses</b> versus nonparametric sets of alternatives...|$|R
