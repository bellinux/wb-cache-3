40|$|For {{some years}} a high {{severity}} of sickness absence {{has been noted}} in young postmen. This cross sectional study is of 4419 male postmen and 787 male <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> and <b>postal</b> assistants, of whom 3753 and 709 respectively were employed for the whole year of the study from 1 April 1982 to 31 March 1983. A stratification technique {{was used to assess}} the influence of duration of service on sickness absence within certain age ranges. Differences in the proportion of men taking more than a stated number of spells or days, in groups of short and long service, are tested statistically using Chi square tests with a continuity correction. Statistically significant reductions, with increasing duration of service, are found for self certificated spells and days in all postmen and for certificated spells but not days in younger postmen. Older <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> and <b>postal</b> assistants have a statistically significant reduction in self certificated spells. Young <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> and <b>postal</b> assistants show no significant change in spells and days of sickness absence with duration of service. It is concluded that the excess severity of sickness absence in younger postmen is due to self certificated absence rather than certificated absence. The difference in severity of sickness absence in various diagnostic groups with increasing duration of service is discussed. The limitations of a cross sectional study mean that further work is required to investigate this problem using longitudinal techniques...|$|R

50|$|Matters grow {{worse when}} Kingsland’s legs become infested with ulcers - {{it turns out}} he is {{allergic}} to the shark they are regularly eating - and the two are visited by two male naval <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> who drop supplies.

Having no means of communication - the antenna of their CB radio set is missing — the two nearly starve to death. Irvine has serious abdominal problems and fears she is pregnant, which would be her doom in her weakened state.|$|R

Tyner was indicted three times for fraud and one count bribery. Also indicted was First Assistant Postmaster Perry S. Heath. President Roosevelt stated the postal investigation revealed a condition of [...] "gross corruption" [...] in their offices. [...] Allegations against Tyner and Heath ranged from gross negligence of office, criminal collusion, to actual participation in frauds, bribery, and financial profiteering. [...] Tyner was acquitted for lack of evidence since Tyner's wife had removed his papers {{from his office in}} April.

Four <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> and employees resigned while thirteen workers were removed from office.|$|R
50|$|The Interwar {{period was}} an active period for the {{construction}} of post offices, and 26 buildings of this standard porch and gable design were constructed in Queensland country towns between 1923 and 1939.

Materials introduced in this style included concrete stumps and shingles on sunhoods, both of which can be seen at Yungaburra. The post office had several staff members and a telephone exchange. Many tourists visiting Yungaburra and staying at the nearby hotel would have used the post office. During World War II many troops were stationed on the Tablelands and visited Yungaburra for recreational purposes. A Mr T L Bytie was postmaster throughout the war years.|$|R

50|$|The Postal Service Act of 1792 legally allowed Congressional {{newspapers}} {{into the}} mail system postage free: Despite this, <b>postal</b> <b>officers</b> often {{still did not}} allow newspapers to be carried in the official portmanteau with the regular mail. Where the mail was carried by post riders at the time, then the newspapers had to be light and able to fit in the saddlebag or else they {{were likely to be}} left behind because they would be too much of a load for the rider. Post riders carried official portmanteau horse leather saddlebags that carried the mail, that contained Congressional newspapers, on their horse's backside, which were locked and could only be opened by an authorized postal person. This procedure came about because of constant complaints of personal mail being previously opened before arrival. The letters and newspapers were divided into two separate canvas or linen bags and placed inside portmanteaux for distribution.|$|R
