40|$|In this paper, the preform of an {{automotive}} refill opening cap is manufactured {{through the}} incremental sheet forming (ISF) with large rigidity {{because of the}} lower thickness reduction percentage, and the production cost is reduced. Four processing parameters, including the preforming height (PH), the <b>preforming</b> <b>press</b> amount (PPA), the preforming tool diameter (PTD) and the preforming angle (PA), are optimized by orthogonal tests and response surface methods, and the max thickness reduction percentage (MTRP) is taken as the test target. Results: The optimal processing parameters include a PH of 15 mm, a PPA of 0, 5 mm, a PTD of 8 mm and a PA of 40 °...|$|E
40|$|The use of oak sawdust as carbon {{precursor}} for SiC manufacture via reactive infiltration was studied. The {{effect of}} oak sawdust pressing parameters, temperature and pressure, {{on the final}} SiC's properties was studied. Final product's quality was evaluated through density measurement, and microstructure and pore size distribution variations were characterized with optical microscopy and mercury porosimetry. <b>Pressed</b> oak sawdust <b>preforms</b> were carbonized to obtain a carbon porous preform which was then infiltrated with melted silicon. Successful infiltration of <b>preforms</b> <b>pressed</b> at room temperatures were performed, to obtain a porous SiC. Hot <b>pressed</b> <b>preforms</b> were not satisfactory infiltrated due to a narrowing of their pores caused by SiC formation's expansiveness. MCINN (Spain), project MAT 2011 - 25029...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Fe 3 Al-TiB 2 -Al 2 O 3 {{composite}} {{was prepared}} by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) from FeTiO 3 - B 2 O 3 -Al system. The standard Gibbs energy minimization method {{was used to}} calculate the equilibrium compositions of the reacting species. The effects of applied pressure of preform at 60, 80 and 100 MPa and milling duration of precursors on result products were studied. The result products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The optimum result was obtained when 100 MPa <b>pressed</b> <b>preform</b> and milling duration of 1. 5 hr was used...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} aluminium matrix composite, having 16 vol. {{percent of}} the fibres, was prepared by powder metallurgy technique. The composite exhibited a tensile strength of 177 MPa {{in comparison with the}} UTS of 88 MPa for the unreinforced aluminium matrix. To improve the wettability and consequently the UTS of the composite, the <b>preforms</b> were hot <b>pressed</b> at higher temperature (675 degrees C) in liquid state and the fibres were electroplated with nickel. Al-l wt. % Ph and 7010 P/M aluminium alloys were the two matrixes under investigation. Optimized hot pressing parameters and SEM fractography have indicated that these efforts result in improvement in the wettability. However, the UTS of the composite was found to decrease in all these cases. In the paper, these investigations have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} composite structures at a low-cost, moderate-to-high production rate is disclosed. A first {{embodiment of the}} method includes employing a continuous press forming fabrication process. A second embodiment of the method includes employing a pultrusion process for obtaining composite structures. The methods include coating yarns with matrix material, weaving the yarn into fabric to produce a continuous fabric supply, and feeding multiple layers of net-shaped fabrics having optimally oriented fibers into a debulking tool to form an undebulked <b>preform.</b> The continuous <b>press</b> forming fabrication process includes partially debulking the preform, cutting the partially debulked preform, and debulking the partially debulked preform to form a netshape. An electron-beam or similar technique then cures the structure. The pultrusion fabric process includes feeding the undebulked preform into a heated die and gradually debulking the undebulked preform. The undebulked preform in the heated die changes dimension until a desired cross-sectional dimension is achieved. This process further includes obtaining a net-shaped infiltrated uncured preform, cutting the uncured preform to a desired length, and electron-beam curing (or similar technique) the uncured preform. These fabrication methods produce superior structures formed at higher production rates, resulting in lower cost and high structural performance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} new or {{innovative}} materials has to meet two essential criteria: increased mechanical performance and minimization of the mass. This dual requirement leads to {{interest in the}} study of various classes of metallic foams. The actual research is focused on open-cell Tin-Lead foams manufactured by replication process using NaCl <b>preform.</b> A mechanical <b>press</b> equipped with a load cell and a local extensometer with a controlled deformation rate is used. Experimental tests were carried out in order to study the influences of both the cell size and of the relative density on the mechanical behavior during a compression deformation and to analyze the obtained properties variation within a new framework. This study has three main sections which start with the manufacturing description and mechanical characterization of the proposed metallic foams followed by the understanding and modeling of their response to a compression load via a Gibson-Ashby model, a Féret law, a proposed simple Avrami model, and a generalized Avrami model. Finally, an exposition of a numerical simulation analyzing the compression of the Sn-Pb foams concerning the variation of the relative densities with respect to the plastic strain is propose...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{titanium}} alloy metal matrix composites offer significant mechanical improvements over many conventional materials. In {{order to minimize}} fiber-matrix chemical reactions due to high temperatures involved in the fabrication methods, the final component can be obtained using two different steps: (1) fabrication of preforms (monotapes) by inert plasma spraying and (2) hot pressing of the fabricated preforms. Continuous SiC fiber-reinforced Ti- 6 Al- 4 V <b>preforms</b> were hot <b>pressed</b> to fabricate a composite multilayer. Different values of hot pressing processing parameters (temperature, applied load, bonding time) were investigated {{on the basis of}} a two-level factorial design. Metallographic and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were carried out to evaluate the bonding degree of the fabricated preforms. Preliminary three-point bending tests were also performed to understand the mechanical behavior and to show the more suitable values of the processing parameters for a hot pressing procedure. These values should be in the range of 830 to 950 degrees C (temperature), 80 MPa (applied stress), 20 to 30 min bonding time to avoid undesired phase transformation, large plastic flow of the metal matrix, and detrimental chemical reaction at fiber-matrix interface...|$|R
40|$|In the {{definition}} of conceptual developments and design of new materials with singular or unique properties, characterisation takes {{a key role in}} clarifying the relationships of composition, properties and processing that define the new material. B 4 C has a rare combination of properties that makes it suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications in engineering: high refractoriness, thermal stability, high hardness and abrasion resistance coupled to low density. However, the low self-diffusion coefficient of B 4 C limits full densification by sintering. A way to overturn this constraint is by using an alloy, for example Al-Si, forming composites with B 4 C. Multi-carbide B 4 C-SiC/(Al, Si) composites were produced by the reactive melt infiltration technique at 1200 - 1350 degrees C with up to 1 hour of isothermal temperature holds. <b>Pressed</b> <b>preforms</b> made from C-containing B 4 C were spontaneously infiltrated with Al-Si alloys of composition varying from 25 to 50 wt% Si. The present study involves the characterisation of the microstructure and crystalline phases in the alloys and in the composites by X-ray diffraction and SEM/EDS with EBSD. Electron backscatter diffraction is used in detail to look for segregation and spatial distribution of Si and Al containing phases during solidification of the metallic infiltrate inside the channels of the ceramic matrix when the composite cools down to the eutectic temperature (577 degrees C). It complements elemental maps of the SEM/EDS. The production of a flat surface by polishing is intrinsically difficult and the problems inherent to the preparation of EBSD qualified finishing in polished samples of such type of composites are further discussed...|$|R
