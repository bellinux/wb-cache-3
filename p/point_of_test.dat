40|$|BACKGROUND: Many <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care {{diagnostic}} {{technologies are}} available which produce results within minutes, and offer {{the opportunity to}} deliver acute care out of hospital settings. Increasing access to diagnostics at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care could increase the volume and scope of acute ambulatory care. Yet these technologies are not routinely used in many settings. We aimed to explore how <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> is used in a setting where it has become 'normalized' (embedded in everyday practice), in order to inform future adoption and implementation in other settings. We used normalization process theory to guide our case study approach. METHODS: We used a single case study design, choosing a community based ambulatory care unit where <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> is used routinely. A focused ethnographic approach was taken, including non-participant observation of all activities related to <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing,</b> and semi-structured interviews, with all clinical staff involved in <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> at the unit. Data were analysed thematically, guided by normalization process theory. RESULTS: Fourteen days of observation and six interviews were completed. Staff had a shared understanding of the purpose, value and benefits <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing,</b> believing it to be integral to {{the running of the}} unit. They organised themselves as a team to ensure that <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> worked effectively; and one key individual led a change in practice to ensure more consistency and trust in procedures. Staff assessed <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> as worthwhile for the unit, their patients, and themselves in terms of job satisfaction and knowledge. Potential barriers to adoption <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> were evident (including lack of trust in the accuracy of some results compared to laboratory testing; and lack of ease of use of some aspects of the equipment); but these did not prevent <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> from becoming embedded, because the importance and value attributed to it were so strong. CONCLUSIONS: This case study offers insights into successful adoption of new diagnostic technologies into every day practice. Such analyses may be critical to realising their potential to change processes of care...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of {{cortisol}} in serum is used commonly as {{an indicator}} of stress and disease. Conventional analytical techniques have limited utility given that they remain largely laboratory based, they do not directly measure the deemed biologically active free cortisol, and there is no robust correlation between the free cortisol measurements within serum and saliva. It would therefore be desirable to measure both the free and total cortisol readily within the same matrix in a portable device in the field or at the bedside. This paper demonstrates the utility of a portable Raman approach to measure both the biological active free cortisol as well as total cortisol in human serum, compared to a laboratory-based chemiluminescence analysis technique. This alternative portable Raman method produced results that were consistent with results obtained from previous methods, which has the potential for further miniaturisation for <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> applications...|$|E

Data sources Studies on the diagnostic accuracy <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care D-dimer <b>tests</b> published between January 1995 and September 2008 and available in either Medline or Embase. Review methods The analysis included studies that compared <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care D-dimer <b>tests</b> with predefined reference criteria for venous thromboembolism, enrolled consecutive outpatients, and allowed for construction of a 2 x 2 table. Results 23 studies (total number of patients 13 959, range in mean age 38 - 65 years, range of venous thromboembolism prevalence 4 - 51 %) were included in the meta-analysis.

40|$|<b>Point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> {{describes}} testing using handheld or benchtop technology, {{where the}} result will be used in the screening for, or the diagnosis and/or the management of, disease. It is an alternative to using the services of a centralized facility such as a laboratory. The successful use <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> technology demands that the quality of the result can be assured and that a clinical and/or economic benefit can be demonstrated. As with benchtop technology, handheld technologies have features to deal with all the steps in the analytical process. The quality of the result depends on the manufacturing process of the device and the competence of the operator. The potential for clinical and/or economic benefit will exist wherever the rapid provision of the result enables a decision to be made immediately and appropriate action implemented. This may include making or ruling out a diagnosis; the latter leading to an alternative diagnostic pathway or discharge of the patient. The clinical benefits, however, will also depend on the implementation of an intervention and will be measured in terms of improved morbidity and mortality. However, in both the design of outcome studies as well as the routine management of patients, surrogate markers of outcome may be used to assess the value <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> and intervention. In patients with chronic diseases a test may be used to assess the status of the patient and the effectiveness of the intervention, thus playing an important role in maintaining patient compliance. Diabetes mellitus provides an excellent exemplar <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> care <b>testing</b> producing both positive clinical and economic outcomes in the management of a chronic disease.
