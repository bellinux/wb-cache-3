5|$|However, a newer study {{compared}} incidence {{rates of}} skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus {{and showed that}} these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a <b>protective</b> <b>structure,</b> while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as Centrosaurus was {{more closely related to}} Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat with predators using horns, Triceratops are classically shown engaging {{each other in}} combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on Triceratops skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a <b>protective</b> <b>structure,</b> while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in Triceratops. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of Triceratops is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling.|$|E

500|$|As in all Geastrum fungi, the {{internal}} spore-producing gleba is enclosed in the peridium, a <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> composed of four layers of tissue: an inner endoperidium, and outer exoperidium that may further {{be divided into}} an external mycelial, a tough and membranous middle fibrillose layer, and an internal fleshy layer (known as the pseudoparenchyma). The immature, unopened fruit body is roughly spherical to somewhat flattened or irregular in shape. It lies partly or wholly submerged, encrusted with debris. [...] The expanded fruit body is usually taller than it is wide, about [...] high, with mycelial cup included about [...] The exoperidium (the outer tissue layer of the four-layered peridium) splits in the middle into three to six, but usually four or five rays. The exoperidium is typically —a structural feature that arises when the mesoperidium separates from the exoperidium, adhering only at the edge. In this way, the endoperidium ({{the internal}} tissue layer that encloses the spore sac) is lifted upwards with the downward movement of the rays. In this species, {{the tips of the}} rays remain attached to the mycelial layer, which remain attached to the substrate as a cup in the ground.|$|E
500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E

A considerable number of shelters and enclosures have been constructed of transparent materials to enhance the display function.

The selected examples illustrated that greenhouse effect, condensation, loss of transparency and excessive lighting are the problems to be considered in the design process.
