5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, <b>parsley</b> <b>root</b> and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to measure the levels of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb) found in common {{vegetables}} (parsley, carrot, onion, lettuce, cucumber and green beans) grown in contaminated mining areas compared with those grown in reference clear area and to determine their potential detrimental effects via calculation of the daily metal intake (DImetal) and Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) for normal daily consumption of these vegetables, for male and female gender. Results Compared with the reference in contaminated areas, soil and plant contents of all analyzed metals are higher, usually over normally content for Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb. Particularly, in soil, higher values than intervention threshold values (ITV) were found for Cu and Pb and higher than maximum allowable limits (MAL) for Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb for <b>parsley</b> <b>roots</b> and leaves, carrot roots, cabbage, lettuce and cucumber. DImetal and THQ values for male and female were calculated for each vegetable and metal and for which oral reference doses exist. The combined THQ values calculated are concerning in that they are usually below the safe level of THQ Conclusion The results of this study regarding metal contents in soils, vegetables, DImetal and THQ suggest that the consumption of some vegetables (especially parsley, carrot and cabbage and less for lettuce, cucumber and green beans) is not free of risks in these areas. The complex THQ parameter use in health risk assessment of heavy metals provides a better image than using only a simple parameter (contents of metals in soils and vegetables). </p...|$|R

40|$|Parsley is {{a typical}} root {{vegetable}} grown in this coun-try. The area under parsley in the Czech Republic is around 1, 500 ha.

A current Czech list of registered cultivars includes 14 parsley cul-tivars of inland and foreign origin. The quality of a large portion of domestic production is still below the market demand. Mean annual consumption of parsley is nearly 2 kg per capita. The nutritional value of <b>parsley</b> <b>roots</b> is characterised by mean content (in mg/kg of fresh matter) of 5. 3 mg of beta-carotene, 1. 1 mg of thiamine, 1. 0 mg of riboflavin, 1. 6 mg of pyridoxine, 340 mg of vitamin C (KOPEC 1998).

Selected {{research}} polygon {{is located}} in Trzebinia commune in the mid of the 80 km way from Kraków to Katowice (the Upper Silesia capital). The towns of Trzebinia, Chrzanów within the towns of Krzeszowice, Jaworzno, Mysłowice, have been creating a base of well-connected Kraków-Upper Silesia agglomeration. The inhabitants of Trzebinia commune are flexible on labour market, often commute to work in Kraków or Katowice. They have detached houses with gardens {{of one or two}} acres size, where "home-made", fresh, low-processed food could be produced. At the same time the area of Trzebinia Community belongs to Chrzanów geochemical anomaly, which is reflected in high values of cadmium, lead and zinc contents in the soils. This is the result of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The purpose of the paper was to evaluate lead and iron contents in roots and leaves of parsley being cultivated within the area of the anomaly. Considering, there is a positive geochemical anomaly, the lead contents in soil were low - the average value was 88. 67 mg kg - 1 d. m. and only two contents - 218. 98 and 119. 35 exceeded 100 mg kg - 1 d. m. On the other hand the lead contents in <b>parsley</b> <b>roots</b> were high, many times higher than the allowable values. The lead contents in parsley leaves were also high. Phytoaccumulation indices low, only one had the average value, but at their minimal range (1. 02 and 10. 3 adequately for leaves and roots). Translocation index of lead was close to one. The iron contents in soils were not high and fall within the scope of low and average ranges that occur in Polish soils. The iron contents in leaves were high, attractive from nutrition point of view. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: parsley, geochemical anomaly, food quality...|$|R
