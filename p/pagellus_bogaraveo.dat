Studies on small–scale fisheries could help to improve our understanding of the effect of climate on the ecology of exploited stocks. The Strait of Gibraltar is an important fishery ground for artisanal fleets. In this area, b lackspot seabream (<b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo)</b> is the main species targeted by artisanal fisheries in view of its relevance in landed weight. The aims of this study were to explore the possible effects of two atmospheric oscillations, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO), on the capture of blackspot seabream in the Strait of Gibraltar, to determine their association with oceanographic conditions, and to improve our knowledge about the possible effects of climate change on fisheries ecology so that fishery management can be improved. We used two types of data from different sources: (i) landings per unit of effort reported from a second working group between Morocco and Spain on <b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo</b> in the Gibraltar Strait area, for the period 1983 – 2011, and (ii) the recorded blackspot seabream landings obtained from the annual fisheries statistics published by the Junta de Andalucía (Andalusian Regional Government).

The recovery plan was specifically targeted at the problem of overcapacity. Technical efficiency, capacity output and capacity utilization is measured during the stock recovery plan. The fishing capacity of liners located in the port of Tarifa is calculated to test the effects of this recovery plan over the period 1998 Â– 2001 using data envelopment analysis.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the potential for}} simulation and modelling of the blackspot seabream (<b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo)</b> population in the Strait of Gibraltar to discriminate the environmental effects of fishery impacts. A discrete biomass–abundance dynamic model was implemented to obtain a simulated monthly time series of blackspot seabream biomass. On this simulated time series, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were fitted. The best ARIMA fit provided a significant correlation of 0. 76 and persistence index higher than 0. 85. The proportion of variance non-explained by the ARIMA models was correlated with a time series of sea surface temperature (SST) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The analysis of global, annual and winter correlation between the proportion of variance not explained by the ARIMA models and environmental variables showed that significant associations were not detected over the full time series.

Significant differences in average fish length between all hooks, except in one case, were found. The comparison of two experimental fishing trials within 4 years indicates a displacement towards smaller sizes in the size frequency distributions. The {{results of this study}} show that the fishing gear can be size selective depending on hook size. The fitted selectivity models for each experiments were very different despite having two hooks in common.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to gain {{insights}} into the mechanism of muscle differentiation and growth in <b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo,</b> by studying Muscle fibre phenotypes identified by immunohistochemistry. At hatching, several layers of deep fast-white fibres were covered by a superficial fibre monolayer. At 5 days, slow-red fibres appeared near the lateral line nerve. At 40 days, the intermediate-pink muscle became visible, and in the slow-red and fast-white muscle layers transitions from larval myosin isoforms to the isoforms typical of adult muscle occurred. Between 70 and 100 days, small fibres with a distinct ATPase profile appeared throughout the fast-white muscle, marking the onset of "mosaic" hyperplasia. The myosin of the original superficial monolayer fibres underwent two myosin transformations, before being slowly replaced by an adult slow-red isoform. In juveniles and adults, the slow-red muscle layer Could be resolved into two distinct types. The analysis of fibre phenotypes indicated that post-larval muscle growth occurred by two distinct stages of hyperplasia.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on <b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo</b> muscle cellularity were investigated, by morphometry, throughout the endogenous feeding stage, testing two rearing temperatures: 14 and 18 degrees C. The following parameters were estimated in transversal body sections at post-opercular and post-anal body levels: the total cross-sectional muscle area, {{the total number}} of fibres and the mean cross-sectional fibre area. At hatching, no significant influence of the temperature was observed on the morphometric parameters measured in the white muscle. At mouth opening, {{an increase in the number}} of post-opercular white fibres was promoted by the highest temperature. During embryonic development, the red muscle fibre number in the post-anal part of the larvae increased with higher temperature, but it appears that the difference was no longer present at mouth opening. An increase in the fibre area and in the total cross-sectional area of red muscle at the post-anal level was promoted by a 4 degrees C increase in the temperature during the vitelline phase.

40|$|Stochastic {{simulations}} {{were used}} to evaluate the influence of recruitment pattern (log-normal, decreasing), size selectivity (normal, logistic model) and fishing mortality pattern (abrupt, continuous increase in fishing mortality) on the evolution of mean length and the dispersion of mean length for a relatively long-lived deep-water species, the black spot sea bream (<b>Pagellus</b> <b>bogaraveo).</b> An abrupt increase in fishing mortality resulted in mean size decreasing and stabilizing at a lower level while a steady increase in fishing mortality caused the continuous decrease in mean size that has been reported for many long-lived species. Decrease in mean size was greatest for logistic model simulations and for cases where fish were susceptible to capture at a small size. Logistic selectivity, with decreasing recruitment and increasing fishing mortality over time, resulted in mean length and variability in mean length trends similar to that observed for the Strait of Gibraltar fishery. Furthermore, it was found with the declining recruitment that moderate increases in fishing mortality can result in significant decreases in mean length. Given the importance of mean size as an indicator of the state of a resource, these simulations are a useful alternative or complement to standard fisheries assessment methods, helping to provide information on exploitation patterns and rates {{that can be used for}} conservation and management...|$|E
