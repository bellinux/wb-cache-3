When equipped with this type of wrist, a robotâ€™s entire reachable workspace becomes the dexterous workspace. Because some wrist joint limitations may need to be im-posed under practical consideration, to better assess this new wrist design, kinematics on robot point accessibility is derived. An algo-One method of designing such a zero-dimension wrist is to replace the intermediate joint of a Euler angle wrist with a linkage. Guinot and Biduad (1986) replaced the intermediate joint with a <b>Peaucellier</b> <b>inversor</b> mechanism. Another design based on this concept was created by Mosher as described in a text by Rosheim (1989). This design, used by Pilarski (1984) and Trevelyan et al. (1986), consists of replacing th...|$|E

It is named after Charles-Nicolas Peaucellier (1832 - 1913), a French army officer, and Yom Tov Lipman Lipkin (1846 - 1876), a Lithuanian Jew and son of the famed Rabbi Israel Salanter.|$|R
