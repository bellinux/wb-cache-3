At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June. The figure also included foreign militants killed. Two drone attacks on 12 June killed Uzbek, Afghan and local militants. On 15 June the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> intensified air-strikes and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts, killing as many as 140 militants (most Uzbek, including persons linked to the airport attack and airport attack commander and mastermind Abu Abdur Rehman Almani) in North Waziristan.|$|E

5|$|Planners {{believed}} the SEALs {{could get to}} Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military.</b> The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known. The U.S. had supplied F-16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> base under 24-hour U.S. surveillance.|$|E
50|$|Ali Akbor Shikdar had {{collected}} arms from the Bagundia camp {{and with the}} help of Captain Afzal entered into Bangladesh.

Captain Afzal fought under the instruction of Abdul Jalil who was the commander of sector 9.|$|R
25|$|The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack, describing it as revenge for Operation Zarb-e-Azb, the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military's</b> offensive in North Waziristan that started in summer 2014.|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} by the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> to launch a comprehensive operation was widely supported, with journalists, opinion-makers, politicians and other social-media users commending the operation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> had {{prepared}} for the operation long before, and the government prepared for a three-front operation: isolating targeted militant groups, obtaining support from the political parties and saving civilians from the backlash of the operation.|$|E
5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) {{officials said they were}} present at what they called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> had scrambled F-16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat {{to achieve a}} ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E
5|$|The War Office {{authorized}} the award of the clasp Malakand 1897 to the India Medal {{for those of}} the British and Indian armies {{who participated in this}} action. The battleground remained closed to visitors and under military control since the publication of Churchill's memoirs, and is the location of a <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> base. However, in 2006 the Pakistani government began opening the area to foreign visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States still {{has the ability to}} conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military,</b> the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E

Because the area was impassable in that time. So the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>militaries</b> guarded through the rivers with their gunboat all the time. As a result, the freedom fighters of this area fought many parts of the country.|$|R

5|$|Yousafzai {{was born}} in Mingora, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Jinnah and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was {{particularly}} inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian work. In early 2009, when she was 11–12, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life during the Taliban occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> intervened in the region. She rose in prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.|$|E
5|$|Not all <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> {{personnel}} {{supported the}} violence: General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, who advised the president against military action, and Major Ikram Sehgal both resigned in protest, as did Air Marshal Asghar Khan. Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, a Balochi politician, and Khan Abdul Wali Khan, {{leader of the}} National Awami Party, protested over {{the actions of the}} armed forces. Those imprisoned for their dissenting views on the violence included Sabihuddin Ghausi and I. A. Rahman, who were both journalists, the Sindhi leader G. M. Syed, the poet Ahmad Salim, Anwar Pirzado, {{who was a member of}} the air force, Professor M. R. Hassan, Tahera Mazhar and Imtiaz Ahmed. Malik Ghulam Jilani, who was also arrested, had openly opposed the armed action in the East; a letter he had written to Yahya Khan was widely publicised. Altaf Hussain Gauhar, the editor of the Dawn newspaper, was also imprisoned. In 2013 Jilani and Faiz Ahmad Faiz, a poet, were honoured by the Bangladeshi government for their actions.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E
50|$|For Pakistan {{it was a}} {{complete}} and humiliating defeat, a psychological setback that came from a defeat {{at the hands of}} rival India. Pakistan lost half its population and a significant portion of its economy and suffered setbacks to its geopolitical role in South Asia. In the post-war era, Pakistan struggled to absorb the lessons learned from the military interventions in the democratic system and the impact of the <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military's</b> failure was grave and long-lasting.|$|R

5|$|Within {{two days}} of Phet's passage, most of the {{evacuees}} were allowed to return home. In Gwadar however, storm flooding caused shortages of food and medicine, leading to price increases. Balochistan Chief Minister Aslam Raisani allocated RS500million toward reconstructing damaged areas. The Sindh provincial government declared six districts as disaster areas. The government opened 214relief camps, with 160 in Karachi alone; these facilities also gave out food to storm victims. These relief camps were also opened in schools to service as temporary hospitals, with 24medical teams dispatched {{by the government to}} helped injured residents. The <b>Pakistani</b> <b>military</b> helped in search and rescue missions, and also traveled by air and sea to bring emergency blankets, tents, and medicine to damaged coastal towns. Responding to the storm damage, the Save the Children organization sent supplies to its Hyderabad office, including medical kits for two weeks of care for 8,000people, as well as 34,000water purification tablets. The International Red Cross's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund provided US$45,935 to support the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, which gave out 5,000mosquito nets, along with food and tents to affected families.|$|E
