A considerable amount of <b>production</b> <b>work</b> was required afterward before the track reached its final form.|$|E

During the sessions for the final of these, New Morning, Dylan decided {{that he did not}} want to continue working with Johnston. Al Kooper did uncredited <b>production</b> <b>work</b> to help Dylan finish the album. For his next recording session, Dylan asked Leon Russell, who made his name with Joe Cocker, to assist in finding a new sound. Russell suggested that Dylan come with him to Blue Rock Studios in New York City to record some new material.|$|E

They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and <b>production</b> <b>work</b> being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa.

5|$|The College Dropout is {{the debut}} studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was {{released}} on February 10, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. It was recorded {{over a period of}} four years, beginning in 1999. Prior to the album's release, West had received praise for his <b>production</b> <b>work</b> for artists such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as a recording artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Nonetheless intent on pursuing a solo career, it was several years before West finally received a record deal from Roc-A-Fella Records.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{began in}} 1943 when Monsanto's Charles Allen Thomas was {{recruited}} by the Manhattan Project to coordinate the plutonium purification and <b>production</b> <b>work</b> being carried out at various sites. Scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory calculated that a plutonium bomb would require a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources used radioactive polonium and beryllium, so Thomas undertook to produce polonium at Monsanto's laboratories in Dayton.|$|E

5|$|The <b>production</b> <b>work</b> of Drushyam was {{undertaken}} by Suresh Balaje and George Pious. Music {{for the film}} was composed by Sharreth. The cinematography was led by S. Gopal Reddy and the editing by Marthand K. Venkatesh. Principal photography commenced on 8 March 2014 and lasted three months. It was shot primarily in Kerala, similar to the original, and also filmed at Araku, Simhachalam, Vizianagaram and Hyderabad. The post-production phase ended after one month. Drushyam released on 11 July 2014 to positive feedback from critics.

5|$|The <b>production</b> <b>work</b> was exhaustive, {{involving}} {{the filming of}} numerous churches in Norfolk, both ancient and more modern. Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by accident or by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher managed to find, on request, a vicar who had an extensive model railway in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Experiment led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), both {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier's <b>production</b> <b>work</b> on them became increasingly ambitious. For Quatermass II, he pre-filmed {{a significant amount of}} material on location, using 35mm film, opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his <b>production</b> <b>work</b> for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E
5|$|When the {{agreement}} was finalised, the United Kingdom and West Germany each had a 42.5% stake of the workload, with the remaining 15% going to Italy; this division of the <b>production</b> <b>work</b> was heavily influenced by international political bargaining. The front fuselage and tail assembly was assigned to BAC (now BAE Systems) in the United Kingdom; the centre fuselage to MBB (now EADS) in West Germany; and the wings to Aeritalia (now Alenia Aeronautica) in Italy. Similarly, tri-national worksharing was used for engines, general and avionic equipment. A separate multinational company, Turbo-Union, was formed in June 1970 to develop and build the RB199 engines for the aircraft, with ownership similarly split 40% Rolls-Royce, 40% MTU, and 20% FIAT.|$|E

Gnädinger said he got in touch with Swiss wrestling only once, as a boy. Ursula Gnädinger assisted her husband at the <b>production</b> <b>works</b> as make-up artist.
