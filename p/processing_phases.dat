Despite these changes, a LIMS tends to have a base set of functionality that defines it. That functionality can roughly be divided into five laboratory <b>processing</b> <b>phases,</b> with numerous software functions falling under each:(1) the reception and log in of a sample and its associated customer data, (2) the assignment, scheduling, and tracking of the sample and the associated analytical workload, (3) the processing and quality control associated with the sample and the utilized equipment and inventory, (4) the storage of data associated with the sample analysis, (5) the inspection, approval, and compilation of the sample data for reporting and/or further analysis ...|$|E

50|$|However, {{over the}} past two decades, coarse bubble {{diffusers}} have been used less frequently, primarily due to the ever increasing cost of energy and the availability of more reliable, highly efficient fine bubble diffusers. Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings. Specifically, in aeration tanks, a system that utilizes coarse bubble diffusers requires 30 to 40 percent more process air than a fine bubble diffused air system to provide the same level of treatment. The exception would be in secondary treatment (or side <b>processing)</b> <b>phases.</b> In these processing tanks, floc particles, sediment and carbonate buildup tend to plug or clog the small air release openings on the fine bubble diffusers. Because of their small air openings, fine bubble diffusers cease to have an advantage. Currently, coarse bubble diffusers are the mainstay solution.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the event}} dispatcher {{is responsible for}} the event detection and the event handler is responsible for event processing. Therefore, the event detection and event <b>processing</b> <b>phases</b> could overlap. Also, because event handlers are able to work independently, the event <b>processing</b> <b>phases</b> of different events can overlap, which makes it possible to process the events in parallel. These are the key features that make our event-driven architecture as customizable and scalable. The proposed sensor node architecture locates all computation resources locally as needed by the event handler to process a particular event. Therefore, event handlers do not need to signal an interrupt to request the resources for task processing. As a result, there is no interrupt overhead in our architecture.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a hybrid time-frequency {{approach}} {{for the detection of}} audio signal patterns for the purpose of surveillance applications. The proposed detection algorithm evolves through two main <b>processing</b> <b>phases,</b> denoted as coarse and fine, respectively. The key idea is that of distinguishing classes of audio signals on the basis of spectral “signatures. ” However, we use different <b>processing</b> <b>phases,</b> in the time (“coarse”) and frequency (“fine”) domains, {{in order to reduce the}} computational complexity. In fact, fine processing (in the frequency domain) is carried out only when an "atypical" audio signal is detected, on the basis of low-complexity energy detection, with coarse processing. The performance of the proposed detection algorithm is investigated also using experimental audio signals acquired with the microphone module of a multi-sensorial wireless sensor network (WSN) node prototype. The obtained results show that the proposed approach allows to effectively detect a signal of interest, thus making it suitable to surveillance applications and in general for distributed sensing applications...|$|E
