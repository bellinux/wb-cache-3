40|$|This report {{concerns}} part 2 of {{a project}} with the aim to propose protective measures for cables and pipelines for bio and natural gas. The wish {{is to be able}} to increase the pressure in the distribution networks from 4 to 10 bars without having to retain the safety distances valid for 80 bar pipelines. Polymer, concrete and steel protective plates, and deep digging are the physical measures considered. In part 1 a survey was made, in part by an enquiry, of the frequency, causes and conse-quences of incidents where pipelines were hit by excavators. Further, the rules and standards were investigated in countries where 7 - 10 bar pipelines are already in service. Now a visit to a supplier in France is reported, as well as an investigation of costs and environmental impact of the different protective measures, and an analysis of the strength of protective plates and of how they can best be positioned in the ground in relationship to the pipeline. The main result from the study visit to France was that new regulations mean that both new and existing pipelines have to be satisfactorily protected. For the physical part of these plastic protective plates play an important part, and there are commercially available building systems of plates for which the strength and durability have been verified by tests. The analysis of costs and environmental impact shows that plastic plates are to prefer with regard to both aspects. In addition they have a very good signalling effect being produced in a bright yellow colour. Also deep digging can be effective taking into account environmental and costs aspects, but the risk reduction will according to literature be less than for the plates. Plastic plates are shown, in the literature surveyed, by full scale experiments to have at least as good, and sufficient, resistance to impact as concrete ones. This is verified by in-house numerical analyses. A discussion is presented of how well the geometric design of pipeline and <b>protective</b> <b>plate</b> protects the pipeline against some digging scenarios with excavators of different sizes. Since the regulations are differing between countries and comprise a mix of administra-tive and physical protective measures in a way that is not quite evident, it was also found worthwhile to make a note, for possible further use, on how risk analysis can, and has been, used in connection with the establishment of major pipelines for optimization of protective measures...|$|E
40|$|When a {{computer}} code {{is used to}} simulate a complex system, a fundamental task is to assess {{the uncertainty of the}} simulator. In the case of computationally expensive simulators, this is often accomplished via a surrogate statistical model, a statistical output emulator. An effective emulator is one that provides good approximations to the computer code output for wide ranges of input values. In addition, an emulator should be able to handle large dimensional simulation output for a relevant number of inputs; it should flexibly capture heterogeneities in the variability of the response surface; it should be fast to evaluate for arbitrary combinations of input parameters; and it should provide an accurate quantification of the emulation uncertainty. In this work, we develop Bayesian adaptive spline methods for emulation of computer models that output functions. We introduce modifications to traditional Bayesian adaptive spline approaches that allow for fitting large amounts of data and allow for more efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We develop a functional approach to sensitivity analysis that can be performed using this emulator. We present a sensitivity analysis of {{a computer}} model of the deformation of a <b>protective</b> <b>plate</b> used in pressure driven experiments. This example serves as an illustration of the ability of Bayesian adaptive spline emulators to fulfill all the necessities of computability, flexibility and reliable calculation on relevant measures of sensitivity. We extend the methods to emulation of an atmospheric dispersion simulator that outputs a plume in space and time based on inputs detailing the characteristics of the release, some of which are categorical. We achieve accurate emulation using Bayesian adaptive splines to model weights on empirical orthogonal functions. We extend the adaptive spline methodology to allow for categorical inputs. We use this emulator as well as appropriately identifiable simulator discrepancy and observational error models to calibrate the simulator using a dataset from an experimental release of particles from the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in Central California. Since the release was controlled, these characteristics are known, allowing us to compare our findings to the truth. We further extend the methods to emulate a computer model that outputs misaligned functional data. We do this by modeling the aligned, or warped, data as well as the warping functions, using separate Bayesian adaptive spline models. We explore inference methods that treat these models jointly and separately, and establish methods to ensure that the warping functions are non-decreasing. These methods are applied to a high-energy-density physics model that outputs a curve representing energy as a function of time...|$|E

Part 1 was previously reported in SGC Rapport 2011 : 239.

Polymer, concrete and steel <b>protective</b> <b>plates,</b> and deep digging are the physical measures considered.

Further, the rules and standards were investigated in countries where 7 – 10 bar pipelines are already in service. Here, in part 2 the perspective was widened to include, apart from gas pipelines, also all kinds of buried pipelines and cables. Now a visit to a supplier in France is reported, as well as an vestigation of costs and environmental impacts of the different protective measures, and an analysis of the strength of <b>protective</b> <b>plates</b> and of how they can best be positioned in the ground in relationship to the pipeline.

For the physical point of view these plastic <b>protective</b> <b>plates</b> play an important part, and there are commercially available building systems of plates for which the strength and durability have been verified by tests. In the full scale experiments done in, e. g., France, it can be concluded that the plastic (HDPE) plates can wit stand high loads which are applied by use of a bucket with teeth mounted on an excavator. In some cases penetration of teeth occurs, but the plates will in that case either come up and alert the operator or stay in the ground and still protect the buried cable or pipeline. Concrete plate can also break, but the pieces are held together by the steel reinforcement. The analysis of costs and environmental impacts shows that plastic plates are preferred with regard to both aspects. In addition they have a very good signalling effect being produced in a bright yellow colour. Also deep digging can be effective taking into account costs and environmental aspects, but the risk reduction will according to literature be less than for the plates. Plastic plates are shown, in the literature surveyed, by full scale experiments to have at least as good, and sufficient, resistance to impact as concrete ones. This is verified by in-house numerical analyses. The finite element analyses show that the plastic plates deforms but do not break.

Yanagida also points out that the eldest versions of Utsuro-bune describe humble, circular and open log-boats without any dome atop. Yanagida assumes that the details of the brazen plates and windows made of glass or crystal were added because sceptics would question the seaworthiness of a humble log-boat on the high seas. A steel reinforced Utsuro-bune with glass windows would more easily survive travelling on the ocean than an open, unreinforced wooden boat.|$|R
