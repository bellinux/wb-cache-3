5|$|The character, who is of British origin, {{has been}} noted by video game outlets to be a peppy and {{energetic}} character. In game, Tracer is highly mobile, but weak in terms of health. She makes use of her speed through her teleportation and time traveling abilities. Those abilities were caused by an in-universe accident, which left her unable to maintain a <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> in the present until Winston invented the chronal accelerator, a device allowing her to control her <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E

The Black Hand quickly incapacitates him with a spell that also restores the last of Celebrimbor's memories. He then kills himself {{as part of a}} ritual that forces Celebrimbor to depart from Talion and merge with himself. This allows Sauron to possess the Black Hand's body and incarnate in <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> However, Celebrimbor is able to briefly paralyze Sauron from within, allowing Talion to destroy Sauron's <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> With the Black Hand dead, Celebrimbor wishes to depart for Valinor.

5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
5|$|The ba of a god {{was said}} to {{periodically}} leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god. By inhabiting these images, the gods left their concealed state and took on a <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> To the Egyptians, a place or object that was ḏsr—"sacred"—was isolated and ritually pure, and thus fit for a god to inhabit. Temple statues and reliefs, as well as particular sacred animals, like the Apis bull, served as divine intermediaries in this way. Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction. In these states, it was believed, people could {{come close to the}} gods and sometimes receive messages from them. Finally, according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs, human souls pass into the divine realm after death. The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature.|$|E

Stunt director Richard Talmadge employed Geraldine Chaplin to appear in a brief Keystone Cops insert. The film also proved to be young Anjelica Huston's first experience in the film industry as she was called upon by her father, John Huston, to cover the screen shots of Deborah Kerr's hands. The film also marks the debut of Dave Prowse, later the <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, as Frankenstein's monster, a role he would later play again in the Hammer films The Horror of Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. John Le Mesurier features in the early scenes of the film as M's driver.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{writes that}} along with the ongoing social {{evolution}} that occurred after humans left Africa, the human <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> also continued to evolve. This {{is the subject of}} chapter nine, Race; because humans were spread across different continents, and distance and tribal hostility limited gene flow between them, they followed different evolutionary paths. Race is not well understood, he says, because its historical implications cause it to be avoided in modern academic studies. Wade states, however, that there are reasons to reconsider the study of it; the genetic differences between races may give evidence of the different evolutionary pressures they faced, and the differences may be medically relevant. Citing Neil Risch, Wade puts forth that there are five continental races – Africans, Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Native Americans – which are made up of smaller subdivisions called ethnicities. He explicitly avoids discussing the cause of IQ differences between races, but hypothesises that racial differences may have an influence on sporting achievement. Chapter ten, Language, concerns the spread and division of languages. Wade believes that all languages ultimately came from an ancestral language, and that many of its descendants – such as Proto-Indo-European – possibly spread through agriculture. By citing linguists such as Joseph Greenberg, Wade shows that almost all of today's languages belong to families, which in turn may belong to superfamilies such as Eurasiatic.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} unleashing of the king's power, Veigue's Force of Ice {{goes out of}} control, causing his friend Claire to become imprisoned in an ice pillar. One year after this, Veigue is {{contacted}} by Eugene and Mao, who help free Claire from the ice pillar. Shortly after this, Claire is taken away by agents of Agarte, who is searching for the most beautiful Huma woman in the land. Veigue heads out with Eugene and Mao to rescue Claire, eventually joining forces with Annie, Tytree and Hilda. Upon reaching the royal capital of Balka, the group find Agarte using her Force of the Moon to resurrect Geyorkias {{in the belief that}} the spirit will save her kingdom from the chaos consuming it, having been prompted by Zilva. When summoned, Geyorkias declares his intent to destroy the Huma population, forcing the group to attack and destroy his <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat. To quell the violence, the group decide to summon the other Sacred Beasts in the hope of purging Geyorkias' hatred from the land. After rescuing Agarte from a Huma mob, it is revealed that Agarte switched bodies with Claire. In the aftermath, Agarte reveals that she originally captured Claire so she could switch bodies and realize her love for her bodyguard Milhaust, as relations between Huma and Gajama are taboo. Unfortunately, the trauma of events has caused Agarte to lose her Force abilities, leaving Claire and Agarte trapped in each other's bodies.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a survey of}} understanding of <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of substance and of water circulation in nature among the pupils of the seventh grade of primary school. The theoretical part presents the concepts of triple nature of chemical concepts; Johnstone's triangle with three levels of chemical concepts; interdependence of three levels of science concepts model; model {{of teaching and learning}} chemistry, and the results and key findings from various studies in the field of false understanding of <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of substance and chemical concepts related to them. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis gives an overview of selected school textbooks and curricula of subjects Environmental Education, Natural Science and Technology and Natural Sciences from the first to the seventh grade of primary school. The empirical part presents the results of the tests analysis and the interpretation of results {{from the point of view}} of understanding of chemical concepts. The main purpose of the thesis was to determine the understanding of the concepts related to the <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of water, transitions between <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> at the submicroscopic level, presentation of chemical concepts and understanding of the process of water circulation among pupils of the seventh grade of primary school. An adapted written test was prepared for the purpose of the survey, which covered the key chemical concepts related to the teaching content of <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of substance, transitions between <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of substance and water circulation in nature. 228 pupils of the seventh class of elementary schools from Ljubljana and its surroundings participated in the survey. The results of the survey indicate that the tested pupils of the seventh grade of primary schools do not have any difficulties in identifying the <b>physical</b> <b>forms</b> of substance at the submicroscopic level. The problems occur in the understanding of submicroscopic presentations of the condensation, evaporation and melting process. More than half of the tested pupils did not recognize the phase transition between liquid and gaseous form of substance based on the submicroscopic distribution of substance particles. The pupils also have difficulties understanding the chemical concepts related to the process of water circulation in nature, but they are familiar with the process...|$|R

25|$|Samizdat distinguishes itself {{not only}} by the ideas and debates which it helped spread to a wider audience, but also by its <b>physical</b> <b>form.</b> The hand-typed, often blurry and {{wrinkled}} pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature. The <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union. In effect, the <b>physical</b> <b>form</b> of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.|$|E
