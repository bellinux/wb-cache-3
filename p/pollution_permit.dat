40|$|Introduction {{emphasizes}} that the paper deals with {{the analysis of the}} economic effects of the EU Directive on trade with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits.</b> The ideas of trading with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> have their theoretical origins in the economic analysis of law. The second part provides an overview of the two main trading systems with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits.</b> In one system is limited the total mass of pollution that can be traded. This system is essentially a pure tradable permit system. The second system is based on trade with pollution reductions in the future. This section, also pointed out the existence of the possibility for manipulation with the market for <b>pollution</b> <b>permits.</b> There is also a review of basic forms of manipulation. The third part is dedicated to a comparative analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of various trading systems with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits.</b> Special attention is given to the impact of the opportunity cost on preferences by certain companies. In the fourth part the paper analyzes the Directive of the European Commission 2003 / 87 and 2009 / 29 on trade with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits,</b> and the expected results in the reduction of pollution for each of them. The fifth part of the paper predicting the behavior of companies within the EU {{as a result of the}} Directive 2003 / 87 and 2009 / 29. In the sixth and final section the paper concludes that: trade with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> can be an effective instrument in the battle against environmental pollution. But unfortunately sometimes could produce unintended results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the incentive effects of pollution taxes versus <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> for a revenue maximizing Government that also pursues environmental objectives. In our model, <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> are analyzed as durable goods, and the leasing of <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> {{is seen as}} an equivalent to a pollution tax. We show that environmental policy based on durable <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> can be welfare superior to a pollution tax regime. The intuition is that a monopolistic Government would, in order to maximize its revenues, try to restrict the permit sales below the welfare maximizing level. While a pollution tax or leasing charge allows the Government to credibly commit to a monopoly level of pollution in future periods, a system based on durable permits weakens the monopolistic Government?s ability to credibly restrict future sales. Therefore, a pollution tax regime may be better for the environment and simultaneously increase Government revenues, but social welfare is larger with <b>pollution</b> <b>permits.</b> Hence, a regime where the Government cannot commit to monopoly quantities may be preferable from a welfare economic perspective. This argument in favor of durable permits complements more traditional arguments based on information asymmetries and innovation incentives...|$|R

As a means of steering the economy along the optimal path, two types of tradeable <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> are analyzed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 {{attempts}} {{to address the}} problem of global warming by establishing national greenhouse gas emissions targets and timetables. To reduce emissions, the protocol outlines a tradeable <b>pollution</b> <b>permit</b> system. The system would allow countries with high abatement costs to purchase permits from countries with low abatement costs, equalizing global marginal abatement costs. The protocol, however, is destined to fail because of the free-rider problem and the problem of trade leakage. Given the correct guidelines, a tradeable <b>pollution</b> <b>permit</b> system would provide a marketbased, cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I...|$|E

Finally, we propose an algorithm for the discrete time approximation of the trajectories, establish convergence, and provide numerical examples.

40|$|The {{issue of}} how to {{allocate}} <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> is critical for the political sustainability of any cap-and-trade system. Under the objective of offsetting firms' losses resulting from the environmental regulation, we argue that the criteria for allocating free allowances must account {{for the type of}} abatement technology: industries that use process integrated technologies should receive some free allowances, whereas those using end-of-pipe abatement should not. In the long run, we analyze the interaction between the environmental policy and the evolution of the market structure. In particular, a reserve of <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> for new entrants may be justified when the industry uses a process integrated abatement technology.

5000|$|An {{emission}} cap and permit trading {{system is a}} quantity instrument because it fixes the overall emission level (quantity) and allows the price to vary. Uncertainty in future supply and demand conditions (market volatility) coupled with a fixed number of <b>pollution</b> <b>permits</b> creates an uncertainty in the future price of <b>pollution</b> <b>permits,</b> and the industry must accordingly bear the cost of adapting to these volatile market conditions. The burden of a volatile market thus lies with the industry rather than the controlling agency, which is generally more efficient. However, under volatile market conditions, {{the ability of the}} controlling agency to alter the caps will translate into an ability to pick [...] "winners and losers" [...] and thus presents an opportunity for corruption.|$|R

This paper attempts to remedy this void by developing a simple, two-region general equilibrium model with amenities playing a key role in affecting migration flows. Specifically, we argue that in the presence of an environmental externality, interregional labour migration depends not only on wages but also on amenities. People may leave a region offering higher wages, if the resulting utility loss from worsened amenities exceeds the gain in wages. Policies should be adopted by regions or nations to regulate the environment to provide for the quality of living.
