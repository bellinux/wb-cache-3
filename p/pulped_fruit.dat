Additional juice may be extracted from the remaining pulp by hot water. The juice is homogenized, slightly acidified to prevent gelling and improve the flavor, then treated with pectinase or other enzymes {{to break down the}} pectin. Most of the off-flavor agents are then removed with ion-exchange resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer or polyacrylic acid. Alternatively, the off-flavors can be adsorbed by agents like charcoal or bentonite, which are removed by filtration; or precipitated with gelatin or other gelling agents. Most of the remaining sulfurous volatiles are then removed by low-pressure evaporation. The juice is then pasteurized to inactivate remaining natural enzymes and kill micro-organisms. The process is claimed to preserve a substantial fraction of the mogrosides present in the fruit.|$|E

In order to do so, 2 x 2 factorial design treatments were carried out, using two different manners to store fruit prior to pulping, immersed in water and not. Also, two different methods for the pulping of fruit were used for each lot; namely, manual and mechanical. Seeds from fruit that had been immersed in water at 40 °C for 20 minutes showed greater physiological performance than those {{that had not been}} immersed in water previously. Immersion in water at 55 °C resulted in seed death. The pulp extraction method, whether manual or mechanical, did not affect seed physiological performance. Radiographs made it possible to observe that the volume occupied by embryos in the embryo cavity reduced with decreased water content. Mechanical pulping showed no reduction in percentage of seedling emergence for water content up to 33. 3 %. However, reduction in water content to 16. 1 % caused seed death. The drying of manually pulped seeds until reaching 39. 0 % water content did not adversely affect seedling emergence, whereas lower water contents than 25. 6 % caused seed death.

40|$|Africa {{is third}} {{in terms of}} global {{production}} of cashew, producing approximately 100, 000 tonnes per year. Although the crop is much in demand, particularly in the United States and in Europe, Africa gains little profit from its production, most of which is exported raw to India for processing. The Benin example shows very clearly that African countries are able to produce good quality cashew nuts, but it also demonstrates missed opportunities {{when it comes to}} processing and a consequent loss of potential income in regions of production. The cashew nut tree (Anarcardium occidentale) is a 10 m high fruit tree, which came originally from Brazil. It was introduced into Africa long ago and is now more widespread in Africa than in any other continent. It tolerates a wide range of rainfall regimes and is adapted to many types of soil, including marginal, degraded land on which it can be planted for reforestation. The fruit comprises the highly-prized nut, which is surrounded by a false fruit, the cashew apple. The cashew nut kernel is used as a cocktail delicacy or in the food industry for the manufacture of nougat, biscuits, ice creams etc [...] The juicy, sweet cashew apple has nine times more vitamin C than the orange and the <b>pulped</b> <b>fruit</b> can be used for fruit juice, alcohol, sweets or fruit pies. The cashew nut shell liquid, which is extracted from the shell surrounding the kernel, is an astringent, corrosive oil valued by industry for its unique properties which make it useful for the manufacture of vehicle brakes, clutch linings and insulating material. Brazil and India are the two major producers of cashew nuts, (200, 000 t and 120, 000 t per year respectively). The third largest global source of nuts is Africa (about 100, 000 t), of which Tanzania produces 15, 000 t, and Mozambique 4, 000 t; Kenya, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal and Togo are also significant producers. Case history: Benin Benin now occupies a significant place in cashew nut production: its exports have increased from 3, 500 t in 1993 to 15, 500 t in 1996. Benin cashews command a high price because of their quality, which bas earned the country {{a reputation as one of}} the three best producers in the world. Even though Benin cashew nuts in the international market are priced at 25 % more than those from other countries, most exporters say that they cannot meet demand. Like the cashew production from other African countries, most of Benin's cashews end up in India, which absorbs 90 % of the country's exports, and the demand ensures a premium price. According to Jean-François Vavasseur of the French Development Bank in Cotonou, 'The revenue from cashew plantations is very attractive because of continuing demand, particularly since devaluation of the CFA franc. ' The growth in the number of cashew trees planted has been spectacular in recent years, particularly in cotton-growing areas, where farmers plant trees directly in the cotton fields. This practice is welcomed, because it encourages farmers to protect their fields from bush fires. Furthermore, farmers, entrepreneurs and young, qualified people are also investing in the production chain. A study by the Ministry of Rural Development takes the view that, 'The continuing increase in world demand, which is still not being met by production, should guarantee a sound future for this product. ' This is confirmed by the French Development Bank in Cotonou which suggests that, 'The development of cashew nut production appears to be one of the most important in the search for diversification in agricultural production and sources of revenue for the rural population. ' This is of particular significance to, Benin, where there is a need to diversify from cotton production which, in 1994, accounted for 70 % of export earnings. ' A complex processing method In Benin, as in much of Africa, the cashew nut is not processed where it is grown. The high-value kernel is difficult to extract because it is surrounded by a liquid and the whole kernel protected by a shell. If the shell is simply cracked open, the result is an oily paste. The simplest processing method, which is used in India, is to toast the nuts and then crack them to, obtain the kernels, which are then graded. The process must be done carefully because if the kernel is broken it loses more than half its value. Processing plants using this technique of heating or roasting have been installed in Africa, notably in Madagascar, Mozambique and Benin, but the problems of obtaining sufficient and consistent supply of raw material has meant that many have now closed. India has a processing capacity of about 600, 000 t per year which is much higher than its own local production. Indian manufacturers are therefore ready to pay a significant advance in order to ensure supply. Their buyers go round African villages and give farmers an advance in order to establish priority purchase over competitors. Local African factories are therefore unable to obtain an adequate supply of cashew nuts because they cannot meet the purchase price that the Indian buyers have negotiated; yet they still remain profitable. Some estimates have suggested that African countries are losing about $ 100 million per year by not processing their cashew nuts. The technology used in India could be adapted for Africa and small processing units set up to absorb production. The potential is good, particularly if the results of research on hybridization of varieties, control of diseases and improved cultural practices were to be made widely known. Benin, and also Mozambique, are beginning to bring their disused factories back into production as a response to, growing demand for the product, particularly from new markets in the Middle-East and South East Asia. The factory in Parakou, in Benin, which bas been shut since 1987, is expected to be operational again by the end of 1997, with the capacity to process 1, 500 t of nuts per year. In order to compete with Indian buyers, a plantation of 800 hectares of cashew trees will supply the factory with raw material. It will be interesting to follow progress. If the enterprise is successful it may encourage other African countries to follow suit and get a better cash return from their cashews.

Sixty guava accessions established in a field germplasm bank, at Embrapa Tropical Semi-Arid, Petrolina, Pernambuco State, Brazil, were evaluated for total antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, lycopene and beta-carotene, titrable acidity, soluble solids and total soluble sugars. The accessions, including guavas of white (n= 10), red (n= 23) and pink pulp (n= 27), were grown in a block design experiment, with two replications/ accession. An ANOVA was performed, decomposing the degrees of freedom for the three pulp color groups in order to test the contrast to the nine evaluated compounds. The accessions presented high variability (p< 0. 01) for all compounds. Guava white pulp did not presented variability for the majority of compounds, except soluble solids, while guava red and pink pulps presented high variability (p < 0. 01) for most compounds, except flavonoids in pink pulp guava and flavonoids, beta-carotene, soluble solids and total sugars in red <b>pulp</b> <b>fruit.</b> The white*red and pink pulp contrast was significant (p< 0. 01) for most compounds, except for titrable acidity and soluble solids, with the greater mean values found in the accessions of pink red pulp, except for total soluble sugars.

The microbiological status of the treatments was also at acceptable levels at the proposed shelf life of 21 days after which, spoilage microorganisms started to grow. The added <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> increased their keeping quality by increasing the shelf life. The composition of the two desserts types was also acceptable and compared well with results from other studies. It still remains that the fat content played a major role in distinguishing the two dessert types. The effect of the fat, fruit and fat/fruit interaction was evaluated. During shelf life studies, the effect of the fat, fruit, fat/fruit, day, day/fat, day/fruit as well as the day/fat/fruit interaction was also evaluated on the microbiological, pH and titratable acidity values of the treatments with a tendency to decrease by day with an increase in the percentage fruit added.

Samples (100 g each) of the seed dhal and flour added and mixed together with aqueous suspensions (0, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 or 5. 0 g per 5 ml water) of tamarind <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> were analysed for TBA values within 4 months of storage at 26 ± 2 °C. The water and ethanol extracts scavenged DPPH in a dose-dependent manner. The ethanol extract had IC 50 of 38. 17 while the water extract had IC 50 of 7. 32, indicating much higher antioxidant activity of water extract. Tamarind <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> inhibited lipid oxidation in breadfruit seed dhal and flour as evident from the mean thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value which decreased with increasing concentrations of the <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp.</b> Antioxidant activity of the <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> was higher in the flour than in the dhal within 4 months of storage. Both seed dhal and flour treated with tamarind <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> had lower mean TBA values ranging from 2. 80 to 4. 12 ppm Malonaldehyde as against 4. 55 to 4. 91 ppm for untreated samples. Tamarind fruit can thus be further studied for possible exploitation as a natural antioxidant for use in food, drug and cosmetic products...|$|R

40|$|Wild fruits make an {{important}} source of variation and complementation for food security, health, social and economic welfare of rural communities, provide significant nutritional contribution and create palatable and balanced diets. Butyrospermum paradoxum Gaertn f. tree grows wild in the West African Savanna and its <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> constitutes more than 50 % on fresh weight basis. There is dearth of information on geographic and yearly variation in nutrient composition of the <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp,</b> hence this study was undertaken to provide information on geographic and yearly variation in nutrient content of Butyrospermum paradoxum Gaertn f. <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp.</b> Fresh <b>fruits</b> were collected and the pulp carefully removed by scraping with spatula. Proximate and mineral composition of the pulp was determined using standard methods of analysis of AOAC and atomic absorption spectrophotometric methods respectively. 100 g fresh pulp sample from Ilorin, Ede and Saki contained 6. 9, 6. 5, and 4. 8 g crude protein, 4. 2, 2. 7, and 10. 1 g crude lipid, 6. 5, 5. 7, and 3. 6 g crude fibre, and 1. 5, 1. 7 and 2. 4 g ash respectively. Ede pulp sample had the highest value of potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron and zinc, while Ilorin pulp had the highest sodium value. The pulp from the three zones was rich in macro-minerals, while the one from Ede seemed to be richest source of both macro- and micro-minerals. The results of yearly variation in nutrient content of Ilorin <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> over the three year period of study revealed that the chemical composition of Butyrospermum paradoxum <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> was dependent on the climatic and soil conditions prevailing each year...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{reported}} for the quantification of isoorientin (using a standard addition method) and total flavonoids (expressed as rutin, using the external standard method) in passion <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> (Passiflora edulis Sims f. flavicarpa Degener, Passifloraceae). Extraction of flavonoids was optimized by experimental design methodology, and quantitative analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photo-diode array detection (HPLC-UV/DAD). The method was developed and validated according to ICH requirements for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision). LOD and LOQ. Rutin was chosen as standard for the quantification of total flavonoids in order to propose a HPLC method feasible for routine analysis of the flavonoids in the passion <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp.</b> The passion <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> contained 16. 226 +/- 0. 050 mg L(- 1) of isoorientin and 158. 037 +/- 0. 602 mg L(- 1) of total flavonoid, suggesting that P. edulis fruits may be comparable with other flavonoid food sources such as orange juice or sugarcane juice.

40|$|The {{number of}} methods to measure {{antioxidants}} in botanicals, foods, nutraceuticals and other dietary supplements are increased considerably {{in the last}} ten years. However most techniques require long experimental times and high costs to determine antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic or lipophilic compound in a food mixture. By means of a photochemiluminescence method (PCL), we assessed the Integral Antioxidant Capacity (IAC) which represents the sum of the antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. In this study the IAC of extracts from Adansonia digitatata (i. e. red fiber, <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> and leaves), was assessed in comparison to those deriving from other natural sources of antioxidants (i. e. orange, kiwi, apple and strawberry). When compared, IAC values for the examined product resulted as follows: Adansonia digitata red fibre >>> Adansonia digitata <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> >> Adansonia digitata fresh leaves >> Adansonia digitata seeds  Adansonia digitata radix cuticle  orange fresh pulp >> strawberry fresh <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> > Adansonia digitata radix > bilberry fresh <b>pulp</b>  kiwi <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp.</b> Results clearly indicate the interesting antioxidants properties of Adansonia digitata red fibre, in particular the IAC value of baobab red fibre was 66 time higher than that of orange pulp, with value of 1617. 3 μmol/g and 24, 3 μmol/g, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> extract of Tamarindus indica {{has been}} {{reported}} for its antioxidant and hypolipidemic properties. In this study, the methanol extract of T. indica <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> was investigated for its effects on the abundance of HepG 2 cell lysate proteins. Cell lysate was extracted from HepG 2 cells grown in the absence and presence of the methanol extract of T. indica <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp.</b> Approximately 2500 spots were resolved using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the abundance of 20 cellular proteins {{was found to be}} significantly reduced. Among the proteins of reduced abundance, fourteen, including six proteins involved in metabolism (including ethanolamine phosphate cytidylyltransferase), four mitochondrial proteins (including prohibitin and respiratory chain proteins), and four proteins involved in translation and splicing, were positively identified by mass spectrometry and database search. The identified HepG 2 altered abundance proteins, when taken together and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software, are suggestive of the effects of T. indica <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> extract on metabolism and inflammation, which are modulated by LXR/RXR. In conclusion, the methanol <b>fruit</b> <b>pulp</b> extract of T. indica was shown to cause reduced abundance of HepG 2 mitochondrial, metabolic, and regulatory proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism...|$|R
