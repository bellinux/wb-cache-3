40|$|Results from {{airborne}} field deployments {{emphasized the}} need to obtain concurrently high temporal and spatial resolution measurements of 3 -D winds and microphysics. A phased array radar on an airborne platform using dual-polarization antenna {{has the potential for}} retrieving high-resolution, collocated 3 -D winds and microphysical measurements. Recently, ground-based phased array radar (PAR) has demonstrated the high time-resolution estimation of accurate Doppler velocity and reflectivity of precipitation and clouds when compared to mechanically scanning radar. PAR uses the electronic scanning (e-scan) to rapidly collect radar measurements. Since an airborne radar has a limited amount of time to collect measurements over a specified sample volume, the e-scan will significantly enhance temporal and spatial resolution of airborne radar observations. At present, airborne weather radars use mechanical scans, and they are not designed for collecting dual-polarization measurements to remotely estimate microphysics. This paper presents a possible configuration of a novel airborne phased array radar (APAR) to be installed on an aircraft for retrieving improved dynamical and microphysical scientific products. The proposed APAR would replace the aging, X-band Electra Doppler radar (ELDORA). The ELDORA X-band radar's penetration into precipitation is limited by attenuation. Since attenuation at C-band is lower than at X-band, the <b>design</b> <b>specification</b> of a C-band airborne phased array radar (APAR) and its measurement accuracies are presented. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> suggest the proposed APAR will meet or exceed ELDORA's current sensitivity, spatial resolution and Doppler measurement accuracies of ELDORA and it will also acquire dual-polarization measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs almost {{everybody}} is aware, the seafaring as occupation {{is still a}} dangerous way of life. Despite the scientific and technological progresses, the casualties at sea are yet numerous and loss of human life is costly. The causes are pending on various domains such as the increased maritime traffic at often associated higher service speeds, the overconfidence in the navigation gear devices the lack of alternative navigational knowledge, bad team management, crew overstressing and unduly fatigue and so on. Because most of the causes listed above are (more or less) directly linked to human error, a proper training will (at least) reduce the frequency of such obviously unwanted events, so any way {{to achieve this goal}} is a meaningful one. Among other approach directions, the manned models ship training method is a very interesting (at least from most trainee's points of view.) and therefore efficient and successful procedure.

2500|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> {{required}} that the final building be no taller than the existing Federal Triangle structures, be constructed of similar materials, emphasize pedestrian traffic, and have a [...] "sympathetic" [...] architectural style. An architectural model by the firms of Notter Finegold & Alexander, Mariani & Associates, and Bryant & Bryant depicted a building with a long, uninterrupted facade along 14th Street NW and two colonnaded hemicycles {{on the east side}} (matching the Post Office Department building's hemicycle). The <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> specs were criticized for not more clearly specifying the architectural style, for bringing another 10,000 new workers to Federal Triangle each day, and for reducing the required number of parking spaces by 30 percent to just 1,300. The five public members of the design committee were named on April 6, 1988, and were former Senator Charles H. Percy, chair; Harry McPherson, president of the Federal City Council; Donald A. Brown, chair of the Federal City Council's International Center Task Force; Michael R. Garder, a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation; and Judah C. Sommer, a local attorney. Groundbreaking on the now-$350 million building was scheduled for 1989, and completion in 1993. Disagreements broke out in mid-1988 over which federal agencies should take up residence in the structure, and whether they should be trade- or foreign-policy related. Seven designs were submitted in June 1989, each incorporating a base-middle-crown structure and enclosed in traditional materials (limestone facade, vertical glass windows, terra-cotta roof tiles).

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limiting}} factors to nuclear reactors lifetime is the radiation-induced material damage in the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). While older reactors were designed assuming a 40 -year operating lifetime, new reactor designs {{are expected to have}} lifetimes up to 100 years. For safe operation, the integrity of the RPV must be ensured against significant material property changes. In this work, typical neutron damage indicators are calculated in the RPV of the I 2 S-LWR (Integral Inherently Safe LWR) Power Plant, including DPA (displacements per atom) and fast neutron fluence (> 1 [*]MeV and > 0. 1 MeV). I 2 S-LWR is a PWR of integral design, which means that its wider downcomer provides additional shielding to the vessel. However, its higher core power density and longer lifetime may offset this advantage. In order to accurately represent the neutron environment for RPV damage assessment, a detailed model based on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> of the I 2 S-LWR was developed {{to be used in the}} MAVRIC (Monaco with Automated Variance Reduction using Importance Calculations) sequence of the Scale 6. 1 code package. MAVRIC uses the CADIS (Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling) methodology to bias a fixed-source MC (Monte Carlo) simulation. To establish the upper limit of a bounding envelope, a flat-source distribution was used. For the low limit, a center-peaked source was generated using the KENO-VI criticality sequence assuming uniform fresh fuel core. Results based on the preliminary I 2 S-LWR model show that DPA rates and fast fluence rates are conservatively 75 % lower than in typical PWRs being operated currently in the US...|$|R

Prior to selecting the current 'conventional' design of the injection straight section we analyzed an option of injection via pulsed multipole pioneered at PF-AR. We found that this promising approach was not suited to the NSLS-II storage ring optics, since it would require a impractically compact arrangement of the injection straight section components and a complex modification of the transport line optics due to the strong focusing of the injected beam passing off the pulsed multipole axis. In addition, the requirement for a small injection transient of the stored beam orbit severely constrains the vertical alignment tolerance of the pulsed multipole.

40|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{is one of}} the most widely used energy {{conversion}} devices in the world, providing shaft power for electricity production, chemical processing, and HVAC systems. There are new opportunities in growing renewable and combined cycle applications. End-users are asking for energy efficiency improvements that require manufacturers to renew their experimentally verified design methods. A structured design approach was carried out along three integrated research thrusts. The first two thrusts, Turbine Performance Prediction and Measurement Planning, were carried out with the aim of supporting the theoretical modeling required for the third thrust, System Modeling. The primary use of the steam turbine test loop will be to improve performance prediction techniques. Thus the primary focus of the first thrust was to describe empirical loss correlations found in the literature. For the second thrust, a preliminary review of measurement codes and standards was carried out to determine their impact on overall test loop design. For the third thrust, quasi-steady theoretical models were derived from first principles for the turbine, condenser, pump, boiler, and pipe components using control volume analyses. The theoretical models were implemented in a new open source simulation environment that carries out the calculation process over a range of up-to three turbine model inputs. A parametric study was undertaken with the goal of defining <b>preliminary</b> <b>design</b> <b>specifications</b> for the test loop components. The test loop was simulated across a wide range of steady states for three different turbine blade configurations, each at three different values of the blade row enthalpy-loss coefficient.

Design of liquid retaining structures has special features different from the others.

Hybrid knowledge representation schemes, including production rules, object-oriented programming, and procedural methods, are employed to express engineering heuristics and standard design knowledge during the development of the knowledge-based system (KBS) for design of liquid retaining structures. This approach renders it possible to take advantages of the characteristics of each method.
