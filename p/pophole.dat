40|$|In a {{laboratory}} {{test of a}} low-frequency RFID system the probability of registration was assessed and this system was used to study ranging behavior of laying hens. To test the equipment, tags with various orientations on a platform were moved with varying speeds across a different number of antennas. The probability of registration declined when the speed of tags was greater than 1. 5 m/s. In the field test on 12 farms antennas were placed {{on both sides of}} every <b>pophole</b> and tags were attached to a sample of laying hens. The probability of registration of a hen was 94 %. It is suggested to decrease the ID of the tag from 64 bit to 32 bit in order to read tags up to a speed of 3. 2 m/s, reliably. In order to find a possible influence of the magnetic fields that were generated by reading the tags on ranging behavior, the use of two popholes was evaluated while the system at the popholes was alternatively switched off. The use of the two popholes was not affected by that so with the proposed modification of the tag this system seems suitable to study ranging behavior in laying hens...|$|E

40|$|In {{regulations}} for free range systems, maximum distances {{from the house}} to the <b>popholes</b> are defined. For instance in the Dutch IKB and the German KAT {{regulations for}} keeping laying hens, a house that offers free range access only {{on one side of the}} house cannot be wider than 15 meters. However, it is unclear what the actual evidence is that birds will not move for more than 15 meters for access to free range or a winter garden. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify whether distance from the <b>popholes</b> affects use of a winter garden in laying hens. To meet this aim, 9 % of a flock of 5600 non-beak trimmed Lohmann Brown birds were tagged using RFID transponders, with antennas placed at the <b>popholes.</b> The house had a width of 31 meters and was divided in six rows of a Bolegg Terrace aviary system, with row one being closest to the outdoor run and row six being furthest away. In each row, 80 hens were caught and tagged, while perching at night. Access to the winter garden was measured for a six-week period. We here show that use of the winter garden was high, with 60 % of all the tagged hens visiting the winter garden on 80 to a 100 % of the days. Furthermore, although small differences in use of the winter garden between birds tagged at different rows were found, these could not be related to the distance of the row to the <b>popholes.</b> In conclusion, distance to <b>popholes</b> did not affect use of the winter garden in laying hens. </p...|$|R
40|$|In studies {{assessing}} outdoor {{range use}} of laying hens, {{the number of}} hens seen on outdoor ranges is inversely correlated to flock size. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess individual ranging behavior on a covered (veranda) and an uncovered outdoor run (free-range) in laying hen flocks varying in size. Five to ten percent of hens (aged 9 – 15 months) within 4 small (2 – 2500 hens), 4 medium (5 – 6000), and 4 large (≥ 9000) commercial flocks were fitted with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Antennas were placed at both sides of all <b>popholes</b> between the house and the veranda and the veranda and the free-range. Ranging behavior was directly monitored for approximately three weeks in combination with hourly photographs of the free-range for the distribution of hens and 6 h long video recordings on two parts of the free-range during two days. Between 79 and 99 % of the tagged hens were registered on the veranda at least once and between 47 and 90 % were registered on the free-range at least once. There was no association between the percentage of hens registered outside the house (veranda or free-range) and flock size. However, individual hens in small and medium sized flocks visited the areas outside the house more frequently and spent more time there than hens from large flocks. Foraging behavior on the free-range was shown more frequently and for a longer duration by hens from small and medium sized flocks than by hens from large flocks. This difference in ranging behavior could account for the negative relationship between flock size and the number of hens seen outside at one point of time. In conclusion, our work describes individual birds’ use of areas outside the house within large scale commercial egg production...|$|R
