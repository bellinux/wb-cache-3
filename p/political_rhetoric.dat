5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after {{the details of}} a conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated by both the Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) that the benefits of the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E

Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{literature}} was divided in well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both dialect and metrics. The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry {{there were three}} super-genres: epic, lyric and drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology. Lyric and drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four (elegiac, iambic, monodic lyric and choral lyric); drama in three (tragedy, comedy and pastoral drama). In prose literature, there was more freedom; the main areas were historiography, philosophy, and <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric.</b>|$|E

25|$|Within Sri Lanka, {{the legend}} of Vijaya is a common <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> used to explain {{the origin of the}} Sinhalese, and is often treated as a factual account of {{historical}} events. Sinhalese scholars such as K. M. de Silva have used the legend to propose an Indo-Aryan origin for the Sinhalese, thus distinguishing them from the Dravidian Tamils. At the same time, some Sinhalese authors have also used the myth to oppose Tamil secessionism, arguing that the Sinhalese and the Tamils are one race, because their ancestors included the maidens sent by the Pandyan king of Madurai. Some Tamil nationalists, on the other hand, have claimed that their ancestors were the Yakkhas massacred by Vijaya. Tamil authors like Satchi Ponnambalam have dismissed the legend as fiction aimed at justifying Sinhalese territorial claims in Lanka.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the fourth}} direct {{election}} for the President of the Republic of China. The two candidates were Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh and Kuomintang (KMT) nominee Ma Ying-jeou. The KMT ticket was officially formed as of June 23, 2007, with Ma announcing his choice for running mate to be former premier Vincent Siew. The DPP ticket was announced in August, 2007, with Frank Hsieh selecting former Premier Su Tseng-chang. Unlike the 2004 presidential election, the <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> of the campaigns {{tended to focus on}} economic issues and government corruption rather than national identity and the political status of Taiwan, with both candidates endorsing the status quo in the short term.

25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly conceding that it did not expect the return of every piece of material and equipment that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> to keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent. This in turn helped to ensure that the United States would be the world's strongest most prosperous industrial power {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
40|$|This article {{critically}} interrogates {{the many}} ways in which contemporary urban life in India is imagined and theorized by Hindi horror films and their critics and audiences. It suggests that “horrific” representations of tropes such as living space, family life, labor, gender relations and childhood are repositioned by the meanings attributed in critical and audience discussions across time and national boundaries. Acknowledging and questioning a conceptual mélange from “abjection” and “subalternity” to “voice” and “carnival,” it complicates homogenizing accounts of Bollywood's ideological allegiance to authoritarian master-narratives. While Hindi horror films invite spectators to engage with <b>political</b> <b>rhetorics</b> about economic success, exclusion, justice, and patriarchy, the outcomes of such engagement are inflected by individual spectators's cultural, political, and generic experiences...|$|R
40|$|O véu, real ou metafórico, das mulheres muçulmanas faz, hoje em dia, parte de um claro e sonante argumentário político a diferentes níveis. Este artigo relembra a necessidade de objectivar o modo como as relações generificadas entre a Antropologia, o Islão e as políticas internacionais e nacionais contribuíram para a produção desse argumentário, concorrendo, assim, para o seu espessamento político. Para "descobrir" as mulheres muçulmanas, a Antropologia tem que se "desvelar" de constrangimentos políticos imediatos. Nowadays, {{the veil}} of the Muslim women - either real or metaphoric - make part of clearly and {{sounding}} <b>political</b> <b>rhetorics</b> at different levels. It is my intention to remind that gendered relationships between Anthropology, Islam and international and national politics have largely supplied the production of this speech-making, concurring, thus, for its political thickness. This is why these relations must always stay under scrutiny regardless of the scale of our ethnographies, reminding us that {{the first step to}} 'unveil' Muslim women is to allow political immunity to anthropological inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Having {{reached a}} {{critical}} mass of participants, performances and the study of Shakespeare in different cultural contexts are changing how we think about globalization. The idea of global Shakespeares has caught on because of site-specific imaginations involving early modern and modern Globe theatres that aspired to perform the globe. Seeing global Shakespeares as a methodology rather than as appendages of colonialism, as <b>political</b> <b>rhetorics,</b> or as centerpieces in a display of exotic cultures situates us in a postnational space that is defined by fluid cultural locations rather than by nation-states. This framework helps us confront archival silences in the record of globalization, understand the spectral quality of citations of Shakespeare and mobile artworks, and reframe the debate about cultural exchange. Global Shakespeares as a field registers the shifting locus of anxiety between cultural particularity and universality. This article explores the promise and perils of political articulations of cultural difference and suggests new approaches to performances in marginalized or polyglot spaces...|$|R
25|$|In {{explaining}} why neutral Britain {{went to war}} with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognised it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of neutral Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were {{more concerned with the}} fate of France (pp.457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870, when Prussia and the German states smashed France, would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy-makers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.|$|E
25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric.</b> It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} Novel of the Mexican Revolution as a {{literary}} genre that elaborates alternative images to the political discourse of the Revolution cultivated and further developed by the governing parties PRI and PAN well into the 21 st century. In this context, even early 20 th century novels such as Guzmán’s The Eagle and the Serpent prepare {{the way for a}} demythification of official discourse which historians tend to avoid until post-Tlatelolco/post- 1968 historiography cannot ignore the substantial gap between <b>political</b> <b>rhetorics</b> and actual policy any more. The fact that in this case literary work anticipates historical criticism by several decades correlates with the writers‘ focus on the exploration of local and collective mentalities, which breaks the boundaries of traditional historiography and links up to contemporary disciplines such as regional history and history of the mentalities. Key novels analysed in this study are, next to Guzmán’s work, Agustín Yáñez‘s Al filo del agua (1947) and Juan Rulfo’s masterpiece Pedro Páramo (1955) ...|$|R

During the three decades of partyless Pancayat Democracy, the parties were confined to working underground, undercover in the guise of student unions, and – as they did from its very inception (Rose 1965 : 360, 365) – within the pancayat system itself.

25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would Have Thought It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American <b>political</b> <b>rhetoric</b> by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

Gray and Shami highlight the noted line [...] "No man is an island"; while most interpret it spiritually, they argue that it was a reminder to the prince and his advisors that [...] "even private actions have public consequences". The veiled nature of the political references was deliberate; it allowed the work to be acceptable to the censors, but accessible to Charles and those close to him.

The Rhodesian Front's election strategy of emphasising Smith's reputation as a war hero was criticised by the journalist Peter Niesewand, who was deported from Rhodesia in 1973; according to Niesewand, Smith's contribution to the Allied war effort had been [...] "to crash two perfectly good Hurricane planes [...] {{for the loss of}} no Germans". Smith won decisive election victories in 1970, 1974 and 1977, and remained in office until the country was reconstituted under majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979.
