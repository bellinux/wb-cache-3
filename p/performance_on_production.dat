40|$|Highly {{parallel}} computers have the memory capacity and potential speed to perform very high-resolution time-dependent calculations. Parallel computers {{with hundreds of}} fast processors require highly scalable algorithms to avoid wasting expensive resources. On these machines careful attention {{must be given to}} program design to fully exploit scalable algorithms. We have proposed a programming model that can express a class of scalable algorithms. In this paper we show how compiler analysis can ease the task of writing programs within this programming model. We have used this programming model manually and have achieved good results in reducing communication and synchronization overhead. We describe early results of a prototype compiler transformation tool called TOPAZ that applies this analysis to real programs. 1 Introduction Current parallel supercomputers can achieve approximately 10 GFlops sustained <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> codes and typically have 8 to 32 GBytes of m [...] ...|$|E

On average, the SNH group outperformed the SLI group and was comparable to controls. However, a subset of the SNH group (n = 6) was impaired on one or both of these tasks. Degree of hearing loss or age of receiving hearing aids was not directly related to performance, but other language measures were. The subset was also significantly younger {{than the rest of the}} SNH group, suggesting that acquisition of finite verb morphology may be delayed in children with hearing impairments. Verb regularity had no effect on performance of any group, but word frequency and phonological complexity did exert an influence.

40|$|In the {{globalisation}} spirit, one of {{the major}} objectives of companies is how to reduce the production losses cost-effectively for continuously enhancement of competitiveness and profitability. However, this area has been neglected by scientists and not given the attention justified considering its obvious link to company profitability. To fill this gap, better understanding of the relations and interactions between man, machine/production process, maintenance and economy is vital. Also, it is important for identifying and eliminating root causes of the losses. In this paper, we develop a model to describe these interactions using the most relevant factors, such as maintenance organisation, personnel commitment, machine condition and characteristics, and the impact of maintenance <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> time. The use of the model and its potential benefits are tested using an application example. This example illustrates how the above mentioned factors affect the production time and is thereafter derived to financial results. The result is accordingly a model that can help all producing companies categorise the causes behind losses and identify where losses arise and where to focus their work of continuous cost-effective improvements...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} days, {{manufacturing}} industries face many problems {{due to the}} increase in waste and non value added work. To compete globally, one has to understand the customers need exactly and always maintain a higher quality standard. Lean Manufacturing concept is to reduce the waste and add value to every process in manufacturing. To survive in today’s global market, manufacturers need to find various methods to reduce both time and cost for making a product. Higher quality, Flexibility and Efficient production requires newer ideas in production. Lean Manufacturing Techniques are used to implement such new ideas into the production line to improve the overall production process. Failure Mode Effective Analysis (FMEA) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) are lean approaches that find direct solution to these problems. Identification of failure and non value added work in the production line was carried out. This paper analyses waste and non value added work on the production floor and generates the necessary action plan to improve the performance. Production floor was observed for three months and the data was taken as inputs for FMEA and VSM. The results show that lean manufacturing can be effectively used to improve <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>production</b> floor...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of both word-form {{rehearsal}} and language experience on fast mapping production and comprehension skills. This experiment studied thirty Spanish-English bilingual young adults. The experimental portion of the study contained four main parts: (1) word-form rehearsal, (2) presentation (3) production, and (4) comprehension. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three word-form rehearsal conditions. Each participant began the experiment by repeating a set of sixteen novel nonwords either fifteen times each, five times each, or zero times (control group). Next, the participants were presented a visual and auditory nonword stimulus simultaneously. Next, each participant was aurally asked to verbally produce the nonword when presented with a visual stimulus. Finally, each participant was asked to identify a specific visual stimulus that corresponds with an aurally resented nonword. The participants completed these four tasks in two phonologically similar anguages (English and Spanish) and one phonologically unfamiliar language (Cantonese).

40|$|Specific {{language}} impairment (SLI) {{has traditionally}} been characterised as a deficit of structural language (specifically grammar), with relative strengths in pragmatics. In this study, comprehensive assessment of production, comprehension and metalinguistic judgment of referring expressions reveals that children with SLI have weaknesses in both structural and pragmatic language skills relative to age-matched peers. Correlational analyses highlight a relationship between their <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the experimental tasks and their structural language ability. Despite their poor <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the <b>production</b> and comprehension tasks, children with SLI were able to recognise pragmatically under-informative reference relative to other types of utterance, though imposed a less severe penalty on such expressions than their typically-developing peers; a pattern which supports the pragmatic tolerance account. Our novel methodology (which probes structural abilities from both the speaker’s and hearer’s perspectives as well as metalinguistic and pragmatic skills in the same sample) challenges the assumption that pragmatic errors stem from deficits in social cognition and instead supports recent findings suggesting that when the impact of structural language is isolated, pragmatic deficits may be resolved...|$|R
