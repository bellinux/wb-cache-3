40|$|The {{construction}} industry currently {{accounts for a}} large portion of the U. S. ’s environmental impact and use of virgin resources. As a result, many new construction methods, including panelization and modularization, have been developed and implemented with varying levels of success. The student team has researched the current practices and has designed an improved <b>panelized</b> <b>construction</b> method. The designed panels are lightweight and easily lifted into place by two workers, thus eliminating the need for the heavy machinery that is typically required for current panelized options. Ultimately, the panelized system developed by the student team will decrease the amount of material waste, delays due to weather and subcontractors, and overall cost of the project...|$|E
40|$|Historically, pavilions {{have been}} a {{profitable}} territory for research and innovation in architecture. “Cellular Tessellation” is a research pavilion developed and implemented for a site at Sydney Harbor in 2014. This paper documents and critically reflects upon the design, development, fabrication, and experiential outcomes of the work. The core investigation embodied by this work is the refinement of techniques to computationally design and fabricate integrated structure and skin envelopes through a file-to-fabrication process, culminating {{in the production of}} doubly curved project geometry via <b>panelized</b> <b>construction.</b> The project attempts to address multiple concerns (gravity, bracing, affect, etc) with a minimum of assembly. This work is invested in extending the possibilities of architectural practice, extrapolating the workflow from this project to the speculative impact of the work upon emerging practice techniques, ultimately leading to augmented spatial experience for the end user...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design of}} a prefabricated sustainable roof system for LionForce Systems. While being economical, environmentally sustainable, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to assemble on site, the design includes a sturdy and durable roof-to-wall joint that minimizes waste, insulates the interior, and locks out moisture. In addition, the design facilitates a 20 -foot unsupported roof span and a 4 -foot overhang beyond the exterior wall, with allowances for variation in roof pitch. The roof-to-wall joint was successfully designed and prototyped with less than half the $ 1200 allowable budget using galvanized steel with Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) insulation. Executive Summary LionForce Systems, a <b>panelized</b> pre-fabricated home <b>construction</b> company, requested {{the design of a}} system to create a structural and environmental seal between roof and wall panels of homes, increase unsupported roof span from 14 to 20 ft, and support an overhang of 4 instead of 2 ft. A successful design is structurally sound, impenetrable by moisture, critters, and air, and allows roof pitches from 2 / 12 to 8 / 12. Roof pitch is the ratio of vertical height to horizontal span. To improve LionForce’s product, a steel roof-to-wall joint in an L-shape was designed and prototyped. The L sits on the wall panel, and both extremes are in contact with the roof, providing structural support and an environmental seal. The L joint is filled with pre-cu...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} an alternative to traditional wood framed shear wall construction. This study introduced the innovative idea of using a water and seismic damage resistant, wood-concrete- composite (WCC) construction instead of an all-wood design. The WCC design consisted of a thin shell of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) cast in composite with a traditional wood frame. The WCC wall was evaluated with regards to structural performance during lateral loading, cost and damage sustained during lateral loading. The WCC test results were compared to a traditional wood frame wall with OSB sheathing. Data from the monotonic tests of the WCC walls show that the average maximum load was 47. 5 kN (10700 lb), average elastic shear stiffness was 1. 78 kN/mm (10200 lb/in) and the average energy absorbed was 4810 J (42600 lb-in). Overall, the test results indicate that the WCC is comparable with or superior to the OSB wall in regards to shear strength, shear stiffness, energy absorption and ductility. During lateral loading tests the WCC wall appeared to sustain less damage than the OSB wall. <b>Panelized</b> <b>construction</b> of the WCC system may increase overall project cost but could provide many additional benefits such as decreased construction time and greater durability. The WCC design appears to be a viable shear wall system that should be refined and fully tested for building code compliance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} costs and benefits of the two main construction methods in the prefabricated homes category: panelized and modular. The main goal is to provide a framework of the implications and tradeoffs of both construction methods for single family homes, as well as determine which is more cost effective. The methodology consists of a qualitative analysis that includes the overview of the benefits of each construction method over the other, and quantitative analysis which compares the cost of the finished homes per square foot to determine which one is more cost effective. Both analyses are conducted by evaluating two case studies of single family homes with similar characteristics, one built with panels and the other with modules. The benefits identified for panelized homes have to do with transportation, equipment and machinery, and insulation technology; on the other hand, the benefits for modular homes are related to quality control, on-site work and trades. The quantitative results showed that the modular construction method is only marginally more cost effective than the <b>panelized</b> <b>construction</b> method under the given circumstances. As a second part of the quantitative analysis, the panel case study was calculated as if it would be built with modules, and the results of both analyses were consistent, but both with the same limitations. Through the proposed method, it is possible to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the two construction methods for single family prefabricated home projects which could serve as a valuable tool for decision making...|$|E
40|$|This thesis re-thinks {{conventional}} light {{frame and}} <b>panelized</b> <b>construction</b> methodologies employed in residential and general medium-scale construction. To do so, it investigates the flexural geometry, the structural performance, and volumetric approaches to systematizing elastically bent developable strips. Many rapidly-renewable sheet materials exist or are near market, {{and the local}} availability of flatbed machining increases with each new makerspace. Thus, this thesis proposes using simple cutting and bending operations, site-applied attachments, and granulated insulation to produce permanent, freeform, stressed-skin formwork (which is herein branded "Free 4 orm" strip construction). Observing only partial engagement of medium-scale building applications, this project deploys elastic bending for design diversity by developing open, pre-cut, site-assembled systems for complex structural form. Initial contextual, typological, and geometric research exercises lead to an experimental installation (fiber-reinforced polymer rod and shrink-wrap), to material testing (plywood, bamboo, and phenolic paper), and then to creating computational dimensional analysis tools. Different methods of assembling (tiling, hinging, linking, networking, self-straining, wrapping, staggering etc.) and "unitizing" bending-active strips are developed, tested, and ultimately combined into a prototype, "bend-up, zip-up, iron-up," methodology. Numerical solvers and plug-ins (Strand 7, Karamba, and Scan&Solve) are used for in-process analysis to inform conceptualization and to supplement theoretical predictions. Full-scale prototype "unitized, rapid-assembly" and "semiunitized, site-assembly" specimens are fabricated and experimentally loaded to evaluate theoretical stress predictions and preliminary detailing. In the closing design exercises and demonstrations, a single-module arch and a heliotropic canopy are presented. This project explores different possibilities for using flexure to create cost-aware dimensional variation in residential building systems in order to enable passive functional articulation and increase access to surface-active architecture. by Richard Aeck.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a home that}} uses 40 % less energy than the energy-efficient Building America standard - a giant step {{in the pursuit of}} affordable near-zero-energy housing through the evolution of five near-zero-energy research houses. This four-bedroom, two-bath, 1232 -ft 2 house has a Home Energy Rating System (HERS) index of 35 (a HERS rating of 0 is a zero-energy house, a conventional new house would have a HERS rating of 100), which qualifies it for federal energy efficiency and solar incentives. The house is leading to the planned construction of a similar home in Greensburg, Kansas, and 21 staff houses in the Walden Reserve, a 7000 -unit "deep green" community in Cookville, Tennessee. Discussions are underway for construction of similar houses in Charleston, South Carolina, Seattle, Washington, Knoxville and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and upstate New York. This house should lead to a 40 % and 50 % Gate- 3, Mixed-Humid-Climate Joule for the DOE Building America Program. The house is constructed with structurally-insulated-panel walls and roof, raised metal-seam roof with infrared reflective coating, airtight envelope (1. 65 air changes per hour at 50 Pascal), supply mechanical ventilation, ducts inside the conditioned space, extensive moisture control package, foundation geothermal space heating and cooling system, ZEHcor wall, solar water heater, and a 2. 2 kWp grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system. The detailed specifications for the envelope and the equipment used in ZEH 5 compared to all the houses in this series are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Based on a validated computer simulation of ZEH 5 with typical occupancy patterns and energy services for four occupants, energy for this all-electric house is predicted to cost only $ 0. 66 /day ($ 0. 86 /day counting the hookup charges). By contrast, the benchmark house would require $ 3. 56 /day, including hookup charges (these costs are based on a 2006 residential rates of $ 0. 07 /kWh and solar buyback at $ 0. 15 /kWh). The solar fraction for this home located in Lenoir City, Tennessee, is predicted to be as high as 41 %(accounting for both solar PV and the solar water heater). This all-electric home is predicted to use 25 kWh/day based on the one year of measured data used to calibrate a whole-building simulation model. Based on two years of measured data, the roof-mounted 2. 2 kWp PV system is predicted to generate 7. 5 kWh/day. The 2005 cost to commercially construct ZEH 5, including builder profit and overhead, is estimated at about $ 150, 000. This cost - for ZEH 5 's <b>panelized</b> <b>construction,</b> premanufactured utility wall (ZEHcor), foundation geothermal system, and the addition of the walkout lower level, and considering the falling cost for PV - suggests that the construction cost per ft 2 for a ZEH 5 two-story will be even more cost-competitive. The 2005 construction cost estimate for a finished-out ZEH 5 with 2632 ft 2 is $ 222, 000 or $ 85 /ft 2. The intention of this report is to help builders and homeowners make the decision to build zero-energy-ready homes. Detailed drawings, specifications, and lessons learned in the construction and analysis of data from about 100 sensors monitoring thermal performance for a one-year period are presented. This information should be specifically useful to those considering structural insulated panel walls and roof, foundation geothermal space heating and cooling, solar water heater and roof-mounted, photovoltaic, grid-tied systems...|$|E
