Quantitative skin exposure data are scarce and quantitative methods limited. Methods: As part of the Survey of Painters and Repairers of Autobodies by Yale study, a method to sample and quantify human isocyanate skin exposure was developed (based on NIOSH 5525 method) and used to evaluate aliphatic isocyanate skin exposure in 81 auto body shop painters and body technicians. Wipe samples were collected from unprotected skin and from under PPE (gloves, clothing and respirator) using a polypropylene glycol-impregnated wipe.

50|$|Eventually, the {{advantages}} of using polyaspartic esters as {{the main component of}} the co-reactant for reaction with an aliphatic <b>polyisocyanate</b> in low to zero volatile organic compound (VOC) coatings has been realized. The rate of reaction of polyaspartic esters can be manipulated, thus extending the pot-life and controlling the cure rate of aliphatic coatings. This allows formulators to create high solids coatings systems which are user-friendly with longer working times and still maintain a fast-cure. Traditional aliphatic polyurea formulations required high-pressure, high-temperature plural component spray systems to be applied due to fast initial reaction rates. Aliphatic polyaspartics can be formulated with slower reaction rates to accommodate batch-mixing and application by roller-applied methods or spray-applied through conventional single components paint sprayers without the use of solvent. As with aliphatic polyurethane or acrylic coatings, polyaspartic coatings are UV and light stable and will not yellow like aromatic epoxies, polyureas and polyurethanes.|$|E

50|$|In polymer chemistry, {{there are}} several {{mechanisms}} by which a polymerization reaction can terminate depending on the mechanism and circumstances of the reaction. A method of termination that applies to all polymer reactions is the depletion of monomer. In chain growth polymerization, two growing chains can collide head to head causing the growth of both of the chains to stop. In the case of radical or anionic polymerization, chain transfer can occur where the radical {{at the end of}} the growing chain can be transferred from the chain to an individual monomer unit causing a new chain to start growing and the previous chain to stop growing. With step-growth polymerization, the reaction can be terminated by adding a monofunctional species containing the same functionality as one or more of the types of monomer used in the reaction. For example, an alcohol R'-OH can be used to stop a reaction between a <b>polyisocyanate</b> and a polyol because it will react with the isocyanate functionality R-N=C=O to produce R-(N-H)-(C=O)-O-R' which is then no longer reactive with the polyol.|$|E
