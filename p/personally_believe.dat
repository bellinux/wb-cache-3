25|$|In viticulture, {{ripeness}} is {{the completion}} of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{stated that}} Avatar is [...] "very much a {{political}} film" [...] and added: [...] "This movie reflects {{that we are}} living through war. [...] There are boots on the ground, troops who I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> were sent there under false pretenses, so I hope this {{will be part of}} opening our eyes." [...] He confirmed that [...] "the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam stuff is there by design", adding that he did not think that the film was anti-military. [...] Critic Charles Marowitz in Swans magazine remarked, however, that the realism of the suggested parallel with wars in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan [...] "doesn't quite jell" [...] because the natives are [...] "peace-loving and empathetic".|$|E
500|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Italians, the Chetniks {{thoroughly}} ethnically cleansed eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims in July and August 1942. In response to a massacre of non-Serbs in Foča in August, Jevđević issued a proclamation to the Muslims in eastern Herzegovina demanding that they join the Chetniks in their struggle against the Ustaše. He stated: [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that in a future state the Muslims have no other choice but to finally and definitely accept Serb nationality and renounce their speculative maneuvering between the Serb and Croat nations, above all because all the lands in which the Muslims live will indisputably and inviolably become part of the Serb state entity." [...] That month, Roatta contacted Jevđević and [...] "legalised" [...] 3,000 of his Chetniks, formally authorising them to operate in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5000|$|Lemieux {{has stated}} that he <b>personally</b> <b>believes</b> in the [...] "inherent dignity of human life {{from the moment of}} {{conception}} through to natural death...we need to discuss and debate life issues in an open and respectful way, both within society and within Parliament."

500|$|Unlike {{his more}} stridently [...] "non-interventionist" [...] father, Paul concedes {{a role for}} American armed forces abroad, {{including}} permanent foreign military bases. He {{has said that he}} blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War [...] "emboldened" [...] Iran. Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position. Paul stated: [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that this group [...] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [...]" [...] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016. In 2011, shortly after being elected, he proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending.|$|E
2500|$|He {{supports}} the complete legalisation of marijuana for both medical and recreational purpose, saying that [...] "The Liberal Democrats will be releasing {{a report in}} due course that lays out {{the case for a}} legalised market for sales of cannabis.

2500|$|In 1950, Chairman Mao Zedong made {{a speech}} in support of {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) which was influenced by political necessity. Zedong believed he and the Chinese Communist Party should promote TCM {{but he did not}} <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> in TCM and he did not use it. In 1952, the president of the Chinese Medical Association said that, [...] "This One Medicine, will possess a basis in modern natural sciences, will have absorbed the ancient and the new, the Chinese and the foreign, all medical achievements—and will be China’s New Medicine!" ...|$|E
25|$|His defence {{was led by}} Mr Serjeant William Shee. The defence case {{suffered}} adverse {{comment from}} the judge because Shee had, against all rules and conventions of professional conduct, told the jury that he <b>personally</b> <b>believed</b> Palmer to be innocent.|$|R
50|$|Although Martin Luther <b>personally</b> <b>believed</b> {{and taught}} {{resurrection of the}} dead in {{combination}} with soul sleep, {{this is not a}} mainstream teaching of Lutheranism and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the immortal soul.|$|R

2500|$|Dance of Death is {{the only}} Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer Nicko McBrain has a songwriting credit, having co-written [...] "New Frontier." [...] As a born-again Christian, the track expresses his {{concerns}} with human cloning, stating, [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that God created man and it's only God's right to create a human being because only He {{can give you a}} soul. When man attempts to make man then it's a monster in a test tube." [...] This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a songwriting credit.|$|E
2500|$|The stop-action {{photographs}} {{showed the}} mare lifted all four legs {{off the ground}} at certain points during the gallop. Run together, the photographs produced {{the effect of the}} horse in motion, or a film. Muybridge produced his prints onsite; when the press noticed the broken straps on Sallie's saddle in the prints, they became convinced of the prints' authenticity. Scientific American was among the publications that carried reports of Muybridge's groundbreaking 1878 work. While there have been rumors that Stanford had a large bet riding on the outcome of the study, the historian Phillip Prodger has said, [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that the story of the bet is apocryphal. There are really no primary accounts of this bet ever having taken place. Everything is hearsay and secondhand information." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Goldwater {{fought and}} won a multi-candidate race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. His main rival was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whom he {{defeated}} by a narrow margin in the California primary. Eisenhower gave his support to Goldwater when he told reporters, [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that Goldwater is not an extremist as some people have made him, {{but in any event}} we're all Republicans." [...] His nomination was opposed by liberal Republicans, who thought Goldwater's demand for rollback, defeat of the Soviet Union, would foment a nuclear war. He delivered a captivating acceptance speech. [...] "Instead, he devoted more care to his acceptance speech than to any other speech in his political career. And with good reason: he would deliver it to the largest and most attentive audience of his life. No other statement of the 1950s and 1960s, including The Conscience of a Conservative, presents more truly Barry Goldwater's basic beliefs and his positions on current issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 9, 2005, Mary Mapes gave an {{interview}} to ABC News correspondent Brian Ross. Mapes stated that the documents have never been proved to be forgeries. Ross expressed {{the view that the}} responsibility is on the reporter to verify their authenticity. Mapes responded with, [...] "I don't think that's the standard." [...] This stands in contrast to the statement of the president of CBS News that proof of authenticity is [...] "the only acceptable journalistic standard." [...] Also in November 2005, Mapes told readers of the Washington Post, [...] "I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> the documents are not false," [...] and [...] "I was fired for airing a story that could not definitively be proved false but made CBS's public relations department cringe." [...] As of September 2007, Mapes continued to defend the authenticity of the documents: [...] "the far right blogosphere bully boys...screamed objections that ultimately proved to have no basis in fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of antisemitism, the Fascists were divided on what to do, {{especially}} {{with the rise of}} Hitler in Germany. A number of Fascist members were Jewish and Mussolini himself did not <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> in antisemitism, but to appease Hitler antisemitism within the Fascist Party steadily increased. In 1936, Mussolini made his first written denunciation of Jews by claiming that antisemitism had only arisen because Jews had become too predominant in the positions of power of countries and claimed that Jews were a [...] "ferocious" [...] tribe who sought to [...] "totally banish" [...] Christians from public life. In 1937, Fascist member Paolo Orano criticized the Zionist movement as being part of British foreign policy which designed to secure British hold of the area without respecting the Christian and Islamic presence in Palestine. On the matter of Jewish Italians, Orano said that they [...] "should concern themselves with nothing more than their religion" [...] and not bother boasting of being patriotic Italians.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, {{a weekly}} {{informal}} variety show, began on CBS-TV in prime time. His affable personality combined warmth, heart, and occasional bits of double entendre repartee, {{such as his}} remark when the show went on location: [...] "Well, {{here we are in}} Miami Bitch. Hehheh." [...] Godfrey received adulation from fans who felt that despite his considerable wealth, he was really [...] "one of them," [...] his personality that of a friendly next-door-neighbor. His ability to sell products, insisting he would not promote any in which he did not <b>personally</b> <b>believe,</b> gave him a level of trust from his audience, a belief that [...] "if Godfrey said it, it must be so." [...] When he quit smoking after his 1953 hip surgery, he began speaking out against smoking on the air, to the displeasure of longtime sponsor Chesterfield. When he stood his ground, the company withdrew as a sponsor. Godfrey shrugged off their departure since he knew other sponsors would easily fill the vacancy.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{inclined}} to believe in it myself, Mr. Ducaine," [...] said Lord Chelsford. [...] "There are indications of a strong revival of Royalist sentiment amongst the French people, {{and it is very}} possible that the Prince of Malors may wish to ingratiate himself by any means with the French army. This sort of thing scarcely sounds like practical politics, but one has to bear in mind the peculiar temperament of the man himself, and the nation. I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that the Prince of Malors would consider himself justified in abusing the hospitality of his dearest friend in the cause of patriotism. At any rate, this is my view, and I am acting upon it. All danger from that source will now be at an end, for in an hour's time the Prince will be under the surveillance of detectives for the remainder of his stay in England." ...|$|E

Evidence is brought to us that a secret meeting took place between the Czar of Russia and the Emperor of Germany. From all the information which we have collected that meeting was possible. I <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that it took place. A treaty {{is said to have}} been drawn up between them, having for its object the embroilment of England with Russia, and an alliance of Germany with Russia so far as regards her quarrel with England. We know that Germany is secretly mobilizing men and ships. We know that the ambition of the Emperor is to possess himself of the Colonies of Great Britain, if not actually to hold his court in London. We know that his jealousy of King Edward amounts to a disease. We know that he is a man of daring and violent temper, with an indomitable will and an unflinching belief in his own infallibility and the infallibility of his army and navy. We know that he has at least a dozen schemes for a sudden attack upon England, and mighty though the navy of Great Britain is, it is not in our opinion strong enough to protect her shore from the combined Baltic and German fleets and also protect her Colonies. England, through our friendship, has been warned. She proposes with most flattering alacrity the only possible counter-stroke--an alliance with ourselves. We must decide within twelve hours. The treaty lies upon my desk there. Upon us must rest the most momentous decision which any Frenchman within our recollection has been called upon to make. What have you to say, gentlemen?" ...|$|E
