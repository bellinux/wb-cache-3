5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
25|$|When {{the engine}} started, air began {{flowing through the}} boost venturi, causing the {{pressure}} (referred to as a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> as it is lower than atmospheric pressure, but not a full vacuum) in the venturi to drop according to Bernoulli's principle. This causes the air pressure in chamber A to drop in proportion with the <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the boost venturi.|$|E
25|$|The South Devon Railway engine {{houses were}} built in Devon, England, to power the {{atmospheric}} trains on the South Devon Railway between Exeter St Davids and Plymouth Millbay railway stations.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{artificial}} refrigeration began when Scottish professor William Cullen designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755. Cullen used a pump {{to create a}} <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surrounding air. The experiment even created {{a small amount of}} ice, but had no practical application at that time.|$|E
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the slide bars for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the motion}} of the Crookes {{radiometer}} was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation {{is the result of a}} <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum.</b> This should not be confused with the Nichols radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) is directly caused by light pressure.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{cleaners}} use air pumps {{to create}} <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums</b> to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors and carpets. Filtering systems or cyclones collect dirt for later disposal. Modern carpet cleaning equipment use rotary vacuum heads and spray jets to deep clean the carpet through hundreds of multi-directional cleaning passes. Some add steam and agitation. Models include upright (dirty-air and clean-air), canister and backpack, wet-dry and pneumatic, and other varieties. Robotic vacuum cleaners have recently become available.|$|R
5000|$|... was {{the first}} Freedom-class LCS to be fitted with {{cavitation}} performance waterjets. The jets create <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums</b> in liquid using an improved impeller blade design. Cavitation jets do not increase the ship's top speed, but deliver 10 percent greater fuel efficiency with less noise and vibration, reduced life-cycle costs, improved maintainability, increased availability, and potentially improved efficiency at lower speeds. The Navy plans to add the new waterjets to every Freedom variant that is produced, including LCS 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. The mixed flow design was changed to an axial design to push water {{parallel to the shaft}} of the impeller.|$|R
40|$|Four {{methods of}} laser {{assisted}} catalyst generation for carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis have been tested. These include pulsed laser transfer (PLT), photolytic deposition (PLD), photothermal deposition (PTD) and laser ablation deposition (LABD). Results from each method are compared based on CNT yield, morphology and structure. Under the conditions tested, the PLT was the easiest method to implement, required the least time and also yielded the best pattemation. The photolytic and photothermal methods required organometallics, extended processing time and <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums.</b> The latter two requirements also {{held for the}} ablation deposition approach. In addition to control of the substrate position, controlled deposition duration was necessary to achieve an active catalyst layer. Although all methods were tested on both metal and quartz substrates, only the quartz substrates proved to be inactive towards the deposited catalyst particles...|$|R

By 1860 {{he was able to}} demonstrate a working device, and obtained a British patent covering a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum,</b> carbon filament incandescent lamp. However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short lifetime.|$|E
25|$|As {{water is}} pumped out, the bladder's walls are sucked inwards by the <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> created, and any {{dissolved}} material inside the bladder becomes more concentrated. The {{sides of the}} bladder bend inwards, storing potential energy like a spring. Eventually, no more water can be extracted, and the bladder trap is 'fully set' (technically, osmotic pressure rather than physical pressure is the limiting factor).|$|E
25|$|Vaporizer: A {{vaporizer}} is {{a device}} used to sublimate the active ingredients of plant material. Rather than burning the herb, which produces potentially irritating, toxic, or carcinogenic by-products; a vaporizer heats {{the material in}} a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> so that the active compounds contained in the plant boil off into a vapor. This method is often preferable when medically administrating the smoke substance, as opposed to directly pyrolyzing the plant material.|$|E
2500|$|His {{work with}} {{celluloid}} {{was not limited}} to investigation of its uses in astronomy. He reported in 1902 that he had demonstrated the explosive nature of the substance by substituting it for the cordite in a bullet and then firing that bullet through a [...] thick piece of wood. Similarly, although he used <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums</b> in his development of his diffraction gratings, he also investigated their use elsewhere as, for example, in his paper of 1903 entitled On the Production of Polished Metallic Surfaces having the Properties of Japanese [...] "Magic" [...] Mirrors. These and numerous other contributions– including experiments in soldering aluminium and the use of optics for gunsights– were reported to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he had been elected a member on 21 January 1896. He served as member of the Society's Council for all but one year between 1902 and 1912, was a vice-president for three years and was offered, but refused, a nomination to be president.|$|R
25|$|Lenard {{observed}} {{the variation in}} electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums</b> he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|R
50|$|Jasta 4 {{was founded}} on 25 August 1916, drawing {{personnel}} from FFA 23 and other two-seater reconnaissance units within 2 Armee, {{as well as from}} Kampfeinsitzerkommando Vaux and Armee-Flugpark Nr. 2. In June 1917, it switched to support and control of the 4 Armee. On 24 June 1917, it became part of the forming Jagdeschwader 1. Also during that summer, the unit suffered a <b>partial</b> leadership <b>vacuum,</b> with its commanding officer Kurt von Döring double-tasked with command of JG 1 due to the wounding of its CO, Manfred von Richthofen.|$|R
25|$|The evaporator, turbine, and {{condenser}} {{operate in}} <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> ranging from 3% to 1% of atmospheric pressure. The {{system must be}} carefully sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation. In closed-cycle OTEC, the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large {{compared to that of}} the pressurized working fluid. Components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{the main}} muscle of respiration and functions in breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves in the inferior direction, enlarging {{the volume of the}} thoracic cavity and reducing intra-thoracic pressure (the external intercostal muscles also participate in this enlargement), forcing the lungs to expand. In other words, the diaphragm's movement downwards creates a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the thoracic cavity, which forces the lungs to expand to fill the void, drawing air in the process.|$|E
25|$|Evaporators {{consume a}} great deal of steam, and thus fuel, in {{relation}} to the quantity of fresh water produced. Their efficiency is improved by working them at a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum,</b> supplied by the main engine condensers. On modern diesel-powered ships, this vacuum can instead be produced by an ejector, usually worked by the output from the brine pump. Working under vacuum also reduces the temperature required to boil seawater and thus permits evaporators to be used with lower-temperature waste heat from the diesel cooling system.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the <b>partial</b> power <b>vacuum</b> in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Shuttleworth {{suggested}} a hydraulic tube; water pressure {{rather than a}} <b>partial</b> atmospheric <b>vacuum,</b> would propel the train. In mountainous areas where plentiful water was available, a pumping station would be unnecessary: the water would be used directly. Instead of the flap to seal the slot in the tube, a continuous shaped sealing rope, made of cloth impregnated with india-rubber would be within the pipe. Guides on the piston would lift it into position and the water pressure would hold it in place behind the train. Use of a positive pressure enabled a greater pressure differential than a vacuum system. However {{the water in the}} pipe would have to be drained manually by staff along the pipe after every train.|$|R
25|$|The first Watt engines were {{atmospheric}} pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine {{but with the}} condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{raised the possibility of}} reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the power stroke might be reversed, making it easier to obtain rotary motion. Additional benefits of the double acting engine were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{was drawn}} from the boiler to the {{cylinder}} under the piston. When the piston {{reached the top of}} the cylinder, the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened. The condenser being at a lower pressure, drew the steam from the cylinder into the condenser where it cooled and condensed from water vapor to liquid water, maintaining a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> in the condenser that was communicated to the space of the cylinder by the connecting passage. External atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder.|$|E

TV dinners prepared with the aforementioned steps that is frozen and packaged properly can remain in near-perfect condition {{for a long time}} so long as it is stored at -18°C during shipping and storage.|$|E
50|$|This {{experiment}} contained two sealed pressure zones, extending {{along the}} interior {{walls of the}} satellite, which were designed to record the impact of micrometeorites large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were <b>partial</b> <b>vacuums,</b> each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m², which was 20% of {{the area of the}} shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a differential pressure gauge mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite's surface. The microphone output was amplified, shaped, and fed into a magnetic counter unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count of impacts. The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70-h interval from November 16 to 18, 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the influence of oxygen <b>partial</b> pressure (<b>vacuum</b> level in the chamber) on the properties of FeAl intermetallics. One of the problems in the application of classical methods of prepared Fe-Al intermetallic is the occurrence of oxides. Applying a vacuum during sintering should reduce this effect. In order to analyze the effect of oxygen partial pressure on sample properties, five samples were processed (by a pressure-assisted induction sintering—PAIS method) under the following pressures: 3, 8, 30, 80, and 300 mbar (corresponding to oxygen partial pressures of 0. 63, 1. 68, 6. 3, 16. 8, and 63 mbar, respectively). The chemical and phase composition, hardness, density, and microstructure observations indicate that applying a vacuum significantly impacts intermetallic samples. The compact sintered at pressure 3 mbar is characterized by the most homogeneous microstructure, the highest density, high hardness, and nearly homogeneous chemical composition...|$|R
25|$|The traps of the bladderworts {{may have}} derived from {{pitchers}} that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like Sarracenia psittacina does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers {{have to climb}} or fly out of a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in Utricularia, a one-way lid may have developed to form {{the door of a}} proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by the evolution of a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs {{on the door of the}} bladder.|$|E
25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as Daphnia touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a <b>partial</b> <b>vacuum</b> that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to fill the}} <b>partial</b> theoretical <b>vacuum</b> surrounding the understanding of fear acquisition. A review of recent and contemporary theories of the etiology of fear is presented, serving as a justification for further theorizing and allowing for greater understanding of those aspects of fear that remain to be adequately explained. A new model of the etiology of specific fears is subsequently put forward and the various aspects and implications of this model are discussed. How an individual perceives a stimulus is proposed as being critical in determining fear {{in relation to the}} stimulus. In particular, perceptions of the stimulus as uncontrollable, unpredictable, dangerous and disgusting create a schema of vulnerability. The Cognitive Vulnerability Model integrates much of the extensive body of research on fears and specific phobias into a unifying theory of the etiology of fear. The model offers parsimonious explanations for the various characteristics of specific fears and phobias...|$|R
