The hardware implementation {{was developed by}} using Arduino Uno Rev- 3 main board which uses the ATmega 328 as the microcontroller. The power factor value from the load was measured by using voltage and current transformers, zero crossing detectors, and ATmega 328 microcontroller. Zero crossing detectors produced current and voltage signals which will be measured and calculated for the time difference between both signals by ATmega 328 microcontroller using appropriate algorithms {{in order to obtain}} value of power factor. The ATmega 328 is programmed to automatically switch on and off capacitor function in order to control the signal <b>pulse</b> <b>send</b> to relay to connect and disconnect capacitor parallel with the load when energized and de energized if the calculated power factor value is either below 0. 9 or above 0. 9, respectively. Simulation of the power factor controller model was performed by using Proteus software. Arduino IDE software was used as the compiler for the Arduino Uno. The main objective is to study and develop the technology of automatic single phase power factor controller using Arduino Uno Rev- 3 by controlling the power factor of the inductive load near to unity power factor.

The shell is irradiated by a sequence of laser <b>pulses</b> <b>sending</b> inward-propagating shocks that convert the inner core into plasma and create turbulence. In the context of the evolution of the ISM, the shocks play the role of supernova remnant shocks and the core represents the ionized interstellar medium. We consider the effects of both pre-existing and self-generating magnetic fields and study the evolution of the system by means of two-dimensional numerical simulations. We find that the evolution of the turbulent core is generally, subsonic with rms-Mach number M_t≈ 0. 2. We observe an isotropic, turbulent velocity field with an inertial range power spectra of P(k) ∝ k^- 2. 3. We account for the effects of self-magnetization and find that the resulting magnetic field has characteristic strength ≈ 3 × 10 ^ 4 G. The corresponding plasma beta is ≈ 1 × 10 ^ 4 [...] 1 × 10 ^ 5, indicating that the magnetic field does not {{play an important role in}} the dynamical evolution of the system.
