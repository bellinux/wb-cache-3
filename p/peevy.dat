60|$|There {{were four}} loggers {{at work in}} a redwood forest, one January afternoon, rolling a great log with <b>peevies</b> and handspikes out of a chaos of fallen trunks. The Bush, a wall of sombre green, {{spangled}} here and there with frost, and impressively still, closed in about the little gap they had made. Not a sound {{came out of the}} shadowy avenues between the tremendous colonnades of towering trunks, and the topmost sprays of the cedars and Douglas firs cut motionless against the blue high above. There was no wind, and the men's breath went straight up, a thin white vapour, into the biting air. Still, they were warm and comparatively well fed, which was a good deal to be thankful for, and three of them toiled contentedly, with now and then a glance at their companion, who realized at length that he was beaten. In fact, it was only by calling up all the resolution that was in him that this fourth man, Derrick Nasmyth, had held himself to his task since early morning, for there is no occupation which demands from man more muscular effort and physical courage than logging, as it is generally carried on in the forest of Western Canada.|$|R
5|$|In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal {{a rocket}} pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find {{themselves}} on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic <b>Peevy</b> later find the rocket pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield.|$|E

Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and <b>Peevy,</b> Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E

60|$|Neither Vane nor Carroll, nor any {{of those}} who {{assisted}} them, had a clear recollection of what they did. Somehow they reached the boulder; somehow they plied ax or iron-hooked <b>peevy,</b> while the unstable, foam-lapped platform rocked beneath their feet. Every movement entailed a peril no one could calculate; but they toiled savagely on. When Vane began to swing a hammer above a drill, or from whom he got it, he did not know, {{any more than he}} remembered when he had torn off and thrown away his jacket although the sticks of giant-powder which had been in his pocket lay near him upon the stone. Sparks leaped from the drill which Carroll held and fell among the coils of snaky fuse; but that did not trouble them; and it was only when Vane was breathless that he changed places with his companion. They heard neither the turmoil of the flood nor the crashing of the timber, and the foam that lapped their long boots whirled unheeded by.|$|E

But when we {{got as far as}} Lexington we found Binkley Brothers' circus there, and the blue-grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the Belgian blocks with their hand-pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a Datto Bryan drama. I never pass a circus without pulling the valve-cord and coming down for a little Key West money; so I engaged a couple of rooms and board for Rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named <b>Peevy.</b> Then I took Rufe to a clothing store and gent's-outfitted him. He showed up strong, as I knew he would, after he was rigged up in the ready-made rutabaga regalia. Me and old Misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a Nile green visible plaid effect, and riveted on a fancy vest of a light Tuskegee Normal tan color, a red necktie, and the yellowest pair of shoes in town.|$|E

The home of William <b>Peevy</b> in Monrovia, {{a few miles north}} of Danville, was used as a temporary county seat in the interim. The city was named after the steamboat Danville, which plied the Petit Jean River in the 1840s. A log courthouse was constructed at Danville in 1844, though this was replaced by a frame building by 1850. A Masonic lodge was organized in Danville in the late 1840s.

40|$|Thursday, April 14, 2005 Writer: Jason <b>Peevy,</b> 706 / 542 - 8136, peevy@uga. edu Contact: Steve Wrigley, 706 / 542 - 2002, swrigley@uga. edu Robert Hawkins, 706 / 542 - 8176, rhawkins@uga. edu UGA announces $ 500 million Archway to Excellence Campaign {{with more}} than $ 298. 2 million in {{contributions}} to date Athens, Ga. ‚Äì The University of Georgia publicly launched the largest fund-raising effort in school history Thursday, with {{the announcement of the}} $ 500 million Archway to Excellence Campaign (www. archwaytoexcellence. uga. edu) during a gala kickoff event at Atlanta‚Äôs World Congress Center. Calling the celebration unlike any the university had seen in its 220 years, UGA President Michael F. Adams welcomed hundreds of alumni and friends to the kickoff. ‚ÄúPrivate financial support is what separates great universities from those that are merely good,‚Äù Adams said. UGA also announced that more than $ 298. 2 million of the $ 500 million goal had already been raised during the advance phase of the campaign. The School of Law has raised more than $ 8 million of its $ 17 million goal. Adams urged all UGA supporters to make their contribution. ‚ÄúYour financial support of the institution we all cherish is already making a {{difference in the lives of}} UGA‚Äôs students, faculty and staff,‚Äù he said. UGA began preparing for the Archway to Excellence Campaign about five years ago when a strategic plan was carefully developed, spelling out an ambitious agenda that focused on three themes: building the new learning environment, maximizing research opportunities and competing in a global economy. Determining that $ 500 million in private funds raised was necessary to execute its strategic plan, UGA adopted six strategic goals for the campaign. They are: attracting and supporting the best students; recruiting and retaining top faculty; strengthening programs to serve the state and beyond; advancing the quest for knowledge and achieving pre-eminence; enriching the campus and building the new learning environment; and ensuring annual and long-term unrestricted support. At the kickoff event, UGA also announced three new cumulative giving societies that recognize major donors, including individuals, corporations, foundations and organizations whose cumulative gifts have reached $ 1 million and above. The societies reflect all gifts and, in order to be perpetual, are not limited to the current campaign. The new giving societies are: The Crystal Arch Society, $ 10 million; The Abraham Baldwin Society, $ 5 million; and The 1785 Society, $ 1 million. The kickoff event was focused on UGA students, with several student musical groups performing and senior Adam Sparks from Watkinsville serving as Master of Ceremonies. Junior Mallory Grebel from Leesburg, a social work major who served as vice president of the SGA, said, ‚ÄúOn behalf of the more than 33, 405 students at UGA, we want to express our appreciation for your love of the University of Georgia and the financial support that is making UGA one of the best universities in America. ‚Äù Dean Garnett Stokes of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, who holds masters and doctoral degrees from UGA and has spent her entire career at her alma mater, said private gifts to UGA are ‚Äúhelping turn dreams into delight for the nearly 2, 000 faculty members at UGA. ‚Äù Stokes said she hears frequently from other deans that the desire for learning on campus has never been stronger. ‚ÄúThe faculty as a whole here understands that education is both an intellectual joy and an economic engine and that the future of our state, and indeed our country, depends on how well college professors instill both knowledge and a love of learning. ‚ÄúThe real test of the Archway to Excellence Campaign is how it allows us to combine the best and brightest students with the most accomplished and intellectually nimble faculty members,‚Äù Stokes said. ‚ÄúThat is the recipe for success, pure and simple. ‚Äù Lynda Courts of Atlanta, chair of the University of Georgia Foundation and a graduate of UGA‚Äôs English department, said the campaign kickoff celebration had two purposes. ‚ÄúOne is to celebrate what has already been raised in support of the campaign,‚Äù Courts said. ‚ÄúThe second is to focus on the portion of the $ 500 million goal which remains. ‚Äù Courts said all of UGA, especially the students and faculty, deserve support and commitment from private donors. ‚ÄúWe are the ones who will make UGA the kind of university we want it to be,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe should celebrate what we have already accomplished, but keep our eye on the larger goal as well. ‚Äù #...|$|E
