25|$|Older table-based pinsetters that pick up {{the pins}} between throws could {{malfunction}} if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect <b>pin</b> <b>drift</b> can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.|$|E
50|$|In metalworking, a drift <b>pin,</b> <b>drift</b> pin punch, slave pin, simply drift, or even pokey bit is {{the name}} for a tool used for {{enlarging}} holes, or aligning holes prior to bolting or riveting metal parts together. A drift pin is not used as a punch {{in the traditional sense}} of the term. A drift is constructed as a tapered rod, with the hammer acting on the large end of the taper. The tapered end of a drift punch is placed into the semi-aligned bolt holes of two separate components, and then driven into the hole. As it is driven in, the taper forces the two components into alignment, allowing for easy insertion of the fastener. Unlike most punches, force should never be applied to the tip of drift pin.|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull <b>pins,</b> <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. <b>Drift</b> <b>pins</b> have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|R
25|$|If a <b>pin</b> had <b>drifted</b> {{but still}} managed to be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than {{accurate}} gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during the pickup process.|$|R
30|$|Different {{bearing strain}} {{distributions}} and failure behaviors of differently oriented bearing specimens were observed using DIC. The RL specimen with a 12  mm <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> {{was found to}} have highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa, whereas the LR specimen had the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa. Although different bearing strength and mixed failure behaviors from the differently oriented bearing specimens were found, {{based on the results of}} load–displacement curves, statistical analysis, and failure behaviors, the design bearing strength values and failure behaviors could largely be divided into three groups as RL and TL, RT and TR, and LT and LR. The strain distributions at the bearing area from DIC showed that the lower strain values from RL and TL were found compared to the LR and LT. It can be speculated that different load-slip modulus was related with the orientation of the specimens. The results indicated that the bearing strength from the three groups should be established for the reliable <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> connection design using glulam with <b>drift</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the splitting strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify splitting strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the splitting strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of <b>drift</b> <b>pin,</b> end margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to splitting. On the other hand, as thickness increased, the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> bent more at splitting. This bending of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width splitting to partial width splitting. The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the strength of timber under such loading. For splitting of drift-pinned joints with steel side plates loaded parallel to grain, an evaluation method was proposed by considering that splitting occurs when maximum bearing stress by <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> to timber reaches its bearing strength. Based on this view, values of splitting strength estimated by calculation and analysis were compared with experimental values reported in the previous article. Taking the ends of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> as free ends, the calculated values agreed well with experimental values of specimens with thickness of less than 60  mm. On the other hand, taking the ends of the <b>drift</b> <b>pin</b> as fixed ends, the calculated values agreed well with the experimental values of specimens with thickness of more than 90  mm. According to the method proposed in this research, increasing specimen thickness leads to greater differences between specimens with free and fixed ends. It is clear that restricting joint rotation has a large effect. Analytical and experimental values in any specimen are well matched because the restriction of rotation is set properly based on the results of the tests.|$|R

5000|$|A drift [...] "punch" [...] is misleadingly named; it is {{not used}} as a punch in the {{traditional}} sense of the term.

30|$|Bond {{quality and}} joint {{performance}} between {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) and metal plates were investigated. Commercially fabricated LVL made of Douglas fir veneer and bonded with phenol-formaldehyde resin as well as three types of epoxy adhesives were used. Various surface preparations and treatments were applied to ordinary steel, stainless steel, and aluminum plates to remove the weak boundary layer that is incompatible with the resin and form a stable adherend layer that is chemically and mechanically compatible with the resin. Small specimens were tested in shear to search the most suitable metal surface for bonding with LVL. Generally, shear strength obtained for the specimens bonded with aluminum plates was lower than those bonded with ordinary steel plates. Among them chemically treated (ChT) and roughened (R) surfaces have demonstrated superior performance. To investigate strength performance and bond quality, LVL beams jointed with metal plates were tested while bending. The best results were obtained for specimens bonded with zinccoated metal plates, though good results were obtained also for ChT and R plates. However, the fracture proved to be fragile when no <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> were used, even for high-performance surface treatments. The usage of <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> was necessary to add toughness and avoid the brittle status of the fracture.|$|R

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the bearing {{properties}} of the differently oriented glulam using digital image correlation (DIC). Six differently oriented specimens associated with three anatomical directions including longitudinal (L), radial (R), and tangential (T), and 12 -mm <b>drift</b> <b>pins</b> were used to analyze the bearing properties, including yield load and bearing strength. The highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa from RL was found, whereas the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa from LR was found. Different strain distributions were observed from the differently oriented bearing specimens using DIC. Different failure ratios of the differently oriented specimens were highly related to the strain distributions. Although the bearing properties were found to be different between the differently oriented specimens, for the connection design aspect, the bearing properties of glulam could be grouped as RL and TL specimens, RT and TR specimens, and LR and LT specimens.|$|R
30|$|A wooden lattice {{floor with}} high {{stiffness}} and damping capacity {{has been developed}} to solve noise problems in wooden apartment houses. The lattice floor consisted of Douglas fir glulam beams with inserted steel plate joints and <b>drift</b> <b>pins.</b> To examine the structural performance of the floor, dynamic excitation and static loading tests were conducted on the full size floor. The first and second order resonance frequencies of the floor were 13.5 [*]Hz and 27.0 [*]Hz, respectively. These frequencies {{are similar to the}} peak frequency of a conventional wooden floor and the combined floor fabricated from glued laminated timber and iron. The maximum static load of the floor was 127 [*]kN. The apparent flexural rigidity was less than half the value of several floors studied in the past. However, it is considered that the stiffness is improved by constructing panels and this floor has almost equivalent performance. Relative deflection was not affected by the loading history.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of expulsion {{of the last}} liquidlike monolayer of molecules confined between two surfaces (measured recently {{for the first time}} [J. Chem. Phys. 114, 1831 (2001) ]) has been analyzed by solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation combined with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Instabilities in the boundary line of the expelled film produce a rough boundary for all length scales above a critical value. The squeeze-out of liquid is shown to result from the 2 D-pressure gradient in the lubrication film in the contact area. The Monte Carlo simulations agrees well with experiments, reproducing most qualitative and quantitative features. In particular it shows the formation of small islands, which (in the absence of <b>pinning</b> mechanism) <b>drift</b> slowly to the periphery of the contact area. We calculate the drift velocity analytically {{as a function of the}} distance of the island to the periphery of the contact area. Experiments indicate that some kind of pinning mechanism prevails, trapping fluid pockets for very long times. When including such pinning areas in the simulations, three distinct squeeze phases and time scales were observed: (1) initial fast squeeze of most of the fluid; (2) slower squeeze of unpinned fluid pockets; (3) long term pinning of fluid pockets. We also show that a distribution of small pinning areas may produce a synergistic effect, slowing down the second phase of the squeeze, compared to a small number of big pinning areas. The paper presents a new stochastic numerical approach to problems of moving boundaries which naturally accounts for thermal fluctuations and their effect in unstable dynamics.

The objective of this thesis is to devise a method to determine the residual strength of used creosote treated timber railroad bridge piles of various dimensions that have been subjected to varying degrees of environmental and mechanical deterioration. A total of 37 timber piles from three different locations were used for experimentation. Upon receipt, the piles were assigned an identification number and then stripped of any extraneous material such as wood blocks, <b>drift</b> <b>pins,</b> metal strapping, erection spikes, and metal bolts. The piles were then inspected for any form of pretest damage including, but not limited to, longitudinal cracking, fire damage, rot, decay, adequacy of creosote penetration, and general fitness of the wood. The piles were tested in uniaxial compression parallel to the grain in a custom built frame with a capacity of 1. 8 million pounds. Data taken from the testing included the applied load and three separate measurements of axial deformation. Testing for each specimen was terminated when any of the following occurred: longitudinal splitting {{along the length of the}} specimen, longitudinal splitting along the length of the specimen through bolt holes, localized barreling of the cross-section, lateral buckling, mushrooming of the butt or tip end, and/or manual termination due to failure to sustain load. A correlation was discovered between a two part pile strength parameter, [], and the ultimate test load, P[max]. The pile strength parameter consists of the axial stiffness as determined from a plot of load vs. deflection for each pile and a slenderness parameter obtainable from simple measurements as the square of the pile tip diameter divided by length. A least squares linear regression analysis was performed on a plot of the ultimate load from each test, P[max], vs. the pile strength parameter, [], for each test. Uniaxial compression tests of small clearwood samples of different species were similarly tested to determine potential limits of the pile strength parameter approach. This method of determining residual pile capacity is simple in concept and can be used in the field to determine remaining axial strength of in-service piles...|$|R
