25|$|Defamation is the {{communication}} {{of a statement}} that makes a claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, <b>product,</b> <b>group,</b> government or nation a negative image. It is usually—but not always, a requirement that this claim be false and that the publication be communicated to someone other than the person defamed (termed the claimant).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{get three}} types of results on {{measurable}} <b>group</b> theory; direct <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> of Ozawa's class S <b>groups,</b> wreath <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> and amalgamated free products. We prove measure equivalence factorization results on direct <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> of Ozawa's class S groups. As consequences, Monod–Shalom type orbit equivalence rigidity theorems follow. We prove that if two wreath <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> A≀G, B≀Γ of non-amenable exact direct <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> G, Γ with amenable bases A, B are measure equivalent, then G and Γ are measure equivalent. We get Bass–Serre rigidity results on amalgamated free products of non-amenable exact direct <b>product</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the evolving pattern of European countries' trade using recently developed empirical procedures {{based on the}} classic Balassa index. The extent of trade specialization exhibits a declining trend; European countries have lost their comparative advantage {{in a number of}} <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> over time. The indices of specialization have also tended to converge. For particular <b>product</b> <b>groups,</b> the indices display greater variation. They are stable for <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> with comparative disadvantage, but <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> with weak-to-strong comparative advantage show significant variation over time. The results reinforce the finding of a general decrease in specialization but do not support the idea of self-reinforcing mechanisms, strongly emphasized in much of the endogenous growth and trade literature. ...|$|R

25|$|By 1994, Novell {{had largely}} {{given up on}} {{attempting}} to make NetWare into a complete alternative operating system, and started selling off many of the companies it had acquired {{only a few years}} earlier. They had minimally promoted Btrieve, largely due to the delay (24 months) in releasing version 6. Negotiations between The Woodward's and Novell were entered into, and after two years Novell announced (26 Jan, 1994) {{that it was going to}} transfer ownership of Btrieve to Btrieve Technologies, Incorporated (also known as BTI). On 29 April 1994, the transfer was completed and Nancy Woodward became the Chairman of BTI and Doug Woodward was made the Chief Technical Officer. The CEO position was given to Ron Harris, a former employee of Texas Instruments, and one of the founding employees of Citrix Systems, Inc. where he was employed first as Director of Strategic Planning, then as Vice-President of Marketing, and finally as the <b>Product</b> <b>Group</b> Vice President.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} firms in each MC <b>product</b> <b>group</b> and many firms {{on the side}} lines {{prepared}} to enter the market. A <b>product</b> <b>group</b> is a [...] "collection of similar products". The {{fact that there are}} [...] "many firms" [...] gives each MC firm the freedom to set prices without engaging in strategic decision making regarding the prices of other firms and each firm's actions have a negligible impact on the market. For example, a firm could cut prices and increase sales without fear that its actions will prompt retaliatory responses from competitors.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the evolving pattern of Central European countries' agri-food trade using recently developed empirical procedures based around the classic Balassa index. The extent of trade specialisation exhibits a mixed trend. The {{results suggest that the}} trade pattern has converged in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia, while it polarised in Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia over the period. For particular <b>product</b> <b>groups,</b> the indices display greater variation. They are stable for <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> with comparative disadvantage, but <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> with weak to strong comparative advantage show significant variation. In addition, in the Baltic countries many specialisation improvements occurred in those <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> for which world demand expanded at the fastest rates during the period analysed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolving}} {{pattern of}} Hungary's agri-food trade is analysed using recently developed empirical procedures {{based on the}} classic Balassa index and its symmetric transformation. The extent of trade specialisation exhibits a declining trend; Hungary has lost comparative advantage {{for a number of}} <b>product</b> <b>groups</b> over time. The indices of specialisation have also tended to converge. For particular <b>product</b> <b>groups,</b> the indices display a less persistent pattern.

2500|$|Development {{was under}} <b>Product</b> <b>Group</b> Vice President Gerald C. Meyers, whose {{goal was to}} develop a car that was truly unique: [...] "everything that we do must {{distinguish}} itself as being importantly different than what can be expected from the competition." [...] Even before its introduction, AMC's Board Chairman Roy D. Chapin, Jr. described [...] "It will be a visibly different car, maybe even controversial ... It's an idea that represents a transition between what has been and what's coming. Today versus tomorrow."

2500|$|American Motors (AMC), the {{smallest}} U.S. automaker, was so convinced [...] "...that the rotary engine will {{play an important}} role as a powerplant for cars and trucks of the future...", that the chairman, Roy D. Chapin Jr., signed an agreement in February 1973, after a year's negotiations, to build Wankels for both passenger cars and Jeeps, as well as the right to sell any rotary engines it produced to other companies. American Motors' president, William Luneburg, did not expect dramatic development through to 1980. However Gerald C. Meyers, AMC's vice president of the engineering <b>product</b> <b>group,</b> suggested that AMC should buy the engines from Curtiss-Wright before developing its own Wankel engines, and predicted a total transition to rotary power by 1984. Plans called for the engine {{to be used in the}} AMC Pacer, but development was pushed back. American Motors designed the unique Pacer around the engine. By 1974, AMC had decided to purchase the General Motors Wankel instead of building an engine in-house. Both General Motors and AMC confirmed the relationship would be beneficial in marketing the new engine, with AMC claiming that the General Motors' Wankel achieved good fuel economy. However, General Motors' engines had not reached production when the Pacer was launched onto the market. The 1973 oil crisis played a part in frustrating the uptake of the Wankel engine. Rising fuel prices and talk about proposed US emission standards legislation also added to concerns.|$|E
