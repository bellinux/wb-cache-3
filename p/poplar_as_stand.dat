40|$|The {{fact that}} certain {{ecological}} factors fundamentally influencing tree growth have become unfavourable in Hungary in recent years, {{has led to}} the more extensive use of white poplar (and its hybrids) in afforestation and forest regeneration. An intensive integrated research and development work has been carried out on the growth of Leuce poplars on sandy soils, including primarily the white poplar (Populus alba) and its natural hybrid the grey poplar (Populus x canescens). The research revealed several factors influencing stand growth. The study presents a new, simplified tending operation model for Leuce <b>poplar</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>as</b> well as age, growing space and target diameter models suitable for qualitaty log production and for mass assortments. The simplicity of these practice-oriented models may foster the qualitative development of Leuce poplar management in Hungary...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{images of}} poplar {{canopies}} in the Bay of Plenty and East Coast were captured {{to develop a}} model to predict canopy closure in <b>poplar</b> <b>stands</b> <b>as</b> a function of basal area. A model to predict basal area {{as a function of}} site quality, age, and stocking was also estimated. The effect of canopy closure on relative understorey pasture production in poplar stands was investigated using existing data sources. It was concluded that a simple linear function was unlikely to adequately model this relationship, and a more complex function was consequently estimated. The equations to predict basal area, canopy closure, and understorey pasture production can be used in conjunction with data describing initial livestock-carrying capacity and the seasonal distribution of pasture growth, to predict the effect of site, age, and stocking on understorey livestock-carrying capacity in poplar stands...|$|R

[...] Plantation timber includes teak, eucalyptus, and <b>poplar,</b> <b>as</b> well as spruce, pine, and fir. [...] India imports small quantities of temperate hardwoods such as ash, maple, cherry, oak, walnut, beech, etc. as squared logs or as lumber.

5000|$|The {{white poplar}} was also sacred to Persephone, for whom Leuce {{seems to be}} a doublet, as a goddess of regeneration.

50|$|In 1789 William Aiton {{described}} the grey <b>poplar</b> <b>as</b> {{a variety of}} Populus alba, P. alba var. canescens. In 1804, James Edward Smith raised it to a full species, Populus canescens. He described differences between {{the leaves of the}} two taxa: P. alba has lobed leaves with snow-white ("niveus") undersides, whereas P. canescens has wavy-edged leaves with hoary ("incanus") undersides. Later authors sometimes noted the possibility that the grey poplar was a hybrid. It is now considered to be a hybrid between Populus alba and Populus tremula, so the scientific name is written with the hybrid symbol.|$|R

There are two possibilities for using <b>poplar</b> <b>as</b> raw material, and for using a new combination of chemicals as additives, the solution of calcium-chloride and calcium-formate instead of water glass. The present technology uses exclusively Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) chips, which is getting increasingly expensive. The price of the new additive is lower, as well as the price of poplar compared to Scots pine. As a result of {{our research}}, the costs of CBPB production can be reduced.
