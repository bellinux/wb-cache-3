25|$|Recovering {{from the}} abrupt takeoff, Richmond {{carried out a}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> flight with gear {{extended}} throughout but after only five minutes airborne, while encountering inadequate elevator control, the engine overheated. According to some accounts, Richmond was being scalded by steam from the radiator mounted below the cockpit, and in haste {{to carry out a}} forced landing, inadvertently stalled the aircraft at approximately 30ft above the airfield. Other sources state that the coolant leak only occurred after impact. The aircraft impacted heavily, with the undercarriage driven through the wings, and the tail broken off. Richmond survived with minor injuries, chiefly burns.|$|E

The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules.

500|$|On 25 July 1944 {{the first}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> {{was fired in}} the Bayo Canyon as a rehearsal, test of equipment, and {{measurement}} of collapse times and detonation and shock wave velocities. The program was delayed by about a month by late radiobarium shipments, as the test scheduled for 15 August was not conducted until mid-September. The first test with radiobarium was fired on 22 September. In late August and {{at the request of}} Rossi's group, the RaLa group was reformed under the leadership of Rossi, and Alvarez and his group took over the exploding bridgewire detonator research. At the suggestion of Robert Christy solid spheres instead of the originally intended hollow ones were chosen for the pit, {{in order to reduce the}} problems with jets and spalling. The first solid-sphere RaLa shot was performed in early December but the results were inconclusive. The shot from 14 December though, showed (in the words of Robert Bacher) [...] "definite evidence of compression".|$|E

(M100) We {{have already}} seen how warmly the project of {{introducing}} competition into the civil service had kindled Mr. Gladstone’s enthusiasm {{in the days of}} the Crimean war.(199) Reform had made slow progress. The civil service commission had been appointed in 1855, but their examinations only tested the quality of candidates sent before them on nomination. In 1860 a system was set up of limited competition among three nominated candidates, who had first satisfied a <b>preliminary</b> <b>test</b> examination. This lasted until 1870. Lowe had reform much at heart. At the end of 1869, he appealed to the prime minister: “As I have so often tried in vain, will you bring the question of the civil service before the cabinet to-day? Something must be decided. We cannot keep matters in this discreditable state of abeyance. If the cabinet will not entertain the idea of open competition, might we not at any rate require a larger number of competitors for each vacancy? five or seven or ten?” ...|$|E
