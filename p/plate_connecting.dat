50|$|Loner (Du-Xing-Zhe or Duxingzhe, 独行者) UAV is an {{unmanned}} UAV {{developed by}} NUAA, {{and the general}} designer is a NUAA graduate student {{in his second year}} of pursuing master's degree, Mr. Zhang Shuai-Hao (张帅浩). Loner UAV is a rotary wing UAV with very unusual layout, and the inspiration of such design comes from the falling tree leaves from the branches. The fuselage is a semicircle <b>plate</b> <b>connecting</b> to a strip, and a propeller is attached {{to the end of the}} strip. The propeller provides lift during take-off and landing and thrust in level flight, but the directional control is partially provided by the unique shape of the fuselage itself: because its asymmetric shape, it would turn in the wind as the resistance caused by the wind increases, thus indirectly helps to make a turn.|$|E

50|$|The {{south-western}} {{elevation of}} the church, facing the driveway, has changed little from that designed by Gailey: 6 bays framed with shallow engaged piers connected top and bottom, the first 5 punctuated by tall, narrow windows with round-arches and sills, and that at the rear featuring both a narrow window, shorter than the others because of the sloping land, and a timber door with semicircular fanlight. The bays are rough cast render while the frame is smooth render. The windows are filled with 4 coloured lead lights, 3 of which pivot along the horizontal centre line. The rear elevation is again Gailey's design, rendered in a similar pattern with a rough cast face framed by smooth-rendered, engaged piers at each corner curving to the top <b>plate</b> <b>connecting</b> them under the gable end. A small, narrow window with round-headed arch and fixed louvres opens high into the centre of this wall.|$|E

40|$|A {{corrugated}} {{core steel}} sandwich plate is a high-performance all-steel structural element. It {{consists of two}} outer steel plates separated by a folded corrugated core <b>plate.</b> <b>Connecting</b> the three plates can be made through hybrid laser-arc welding. In bridge applications, steel sandwich bridge decks bring several benefits compared to conventional orthotropic decks; better load distribution, higher stiffness to weight ratio and a more industrialized production and construction process. This paper presents a background {{to the concept of}} steel sandwich bridge decks and comparisons are made to conventional steel bridge decks in a qualitative and quantitative manner. The results from a study on the impact of the weld joint configuration on the fatigue performance and transverse shear stiffness is presented. In addition possible applications of sandwich bridge decks are discussed based on case studies. The results show that weight saving with up to 44 % can be achieved by replacing conventional orthotropic decks with steel sandwich plates...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} metal <b>plate</b> <b>connected</b> joints on {{strength}} properties of rubberwood (hevea braziliensis) {{laminated veneer lumber}} (LVL) is presented to study on the possible use of rubberwood LVL for structural purposes {{in the context of}} its strength performance. The making of the rubberwood LVL was carefully designed, selected and monitored in order to produce good quality LVL. Defect-free solid rubberwood was tested as control. Comparison is also made with studies carried out by Gupta in evaluating test results from various sources. Results of different tests on strength properties and joints with metal <b>plate</b> <b>connected</b> rubberwood LVL are presented, including direct comparisons with similar experimental results on selected solid rubberwood. Preliminary studies indicated that the teeth of the metal plate connector causes a certain degree of damage to the outer layer of the LVL and weaken the strength properties. However, it is concluded that this research has merit and requires further investigation on the surface lamination of the LVL and the teeth configuration of the metal plate connector...|$|R
