40|$|AbstractThe 90 -kDa {{heat shock}} protein (HSP 90) is a {{molecular}} chaperone that assists in the folding and assembly of proteins in the cytosol. We previously demonstrated that the antineoplastic reagent, cisplatin, inhibits the aggregation <b>prevention</b> <b>activity</b> of mammalian HSP 90. We now show that cisplatin binds both the amino terminal and carboxyl terminal domains of the human HSP 90 and differently affects these two domains. Cisplatin blocks the aggregation <b>prevention</b> <b>activity</b> of HSP 90 C, but not HSP 90 N. In contrast, cisplatin induces a conformational change in HSP 90 N, but not HSP 90 C. These results indicate that cisplatin modulates the HSP 90 activities through two different mechanisms using the two distinct binding sites of the HSP 90 molecule...|$|R

Half the PCG/Ts (49 %) had formally discussed accidents at a PCG/T meeting, 34 % had taken action and 29 % had written an accident prevention strategy.

40|$|Pharmacologic inhibitors of the prostaglandin-synthesizing COX- 2 {{oncogene}} {{prevent the}} development of premalignant human colon adenomas. However, resistance to treatment is common. In this study, we show that the adenoma <b>prevention</b> <b>activity</b> of the COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib requires the concomitant presence of the 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15 -PGDH) tumor suppressor gene, and that loss of 15 -PGDH expression imparts resistance to celecoxib's anti-tumor effects. We first demonstrate that the adenoma-preventive activity of celecoxib is abrogated in mice genetically lacking 15 -PGDH. In FVB mice, celecoxib prevents 85 % of azoxymethane-induced tumors > 1 mm in size, but is essentially inactive in preventing tumor induction in 15 -PGDH-null animals. Indeed, celecoxib treated 15 -PGDH null animals develop more tumors than do celecoxib naive WT mice. In parallel {{with the loss of}} tumor <b>prevention</b> <b>activity,</b> celecoxib-mediated suppression of colonic PGE 2 levels is also markedly attenuated in 15 -PGDH-null versus WT mice. Finally, as predicted by the murine models, humans with low colonic 15 -PGDH levels also exhibit celecoxib resistance. Specifically, in a colon adenoma prevention trial, in all cases tested, individuals who developed new adenomas while receiving celecoxib treatment were also found as having low colonic 15 -PGDH levels...|$|R
