5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled <b>pumps</b> that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining.

Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons.

In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable <b>pumps</b> that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the <b>pumps,</b> but would contaminate the feed.

They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal <b>pumps.</b> They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump.

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct.

In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then <b>pumps</b> oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E

40|$|Coil <b>pump</b> is {{considered}} one of non-conventional water <b>pumping</b> devices which use non-conventional energy sources. It is a self supporting system for <b>pumping</b> water. The performance of coil <b>pump</b> under different operating parameters is the main objective concerned of present study. The parameters considered in the present study are submerged ratios, rotational speed and number of coils of the wrapped hose. The experimental results showed significant effects on the <b>pump</b> performance due to the variation in submerged ratio Sr and the <b>pump</b> rotational speed as well. The presence of air with water for submerged ratios 0 Sr 100 % gives the coil <b>pump</b> its <b>pumping</b> action. Increasing the submerged ratio increases the <b>pump</b> flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the <b>pump</b> rotational speed, then decreases to zero when the <b>pump</b> is fully immersed. Submerged ratio has a minor effect on the <b>pump</b> maximum static head, it is nearly constant but decreases drastically to zero when the <b>pump</b> submerged ratio reaches 100 %. Increasing the <b>pump</b> rotational speed increases water flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the working submerged ratio, then the discharge decreases by increasing the rotational speed. Meanwhile slight changes are obtained for the <b>pump</b> static head when the <b>pump</b> rotational speed changes. The number of <b>pump</b> coils is also one of most effective parameters on the coil <b>pump</b> performance.
