40|$|The {{petroleum}} solvents {{covered in}} this monograph are all complex mixures of hydrocarbns produced from petroleum distilation fractions {{which have been}} further refined {{by one or more}} process. U nlike petroleum fuels (lARC, 1989), these miures are not produced by blending various refineiy procss streams but rather by further refining and distiling one or two streams to make a product significantly different in chemical composition and much narrower in boiling range (tyically 15 - 30 °C) than its source streams. Petroleum solvents are generally defined and differentiated by certain physical properties and by chemical composition. Among the properties of importnce, depending on the intended end-use of the solvent, are boiling range, flash-point, solvent strength (solvency), colour, odour, aromatic content and sulfur content. Some of these properties are interrelated; for example, increasing the aromatic content often increases solvency, but also increases odour. ln addition, the same propert may be measured in different ways in different industries or in different geographic regions; for example, kauri-butanol value (the amount of <b>petroleum</b> <b>solvent</b> in mililtres required to cause cloudiness in a solution of kauri gum and n-butanol) and aniline point (the minimal temperature for complete mixg of aniline with a <b>petroleum</b> <b>solvent)</b> are both indicators of solvency but kauri-butanol value is more commonly used in Europe and aniline point more commonly in the USA. It is not surpriing, then, that the same names may be used for solvents that are not identical, and that different classification systems or names may be more common in one industiy or geographic region than another.

This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the health hazards of workers exposed to solvents during the re-furbishing of chemical rail-tankers.

Two of the three main processes were conducted within the tanker, defined as a confined space, and the third {{was conducted on the}} dome area, situated on the outside middle top area of tanker. The main chemical composition of the solvent products used included, xylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and <b>petroleum</b> <b>solvent.</b> Various different combinations of chemical compositions, per solvent product, were found. During the assessment of the solvent exposures, as prescribed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods NOSH Manual of Analytical methods, results for both personal and environmental / area air samples were found to be in violation of the occupational exposure limit (OEL) for mixtures, as it has exceeded the unity of one (1). This result was further supported by the high urine content of biological markers, which are reflected in the biological exposure index, for the majority of solvents. The most frequent complaints experienced among the majority of exposed workers included, headaches, dizzy spells, a feeling of fatigue, drunkenness and eye irritation. A lesser percentage experienced nausea (feeling like vomiting), had a sense of irritability and breathing problems. Control measures, aimed at limiting exposures, were found to be inadequate or non-existent as some workers indicated that they were required to purchase their own personal protective equipment.

30|$|Dyes {{are widely}} used in various {{industries}} such as textile, leather, paper, printing, food, cosmetics, paint, pigments, <b>petroleum,</b> <b>solvent,</b> rubber, plastic, pesticide, wood preserving chemicals, and pharmaceutical industry. Over 10, 000 of different commercial dyes and pigments exist currently and more than 7  ×  105 tonnes are produced annually worldwide [1, 2, 3]. Discharge of dye-bearing wastewaters into the natural environment from textile, paper and leather industries causes a serious threat for the aquatic life [4]. On the other hand, limited aquatic resources and increasing demand for safe water require efficient water treatment methods [5]. Synthetic dyes are generally resistant to biodegradation and physicochemical techniques for their removal [6, 7], such as adsorption, chemical oxidation, electrocoagulation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been extensively used to comply {{with more and more}} stringent legislation regarding the maximum allowable dye concentration in wastewaters [7, 8, 9, 10]. Methylene blue (MB) is a thiazine cationic dye with widespread applications, including coloring paper, dyeing cottons, wools and coating for paper stock. It is also used in microbiology, surgery and diagnostics and as a sensitizer in photo-oxidation of organic pollutants. Although it has low toxicity, it can cause some specific harmful effects for the human health such as heartbeat increase, vomiting, shocks, cyanosis, jaundice and tissue necrosis [11, 12]. Hence, its removal from wastewaters is an important issue for the environmental protection [13]. The conventional methods have been extensively used for treating waters contaminated with heavy metal and dyes [14, 15, 16]. However, these methods present some disadvantages such as high cost, low removal efficiency and production of excessive toxic sludge [17]. Recently, inexpensive, ecofriendly and not pathogenic organisms have been used for the dye removal [18]. In this respect, the biosorption process has attracted a great interest in this context, and seems a good alternative for the removal of dyes and other pollutants from wastewaters [19, 20], as a replacement for costly commercially biosorbents [21]. It can be defined as sequestering of organic or inorganic compounds by alive or dead biomasses or their derivatives; the biomass can consist of bacteria [22], fungal [19], yeasts [22], algae [23], seaweeds and even industrial or agricultural wastes [24, 25]. Different vegetal biomasses have been used such as Opuntia ficus indica [26], Sugar beet pulp [21], Stoechospermum marginatum [24], Scolymus hispanicus L. [27], Palm kernel [28], Pinus brutia Ten.

The test sections consisted of straight copper tubes 1 -inch OD and 0. 830 -inch ID. The velocity profiles and drop size measurements were made at a point 8 - 1 / 2 feet downstream from the entrance to these tubes. The dispersions were formed and maintained by the mixing action of a high speed centrifugal pump. The organic phases were a light <b>petroleum</b> <b>solvent,</b> a light oil and a heavy oil with viscosities of 1, 15, and 200 centipoise, respectively. Flow rates were in the range 1 - 4 lb/sec and concentrations from 5 to 50 volume percent were studied. A photographic method of drop size determination was developed. Excellent results are obtained for drop diameters in the range 5 - 800 microns. Dispersions with concentrations from 1 to 50 volume percent were photographed. The drop size and {{the shape of the}} drop size distributions depended strongly on dispersed phase viscosity. The range of drop diameters was found to increase with dispersed phase viscosity. Velocity profile data were obtained in the turbulent core for three flow rates and four concentrations for the light oil dispersions and two flow rates and three concentrations for the heavy oil dispersions. The light oil dispersions were found to behave as single phase Newtonian fluids. The solvent dispersions have previously been shown to behave as single phase Newtonian liquids. The heavy oil dispersions did not behave as Newtonian fluids. These results were combined with the drop size data and a previously proposed criteria for treating dispersions as single phase fluids to give the relation [see PDF for formula] where d₃₂ is the Sauter mean diameter of the dispersed drops. Dispersions which do not meet this criterion are presumed to have a "slip" velocity, i. e., the larger drops move relative to the fluid element in which they are contained. Thus they do not behave as a single phase fluid. The velocity profiles for the light oil dispersions were used to calculate an effective dispersion viscosity [mu subscript e]. The viscosity increased with dispersed phase concentration. Effective viscosities for the solvent dispersion had been determined by previous workers. A comparison of the viscosities and drop size data for these two systems shows that at equal concentrations the effective viscosity of a dispersion {{is a function of the}} drop size distribution, decreasing with increasing size range. Effective viscosities for the heavy oil dispersions were determined from the friction factor data and appeared to be independent of concentration in the range 5 to 17 volume percent. This may be explained by a "slip" velocity and an analysis of the drop size distributions. A study was made of one water-in-solvent dispersion and it was found that water droplets adhered to the pipe wall. The average size of these droplets could be determined from the observed friction factor data. The droplets adhering to the wall were observed to undergo coalescence with the droplets in the flowing dispersion. Several other observations made through the optical portion of the photographic arrangement tend to support the coalescence theory recently proposed by Howarth...|$|E
