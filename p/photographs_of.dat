5|$|Beato's <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the Second Opium War are {{the first}} to {{document}} a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E

5|$|Benedicte Wrensted (1859–1949) was {{a notable}} Danish female photographer, who {{emigrated to the}} USA in 1894. Wrensted learned her craft from her {{maternal}} aunt, Charlotte Borgen, {{and for a time}} in the 1880s operated a studio on Torvet 8, in Horsens, Denmark. Much of her photographic career is anchored to her studio in Pocatello, a small town in southeastern Idaho, where she took <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the local inhabitants and recorded the growth of the town. Perhaps her most famous work remains her documentary <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the Shoshone Great Basin Native Americans which are considered of great anthropological importance.
