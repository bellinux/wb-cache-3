5|$|<b>Pustular</b> {{dermatitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the skin that presents with <b>pustular</b> lesions.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{classified}} as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on histological characteristics. Variants include plaque, <b>pustular,</b> guttate, and flexural psoriasis. Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. Psoriasis can also be classified into nonpustular and <b>pustular</b> types.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{types of}} {{psoriasis}} comprise approximately 10% of cases. They include <b>pustular,</b> inverse, napkin, guttate, oral, and seborrheic-like forms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pustular</b> {{psoriasis}} {{appears as}} raised bumps filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). The skin under and surrounding the pustules is red and tender.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{psoriasis}}: plaque, guttate, inverse, <b>pustular,</b> and erythrodermic. Plaque psoriasis, {{also known as}} psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90 percent of cases. It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top. Areas of the body most commonly affected are {{the back of the}} forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp. Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions. <b>Pustular</b> psoriasis presents as small non-infectious pus-filled blisters. Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds. Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types. Fingernails and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time. This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.|$|E
5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of <b>pustular</b> fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
25|$|Migration of neutrophilic granulocytes {{into the}} {{epithelial}} layer, which may create superficial microabscesses, {{similar to the}} Munro's microabscesses described in <b>pustular</b> psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{blindness}} {{was indeed}} a common result of smallpox, ophthalmologist Richard H. C. Zegers suggests that Mozart's symptoms did not represent actual blindness, but rather resulted from the <b>pustular</b> rash of the disease affecting his eyelids.|$|E
25|$|Fruit bodies (when present) are gelatinous. In {{some species}} they are small (under 5mm across) and <b>pustular</b> to pulvinate (cushion-shaped). In others {{they are much}} larger (up to 150mm across) and may be {{variously}} lobed, cephaliform (like a brain, with folds and ridges), or foliose (with leaf-like or seaweed-like fronds). Many Tremella species, however, are hymenial parasites, producing spores within the fruit bodies of their hosts, and are only visible microscopically.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{all people}} with Behçet's disease present with {{some form of}} painful ulcerations inside the mouth. They are a form of aphthous ulcers or non-scarring oral lesions. The oral lesions {{are similar to those}} found in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease and can be relapsing. Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 percent of the patients. Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous <b>pustular</b> vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was <b>pustular.</b> His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E

500|$|Life expectancies may {{be up to}} 20–25 years. [...] Parapoxvirus is common, though rarely fatal; Infection causes papular and nodular lesions. There {{have been}} {{epidemics}} of contagious <b>pustular</b> dermatitis. [...] Bacteria such as E.coli and Lyme borreliosis are common, and Toxoplasma gondii has been reported. [...] C.crispus is susceptible to numerous parasites, such as the nematode Trichuris discolor and the lungworm Protostrongylus shiozawai.|$|E
500|$|Smallpox is {{believed}} to have been acquired by humans originally as a zoonosis from a terrestrial African rodent between 16,000 and 68,000 years ago, well before the dawn of agriculture and civilization. [...] The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the <b>pustular</b> rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century (including five reigning monarchs), and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Of all those infected, 20–60 percent—and over 80 percent of infected children—died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million deaths during the 20th century. As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Entertainment Weekly graded the episode a C, writing, [...] "A good idea is tainted by plot holes as gaping and disturbing as the <b>pustular</b> boils you'll be treated {{to in this}} hour". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club was positive, grading it an A. He particularly praised the way the darkness was handled which made it a [...] "tense, gripping mini-movie", and also praised the guest stars. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two wrote positively of {{the first part of}} the entry, noting that it [...] "jogs along quite merrily as a simple contagion story". They were, however, more critical of the second half, noting that the story [...] "takes a left turn and becomes a thoughtful analysis on disinformation, on cover-up, and the public right to truth." [...] Shearman and Pearson called both parts [...] "two really interesting rough drafts", but concluded that the two halves were ill-suited for one another.|$|E
2500|$|Myxarium nucleatum forms scattered, <b>pustular,</b> {{gelatinous}} fruit bodies [...] in diameter. These often coalesce, forming compound fruit {{bodies that}} may be irregularly cerebriform (brain-like) and up to 6cm (2.5in) across. Fruit bodies are hyaline (colourless) to whitish, occasionally with lilac or pinkish tints. Opaque, white, spherical, mineral inclusions are often evident and are made of calcium oxalate. The spore-bearing surface (hymenium) is smooth. With age, the fruit bodies may become brownish and eventually dry to a thin, varnish-like film. The spore print is white. The fungus {{does not have any}} distinct taste or smell; it is inedible.|$|E
2500|$|In 166, {{during the}} epidemic, the Greek {{physician}} and writer Galen traveled from Rome {{to his home}} in Asia Minor. [...] He returned to Rome in 168 when summoned by the two Augusti - the co-emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Virus he was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at Aquileia in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly records observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise Methodus Medendi, and his other references to it are scattered among his voluminous writings. He describes the plague as [...] "great" [...] and of long duration and mentions fever, diarrhea, and pharyngitis, as well as a skin eruption, sometimes dry and sometimes <b>pustular,</b> appearing on the ninth day of the illness. The information provided by Galen does not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.|$|E

50|$|Annular <b>pustular</b> {{psoriasis}} {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} <b>pustular</b> psoriasis, having an annular, or circinate, lesion morphology that may appear {{at the onset of}} <b>pustular</b> psoriasis, with a tendency to spread and form enlarged rings.|$|E
50|$|Characteristics {{may vary}} {{according}} to the subtype of <b>pustular</b> psoriasis. For example, it can be localized, commonly to the hands and feet (localized <b>pustular</b> psoriasis), or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body (generalized <b>pustular</b> psoriasis). However, all forms of <b>pustular</b> psoriasis share in common the presence of red and tender blotchy skin covered with pustules.|$|E
50|$|Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (also {{known as}} pustulosis of palms and soles, palmoplantar pustulosis, {{persistent}} palmoplantar pustulosis, <b>pustular</b> psoriasis of the Barber type, and <b>pustular</b> psoriasis of the extremities) is a chronic recurrent <b>pustular</b> dermatosis (that is, a pustulosis or <b>pustular</b> psoriasis) localized on the palms and soles only, characterized histologically by intraepidermal pustules filled with neutrophils. It can occur {{as part of}} the SAPHO syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>pustular</b> {{psoriasis}} is {{used for}} a heterogeneous group of diseases that share <b>pustular</b> skin characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pustular</b> {{psoriasis}} {{is classified}} into two major forms: localized and generalized <b>pustular</b> psoriasis. Within these two categories {{there are several}} variants: ...|$|E
5000|$|... von Zumbusch (acute) {{generalized}} <b>pustular</b> psoriasis, (acute GPP) is {{the most}} severe form of generalized <b>pustular</b> psoriasis, and {{can be associated with}} life-threatening complications.|$|E
5000|$|Subcorneal <b>pustular</b> {{dermatosis}} (also {{known as}} Sneddon-Wilkinson disease and pustulosis subcornealis) is skin condition {{that is a}} rare, chronic, recurrent, <b>pustular</b> eruption characterized histopathologically by subcorneal pustules that contain abundant neutrophils. This is distinct from {{and not to be}} confused with subcorneal <b>pustular</b> dermatosis type of IgA pemphigus. Sneddon's syndrome, also known as Ehrmann-Sneddon syndrome, is also a different syndrome.|$|E
