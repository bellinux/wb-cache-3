5|$|Modern sources citing Plummer and Bad Elk {{have tended}} {{to discuss the issue}} as defense against {{unlawful}} force; under contemporary law in most jurisdictions, a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> not use force to resist an unlawful arrest. The Plummer quote has been noted to be a fabrication, not appearing in the text of the opinion.|$|E
5|$|No {{implements}} {{other than}} hoop nets may be used; no one <b>person</b> <b>may</b> {{have more than}} 5 nets and no vessel may use more than 10 hoop nets. When fishing from land, each fisherman is limited to two hoop nets.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage. Although the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E

5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxy{{hemoglobin}} to hemoglobin molecules {{in an average}} <b>person</b> <b>may</b> be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> only be {{appointed to the}} Hindu Endowments Board, which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments, {{if he or she}} is Hindu. Similarly, one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
5|$|According to this Upanishad, the renouncer pilgrim {{undertakes}} {{the journey}} to the knowledge of Brahman with purity of thought, without belongings, with his head shaved, wearing discoloured garments, free from enmity towards all, and he lives on alms. This method is not essential for anyone too sick or in mortal danger – such a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> renounce verbally or mentally.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> not be able to breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator.|$|E
5|$|Having {{experienced}} a stroke, a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> {{be admitted to}} a stroke unit, and treatments may be directed as preventing future strokes, including ongoing anticoagulation (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering drugs. A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists plays {{a large role in}} supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In this story, {{there is}} a {{fountain}} where once per year, one <b>person</b> <b>may</b> bathe to have his or her problems answered. This is how three witches meet. The first witch, Asha, suffers from an incurable disease. The second, Altheda, endures poverty and powerlessness due to a robbery. The third, Amata, is distraught after being left by her beloved. The three witches decide {{to try to reach}} the fountain together but along the way, a knight, Sir Luckless, also joins them.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people with}} AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> show no symptoms, and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test.|$|E

5|$|The Government may ask for {{the flag}} to be lowered to half-mast {{in the event of}} the death of an {{important}} person or for national mourning. No person is permitted to use the flag at any private funeral ceremony. However, the national flag can be draped on a coffin during a military or state funeral. No <b>person</b> <b>may</b> display any flag that is damaged or dirty. Any worn out or damaged flag should be packed into a sealed black trash bag before being disposed and not left visible in dustbins.|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean {{government}} {{dictates that}} no <b>person</b> <b>may</b> treat the national flag with disrespect, such as allowing the flag {{to touch the}} ground. The flag must not be displayed below any other flag, emblem or object; dipped in salute to any person or thing; or displayed or carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the <b>person</b> <b>may</b> still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver to a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> help with night blindness, an illness now {{known to be}} caused by a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a <b>person</b> <b>may</b> be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A <b>person</b> <b>may</b> {{not be able to see}} objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
