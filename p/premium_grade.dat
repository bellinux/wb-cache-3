25|$|The Bullitt uses {{a version}} of the Mustang GT's {{aluminum}} 4.6L SOHC V8. It has a cold air intake, improved engine calibration, and a revised exhaust system designed to mimic the sound of the Mustang used in the Bullitt movie. Total output is 315hp (235kW) @ 6000rpm and 325lb·ft (440N·m) of torque @ 4250rpm and the engine's redline has been raised to 6500rpm (from the standard Mustang GT's 6250rpm). <b>Premium</b> <b>grade,</b> 91-octane or better gasoline is recommended, although an adaptive spark ignition system allows the engine to accept regular grade gasoline. Total output is the same with either fuel, but the engine delivers a flatter torque curve when using premium. The Tremec TR3650 5-speed manual transmission from the Mustang GT is used, but the Bullitt featured a heavier duty rear axle (also used in GT500KR) with 3.73:1 ratio, versus the Mustang GT's 3.31:1 or optional 3:55:1 ratios. The suspension is improved over the standard GT utilizing stiffer springs, struts, and a decorative front strut tower brace while also lowering the car's ride height by six millimeters. Most of the Mustang Bullitt's components are available in the aftermarket for retrofitting earlier S197 Mustang GT vehicles, but some parts used in Bullitt Mustangs are marked to show authenticity.|$|E

500|$|Having {{split from}} N.W.A, Dr. Dre's first solo album {{established}} {{him as one}} of the biggest hip hop stars of his era. Yahoo! Music writer S.L.

Whatever one thinks of the over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach". The Chronic brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a [...] "lazy drawl".

2500|$|Starting in late 2010 (for the 2011 model year), the Mustang GT's {{engine was}} an all-aluminum 32-valve 5.0L DOHC V8, codenamed Coyote.

While the new engine's displacement {{was similar to}} Ford's original [...] "5.0" [...] V8, it was an unrelated design and instead shared {{more in common with}} the 4.6L V8 and other Modular engines that it replaced. The new 5.0 used a DOHC head design like other Modular engines and even shared its bore spacing and deck height with the outgoing 4.6L V8. Differing the new engine from earlier Modular engines, among other features, was its use of wider bore diameters (and a longer stroke relative to the 4.6L V8 in particular), to allow the use of larger valves, and camshaft torque-actuated Twin-independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT). This more advanced design is approximately [...] – about heavier than the Mustang GT's previous 4.6L V8. Red-line had been raised to 7,000 rpm.
