The name [...] "Draves Island" [...] was given by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1956 to the western portion of <b>Booth</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> then {{thought to be a}} separate feature. Subsequent Soviet Expeditions (1956-57) found that feature to be part of <b>Booth</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and US-ACAN has reapplied the name to the point described. It was named for Dale Draves, an air crewman on the U.S. Navy Operation Highjump seaplane commanded by D.E. Bunger which landed in this area and obtained aerial and ground photographs in February 1947.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English {{scientist}} William Scoresby explored the Arctic and wrote reports on its meteorology, zoology and geophysics. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic {{in the early nineteenth}} century. In June 1831, Sir James Ross and a group of Eskimos explored the <b>Booth</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{in order to determine the}} exact location of the Magnetic North Pole. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen in Norway. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the United States, Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.|$|R
