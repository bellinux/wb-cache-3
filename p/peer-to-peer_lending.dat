2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{low-cost}} Internet access {{in developing countries}} has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. [...] Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy {{is the use of}} <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>lending</b> for charitable purposes. Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.|$|E

CCS has a 10 -year {{strategic}} plan to grow to one million members, $ 20 billion in assets, and to have operations in all ten provinces in Canada by the year 2012.

40|$|<b>Peer-to-peer</b> Online <b>Lending</b> (P 2 PO) has {{received}} increasing attention {{over the last}} years, {{not only because of}} its disruptive nature and its disintermediation of nearly all major banking functions, but also because of its rapid growth and expanding breadth of services. This model offers a new way of investing in addition to investing in traditional channels such as banking or financial company.

The strong development of P 2 PO also raises a number of issues that require careful attention to promote positive and to limit negative aspects.

The research combines qualitative analysis and data survey to serve descriptive statistics about P 2 PO in Viet Nam.

40|$|What {{happens to}} a {{security}}’s rate of return in the primary market when a sec-ondary market for that security is created? This question is discussed {{in the context of}} a de novo secondary market for peer-to-peer loans using loan data from the <b>peer-to-peer</b> platform <b>Lending</b> Club. Drawing on existing literature on risk and liquidity premiums, a basic model of primary market loan rates is developed and tested against the data using an event analysis. In brief, the model is a supply-and-demand analysis using basic intuition about risk and liquidity preferences. The model suggests that interest rates could either in-crease or decrease depending on how much risk existed in the primary market loan pool prior to the introduction of the secondary market. Namely, inves-tors with safe portfolios would choose to substitute towards riskier and higher yielding loans, whereas investors with risky portfolios would do the opposite. The data indicate that risk and interest rates rose among safe loans, fell among risky loans, and fell on the whole after Lending Club created a secondary market. These results suggest that, from a regulatory perspective, the deci-sion to permit a fi nancial intermediary to create a secondary market should be informed by the possibility that this innovation could raise risk levels in the primary market...|$|R

40|$|There {{are often}} "gains from sharing" underutilized goods with others. People {{routinely}} share tools, media, gear, electronics, toys, space, and vehicles with relatives, friends, and neighbors, {{and the internet}} is opening up new opportunities to share them with strangers. Drawing {{on the work of}} James Buchanan, Elinor Ostrom, and Yochai Benkler, I develop an economic framework of decentralized sharing. My analysis challenges the implications of simple economic models, which ignore the role of sticky norms and endogenous preferences and, therefore, suggest that people are always sharing at efficient levels. I argue that the online platforms may gradually transform norms and preferences to substantially increase <b>peer-to-peer</b> borrowing and <b>lending.</b> Using data from General Social Survey, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, the online platform NeighborGoods, and my own survey, I estimate the current and potential value of decentralized sharing. I find that today peer-to-peer borrowing is worth at least $ 179 a year for 30 percent of Americans and at least $ 774 for 8 percent of Americans. If the online platforms are able to facilitate high levels of sharing among loosely-tied individuals, the annual benefit to the average household would be modest but significant, perhaps one thousand dollars a year. My analysis suggests that that there are significant gains from sharing tools, media, gear, electronics, toys, pets, vacation homes, and lodging, but the largest gains will likely come from sharing privately-owned vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{economy has}} a huge {{dependence}} on financial services, and this is increasingly based on digital platforms. Innovating new economic models around consumer financial services {{through the use of}} digital technologies is seen as increasingly important in developed economies. There are a number of drivers for this, ranging from national economic factors to the prosaic nature of enabling cheap, speedy and timely interactions for users. The potential for these new digital solutions is that they will allay an over-reliance on the traditional banking sector, which has proved itself to be unstable and risky, and we have seen a number of national policy moves to encourage growth in this sector. Partly {{as a result of the}} 2008 banking crisis, there has been an explosion in peer-to-peer financial services for non-professional consumers. These organisations act as intermediaries between users looking to trade goods or credit. However, building self-sustaining or profitable financial services within this novel space is itself fraught with commercial, regulatory, technical and social problems. This report addresses the mutual shaping of business models and innovations in digital technical infrastructure – both client-facing and administrative back-end – in two retail financial products currently in use in the United Kingdom: <b>peer-to-peer</b> consumer <b>lending</b> and a local digital/paper hybrid currency system. The two products and their issuing firms, Zopa Limited (Zopa) and The Bristol Pound Community Interest Company (the Bristol Pound), respectively, are established leaders in their respective product areas: Zopa was established in 2005 and the Bristol Pound in 2010. Each of these firms seeks to disrupt an established financial market through the application of digital technologies and processes: consumer lending for Zopa and retail payment for the Bristol Pound. Our research has involved teams from Lancaster University examining Zopa and Brunel University focusing on the Bristol Pound over approximately a one-year period from October 2013 to October 2014. Extensive interviews, document analysis, observation of user interactions, and other methods have been employed to develop the process analyses of the firms presented here. This report is comprised of three primary sections: descriptions of the business and technological processes of each of Zopa and the Bristol Pound, and a final analytical section drawing preliminary conclusions from the research presented...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{currencies}} {{are mainly}} {{known for their}} part in illegal activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing. However, {{the purpose of this}} chapter is to explore whether digital currencies could have a potential benefit for countries who are in financial crisis. Since 2007 the global financial crisis has affected many different countries and no more so than Greece where the austerity measures and fiscal issues have caused an enormous social and political upheaval. The global economy has been hit by the lack of trust and confidence the ordinary person has for banks, financial intuitions and in some countries the governing body. Banks were created in the 1400 ’s in Florence to ensure that society could trust that their money or currency at the time, would be safe. Following the global crisis, this trust and confidence in the banks and financial institutions has been eroded. This chapter considers whether a digital, decentralised cryptocurrency where <b>peer-to-peer</b> transactions and <b>lending</b> takes place, could replace the trust and confidence that was once found in banks. The chapter is therefore divided into several parts. The chapter begins by examining what digital currencies are and how they differ from other platform based currencies which could not be used at the present time as a form of currency within countries. The chapter then moves onto explore Bitcoins and how they are the leading digital currency currently and whether they have the potential to act as a States’ currency. This then leads the chapter into discussing the financial crisis and digital currencies {{as an alternative to the}} sovereign currency of a State. In particular, the chapter uses Greece’s tumultuous journey through the financial crisis as an example of a State exploring advantages and disadvantages of a cryptocurrency as an alternative currency. The chapter concludes by opining whether digital currencies have a future in financial crisis management and whether the law or State can intervene...|$|R
