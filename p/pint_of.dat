5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons on the rocks, two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> beer.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001 (the 28th festival) {{it moved}} to Jesus Green {{where it has}} {{remained}} ever since. Since moving to Jesus Green it has grown significantly. The location attracts a lot more passing trade than the football ground. The festival is now the second largest in country in terms of visitors (behind the Great British Beer Festival). In 2006 it had over 170 real ales, 50 ciders and perries {{as well as a}} large range of foreign beers and country wines. 2007 was another record-breaking year, with 30,384 visitors, who drank 494 kilderkins (about 70,000 <b>pints)</b> <b>of</b> beer and 194 tubs (about 7,700 <b>pints)</b> <b>of</b> cider and perry. The 39th festival in 2012 set another new record, with around 41,000 visitors drinking around 560 kilderkins (80,000 <b>pints)</b> <b>of</b> beer and 330 tubs (13,000 <b>pints)</b> <b>of</b> cider.

5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> his blood.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{drinking}} game {{associated with the}} film. The game consists of keeping up, drink for drink, with each alcoholic substance consumed by Withnail {{over the course of}} the film. All told, Withnail is shown drinking roughly nine and a half glasses of red wine, half a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> cider, one shot of lighter fluid (vinegar or overproof rum are common substitutes), two and a half shots of gin, six glasses of sherry, thirteen measures of Scotch whisky and half a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> ale.|$|E
25|$|Food was {{prepared}} by cooks {{drawn from the}} prison ranks. The cooks, one for every 12 prisoners, were paid a small allowance by the British government. The initial daily food ration for each prisoner was 1lb of beef, 1lb of bread, 1lb of potatoes, and 1lb of cabbage or pease. As the majority of prisoners were Roman Catholic, herrings or cod was substituted for beef on Fridays. Each prisoner was also allowed 2oz of soap per week. In November 1797 the British and French governments agreed that each should feed their own citizens in their enemy's prisons. The French provided a daily ration of 1 <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> beer, 8oz of beef or fish, 26oz of bread, 2oz of cheese and 1lb of potato or fresh vegetables. They were also allowed 1lb of soap and 1lb of tobacco per month. Patients in the prison hospital were given a daily ration of 1 <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> tea morning and evening, 16oz of bread, 16oz of beef, mutton or fish, 1 <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> broth, 16oz of green vegetables or potato, and 2 pints of beer.|$|E

25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} {{served with a}} beer engine or handpump, {{which is used to}} siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E
25|$|The Guinness Storehouse is {{a popular}} tourist {{attraction}} at St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin, where a self-guided tour includes {{an account of the}} ingredients used to make the stout and a description of how it is made. Visitors can sample the smells of each Guinness ingredient in the Tasting Rooms, which are coloured with a unique lighting design that emits Guinness' gold and black branding. A <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> Guinness is offered which the visitor may pour after a demonstration by one of the staff. There are videos showing how Guinness is tested by a panel of tasters, and the visitor is instructed in tasting the beer. The tour includes such items as the historical coopering trade within Guinness, a section dedicated to advertising and merchandising by Guinness, and a section dedicated to historical artefacts and footage relating to Guinness. The tour finishes with a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> Guinness (if it has not already been drunk at one of the other bars) in the Gravity Bar. Two other bars, a coffee shop and a restaurant, are available to visitors during the tour, and a range of Guinness merchandise is available to purchase.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} sinking of Lady Elizabeth, Ah Cum, a Chinese steward, was charged with larceny. Ah Cum did plead guilty to {{stealing}} personal affects and cargo from Captain Scott. The items included one pound of corn flour, a pound of tea, two dozen red herrings, two bottles of brandy, two bottle of wine, a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> rum, two cans of jam, and tobacco. Ah Cum had apparently sold the merchandise to other immigrants sailing on Lady Elizabeth. He was sentenced to 3 years gaol.|$|E

25|$|After {{stopping}} at the accident scene, Hugh Smith examined the singer, who was lying {{in the middle of}} the road with obviously severe injuries. He estimated she had lost about a half <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> blood and immediately noted a major traumatic injury to her right arm; it had been almost completely severed at the elbow. He stated that this injury alone did not cause her death. Although the light was poor, he observed only minor head injuries. He attributed her death to extensive and severe crush injuries to the entire right side of her body, consistent with a sideswipe collision.|$|E
25|$|According to Esquire Magazine, a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> Guinness {{should be}} {{served in a}} {{slightly}} tulip shaped pint glass (as opposed to the taller European tulip glass or 'Nonic' glass, which contains a ridge approx 3/4 {{of the way up}} the glass). To begin the pour, the server holds the glass at a 45° angle below the tap and fills the glass 3/4 full. On {{the way out of the}} tap, the beer is forced at high speed through a five-hole disc restrictor plate in the end of the tap, creating friction and forcing the creation of small nitrogen bubbles which form a creamy head. After allowing the initial pour to settle, the server fills the remainder of the glass until the head forms a slight dome over the top of the glass.|$|E

With the help of the life-size patchwork doll named Scraps, Bungle the snobbish Glass Cat (another of Dr. Pipt's creations), the Woozy, Dorothy, the Shaggy Man, and the Scarecrow, Ojo gathers all of these supplies but the left wing – the Tin Woodman, who rules the yellow Winkie Country, which is the only place where yellow butterflies grow, will not allow any living thing to be killed, even to save another's life.|$|E

25|$|A <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> pub beer is famously more {{expensive}} {{in the south}} of England than the north, but supermarket beer prices are very similar. This may be treated as anecdotal evidence in favour of the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis, since supermarket beer is an easily transportable, traded good. (Although pub beer is transportable, the pub itself is not.) The BS-hypothesis explanation for the price differentials is that the 'productivity' of pub employees (in pints served per hour) is more uniform than the 'productivity' (in foreign currency earned per year) of people working in the dominant tradable sector in each region of the country (financial services {{in the south of}} England, manufacturing in the north). Although the employees of southern pubs are not significantly more productive than their counterparts in the north, the pubs must pay wages comparable to those offered by other southern firms in order to keep their staff. This results in southern pubs incurring a higher labour cost per pint served.|$|E
25|$|The highwayman Dick Turpin {{used the}} Swan Inn at Woughton-on-the-Green in Buckinghamshire as his base. Jamaica Inn near Bolventor in Cornwall gave {{its name to}} a 1936 novel by Daphne du Maurier and a 1939 film {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock. In the 1920s John Fothergill (1876–1957) was the innkeeper of the Spread Eagle in Thame, Berkshire, and published his autobiography: An Innkeeper's Diary (London: Chatto & Windus, 1931). During his idiosyncratic occupancy many famous people came to stay, such as H. G. Wells. United States president George W. Bush fulfilled his lifetime ambition of visiting a 'genuine British pub' during his November 2003 state visit to the UK when he had lunch and a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> non-alcoholic lager (Bush being a teetotaler) with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the Dun Cow pub in Sedgefield, County Durham in Blair's home constituency. There were approximately 53,500 public houses in 2009 in the United Kingdom. This number has been declining every year, so that {{nearly half of the}} smaller villages no longer have a local pub.|$|E

By 20:00 the battalion had occupied Béja, and the section took over a small twenty-bed hospital in the garrison school and a part of the larger 250-bed civil hospital. The town was attacked by a squadron of German Stukas on 20 November, and Lieutenant Charles Rob in command on the surgical team carried out over 150 operations during which he suffered a fractured tibia and kneecap caused by a bomb exploding nearby. Continuing to operate he carried out another twenty-two operation the next day, even giving a <b>pint</b> <b>of</b> blood to save a wounded soldier.
