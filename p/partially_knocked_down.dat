40|$|Apoptosis is a {{hallmark}} event observed upon infection with many viral pathogens, including influenza A virus. The apoptotic process is executed by a proteolytic system {{consisting of a}} family of cysteinyl proteases, termed caspases. Since the consequences of apoptosis induction and caspase activation for the outcome of an influenza virus infection are not clear, we have addressed this issue by interfering with expression or function of a major virus-induced apoptosis effector, caspase  3. Surprisingly, influenza virus propagation was strongly impaired in the presence of an inhibitor that blocks caspase  3 and in cells where caspase  3 was <b>partially</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> by small interfering RNAs. Consistent with these findings, poor replication efficiencies of influenza A viruses in cells deficient for caspase  3 could be boosted 30 -fold by ectopic expression of the protein. Mechanistically, the block in virus propagation appeared to be due to retention of the viral RNP complexes in the nucleus, preventing formation of progeny virus particles. Our findings indicate that caspase  3 activation during the onset of apoptosis is a crucial event for efficient influenza virus propagation...|$|E

40|$|Bcl- 2 {{inhibitor}} of transcription (Bit 1) is a mitochondrial {{protein that}} {{functions as a}} peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, but, when released into the cytoplasm, it elicits apoptosis. The proapoptotic function is uniquely counteracted by integrin-mediated cell attachment. We generated a conditional KO mouse of the Bit 1 gene by using the Cre-LoxP recombination system. Bit 1 -null mice were born alive but with some developmental abnormalities. They developed a runting syndrome after birth and died within the first 2 weeks. Cultured fibroblasts from the Bit 1 -null embryos [mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) ] were more resistant to cell death induced by loss of attachment to extracellular matrix (anoikis) than cells from the wild-type or heterozygous littermates. MEFs and tissues from Bit 1 KO mice displayed a marked increase in Erk phosphorylation. <b>Knocking</b> <b>down</b> Bit 1 expression in cultured cells resulted in increased Erk activation, and <b>partially</b> <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> Erk reversed the increased anoikis resistance of Bit 1 knockdown. The enhanced Erk activation was associated with decreased Erk phosphatase activity. These studies establish the physiological significance of Bit 1 activity and begin to delineate a Bit 1 signaling pathway that acts through Erk regulation...|$|R
50|$|Wodehed {{the magician}} {{comes up with}} a {{solution}} to the problem of the dragonfly: they must journey to the Forest of Lost Birds and retrieve a secret herb, known as Shatter from the goddess Sessile's garden. Sessile is a sentient tree, and in her roots another dimension resides. On their way to the forest, they run into, and escape, a group of birds who are obsessed with the idea of returning home to their island via a ship of Braeburns, and then are attacked by Rosencrass and Guildenswine, who, upon revealing that they have murdered one of the birds, are imprisoned in the trees of the Forest of Lost Birds. The weasels retrieve the herb, return to Castle Storm, and destroy the dragonfly, whereupon it shatters into small, harmless dragonflies. Torca Marda, furious at this loss of chaos, attempts to kill Sylver, but is scared off by Scirf, pretending to be an animal dying from the mange, and falls over a cliff to his death. His priests, attempting to shatter the squirrels into pieces with the herb, are themselves turned into minuscule stoats by the same herb and Welkin is free of the evil of Torca Marda. The next day Lord Ragnar is killed in battle with the rats, and Prince Poynt promises to elect Sylver to a lord if he defeats the rats, thus fulfilling the mole coven's prophecy. Lord Haukin tells Sylver and the weasels to <b>partially</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the sea walls, allowing a bore to flood to Castle Rayn and destroy the rat hordes, along with the effigy, although Lord Flaggatis escapes, along with most of the rats.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Breastfeeding {{by human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -positive mothers is an unavoidable practice in some very poor countries. It {{has been suggested that}} long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) in breast milk, such as arachidonic acid, act as natural, protective ingredients against HIV transmission. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the protective mechanism of LC-PUFAs in cells susceptible to HIV infection (e. g. human CD 4 + T cells, HeLa cells). Results: LC-PUFAs are bioactive molecules capable of activating the cellular protective machinery via modulation of endogenous background K + or KCNK channels. KCNK channel expression contributes significantly to the stability of the cell membrane potential. During HIV- 1 infection, degradation of the KCNK channel is accelerated, and the cell membrane potential becomes pathologically depolarized. From studying functionally distinct KCNK mutants, we found that the degree of membrane potential depolarization was directly proportional to the release efficiency of HIV- 1 virions. On the other hand, supplementation of KCNK channel modulators such as arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at micromolar doses could restore hyperpolarization and stability of the cell membrane potential when endogenous KCNK channels are <b>partially</b> <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> (mimicking the depolarized state of an HIV- 1 -infected cell). Conclusion: The protective mechanism of LC-PUFAs against HIV spread involves stimulation of the endogenous KCNK channels. Our work suggests that supplementation with AA and DHA may be beneficial in reducing the risk of HIV- 1 transmission, particularly during the period of breastfeeding...|$|E
40|$|We {{sought to}} {{determine}} how the Src Family Kinases, Fyn and Yes, are involved in early vertebrate development. Using morpholinos we <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> Fyn and Yes and found that the resultant phenotype bore striking similarities to Wnt 11 and Wnt 5 mutant zebrafish. Further analysis proved that Fyn/Yes morphants have defective CE cell movements during gastrulation which required the small GTPase RhoA. However, Fyn and Yes are not linear components of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Instead they appear to act in parallel converging on or upstream of RhoA. This led to the question what is upstream of Fyn and Yes? Previous research in Xenopus and the mouse has identified the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) as a key regulator of vertebrate gastrulation. Csk phosphorylates the inhibitory tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail of SFKs leading to inactivation. Using a morpholino’s, we <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> Csk during early zebrafish development and found that disruption of Csk results in defective gastrulation cell movements. Importantly, we were able to rescue the Csk morphants by <b>partially</b> <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> Fyn and Yes, indicating that Csk is directly upstream of these two SFKs. We next {{sought to determine}} what is upstream of Csk. The most promising candidate was Shp 2, as Shp 2 negatively regulates Csk by dephosphorylating the membrane bound adaptor protein PAG 1. Csk is now no longer targeted to the plasma membrane and cannot inhibit membrane bound SFKs. We were able to demonstrate that Shp 2 was necessary for CE cell movements during zebrafish gastrulation. These results are consistent with data from Xenopus and mouse. In addition, we show that Shp 2 is upstream of Fyn and Yes by epigenetic analyses. Moreover, Shp 2 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> was rescued by active RhoA, placing Shp 2 in a pathway parallel to non-canonical Wnt signalling. Our data, together with biochemical data, suggest a model which sees Shp 2 negatively regulate Csk, the inhibitor of Fyn and Yes which in turn act upstream of RhoA in gastrulation cell movements. Because of Shp 2 ’s involvement in early embryonic development we sought to determine whether the defects associated with human Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome (NS/LS) which are caused by activating and dominant negative mutations in Shp 2, respectively, are also caused by defective gastrulation cell movements. Both NS and LS patients present with overlapping symptoms, including short stature, hypertelorism and heart defects. We noticed that some of these features were also present in Shp 2 morphants. Here we show that zebrafish expressing either NS or LS mutated Shp 2 develop defects that bear striking similarities to NS/LS patients, in that they are shorter, their eyes are spaced wider apart and they develop heart defects. Furthermore, we found that some of these defects were due to defective gastrulation. In conclusion, we identified a novel signalling pathway involving Shp 2, Csk, Fyn/Yes and RhoA that acts in parallel to non-canonical Wnt signalling in gastrulation cell movements. Our data suggest {{that at least some of}} the symptoms in human NS and LS patients are caused by disruption of the Shp 2 -Csk-Fyn/Yes-RhoA signalling pathway and result from gastrulation cell movement defects...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGLUT 4 {{trafficking}} to {{the plasma}} membrane of muscle and fat cells is regulated by insulin. An {{important component of}} insulin-regulated GLUT 4 distribution is the Akt substrate AS 160 rab GTPase-activating protein. Here we show that Rab 10 functions as a downstream target of AS 160 in the insulin-signaling pathway that regulates GLUT 4 translocation in adipocytes. Overexpression of a mutant of Rab 10 defective for GTP hydrolysis increased GLUT 4 {{on the surface of}} basal adipocytes. Rab 10 knockdown resulted in an attenuation of insulin-induced GLUT 4 redistribution to the plasma membrane and a concomitant 2 -fold decrease in GLUT 4 exocytosis rate. Re-expression of a wild-type Rab 10 restored normal GLUT 4 translocation. The basal increase in plasma-membrane GLUT 4 due to AS 160 knockdown was <b>partially</b> blocked by <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> Rab 10 in the same cells, further indicating that Rab 10 is a target of AS 160 and a positive regulator of GLUT 4 trafficking to the cell surface upon insulin stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Completion of genome {{duplication}} {{is challenged}} by structural and topological barriers that impede progression of replication forks. Although this can seriously undermine genome integrity, {{the fate of}} DNA with unresolved replication intermediates is not known. Here, we show that mild replication stress increases the frequency of chromosomal lesions that are transmitted to daughter cells. Throughout G 1, these lesions are sequestered in nuclear compartments marked by p 53 -binding protein 1 (53 BP 1) and other chromatin-associated genome caretakers. We show {{that the number of}} such 53 BP 1 nuclear bodies increases after genetic ablation of BLM, a DNA helicase associated with dissolution of entangled DNA. Conversely, 53 BP 1 nuclear bodies are <b>partially</b> suppressed by <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> SMC 2, a condensin subunit required for mechanical stability of mitotic chromosomes. Finally, we provide evidence that 53 BP 1 nuclear bodies shield chromosomal fragile sites sequestered in these compartments against erosion. Together, these data indicate that restoration of DNA or chromatin integrity at loci prone to replication problems requires mitotic transmission to the next cell generation...|$|R

50|$|The {{rules of}} this game are {{slightly}} more complicated than the European version. Each bowler will roll the ball twice in each frame regardless {{of the number of}} pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> on each roll. When a bowler’s turn is completed, the next bowler will not receive a “Full House” to bowl at: rather, the next bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the pins that were left by the previous bowler. For example, if the first bowler is only able to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> seven pins, the second bowler must attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining two pins. Should the second bowler be unsuccessful in <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> both of these pins in the allotted two rolls, the third bowler will attempt to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining pins. This will continue until the remaining pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> or {{until the end of the}} frame.

40|$|Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) {{regulate}} {{virtually all}} biological processes. PTKs phosphorylate substrates in a sequence-specific manner and relatively short peptide sequences determine selectivity. Here, we developed {{new technology to}} determine PTK activity profiles using peptide arrays. The zebrafish is an excellent model system to investigate signaling in the whole organism, given its wealth of genetic tools, including morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> technology. We used zebrafish embryo lysates to determine PTK activity profiles, thus providing the unique opportunity to directly compare the effect of protein <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> on PTK activity profiles {{on the one hand}} and phenotypic changes on the other. Methodology. We used multiplex arrays of 144 distinct peptides, spotted on a porous substrate, allowing the sample to be pumped up and down, optimizing reaction kinetics. Kinase reactions were performed using complex zebrafish embryo lysates or purified kinases. Peptide phosphorylation was detected by fluorescent anti-phosphotyrosine antibody binding and the porous chips allowed semi-continuous recording of the signal. We used morpholinos to <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> protein expression in the zebrafish embryos and subsequently, we determined the effects on the PTK activity profiles. Results and Conclusion. Reproducible PTK activity profiles were derived from one-day-old zebrafiish embryos. Morpholino-mediated <b>knock</b> <b>downs</b> of the Src family kinases, Fyn and Yes, induced characteristic phenotypes and distinct changes in the PTK activity profiles. Interestingly, the peptide substrates that were less phosphorylated upon Fyn and Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> were preferential substrates of purified Fyn and Yes. Previously, we demonstrated that Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> phenocopied Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> Interestingly, Wnt 11 <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> induced similar changes in the PTK activity profile as Fyn/Yes <b>knock</b> <b>down.</b> The control Nacre/Mitfa <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> did not affect the PTK activity profile significantly.

40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) {{is known}} to {{regulate}} definitive myelopoiesis but its role in vertebrate primitive myelopoiesis remains unclear. Here we report that zebrafish primitive myelopoiesis is restricted by RA in a dose dependent manner mainly before 11 hpf (hours post fertilization) when anterior hemangioblasts are initiated to form. RA treatment significantly reduces expressions of anterior hemangioblast markers scl, lmo 2, gata 2 and etsrp in the rostral end of ALPM (anterior lateral plate mesoderm) of the embryos. The result indicates that RA restricts primitive myelopoiesis by suppressing formation of anterior hemangioblasts. Analyses of ALPM formation suggest that the defective primitive myelopoiesis resulting from RA treatment before late gastrulation may be secondary to global loss of cells for ALPM fate whereas the developmental defect resulting from RA treatment during 10 – 11 hpf should be due to ALPM patterning shift. Overexpressions of scl and lmo 2 partially rescue the block of primitive myelopoiesis in the embryos treated with 250 nM RA during 10 – 11 hpf, suggesting RA acts upstream of scl to control primitive myelopoiesis. However, the RA treatment blocks the increased primitive myelopoiesis caused by overexpressing gata 4 / 6 whereas the abolished primitive myelopoiesis in gata 4 / 5 / 6 depleted embryos is well rescued by 4 -diethylamino-benzaldehyde, a retinal dehydrogenase inhibitor, or <b>partially</b> rescued by <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> aldh 1 a 2, the major retinal dehydrogenase gene {{that is responsible for}} RA synthesis during early development.
