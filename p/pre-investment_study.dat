40|$|Two outline {{schemes for}} {{the course of the}} 2 nd track on the railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice for {{estimating}} the land market value of the individual corridor or territory are presented and analyzed in the Bachelor degree. A relevant legislation in the area of acquisition of real estates for the public interest is analyzed. A surface analysis of the land use in the area defined is {{made on the basis of}} the applicable spatial implementation acts and a type of use according to the cadastral classification on the basis of information of land cadastre is formed. Land prices, contractual and advertised land price, were analyzed for the purpose of estimating the land market value planned for the purchase inside and the remaining surface outside the defined corridor. The analysis represents the baseline for land classifications for the purpose of estimating the land within a framework of the <b>pre-investment</b> <b>study.</b> All land is evaluated with the method of direct price comparison of similar real estates. For this purpose the currently available information about the functioning of the real estate market is used. In the conclusion of the Bachelor degree we found out that we lack a suitable number of specified types of data to formulate the right evaluation methodology, especially information on contractual land prices at some stage of land development. On the basis of the estimated land market value for the potential construction of the public railway infrastructure on two different variants we found out that the most favorable variant of the planned route is next to the existing railway line. The second variant would require a purchase of more surface land, which would be more expensive. In the process of acquiring land for the construction of the 2 nd track on the railway line Ljubljana-Jesenice a more detailed separate estimation of land will be required, which would be carried out by the competent experts - appraiser...|$|E
40|$|Slovenia has for {{the last}} two decades a {{positive}} trend in constructing and renovating of small hydro power plants. Renovated ones are often those left behind by industries that shot down lately. Governmental implementation of support scheme was a reason that many of them had been eligible for the last years, even those with poor optimization and efficiency. This scheme stopped in 2015 and was substituted with a new one based on an auction. A new method of support brings large uncertainty between design engineers. Multiplying this with uncertainties of hydrological conditions makes investment in a small hydro power plant like Osolin a risky investment. To avoid potentially poor solutions, there is a necessity of making <b>pre-investment</b> <b>studies.</b> In <b>pre-investment</b> <b>studies</b> we introduce and check different solutions. If the solutions meet obligated requirements, the last step is to propose the best one...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} (Wells, 1974; MacMillan, 1985, 1987; Shepherd, 1999) {{has focused}} on examining VCs' decision making at the <b>pre-investment</b> stage. Few <b>studies</b> have investigated VCs' financing decisions at the post-investment stage, and the differences between investment and reinvestment. Some scholars claimed that VCs {{are more likely to}} provide a venture with initial funding than subsequent financing (Dean & Guglierano, 1990). Others argued the opposite (Ryan, 1994; Guler, 2003). My dissertation seeks to answer this question empirically. I surveyed 40 VCs either in person or over the phone, and asked them to assess how some new incremental information will affect the likelihood that they will invest in a venture at the pre-investment vs. post-investment stage. The results have demonstrated that VCs assess the same positive information more positively at the post-investment stage compared to the pre-investment stage and hence, are more likely to provide a venture with additional than with initial funding...|$|R
40|$|A capital {{investment}} appraisal {{is a means}} of ensuring value for money. It is not meant to provide an indication of profit or loss, but rather a comparison of costs in relation to those areas where there is an opportunity or an inclination for change. The decision to invest in a project is based on the expectation of future returns since a rational investor does not expect to incur loss on his capital outlay. This decision making is usually hinged on advice obtained during <b>pre-investment</b> appraisal. This <b>study</b> is aimed at evaluating the mode of practicing investment viability appraisal by Estate Surveyors and Valuers in Lagos metropolis. The data for the study was obtained by randomly administering structured questionnaires on eighty-seven (87) practicing Estate Surveyors and Valuers in the study area and the findings were analyzed through descriptive statistical tools such as the Likert scale to present the result. Findings revealed that the payback period is the most adopted appraisal technique in practice as evidenced with a mean score of 3. 57. The objective (s) of the investor is also the most significant factor being considered while selecting appraisal technique with a mean score of 3. 83 while the problems of actual return varying from the expected return and also difficulty in the repayment of loans always result when a wrong viability technique is employed. The success of any viability study goes beyond knowing the objective (s) of the investor; therefore, it was recommended that appraisers should ensure that they are equipped with adequate knowledge required for the execution of feasibility and on viability studies because knowing the right viability criteria for a particular objective will help in advising an investor on a course of action that will best achieve the developer’s objective...|$|R
40|$|The first essay of my {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the incubation stage [...] the period between introduction of a technological change and its first commercialization [...] of an industry, which is an understudied phenomenon. It examines firms' technological investments in a nascent industry in anticipation of commercialization, and contributes novel insights to the classic industry evolution literature that conceptualizes industry formation from the first instance of product. Using the agricultural biotechnology industry as the empirical context, this essay documents not only {{the extent to which}} firms undertake technological investments in anticipation of entry, but also the heterogeneity in types of entrants and their modes of value capture. I thus shed light on the intertwined processes of economic value capture at the firm-level and ecosystem development at the industry-level that underpin incubation of nascent industries. The second essay examines the capability antecedents of a firm market entry into a nascent industry. A firm's technical capabilities and complementary assets, at time of entry, have been consistently noted as key determinants of the likelihood of entry. Drawing on the premise that firms make deliberate decisions regarding technological investments well before they enter nascent markets, I make a distinction between a firm's pre-entry and <b>pre-investment</b> capabilities and <b>study</b> the type of pre-investment capabilities that are related to the likelihood of firm entry. I suggest that a firm's pre-investment reconfiguration experiences are the critical capability: these experiences shape the firm's development of pre-entry technical capabilities and complementary assets, which in turn affect the likelihood of entry. I find empirical support for the mediating role of pre-entry capabilities to the relationship between pre-investment experiences and the likelihood of entry {{in the context of the}} population of firms that conducted R&D investments in agricultural biotechnology between 1980 and 2010. The third essay studies the reconfiguration strategies pursued by firms in anticipation of entry into a nascent industry. Whether entry to a nascent industry is undertaken by de novo startups, diversifying firms from related industries or industry incumbents from the obsolescing industry, a critical strategic action for firms is to achieve the required configuration of capabilities for operations in the new industry. The choice, timing, and sequence of these capability reconfiguration mechanisms may, however, differ across different types of firms. I provide theoretical propositions that link firm types to the underlying sources of heterogeneity and suggest how this heterogeneity leads to differential paths undertaken by de novo startups, diversifying firms and industry incumbents while reconfiguring themselves in anticipation of entry into a nascent industry. Implications of the model are discussed using three firm case studies from the agricultural biotechnology industry...|$|R
