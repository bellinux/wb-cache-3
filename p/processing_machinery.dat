5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA <b>processing</b> <b>machinery.</b> However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E

25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as plastic, glass, or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used.

The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more <b>processing</b> <b>machinery</b> will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E

Cleaning of the process equipment is crucial {{to meet the demands}} for fish quality, but also environmental issues and human safety must be taken into consideration. Design of Easy-to-clean fish <b>processing</b> <b>machineries</b> is an efficient and innovative perspective which could be a game changer in the Aquaculture Industry. Based on the generic hygienic design principles stated by EHEDG and experience collected in a in a research project in the Norwegian Aquaculture Industry, this paper presents four specific design concepts for state of the art fish <b>processing</b> <b>machineries,</b> which is an attempt to interpret EHEDG guidelines to actionable design changes suiting the Norwegian Aquaculture Industry and the type of Original Equipment Manufacturers serving this industry. The development of the design concepts is done by extensive prototyping work, and continuous testing and evaluation in real industrial environment, and there have been numerous iterations {{in the development of the}} design concepts. The design concepts have been implemented into several industrial applications for fish <b>processing</b> <b>machineries,</b> and have been under operation at fish processing factories for more than 6 months. The Hygienic design concepts implemented on fish processing is expected to reduce the risk for Listeria monocytogenes and other bacterial contamination in the fish processing factories, reduce the demanding cleaning work in the fish processing factories, reduce usage of chemicals and water in the cleaning process. The experience collected after over 6 months support the expectations. The paper also elaborates future research work in the area of hygienic design principles and concepts...|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleolus}} {{is a large}} nuclear domain {{generated by}} the act of building ribosomes. It illustrates the compartmentation of the nuclear functions, since {{it is in the}} nucleolus that transcription of the ribosomal genes, maturation and processing of the 47 S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) into 18 S, 5. 8 S and 28 S rRNA, and almost complete assembly of the 40 S and 60 S ribosome subunits take place. The shape, size and organization of the nucleoli vary with their activity. Nuleolar activity is a cell cycle dependent-process. In electron microscopy, the nucleolus exhibits three main components: fibrillar centers (FCs), a dense fibrillar component (DFC) and a granular component (GC) corresponding to different steps of ribosome biogenesis. The steady state between transcription, processing and export of ribosomal subunits engenders this organization. Conversely, inactivation or blockage of one of these processes modifies the organization of the nucleolus and ultimately induces nucleolar disassembly. The nucleolus is also a plurifunctional domain, a key partner of chromatin architecture in the nucleus and it plays a crucial role in several cellular functions in addition to ribosome production. The nucleolus is assembled at the end of mitosis, is active during interphase, and disassembled in prophase. The nucleolar transcription and <b>processing</b> <b>machineries</b> are inherited from parental to daughter cells through mitosis. The polymerase I (pol I) transcription machinery is repressed during mitosis although assembled with ribosomal genes. Repression of pol I transcription is achieved at the end of prophase and is maintained during mitosis through phosphorylation of transcription factors by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1. The nucleolar <b>processing</b> <b>machineries</b> relocalize from the nucleolus towards the periphery of all chromosomes until telophase and this chromosome association depends on CDK 1 activity. As a consequence of natural inhibition of CDK 1 activity, pol I transcription is restored in telophase. The <b>processing</b> <b>machineries</b> are recruited to the sites of rDNA transcription after a temporary transit in foci known as prenucleolar bodies. In conclusion, the behavior of the nucleolus illustrates the fact that the dynamics of nuclear organization are integrated in a network of interactions and controls that is largely dependent on the coordination of cell cycle controls...|$|R
