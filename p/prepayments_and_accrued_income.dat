40|$|Government {{accounting}} {{and other financial}} management practices have in recent times {{become one of the}} major target areas of public management reform. Public sector organisations traditionally use accounting systems based on cash inflows and cash outflows, commonly known as cash accounting. This cash style of accounting differs significantly from accounting systems used in the private sector, so called accrual accounting systems. The recent reforms to government accounting systems have focused largely on implementing accrual accounting in the public sector. The exponents of accrual accounting argue that it provides significantly more detailed and accurate financial information than cash systems. One of the basic principles of {{accounting and}} financial reporting is that it should provide a true and fair view of the financial operations and financial position of an entity. Given that cash accounting records cash transactions only, no consideration is given to assets and liabilities or to items extending beyond the accounting period (i. e. <b>prepayments</b> <b>and</b> <b>accrued</b> expenses). Accrual accounting on the other hand produces detailed information on assets and liabilities and requires depreciation expenses to be matched to the expected life of the related asset. Similarly, accruing expenses such as employee entitlements are represented in the financial reports. Countries with a Westminster style of government have tended to be the leaders in implementing accrual accounting in the public sector.

It is argued that in the interpretation and application of the rules, a clear distinction should be made between conceptual and practical issues. While there may be overlap between them, distinct issues exist regarding the normative questions of how and where profits arising from e-commerce should best be taxed {{as a matter of}} principle, as well as how such taxes should be implemented.

40|$|Observed {{mortgage}} <b>prepayment</b> <b>and</b> default {{rates have}} been far different than the ruthless option exercise rates predicted by contingent claims models of mortgage pricing. The discrepancies {{have been attributed to}} both the competing-risk nature of <b>prepayment</b> <b>and</b> default and to transactions costs. This paper tries a different means of reconciliation. We introduce a third stochastic process, household income, into the usual pricing model that includes only the spot interest rate and the house price. The presence of income allows considering consumption-theoretic determinants of termination. The role of mortgage underwriting rules in restricting optimal prepayment is also explicitly modeled.

Although IS employees accounted for a very small share of total employment by 1986, IS employment growth is estimated to have made a larger contribution to 1976 - 86 output growth than non-IS employment, due to the very rapid growth (16 % per annum) of IS employment. The estimated marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between IS and non-IS employees, evaluated at the sample mean, is 6 : one IS employee can be substituted for six non-IS employees without affecting output. ...|$|R

Yet the definition and measurement of household enterprise ROA remain inconsistent or unclear. We illustrate potential measurement problems with examples from various surveys. We {{take advantage of a}} detailed household survey and analyze what matters and for whom. The three issues that matter most for measurement of household enterprise ROA are the choice of accrual versus cash income, the treatment of household labor in enterprise income, and the treatment of non-factor income. This sensitivity matters most for a poorer region dominated by cultivation relative to a richer region with non-farm enterprises. Though the choice between <b>accrued</b> <b>and</b> cash <b>income</b> matters less when the frequency of the data declines, there remains high sensitivity in annualized data.

Poisson regression for grouped survival data has several advantages over partial likelihood methods.

Second, {{it is possible to}} estimate full-hazard models which include, for example, functions of time as well as multiple time scales (i. e., age of the loan and calendar time), in a much more straightforward manner than partial likelihood methods for un-grouped data. Third, Poisson regression can be used to estimate non-proportional hazards models such as additive excess risk specifications.

40|$|Option theory {{which has}} {{dominated}} residential mortgage <b>prepayment</b> <b>and</b> default research implies that a borrower will exercise prepayment or default options if the call option or put option, respectively, is "in the money " by some optimal amount.

In view of this, we assess the vulnerability of Philippine households to an exogenous shock {{in the form of}} a five-percent decline in remittances. We utilize a spatial computable general equilibrium model based on a five-region social accounting matrix. A three-level production function is specified, namely, Cobb-Douglas between labor and capital to produce value added; then Leontief between non-transport inputs and value added to produce output net of transport, which is then combined with transport inputs at the third level, using again a Cobb-Douglas production function. Capital <b>and</b> labor <b>incomes</b> <b>accrue</b> to the households who then allocate these to consumption and savings with a constant marginal propensity to consume. Overseas remittances enter as transfer payments to households. Consumption is allocated among different commodities, using a Cobb-Douglas utility function.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{coverage}} under employer-sponsored pension plans has shifted from traditional defined benefit to 401 (k) -type defined contribution formats. This shift has many important implications for retirement security. This brief examines the differential impact of the transition for men and women. For women, the shift from defined benefit to 401 (k) plans is a “good news/ bad news” story. When women are employed <b>and</b> <b>accruing</b> retirement <b>income</b> benefits, the news is good. 401 (k) plans are better for short-tenured workers, and {{women are more likely}} than men to have short tenures. Therefore, more women are likely to end up with more benefits and their benefits are likely to be larger when they have a 401 (k) plan rather than a traditional defined benefit plan. The bad news arrives when women retire. As women tend to live longer than men, their 401 (k) balances must provide an income stream over a longer stretch of time. Should they wish to annuitize a portion of their 401 (k) accumulations at retirement, they will find that insurance companies compensate by providing smaller benefits to women, and larger benefits to men. In defined benefit plans, men and women with comparable work histories would get the same monthly benefit. Women who rely on their husband’s earnings and pension benefits are also affected by the shift from defined benefit plans to 401 (k) s. Under traditional defined benefit plans, the government requires that the worker receive a joint-and-survivor annuity at retirement, unless the spouse specifically waives the requirement. This provision gives the wife a legal claim on her husband’s pension benefit. No such automatic claim exists with 401 (k) plans. At this point, it is unclear whether the good news or bad news will carry the day. But the outcome is extremely important because women have not done well in our retirement income system. Among elderly women without a husband, more than one in four is poor or near poor. Among single women age 85 and over, the figure approaches one in three. To date, elderly women have relied heavily on Social Security, but in the future Social Security will replace a far smaller share of pre-retirement earnings than it does at present. Fortunately, women’s labor force participation, earnings, and participation in employer plans have all increased significantly over the past three decades. Their retirement income security thus will depend increasingly on 401 (k) plans, so it matters a lot whether the good news in the accumulation of benefits sufficiently outweighs the bad news in the payout of benefits. 401 (k), Women, shift, defined-benefit, defined-contribution...|$|R
