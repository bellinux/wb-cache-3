40|$|The {{construction}} business, {{like any}} other business, is risky. However, construction projects are perceived to have more inherent risks due to the involvement of many contracting parties such as owners, designers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. Construction projects are unique and built only once. During the bidding stage contractor is facing {{a greater risk of}} having mistakes in <b>pricing</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> and preparing project schedule, due to lack of details about site, client, construction drawings, etc. It is a tiresome exercise for the Quantity surveyors to accurately <b>price</b> a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> which normally comprises over two hundred measured work items. Contractor’s risk exposure to have errors (mistakes) commences with the receipt of tender and in order to arrive at a commercially viable and competitive tender price, the tenders often adopt rule of thumb and various guesswork within the restricted time frame available for submission of duly completed tender. This research discusses about the risk areas in the construction industry and what are the errors happened to contractors and their importance and contribution in a dispute case. Also it discuss what are the procedures to be followed to minimize disputes. To collect data, an industry – wide survey was undertaken covering roads and building projects. From the survey and the data analysis, it is identified the importance of each bidding error, made by contractors, and their relationship to dispute case, at the post contract stage. By this research it is expected to establish a relationship between risks in the construction industry and mistakes of contractors at the bidding stage. Then those relationships are justified by analyzing some case studies in construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Determining a fair {{margin of}} risk that forms {{a part of}} mark-up in a bid is a crucial issue when <b>pricing</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> at a tender. The results {{indicates}} that risk is not adequately priced by almost all the local contracting firms but they often use experience, intuition, rule of thumb or guesswork. However, in the present day context of competitive business environment, it is time a new emphasis placed on identifying and assessing risk factor as precise as possible. Hence, the thesis is aimed to examine closely and objectively the risk factor involved in pricing construction projects and to propose a way of assigning a monetary value to the risk factor so as {{to arrive at a}} reasonable margin of risk and a contingency sum. At this exercise, various risk management techniques such as risk premium, sensitivity testing, monte-carlo simulation, utility theory, risk adjusted discount rate and expected monetary value etc have been commentated including their relative merits, demerits and practical limitations. Further, the contractual provisions as to apportionment of risk in tender and contract documents have also been discussed with special emphasis on ICTAD Conditions of Contract Revised in January 1989, conditions by which most of local building contract are governed. A statistical approach, one that is already developed, to decide on the sum of contingency allocation supported with a worked example extracted from building schedule' of rates is also suggested for the quantity surveyors to adopt in their pre-tender pricing exercises. The research concludes with a proposal of guidelines and recommendations on how to cope with the risk factor. It is the author's belief that these guidelines will benefit both construction contracting and consultancy firms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Preliminary cost {{estimates}} for construction projects {{are often the}} basis of financial feasibility and budgeting decisions {{in the early stages}} of planning and for effective project control, monitoring and execution. The purpose of this paper is to identify and better understand the cost drivers and factors that contribute to the accuracy of estimates in residential construction projects from the developers’ perspective. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a literature review to determine the drivers that affect the accuracy of developers’ early stage {{cost estimates}} and the factors influencing the construction costs of residential construction projects. It used cost variance data and other supporting documentation collected from two case study projects in South East Queensland, Australia, along with semi-structured interviews conducted with the practitioners involved. Findings – It is found that many cost drivers or factors of cost uncertainty identified in the literature for large-scale projects are not as apparent and relevant for developers’ small-scale residential construction projects. Specifically, the certainty and completeness of project-specific information, suitability of historical cost data, contingency allowances, methods of estimating and the estimator’s level of experience significantly affect the accuracy of cost estimates. Developers of small-scale residential projects use pre-established and suitably <b>priced</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> as the prime estimating method, which is considered to be the most efficient and accurate method for standard house designs. However, this method needs to be backed with the expertise and experience of the estimator. Originality/value – There is a lack of research on the accuracy of developers’ early stage cost estimates and the relevance and applicability of cost drivers and factors in the residential construction projects. This research has practical significance for improving the accuracy of such preliminary cost estimates...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} proposition is {{that the}} accuracy of the designer's tender price forecasts is positively correlated with the amount of information available for that project. The paper describes an empirical study of the effects <b>of</b> the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> information available on practicing Quantity Surveyors' forecasting accuracy. The methodology involved the surveyors repeatedly revising tender price forecasts on receipt of chunks of project information. Each of twelve surveyors undertook two projects and selected information chunks from a total of sixteen information types. The analysis indicated marked differences in accuracy between different project types and experts/non-experts. The expert surveyors' forecasts were not found to be significantly improved by information other than that of basic building type and size, even after eliminating project type effects. The expert surveyors' forecasts based on the knowledge of building type and size alone were, however, found to be of similar accuracy to that of average practitioners <b>pricing</b> full <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{documented}} {{of an investigation}} into current cost estimating practices of contractors for construction projects. A questionnaire survey of contractors was undertaken, in which the respondents are classified into four groups based on their turnover namely: very small, small, medium and large firms. The survey indicates that contractors, irrespective of size, continue to undertake cost estimating predominantly for construction planning purposes, including the preparation of tenders and cost control of projects during the execution stage and, to a lesser extent, for construction project evaluation. Recent developments in cost estimating methods and tools that consider risks and variability in cost estimates, {{such as the use of}} range estimating and parametric estimating techniques, have not been adopted by contractors. The practice of cost estimating does not differ from conventional techniques based on the use of labour and material constants to obtain <b>prices</b> for <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> items on an item by item basis. The study shows that the major causes of inaccuracy in cost estimating continue to be the lack of practical knowledge of the construction process by those responsible for the estimating function, insufficient time to prepare cost estimates, poor tender documentation and the wide variability of subcontractors' prices.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{execution}} of a public tender {{in the field of}} construction. The analysis starts by the identification of the need for investment by the customer, and ends with the preparation of the offer by the bidder. It presents the legislation concerning public procurement, and it analyses in detail the provisions that {{have a significant impact on}} the determination of the selling price. The thesis specifically {{deals with the}} estimated value of the public tender that may be published on the procurement portal. A questionnaire and statistical analysis are used to verify the impact of published estimates on the act of fixing the <b>prices</b> by suppliers. <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> (BoQ) is an essential part of the tender documentation and the basis for costing of construction works. In the thesis, the composition <b>of</b> a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> is analyzed and the deficiencies that affect the quality of it are evidenced. The traditional method of construction cost estimation, presented in the Slovenian literature, is based on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities.</b> In this method the calculation of the tender price is based on calculation of cost for each item in the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities.</b> In the thesis the method is presented on a case study.

In the conclusion the advantages of the non-traditional method are exposed, and consequently reasons are obtained, for why alternatives to the traditional way of construction cost estimation are used...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{costs related to}} the selection of formwork system for reinforced concrete structure {{is presented in the}} thesis. These costs include formwork system renting, labour and material costs. The analysis is carried out for the case study, the building TP Brdo. Two different systems, Epic ECO SKY Speed made of fibre reinforced plastics plates and Dokaflex 1 - 2 - 4, where the formwork is made of wood, are taken into the account for horizontal formwork, while steel formwork offered by both fromwork producers (Epic Faresin and Framax Xlife) is selected for wall elements. By using construction normative values and normative tables provided by the formwork producer, the lengths of time required for completing various activities, e. g. composing formwork, reinforcement laying and pouring concrete, were determined. The obtained values were multiplied by corresponding hour wages to obtain the total labour costs. Construction material costs were determined with the help of contractor's <b>price</b> database and <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities.</b> For the formwork systems selected, all costs {{associated with the use of}} formwork, i. e. formwork rent and labour costs, were calculated.

By 1951 the projected project delays were serious enough to draw criticism from the Electrical Supply Authority. By now aware of the projected energy shortfalls and the shortage of government resources to complete six other hydroelectric projects that were underway as well as complete Roxburgh, Goosman's response was to announce on 25 September 1951 that tenders would be called from interested parties to undertake the civil aspects of the project. This required the rapid production of tender documents and specifications by a short staffed government design staff. Bidders had the choice of offering on either a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> basis or by nominating a 'target estimate' plus a 4% fee. In this type of contract the Government met all costs and the contractor received a fee of 4% of the total cost up to the target estimate. If the cost varied from the estimate, then 25% of the change was added to or subtracted from the fee. A 'no loss clause' meant that if the cost overruns where high enough the contractor could lose their entire fee but would not suffer any further loss, other than those for not meeting agree completion dates. Eight tenders were received. Three were fixed <b>price</b> with a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> and the remainder were target estimates. The Ministry of Works had estimated that the work would cost £10,198,000 and the average for seven of the bidders was £10,068,838.

Whilst a deviation of - 3 to 4 % was obtained on housing projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 4 and 17 % whist on commercial project, it came out to be between - 20 and 20 % and in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of between - 11 and 37 % was obtained. This seems to suggest that the more complex a project is, the less reliable it is to use the BOQ to guarantee cost certainty...|$|R

The standardization <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> is a constant process, as it must include all the modern characteristics and standards in the sense of correct technology definition, materials {{and the quality of the}} final product accordingly. Due to the ongoing development in different engineering industries, and the high numbers in the characteristic permutations, there still prevails the everlasting dilemma: what and how to include the most important characteristics of the final product into the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> in order for them to be still (and at the same time) accurate, flexible and manageable enough to enable the connection between the productive and manufacturing (<b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> and calculation) project model (plans, resources dynamics).

40|$|Producing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> is a knowledge-based, {{dynamic and}} {{collaborative}} process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, {{within the context}} of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantity,</b> including details <b>of</b> their description, <b>quantity</b> and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain use...|$|R
