50|$|Let us {{consider}} that the vibration of polarisation is along OP. On passing through the glass half the vibrations remain along OP. But on passing through quartz half these vibrations will split into 0- and £-components. The £-components are parallel to the optic axis while O- component is perpendicular to optic axis. The O-component travels faster in quartz and hence an emergence 0-component will be along OD instead of along OC. Thus components OA and OO will combine to form a resultant vibration along OQ which makes same angle with optic axis as OP. Now if the Principal plane of the analyzing Nicol is parallel to OP then the light will pass through glass half unobstructed. Hence glass half will be brighter than quartz half or {{we can say that}} glass half will be bright and the quartz half will be dark. Similarly if principal plane of analyzing Nicol is parallel to OQ then quartz half will be bright and glass half will be dark. When the principal plane of analyzer is along AOB then both halves will be equally bright. On the other hand, if the principal plane of analyzer is along DOC. then both the halves will be equally dark. Thus it is clear that if the analyzing Nicol is slightly disturbed from DOC then one half becomes brighter than the other. Hence by using half shade device, one can measure angle of rotation more accurately. Determination of Specific Rotation In order to determine specific rotation of an optically active substance (say sugar) the <b>polarimeter</b> <b>tube</b> T is first filled with pure water and analyzer is adjusted for equal darkness (Both the halves should be equally dark) point. The position of the analyzer is noted with the help of scale. Now the <b>polarimeter</b> <b>tube</b> is filled with sugar solution of known concentration and again the analyser is adjusted {{in such a way that}} again equally dark point is achieved. The position of the analyzer is again noted. The difference of the two readings will give you angle of rotation θ. Hence specific rotation S is determined by using the relation. St λ =θ /LC The above procedure may be repeated for different concentration.|$|E

Optical rotation is a magnitude of the playing field of optical polarization of a substance and one example is the optical rotation on oil. Polarimeter with type WXG - 4 has two tubes with a length of each is 10 cm and 20 cm. <b>Polarimeter</b> <b>tube</b> volume is 10 ml and 20 ml. Raw material in oil quality testing using a polarimeter is the candlenut oil. Candlenut oil is a fixed variable used as a substitute for linseed oil, the oil {{can be used as a}} paint and varnish, because nature has a more volatile compared with linseed oil, candlenut oil, so one of those volatile oils, while kerosene as a variable changed. Kerosene is the fraction resulting from petroleum processing both physically and chemically. In use, kerosene must have requirements, such as low density, flash point. Kerosene has a boiling point of 175 – 275 °C (350 – 525 oF) to about 795 oC density 15 kg/m 3 and having a flash point abel 39 – 43 oC. Candlenut oil used was 10 ml with the addition of kerosene each 5 ml, 7 ml, 9 ml, and 11 ml, 13 ml and 15 ml. The way the test is candlenut oil inserted into the tube and placed in a polarimeter and then observed angle of rotation. Key word : Candlenut oil, polarimeter, optical rotatio...|$|E
