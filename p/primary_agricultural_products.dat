50|$|Today, {{sugar and}} rice {{are the most}} {{important}} <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> as they had been since the nineteenth century. Sugar was produced primarily for export whereas most rice was consumed domestically. Today in Guyana sugar production generates the most revenue in the primary industry, at around 15% of the total annual GNP. Other important crops include wheat, bananas, coconuts, coffee, cocoa, citrus fruits, pepper and pumpkin and livestock commodies from the country's various cattle ranches including beef, pork, poultry, dairy products and fish, notably shrimp. In some areas peanuts are also an important crop. Many of these products including rice are of extreme importance to national food security within the country. Small amounts of vegetables, vegetable oil and tobacco are also produced. During the late 1980s, some farmers succeeded in diversifying into specialty products such as heart-of-palm and asparagus for export to Europe.|$|E

In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|R
50|$|Its {{economy is}} based in agriculture, in which rural {{population}} produces agricultural commodities for export to larger markets in Praia, Assomada and Fogo. Small market centers exist in São Lourenço dos Órgãos and Pedra Badejo, which act primary as commodity exchanges where subsistence farmers exchange goods as available with merchants who transport and sell goods in larger markets. The <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> productions include fodder (usually {{in the form of}} maize stalks), bananas, papayas and coconuts. Prior to 1981 the area also produced a substantial percentage of the island's maize, but the arrival of large-scale international food aid, while vastly improving the region’s food security, made producing foodstuffs unprofitable. Maize and legumes are still the region's <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product,</b> though 97% is consumed by the families that produce it. The mixture of nitrogen fixing and nitrogen consuming crops reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, allowing small farmers to remain solvent despite little cash income.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic methods {{for the analysis of}} quality of the <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> of the cane sugar industry. The Louisiana sugarcane payment system is based on weight and on quality analysis of core samples from cane hauling bins. The conventional quality parameter of the Louisiana sugar industry, theoretical recoverable sugar (TRS), is calculated from the results of several analyses of the core samples (viz. sediment, refractometric dissolved solids and polarimetric sucrose in pressed juice, and moisture or fibre in the pressed cake of the cane sample). NIR calibrations have been developed for the prediction of individual core sample analyses (Brix, pol, sediment, and moisture), and for direct prediction of the calculated TRS value. In this study NIR spectroscopy has been used for direct prediction of TRS. Conventional analysis and NIR spectroscopic analysis of core samples for the past two sugarcane harvests are compared. The effect of cane preparation methods and sample presentation on NIR calibration development will be discussed. Keywords...|$|R

CMAJ has selected 3 for publication; the first appeared in our Dec. 6, 2005, issue (CMAJ 2005; 173 : 1514). This photograph cap-tures the repetitiveness, hardship and social bonds of manual farm labour, and leaves us pondering the health consequences of these women’s working conditions.

50|$|Carbondale {{takes its}} name from Carbondale, Pennsylvania, {{hometown}} of some of Carbondale's early settlers. Carbondale's economy was initially agriculturally based. Farmers and ranchers capitalized on open lands around Carbondale to supply food for miners in nearby Aspen, then a booming center of silver mining activity. Early in the 20th century, before the rise of industrial agriculture in Idaho, Carbondale's <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> was potatoes. The legacy lives on in Potato Day, an annual fall parade and cookout in Sopris Park. Despite the non-geologic origins of the town's name, the Carbondale area does in fact possess significant coal resources. Until the late 1980s Carbondale's economy was primarily based on coal operations up the Crystal River Valley. The coal mined from the area was favored for its high burning temperature, low sulphur content, and density. However, the coal deposits also contained significant amounts of methane gas. In 1981, a methane gas explosion killed 15 miners http://www.postindependent.com/article/20060416/VALLEYNEWS/104160006 and by 1991 the mines closed down permanently. The rise of Aspen as a skiing mecca and subsequent hyperinflation of its real estate prices has forced a majority of its workers downvalley to other towns like Carbondale. Thus, especially since the 1980s, Carbondale has partly served as a bedroom community to Aspen. More recently Carbondale has seen a boom of second-home construction, arts and recreational amenities, and tourism as the area's wealth and renown has grown.
