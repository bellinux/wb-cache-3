40|$|The {{effect of}} CL 184, 005, a potent and {{specific}} platelet-activating factor antagonist, has been examined {{in a variety}} of animal models relevant to gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Pretreatment of mice with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lethal effects of platelet-activating factor. When rats or primates rendered hypotensive with endotoxin were treated with CL 184, 005, blood pressure was normalized. Pretreatment of rats with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal lesions induced by endotoxin. Pretreatment of rats and mice with CL 184, 005 <b>protected</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lethal effects of endotoxin. Plasma tumor necrosis factor levels in endotoxin-treated mice were lower when the mice were pretreated with CL 184, 005. These observations suggest that CL 184, 005 may be potentially useful in the treatment of gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and the agent is undergoing clinical evaluation...|$|R

5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car {{for the first time}} when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support {{themselves and their children}} outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E

5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them.

They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|The shrine at Bury St Edmunds {{soon became}} one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage {{locations}} in England. In 1010, Edmund's remains were translated to London to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Vikings, where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury. For centuries the shrine was visited by various kings of England, many of whom gave generously to the abbey: Sweyn's son, King Canute, converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. In 1020, he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon the shrine as atonement for the sins of his forefathers.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if {{he was allowed to}} retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, several oil {{and natural}} gas rigs were {{evacuated}} due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September2, the reasons for the lifting of the order are unknown. State parks along the Florida Panhandle were also closed and highways became congested with thousands of residents and tourists evacuating the barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek Prime Minister {{explains}} {{that they have}} a planet known as the Asylum where they keep insane, battle-scarred Daleks. The Parliament has received a transmission of the Habanera Aria from the Asylum. The Doctor makes contact with the source of the transmission: the survivor of a starliner crash named Oswin Oswald. Oswin claims to have spent a year fending off Dalek attacks and making soufflés. The crash had ruptured the planet's force-field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force-field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. The three are given bracelets to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet's nanogene cloud, which would convert them into Dalek puppets, before being dropped onto the planet.|$|E

5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack {{the power to make}} it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E
5|$|The American cavalry {{pursued the}} {{soldiers}} that had retreated from Coamo, {{but were not}} able to reach them until the units had entered Aibonito Pass, a region more commonly known as Asomante. The region had been prepared by allied Puerto Rican and Spanish troops, who had built a trench and placed soldiers and equipment around the foliage. As soon as the soldiers noticed the presence of the invading unit they opened cannon fire. The cavalry received infantry reinforcements, which were received by battery fire. Six American soldiers were injured in the crossfire, prompting a retreat order. The allied units (Spanish and Puerto Rican) lost five soldiers and two civil guards. During the following two days the Americans decided to do a battlefield reconnaissance and Colonel S. Reber, developed a croquis of the Aibonito Pass. Spies were deployed throughout Coamo, including a Puerto Rican separatist named Carlos Patterne, who was able to enter the city without suspicion and contact Rufino Huertas, a separatist teacher. Huertas gave Patterne a series of defense plans that were previously developed and organized by Martínez Illescas. While inactive, the Puerto Rican soldiers deployed in Asomante completed rounds every two hours, working four hours daily. They mostly ate beans, some rice and meat, while conserving several cracker packs for Spanish reinforcements that were supposed to arrive. They slept in improvised huts that did not <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rain.|$|E
