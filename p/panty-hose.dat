40|$|Italian Industrial Districts (here ID) {{represent}} one of {{the most}} original forms of production in industrialized countries: a group of small family enterprises within a densely populated rural landscape produce textile, <b>panty-hoses,</b> furniture or mechanical goods. Their production is increasing at an Asiatic rate: 7, 8 even 10 % a year. Bagnasco, in a famous book (Bagnasco, 1977), identified three Italies: the north-western regions with big industrial companies (Piedmont, Lombardy), the Mezzo-Giorno with wide latifundias, low income, rural exodus {{and the power of the}} Mafias, and finally the "third Italy", the regions of the Districts mainly in the north-east (Veneto, Frioul), but also in the center (Emilia-Romagna,Toscana, Umbria), developing faster than most other regions in Europe. The main originality of the ID is their organisation around local networks of personal communication systems which ensure their flexibility and their efficiency. The Districts have been able, up to now, to accommodate simultaneously individual initiatives and global organisation, solving in their peculiar way the main problem of modern economy. Production is distributed among small economic units, often within families. Cohesion is assured by personal ties, friendship and a common system of values. Information flows through heated discussions around a bottle of grappa, the local brandy. For all its virtues, the system, however, is fragile. Increased competition through European unification and globalisation, as well as the development of information technology within enterprises (data base management, Intranet [...] .) or between them (Internet) increase the need for modernisation and seem to create a "New Economy " while undermining local personal networks. Industrial districts cannot ignore the very rapid progress of Information Technology; on the other hand, they might be destroyed by such developments. This paper tries and evaluates their present situation and the prospects they may face in a near future 1...|$|R
