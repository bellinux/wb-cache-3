40|$|We {{calculate}} the electrical currents through a superconductor - insulator - superconductor junction {{which is also}} weakly coupled to a normal metal side probe. The voltage V applied to the normal metal terminal controls the occupation of Andreev energy levels E_n, and therefore controls the Josephson current flowing through these levels. Whenever the <b>probe</b> <b>voltage</b> crosses an Andreev level, the Josephson current changes abruptly by an amount equal to the current flowing through the Andreev level. The differential conductance along the normal metal terminal permits spectroscopy of the Andreev levels. In a short junction (L ≪ξ_ 0), the critical current switches abruptly from the Ambegaokar-Baratoff value to zero when the <b>probe</b> <b>voltage</b> is approximately equal to the superconducting energy gap (|eV| ≃Δ).

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} charge and spin currents in a three-terminal mesoscopic {{ring in the}} presence of a uniform and nonuniform Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI). It is shown that a fully spin-polarized charge current and a pure spin current can be generated by tuning the <b>probe</b> <b>voltages</b> and/or the strength of the Rashba SOI. The charge and spin currents oscillate as the strength of the Rashba SOI increases induced by the spin quantum interference. The ratio of <b>probe</b> <b>voltages</b> oscillates synchronously with the pure spin current as the strength of the Rashba SOI increases in a nonuniform Rashba ring, while it remains constant in a uniform Rashba ring. We demonstrate theoretically that a three-terminal uniform Rashba ring can be used as a spin polarizer and/or spin flipper for different spin injections, and a nonuniform Rashba ring could allow us to detect the pure spin current electrically.

40|$|Fundamental {{electrical}} conductance measurement {{has been}} studied in-situ in two dimensions in the Ag/Si(111) system {{as a function of}} the incident adatom flux rate with a four probe technique. A conductance study in a three dimensional conical structure was also carried out with field emission techniques. Field emission is now well established and has been used in this case to characterize a novel geometry for use in flat panel displays to replace cathode ray tube monitors. For the two dimensional study on Ag/Si(111), the origin of conduction is still unclear, as both transport by means of percolating Ag clusters and conduction through the substrate via electrons transferred from the film have both been suggested as the conduction mechanism. We have carried out experiments by varying the flux rate to decide between these two possible mechanisms. Smoother films are expected at lower growth rates which would result in faster drops in the four <b>probe</b> <b>voltage.</b> However, the four <b>probe</b> <b>voltage</b> vs. deposition time for various flux rates collapse into a universal curve which indicates that the morphology is not relevant and supports conduction through the substrate. In the conductance measurements in the three dimensional system, a single, lateral micromachined W protrusion on a silica substrate is examined to identify the factors controlling emission in micromachined structures. The I-V characteristics and emission pattern indicate that miniprotrusions of a few hundred Angstroms, much smaller than the nominal radius of the tip, exist on the tip and are responsible for the emission. Adsorption-desorption events from the background environment are the cause of large fluctuations in the emitting current.

40|$|We study {{three-terminal}} linear and nonlinear transport {{through an}} Aharonov-Bohm interferometer containing a double quantum dot using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. Under {{the condition that}} one of the three terminals is a <b>voltage</b> <b>probe,</b> we show that the linear conductance is symmetric with respect to the magnetic field (phase symmetry). However, in the nonlinear transport regime, the phase symmetry is broken. Unlike two-terminal transport, the phase symmetry is broken even in noninteracting electron systems. Based on the lowest-order nonlinear conductance coefficient with respect to the source-drain bias voltage, we discuss the direction in which the phase shifts with the magnetic field. When the higher harmonic components of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are negligible, the phaseshift is a monotonically increasing function with respect to the source-drain bias voltage. To observe the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations with higher visibility, we need strong coupling between the quantum dots and the <b>voltage</b> <b>probe.</b> However, this leads to dephasing since the <b>voltage</b> <b>probe</b> acts as a Büttiker dephasing probe.
