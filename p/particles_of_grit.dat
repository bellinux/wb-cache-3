25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E

The rejected particles are wrapped in mucus, and are then expelled without having passed through the digestive tract. Thus, although they may closely resemble the mollusk's real feces, they are not actually feces, hence the name pseudofeces, meaning false feces.|$|E

40|$|Anti-slip strip {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular {{slip-resistant}} products indoor and outdoor, especially on the ramp. By using anti-slip strip the roughness of floor can be increased, the COF will be increased and the risk of slips and falls will be reduced at the same time. This study wanted to find out the effects of slip-resistance under different <b>particle</b> sizes <b>of</b> steel <b>grit,</b> different floor contamination conditions and different inclined angles while using the emery anti-slip strip. The results demonstrated that the <b>particle</b> size <b>of</b> steel <b>grit</b> used on the emery anti-slip strip has significant influence on the COF. When footwear had no groove under the shoe sole or the groove had been abraded badly, the particle size had to be big enough to perform the function of the anti-slip especially under the floor contamination of glycerol and water. Therefore, the study suggested that the <b>particle</b> size <b>of</b> steel <b>grit</b> used on the emery anti-slip strip should be larger than 500 µm to provide fine anti-slip effects...|$|R
50|$|The {{transparency}} {{of the glass}} plate {{can be used to}} advantage, in that the plate may be placed over a preliminary drawing on paper to guide the artist in creating a drawing on the plate. This is done by placing the drawing face down on a light table (to allow for the reversal of the image in printing) and placing the vitreograph plate on top of it.Although glass is unaffected by compression in the printing press, it will break under tension. For that reason, vitreographs are always printed on an etching press, whose rigid bed will support the glass plate firmly. In addition, the press bed must be level and working conditions in the print shop immaculate. A <b>particle</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> or dirt between press bed and the plate will create a tension point that will cause the glass to crack when pressure is applied.|$|R
50|$|They later {{observed}} another A. urnaria wasp knock {{a caterpillar}} off a bean plant onto bare ground. The caterpillar writhed {{and struggled to}} escape, rolling and unrolling itself, and the wasp had difficulty getting hold of it. She eventually straddled it, grasped it with her mandibles, lifted it {{off the ground and}} curled her abdomen underneath. It continued to struggle but she managed to insert her sting into the junction between the third and fourth segments. At once the caterpillar became motionless and limp and she was able to sting it twice more, choosing the underside junctions between segment two and three and then between segments one and two. After a brief pause and circling flight she stung it again several times in joints in the posterior part of its body. On another occasion they saw a female wasp hammering the ground firm over the entrance to a burrow with a small pebble and reported what they thought was the first observation of an insect using a tool. They were unable to observe this behaviour again but later discovered that Samuel Wendell Williston had recorded similar behaviour in the wasp Ammophila yarrowi in 1892. Since then, several species of Ammophila have been observed to move dry soil, <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit,</b> male pine cones and other suitable size fragments into their burrows, push these objects down with their heads, add more, pound the surface of the ground with chips of wood or fine pebbles and leave it smooth and level. The fact that these other wasp species also use tools makes it likely that this behaviour evolved a long time ago in a common ancestor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study also}} made {{conclusions}} about what hadrosaurids ate, although Purnell cautioned the {{conclusions about the}} hadrosaur's diet were [...] "a little less secure than the very good evidence we have for the motions of the teeth relative to each other." [...] The scratches found on each individual tooth were so equal that measuring an area of just one square millimeter was enough to sample the whole jaw. The team concluded the evenness of the scratches suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items such as twigs or stems, which might have required a different chewing method and created different wear patterns. The lack of pit marks on the teeth also upheld these conclusions, and suggested the hadrosaurs likely grazed on low-lying vegetation that lacked pits, rather than browsing on higher-growing vegetation with twigs. The scratches also indicated the hadrosaur's food contained either small <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit,</b> which was normal for vegetation cropped close to the ground, or that it contained microscopic granules of silica, which is common in grass. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous period, but were not particularly common, so the study concluded it probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet. Instead, they believed horsetails, a common plant at the time containing the above characteristics, was probably an important food for the dinosaur. The {{results of the study}} were published online on June 30, 2009, in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the official journal of the United States National Academy of Sciences. The study was published under the title, [...] "Quantitative analysis of dental microwear in hadrosaurid dinosaurs, and the implications for hypotheses of jaw mechanics and feeding".|$|E

It was usually possible to distinguish an empty pit from a foreign particle, and the analysis indicated that the larger number of imperfections on the sanded surface was associated with the presence of foreign matter, presumably <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> from the sanding.

40|$|The effects <b>of</b> hard <b>particles</b> on the {{friction}} coefficients and particle embedment during hard braking were investigated. Silica sands <b>grit</b> <b>of</b> the size between 180 to 355 µm were {{used during the}} experiments. The results were compared to the results obtained without the grit particles present {{in order to determine}} the change in friction coefficient, the fluctuation of frictional oscillation amplitude, and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> embedment. Different sliding speeds were applied to investigate the relationship between particle embedment with friction coefficient and friction oscillation amplitude. Presence <b>of</b> hard <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> different <b>grit</b> size is found to significantly affect {{the friction}} coefficient and standard deviation of friction oscillation amplitude values. The friction coefficient and standard deviation values of friction oscillation amplitude increase with particle embedment due to the rapid changes of the effective contact area and the abrasion mode operating in the gap interface. Also, particle embedment tends to increase the disc surface roughness and influence the stopping time of the disc...|$|R

40|$|Grit is {{routinely}} removed at the headworks of municipal {{wastewater treatment works}} to limit its onerous impact on downstream processes. Grit separation technologies are normally based on sedimentation of a homogeneous material (usually sand). However, in practice inorganic grit particles {{are likely to be}} combined with organic matter, such as fats oils and grease (FOG), producing a composite particle whose settling properties vary with the inorganic/organic content. A study of the impact <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> composition on its sedimentation has been conducted encompassing theoretical description (for particle settling in transitional flow), practical measurement and economic analysis. Practical measurement included sedimentation tests of homogeneous and composite particles along with characterisation of accumulated granular material sampled from actual municipal wastewater treatment works. The economic assessment was based on data from full-scale installations in the UK and US pertaining to remedial measures undertaken as a result <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> impacts, primarily accumulation in vessels and channels and damage of mechanical equipment through abrasion. Practical tests revealed coating of the sand grains with a FOG analogue (candlewax) to generate composite particles containing 45 % wax by weight. The coated particles were then 30 % less dense, 22 % larger and 14 % less settleable, on average, than the uncoated <b>particles.</b> Samples <b>of</b> accumulated <b>grit</b> taken from anaerobic digesters and aeration lanes from a full-scale plant indicated a FOG content (43 %) similar to that <b>of</b> the waxed <b>particles</b> in the bench-scale tests, thus leading to a similar grain retardation of 14 % assuming the FOG to be entirely associated with the <b>grit.</b> An assessment <b>of</b> the impact of the consequential breakthrough <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> <b>particles</b> due to buoyancy generated by composite particle formation indicated a $ 1. 1 increase in operating costs per megalitre (ML) wastewater...|$|R

The trial consisted of four treatments: one control and three grit treatments. 250 1 -day-old broilers were randomly placed in four pens. Commercial starter diets were fed from 1 to 10 days of age, commercial grower diets from 11 to 18 days of age and starter diet containing 15 % of whole wheat from 18 to 21 days of age. From five days of age, four birds were randomly placed in each of 48 cages. Birds in 12 cages were given no grit, zeolite grit, granite grit or marble. The grit was given {{on top of the}} feed at 5, 7 and 9 days of age, and each cage was offered 38 g each type <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> in total. On day 18, 19 and 20, one gram of each type <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> has given per bird in each treatment. At 5, 11, 13, 18 and 21 days of age, feed intake and body weight were registered. At 13, 18 and 21 days of age, one randomly selected bird from each cage was killed and dissected. The gizzard and crop content were collected and frozen for later analysis. Empty gizzard weight and full gizzard weight were weighed. The small intestine was also collected and frozen. At 11, 13, 18 and 21 days of age, the excreta was collected for analysis <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> and excreta. On day 21, six birds from each treatment were given 50 g whole wheat after fasting 10 hours. After giving feed for 2 hours, small amount of excreta was collected and the whole wheat was measured. The amounts of whole wheat in different digestive segments that form 21 days of age were measured. The findings showed grit supplementation did not impair nor improve broiler overall performance compared to control treatment. Gizzard weight and gizzard content weight were not increased due to providing grit except heavier gizzard was observed at 13 days of age in granite group compared to control group. Gizzard ph was not affected by grit addition. The proportion <b>of</b> larger excreta <b>particle</b> size (> 1. 4 mm) and smaller particle size (< 0. 2) fraction were not influenced by grit.
