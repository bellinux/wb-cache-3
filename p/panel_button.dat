Once the night <b>panel</b> <b>button</b> (located by the stereo and caution lights) has been activated, the instrument cluster will dim except for the speedometer, which will illuminate from 0-87 mph, until 87 has been exceeded. As a gauge becomes a necessity for the driver's attention, it will illuminate (for example, if the car needs to be refueled, if the engine is overheating, etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{a vision}} {{problem for the}} detection of lift operation panel which is a plane subject to deformation due to viewing angle change. The key problem in this project is the large scale change where the panel detection has to start at a significant distance away, and end up with the camera very near to the <b>panel</b> <b>button.</b> The process has three steps: (1) hunting for the panel using a coarse searching algorithm; (2) guiding the robot arm towards the panel; at close range, a model based matching algorithm is applied to verify (or identify) the panel; (3) after verification, tracking the button to guide the robot towards it. Two algorithms were used and it is shown that the weak perspective model outperforms the affine model. Keywords—lift panel detection, control points, motion stereo, affine transformation, weak perspective projection...|$|E
40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{is a set}} of {{breakthrough}} technologies that allow a human being to enter and fully experience a 3 -dimensional, computer simulated environment. A true virtual reality experience meets three criteria: (1) It involves 3 -dimensional computer graphics; (2) It includes real-time feedback and response to user actions; and (3) It must provide a sense of immersion. Good examples of a virtual reality simulator are the flight simulators used by all branches of the military to train pilots for combat in high performance jet fighters. The fidelity of such simulators is extremely high [...] but so is the price tag, typically millions of dollars. Virtual reality teaching and training methods are manifestly effective, and we have therefore implemented a VR trainer for the International Space Welding Experiment. My {{role in the development of}} the ISWE trainer consisted of the following: (1) created texture-mapped models of the ISWE's rotating sample drum, technology block, tool stowage assembly, sliding foot restraint, and control panel; (2) developed C code for control <b>panel</b> <b>button</b> selection and rotation of the sample drum; (3) In collaboration with Tim Clark (Antares Virtual Reality Systems), developed a serial interface box for the PC and the SGI Indigo so that external control devices, similar to ones actually used on the ISWE, could be used to control virtual objects in the ISWE simulation; (4) In collaboration with Peter Wang (SFFP) and Mark Blasingame (Boeing), established the interference characteristics of the VIM 1000 head-mounted-display and tested software filters to correct the problem; (5) In collaboration with Peter Wang and Mark Blasingame, established software and procedures for interfacing the VPL DataGlove and the Polhemus 6 DOF position sensors to the SGI Indigo serial ports. The majority of the ISWE modeling effort was conducted on a PC-based VR Workstation, described below...|$|E
