25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential {{today is that}} risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and <b>portfolio</b> <b>choice</b> require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|The Clayton {{canonical}} vine copula {{allows for}} the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in <b>portfolio</b> <b>choice</b> and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula. Other models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of panic regimes on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by Monte Carlo simulation, mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.|$|E

Specifically we decide socio-economic status difference in investment preference for <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> with respect to investor’s age, income level. Using chi-square analysis on investment experiments to obtain some evidences from a sample of 200 respondents in survey; our results indicate that investor’s decisions to make their <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> are significantly and negatively related to personal income level.

40|$|We {{calculate}} optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> for a long-horizon, risk-averse European {{investor who}} diversifies among stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash, when excess asset returns are predictable. Simulations are performed for scenarios involving different risk aversion levels, horizons, and statistical models capturing predictability in risk premia. Importantly, {{under one of}} the scenarios, the investor takes into account the parameter uncertainty implied by the use of estimated coefficients to characterize predictability. We find that real estate ought to {{play a significant role in}} optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices,</b> with weights between 10 and 30 % in most cases. Under plausible assumptions, the welfare costs of either ignoring predictability or restricting <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> to financial assets only are found to be in the order of at least 100 basis points per year. These results are robust to changes in the benchmarks and in the statistical framework. Optimal asset allocation, real estate, predictability, parameter uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|We study Italian households’ <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices,</b> with {{a special}} focus on equity investments, by {{analysing}} jointly time series and cross-sectional portfolio data. We investigate the temporal evolution of the actual composition of Italian households’ investments in order to explain their <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> and to detect possible determinants of the observed disequilibria phenomena. Moreover, we model the stock market participation choice by using probit regression techniques and we test for parameter stability over time. Instability of participation parameters and a peculiar evolution of Italian households’ portfolios pointed out by our concurrent analysis of cross-sectional and time series data seem to confirm the distance of Italian households’ financial decisions from the rational choice predicted by the Markowitz model. In particular, {{we find that the}} housing market bubbles interact strongly with the stock market and financial institutions seem to be unable to advise investors suggesting optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices.</b> The deep reason behind these facts may be the bounded education of investors, in particular the low financial literacy of Italian households...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we model and test how general health {{conditions}} affect financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices,</b> conditional {{on the presence}} of a National Health System (NHS) and its level of coverage. We further propose a measure of risk of expenses for future health shocks in order to test whether portfolio decisions have a more “myopic ” or “forward-looking ” orientation. To this end, we use data taken from the first wave of SHARE to compare the participation decision of European elderly households in presence of different NHS. The results are consistent with our hypothesis, i. e. that <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> are different across households who shares the same health status but live in countries with higher or lower protection via NHS. More specifically in countries without a protective NHS, a worse current perceived health status sensibly reduces the probability of holding risky assets, while in those with a protective NHS, current health status does not seem to affect <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices.</b> Furthermore, we find evidence of a weak forward-looking attitude in shaping household portfolio decisions...|$|R

This depends particularly on the way <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> are constrained.

40|$|Exchange rate {{policies}} {{depend on}} <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices,</b> and <b>portfolio</b> <b>choices</b> depend on anticipated exchange rate policies. This {{opens the door}} to multiple equilibria in policy regimes. We construct a model in which agents optimally choose to denominate their assets and liabilities either in domestic or in foreign currency. The monetary authority optimally chooses to float or to fix the currency, after portfolios have been chosen. We identify conditions under which both fixing and floating are equilibrium policies: if agents expect fixing and arrange their portfolios accordingly, the monetary authority validates that expectation; the same happens if agents initially expect floating. We also show that a flexible exchange rate Pareto-dominates a fixed one. It follows that social welfare would rise if the monetary authority could precommit to floating. ...|$|R

Existence of optimal policies is established using martingale and duality techniques under general assumptions on the securities 2 ̆ 7 price process and the investor 2 ̆ 7 s preferences. As an illustration of our characterization result, explicit solutions are provided for specific examples involving an agent with logarithmic utilities and a generalized two-factor version of the CCAPM is derived.
