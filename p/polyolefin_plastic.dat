5000|$|OXO-bio plastic is {{conventional}} <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastic</b> {{to which}} has been added small amounts of metal salts, none of which are [...] "heavy metals" [...] which are restricted by the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62 Art 11. These salts catalyze the degradation process to speed it up so that the OXO plastic will degrade abiotically {{at the end of}} its useful life in the presence of oxygen much more quickly than ordinary plastic. At the end of that process it is no longer visible, it is no longer a plastic as it has been converted via Carboxylation or Hydroxylation to small-chain organic chemicals which will then biodegrade. It does not therefore leave fragments of plastic in the environment. The degradation process is shortened from decades to years and/or months for abiotic degradation and thereafter the rate of biodegradation depends on the micro-organisms in the environment.

30|$|However, these {{materials}} lose strength dramatically after being soaked in boiling water, which prevents their usage for outdoor and construction-related applications. This {{is due to}} the incompatibility of the hydrophilic wood with hydrophobic plastic materials, especially <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastic,</b> such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) [8, 9]. This incompatibility can cause insufficient wetting of the plastic on the surface of wood which leads to weak interfacial adhesion between the two phases.

The plasticisation of starch is complex due to the extensive hydrogen bonding between chains. This study shows that a simple quaternary ammonium salt combined with hydrogen bond donor (HBD) forms effective modifiers that produce flexible plastics with good mechanical properties that are comparable to some <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics.</b> Starch-based plastics can be formed by the same processes as current commercial plastics, giving similar mechanical strength to some <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics.</b> The processing conditions are shown to significantly affect the structure of the polymer which has a concomitant effect upon the mechanical and physical properties of the resulting plastic. Using a glycerol based modifier results in a totally sustainable and biodegradable material which can be formed by extrusion, pressing, vacuum forming and injection moulding. Most significantly, it is shown that these plastics are environmentally compatible, recyclable, bio-degradable and compostable. This study has demonstrated the optimisation of the parameters for a range of techniques that are currently used in processing this type of plastic. These include: temperature profiling for both compression moulding and extrusion, residence time in the extruder, drying time and pressing time. Glycerol/choline chloride is the plasticiser that was found to give optimal properties and has been used for most of this study. The optimum ratio is shown to be 1 : 3 by weight plasticiser: starch.

40|$|<b>Polyolefin</b> based <b>plastics</b> are {{extensively}} {{used for}} packaging applications {{and as such}} {{they tend to have}} a short service life but they have a long environmental persistence. One strategy to accelerate the mechanical degradation of <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics</b> in the environment is to blend them with carbohydrate based polymers. Unfortunately polyolefins are hydrophobic whereas carbohydrates tend to be hydrophilic so the two do not blend without chemical modification of the carbohydrate. In this study high density polyethylene, HDPE and thermoplastic starch, TPS are used as the polymers with deep eutectic solvents, DESs as the modifiers. Both TPS and DESs are biodegradable and the DESs are water miscible and biocompatible ensuring that the composite plastic contains a biodegradable flaw which should enable mechanical and chemical degradation. It is shown that DESs enable facile mixing of the two polymers. The composite has a strength similar to TPS but a ductility greater than either of the two components. The glass transition temperature of the composite plastic shows that they are homogeneously mixed and data suggests that the DESs act as lubricants rather than plasticisers.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on a {{potential}} catalytic process for efficient clean-up of plastic pollution in waters, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (CPGP). Detailed catalytic mechanisms of RuO 2 during supercritical water gasification of common <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics</b> including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PP), have been investigated in a batch reactor at 450 °C, 60 min.

Methane was the highest gas component, with a yield of up to 37 mol kg− 1 LDPE using the 20 wt% RuO 2 catalyst. Evaluation of the gas yields, CGE and HGE revealed that the conversion of PS involved thermal degradation, steam reforming and methanation; whereas hydrogenolysis was a possible additional mechanism during the conversion of aliphatic plastics.

40|$|Keywords: polyolefin, polypropylene, polyethylene, fused {{deposition}} modeling, 3 D printing, shrinkage, warping With the continuous developments, FDM has surpassed the status as rapid prototyping method, and matured {{to the point}} where it is widely applied in direct manufacturing of various end-use products. However, the end-use applications are partly limited due to most current feedstock materials being prone to degradation in high-temperature, humid and chemically aggressive environments. The goal of this thesis was to evaluate the per-formance of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) as alternative feedstock materi-als in the FDM process. PP and PE are prevalent <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics</b> and their principal value lies in the attractive balance of physical properties in the solid state and chemical inertness, and for the same reasons, they represent attractive FDM feedstock materials for the environmentally challenging conditions. However, as highly semi-crystalline plastics they show substantial solidification shrinkage upon cooling, and the shrinkage induced contractile stresses can deform the deposited parts. In this work, the performance of PP and PE as feedstock materials in FDM was evaluat-ed through several deposition experiments. The entire manufacturing chain from fila-ment fabrication to deposition of specimens was controlled. Bonding quality between deposited filament strands at varying deposition conditions was assessed by preparing and testing tensile specimens, and comparing the results to injection molded counter-parts. The effects of deposition conditions on the shrinkage and warp deformation were studied by depositing specimens with different geometrical features. Based on the results, FDM of PP and PE feedstock materials is feasible and holds a great potential, but requires special arrangements and awareness of the inherent chal-lenges. Bonding quality was highest at high temperature deposition conditions, and only roughly 10 % loss in yield strength was observed when compared to injection molded counterparts. All specimens, regardless of deposition conditions, showed poor ductility and little to no correlation was found between the elongation and deposition tempera-tures. Excessive heat flow to the specimen during deposition caused substantial shrink-age due to prolonged cooling of the deposited plastic, and consequently the most di-mensionally stable specimens were produced by limiting the deposition temperatures or increasing interlayer cooling time. Specimens with sharp protruding features showed higher tendency to peel off from the build platform than circular specimens did, due to differences in contractile stress distributions. Warp deformation became also more prom-inent when feature thickness was reduced. Nevertheless, the deposition performance under optimal conditions was for the most parts on par with many traditional feedstock materials...|$|R

We evaluated the biodegradability and mechan-ical properties of agro-flour–filled PBS biocomposites ac-cording to the content and filler particle size of agro-flour. As the agro-flour loading was increased, the tensile and impact strength of the biocomposites decreased.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to {{an investigation of the}} potential and technological possibilities of an inline ultrasound system as a quality control system for wet recycling of solid waste. The main targeted recycling technology is magnetic density separation (MDS), a novel technique that was investigated and technologically matured in a project running in parallel to this work. In MDS, the easily magnetisable ferrofluid is used as the separation medium to sort different materials based on their mass densities. The MDS is very accurate compared to conventional recycling separation techniques as it is effective even when the densities are very close (< 1 weight percent), such as for different <b>polyolefin</b> <b>plastics.</b> The special attention for plastics in this work is motivated by the economical and environmental gains that are obtained from the separation of plastics from large waste flows such as automobile scrap and household waste. Due to the inherent optical opaqueness of ferrofluid, the ultrasound imaging system is the only effective method that allows accurate observation and study of the waste particles as they separate in the channel. Moreover, the intrinsic properties of ultrasound make it suitable for quantitative analyses, such as particle tracking and measurement of particle sizes, volume and density distributions as the particles flow in large quantities towards the extraction units. The main objectives for this work have been achieved. It was shown that commercial medical 2 D ultrasonic imaging systems provide a good technological point of departure for the desired inline system. They are capable of generating good quality images of moving particles, provided the view of the probe onto the particles is well controlled. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} real-time ultrasound is capable of delivering online quantitative information that is crucial to the performance of an MDS. In particular, image processing techniques have been applied on the real-time ultrasound video-streams to evaluate the particles density distribution in the channel, measure the particle velocity and to analyze their motion behaviour as they float in the ferrofluid. The limitations of the medical commercial technology are that it cannot serve as a reliable stand-alone machine and also cannot provide all types of quantitative analyses that are desirable in an industrial recycling operation. As a next step, the investigation turned towards the imaging methods themselves. For that purpose the general linear acoustic theory for waves in ferrrofluids and acoustic imaging was reviewed, first to establish the basic physics and main principles of imaging. The potential of quantitative ultrasound analysis was determined by focusing on cross-section imaging, which is the biggest challenge for accurate 2 D imaging. It has been shown that probe positioning and the overall data acquisition strategy deserve due consideration, since data quality proved paramount for good quality images. For the imaging research, the most technologically promising ultrasound methods were adapted from the fields of seismology, medical ultrasound and non-destructive testing. These imaging methods were developed in either the space-time domain or the Fourier domain, as each approach proved to have its own advantages and limitations for data requirements and computational costs. The methods were implemented in Matlab and supplied with raw ultrasound data, scanned from static scenes with just a few generic test objects. These objects were generic in the sense that all possible shapes and size-dependent acoustic wave effects were captured that could be expected with ‘real’ waste particles. Two complementary data sets were used to investigate the possible benefits of having either a wider sensor array aperture during transmission (pulse-echo data) or during data reception (plane wave data). The resulting images were evaluated in terms of performance indicators, which were introduced to obtain a more objective judgement of image quality. This research showed that accurate ultrasound cross-section imaging is quite feasible if good quality data can be scanned, i. e. if the data contain the necessary acoustic information. In particular, the availability of acoustic information from both front and back surfaces was found to be the key factor for good quality data. It is also concluded that all the imaging methods tested in this work are in principle capable of delivering good image quality, provided the data are of sufficient quality. What sets them apart are the substantial differences in computational costs and the ability to process different types of data. Finally, the research conducted in this thesis has also led to the compilation of a set of recommendations for future realization of an ultrasound system, dedicated to inline quality control in recycling.
