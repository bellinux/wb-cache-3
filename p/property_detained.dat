5000|$|Section 2 {{expands the}} {{jurisdiction}} of federal courts to cases arising from revenue collections by the U.S. government and allows injured parties in revenue cases to sue in court. It deems <b>property</b> <b>detained</b> by customs officers {{to be in the}} custody of the law, subject to disposition by court order only, and criminalizes anyone who circumvents the legal process in regaining detained property as guilty of a misdemeanor.|$|E

50|$|Detention is {{the process}} when a state or private citizen {{lawfully}} holds a person by removing his or her freedom of liberty at that time. This can be due to (pending) criminal charges being raised against the individual {{as part of a}} prosecution or to protect a person or <b>property.</b> Being <b>detained</b> does not always result in being taken to a particular area (generally called a detention centre), either for interrogation, or as punishment for a crime (see prison).|$|R
60|$|The {{pleasant}} life in {{the country}} house had lasted for nearly a month, when the announcement of Hugh's approaching return to England reached Iris. The fatal end of his father's long and lingering illness had arrived, and the funeral had taken place. Business, connected with his succession to the <b>property,</b> would <b>detain</b> him in London for a few days. Submitting to this necessity, he earnestly expressed the hope of seeing Iris again, the moment he was at liberty.|$|R
5|$|Richard II {{inherited}} Berkamsted Castle in 1377; {{initially the}} use of {{it was given to}} his favourite, Robert de Vere and, after de Vere's fall from power and exile in 1388, to John Holland. Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard in 1400, and he used the <b>property</b> to <b>detain</b> rival applicants to the throne. During this period Geoffrey Chaucer, later famous for his Canterbury Tales, oversaw renovation work on the castle in his role as a clerk. Both Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until his overthrow in 1461.|$|R
5000|$|The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) {{launched}} an [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] operation, while the intelligence services began investigating unnamed politicians over what {{was described as}} an illegal attempt to seize power. The decision to begin the anti-terrorist operation involved the SBU, the Interior Ministry, the Ministry of Defence, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, and the central and local governments, according to a statement on the SBU website. According to political analyst Taras Berezovets, the decree meant that the SBU could search protesters, seize their <b>property,</b> and <b>detain</b> them at will, [...] "without a court order or other legal safeguards." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the {{recovery}} of specific personal property and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for {{the recovery of}} specific personal <b>property</b> unlawfully <b>detained,</b> or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property. Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the recovery of personal property.|$|R
50|$|Hot pursuit {{has long}} formed {{a part of}} English common law. The {{principle}} {{can be traced back}} to the doctrine of distress damage feasant, which allowed a <b>property</b> owner to <b>detain</b> animals trespassing on his land to ensure that he was compensated for the damage they had caused (though only during the trespass itself). In particular, a case in 1293 held that a property owner could also chase after trespassing animals leaving his land and catch them if he could. Later cases extended this idea to allow a property owner to distrain the goods of a tenant behind on his rent outside his property (in Kirkman v. Lelly in 1314) and peace officers to make arrests outside their jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the ever}} {{increasing}} interest of Academic literature on International taxation, {{real estate and}} property taxes have been somehow underestimated till a very recent time in legal scientific research. There are no general principles (world-wide accepted) applicable to taxes levied on property, mainly because the right to property as such is regulated and acknowledged very differently from State to State. In some areas it is considered a quasi-natural right of the individual, while in many other is protected under law only if a social function (on a case by case basis) {{can be attributed to}} is as well. But if no general consensus can be found on real estate tax, nonetheless it is possible to find de facto common principles on qualified regional areas: shared rules affecting taxation of property that are established at a level which is beyond the one of the sovereign State and that might influence the latter. Europe is a clear example of this regional approach to real estate taxation. In the old Continent both the EU and the Council of Europe have established clear limits to the power to tax of the States that should be respected while dealing with immovable property taxation. The first and foremost of these limits concerns the level taxation and the need for the application of a tax that should never lead to a deprivation of property. Taxation and expropriation in this respect are two phenomena that risk to {{have a lot in common}} when they are directed to real estate. Italy, as a member of the European Union and of the Council of Europe, developed very recently a brand new tax on real estate, and dared to apply it also on immovable <b>properties</b> <b>detained</b> abroad (that is, in other States) by individuals resident in Italy. This decision (taken in the attempt to maximize the flow of revenue in a time of crisis) will ultimately bring Italy to a possible conflict with the taxing powers of the other States, where the asset is placed. An individual resident in Italy, for instance, will be liable to tax therein for a real estate owned in South Korea, even if he is also liable to tax in the Korean peninsula for the same asset. The mechanisms set up to prevent multiple taxation (basically, a foreign tax credit) appears all but adequate to mitigate the newly imposed tax burden, and the tax as such appears to be a serious hinderance to investments in foreign states and ultimately lead to a distorsive affect of capitals allocation. On the long run, the side effects of this decisions are still unpredictable and its consistency with the above mentioned principles concerning real estate taxation all but certain...|$|R
500|$|On 22 April 1789, Bounty {{arrived at}} Nomuka, in the Friendly Islands (now called Tonga), {{intending}} {{to pick up}} wood, water, and further supplies on the final scheduled stop before the Endeavour Strait. Bligh had visited the island with Cook, and knew that the inhabitants could behave unpredictably. He put Christian {{in charge of the}} watering party and equipped him with muskets, {{but at the same time}} ordered that the arms should be left in the boat, not carried ashore. Christian's party was harassed and threatened continually but were unable to retaliate, having been denied the use of arms. He returned to the ship with his task incomplete, and was cursed by Bligh as [...] "a damned cowardly rascal". Further disorder ashore resulted in the thefts of a small anchor and an adze, for which Bligh further berated Fryer and Christian. In an attempt to recover the missing <b>property,</b> Bligh briefly <b>detained</b> the island's chieftains on the ship, but to no avail. When he finally gave the order to sail, neither the anchor nor the adze had been restored.|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of logistic operations {{has a very}} important role in the case of pharmaceutical products. The {{purpose of this article is}} to analyse the particularity of the logistic operations management in the pharmaceutical domain. This is seen in the fact that there is the obligativity of using the exclusive distribution system, because the carriers do not have selling right to the final users. In the pharmaceutical domain, the logistic channels may be represented by a system of vertical marketing, made from producers, en-gross sellers and en-detail sellers that action in the frame of an unified system in which a member of the channel may <b>detain</b> <b>property</b> right over the other members the vertical marketing system may be corporative or contractual. In Romania the medicine producers adopted both marketing systems. Organising and distributing medicine from the specialised unities (pharmaceutical deposit, close circuit pharmacy or comunitary pharmacy) are settled through laws thjat are specific to the pharmaceutical domain. In these conditions the mission of the company is to give medicine with a balance between price – quality – asureness – eficacity, for giving accesibility to different treatments. The role of the state is significant, reason for an interdisciplinary approaching that may drive to ideas, oppinions that may be aplied...|$|R
