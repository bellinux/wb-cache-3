5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly to accommodate a new musical idea with each successive <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> text.|$|E
5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ssekyaaya participated on Uganda's behalf in the men's 62 {{kilogram}} weightlifting discipline. He was 18 {{years old}} and had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Ssekyaaya qualified for the Games after receiving a wildcard from the International Weightlifting Federation after achieving a 28th-place finish in the Africa Olympic Qualifiers. His event took place on 31 July, and included 14 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Ssekyaaya was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in his first two attempts, but did not achieve this objective on the third attempt. Ssekyaaya then attempted 130 kilograms during the clean and jerk <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 135 kilograms on his second attempt, or 140 on his third. Overall, the combination of Ssekyaaya's highest scores in snatch (105) and clean and jerk (130) yielded a score of 235 points. He ranked 13th in the event, ahead of Stevick Patris from Palau (234 points) and behind Tuau Lapua Lapua of Tuvalu (243 points). Ssekyaaya was 92 points behind the gold medallist Kim Un-guk from North Korea.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how syntax {{and focus}} {{interact}} in deriving the phonological <b>phrasing</b> <b>of</b> utterances in Xhosa, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. Although the influence <b>of</b> syntax on <b>phrasing</b> is uncontroversial, a purely syntactic analysis cannot {{account for all}} the data reported for Xhosa by Jokweni (1995). Focus influences the phrasing in that it inserts a phonological phrase-boundary after the focused constituent. This generalization can account for the variation found in the <b>phrasing</b> <b>of</b> adverbials. The findings are dealt with in an OT-based framework following Truckenbrodt’s work on Chichewa (1995, 1999) which is extended to the <b>phrasing</b> <b>of</b> adjuncts. ...|$|R

5|$|Geralee Vega Morales participated on Puerto Rico's behalf as {{its only}} weightlifter. Born in 1986, Vega was 22 {{at the time}} of her {{participation}} in Beijing. She took part in the women's lightweight event, which includes athletes under 58kilograms in weight. She had not previously participated in any Olympic games. Vega's event took place on August 11, and included 12 athletes in total. During the snatch phase of the event, Vega was given three attempts. She unsuccessfully attempted to lift 90kilograms of weight during her first two attempts, but succeeded on her third, tying eighth in that part of the event. She then attempted 112kilograms during the clean and jerk <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> the event, successfully lifting it on her first attempt. She did not succeed in lifting 115kilograms on her second attempt, or 116kilograms on her third. Overall, the combination of her highest scores in snatch (90) and clean and jerk (112) yielded a score of 202 points. Geralee Vega Morales ranked ninth in the event, ahead of Poland's Marieta Gotfryd (200 points) and behind Romania's Roxana Cocos (204 points). China's Chen Yanqing set an Olympic record when she took the gold medal with 244 points.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} an extensive orchestral sinfonia marked Concerto in the autograph score. Lasting 22 bars, this ritornello establishes the prevailing anguished {{mood of the}} first section. It is heard twice again, but only as the accompanying backdrop for the separate musical material of the chorus, a setting of the first <b>phrase</b> <b>of</b> the Old Testament text. The open motifs are also heard again in the fragmentary accompaniment of the central choral fugato episode between the two reprises of the ritornello. The different motifs in the ritornello thus also serve the purpose of accompanying specific parts of the text. The first predominant motif consist of detached repeated quaver chords, passed antiphonally between the three instrumental groups of recorders, oboes and strings. These are accompanied by similarly detached crotchets, scored as quavers with rests, in the walking bass of the continuo. After thirteen bars there follows a four bar passage of melifluous semiquaver passages in thirds for the recorders with imitative responses from the oboes; the upper strings take up the detached crotchets and the continuo the groups of detached repeated quavers. In the four succeeding bars the quaver figure in the continuo line {{is replaced by a}} new motif of rising semiquaver scales, with the detached quavers and crotchets passing into the upper strings and the woodwind playing sustained chords. In the concluding two bars of the sinfonia the semiquaver scale motif passes into the recorders in thirds and is taken up by the other instruments for the sustained final cadence.|$|E
