In this paper, we propose a fair <b>power-controlled</b> MAC protocol (FPCMA) by integrating senderinitiated busy tone with traditional <b>power-controlled</b> protocol. The sender-initiated busy tone is used to assist in channel access, and will be set up when a node finds it difficult to access the channel.

Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that our protocol is able to balance the tradeoff between fair channel access and throughput, and is therefore more flexible than both the traditional dual busy tone and <b>power-controlled</b> MAC protocols. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

This talk addresses the potential role of flexible electric loads and <b>power-controlled</b> operation of combined heat and power (CHP) plants in meeting increasing balancing needs in Germany. It relies on an enhancement and application of the cross-sectoral REMix model, which is designed for the assessment of energy supply scenarios based on a system representation in high spatial and temporal resolution.

40|$|Balancing of {{intermittent}} renewable {{power generation}} from {{wind and solar}} energy {{is one of the}} central challenges within the energy system transformation towards a more sustainable supply. This work addresses the potential role of flexible electric loads and <b>power-controlled</b> operation of combined heat and power (CHP) plants in meeting increasing balancing needs in Germany. It conducts an enhancement of the cross-sectoral REMix model, which is designed for the preparation and assessment of energy supply scenarios based on a system representation in high spatial and temporal resolution. The analysis is composed of three fundamental parts. The first part is dedicated to the quantification of theoretical potentials for demand response (DR), district heating (DH) and industrial CHP in Europe. Special attention is given to the geographic distribution of potentials, as well as the derivation of hourly heat and electricity demand profiles. In the second part, the linear optimization model within REMix is extended by DR and the heating sector, enabling economic assessments of the balancing function of flexible electric loads and <b>power-controlled</b> heat supply. In the third part, REMix is applied to assess the future energy supply in Germany, making use of the model enhancements and identified potentials. In order to account for different renewable energy (RE) and grid capacity development paths, as well as transport and heat sector structures, nine scenarios are considered. For each scenario, least-cost dimensioning and operation of DR capacities, as well as heat supply systems are evaluated. According to the REMix results, the application of DR is mostly limited to short time peak shaving of the residual load. This implies that its focus is on the provision of power, not energy. As a consequence of different cost structures, the exploitation of available DR potentials is attributed almost exclusively to industrial and commercial sector loads, whereas those in the residential sector are hardly accessed. The model results indicate that the temporal availability of DR potentials, as well as their characteristic intervention and shift times are particularly suited for a combination with PV power generation. In the simulations, <b>power-controlled</b> heat supply has proven to be an effective measure to increase RE integration. It is achieved by a modified operation pattern of CHP and [...] to a lower extent [...] heat pumps (HP) enabled by thermal energy storage (TES) on the one hand, and an utilization of surplus power for heating purposes on the other. Due to the greater potential and thus longer storage times of TES, as well as the comparatively low investment costs of electric boilers, an enhanced coupling between power and heat sector is found to be especially favorable in combination with wind power utilization. Load shifting across all sectors provides substantial amounts of positive balancing power, which can substitute other firm generation capacity. The highest load reduction is achieved by controlled electric vehicle charging, lower contributions come from adjusted HP operation and other DR. As a consequence of higher RE integration, load shifting and <b>power-controlled</b> heat supply can contribute substantially to CO 2 emission reductions in Germany. However, this is only the case if the additional balancing potentials are not applied as well for an economically motivated shift in power generation from low-emitting to high-emitting fuels. Furthermore, load flexibility and enhanced power-heat-coupling can enable energy supply cost reductions, arising from the substitution of back-up power plant capacity on the one hand, and a more cost-efficient power and heat supply on the other. The model application reveals that electric load shifting and <b>power-controlled</b> CHP operation are not competing but complementary measures in the realization of higher RE integration and lower back-up capacity demand. Negative interferences between both balancing options are found to be very small. On the contrary, they even promote each other, for example in the reduction of RE curtailments. Based on the REMix results it can be concluded that both DR and <b>power-controlled</b> heat supply enabled by TES are important elements in a future German energy system mainly relying on renewable sources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{conservative}} {{nature of}} the 802. 11 ad hoc scheme has instigated extensive research whose goal {{is to improve the}} spatial reuse and/or energy consumption of this scheme. Transmission power control (TPC) was shown to be effective in achieving this goal. Despite their demonstrated performance gains, previously proposed <b>power-controlled</b> channel access protocols often incur extra hardware cost (e. g., multiple transceivers). Furthermore, they do not fully exploit the potential of power control due to the heuristic nature of power allocation and “interference margin ” computations. In this paper, we propose a distributed, single-channel MAC protocol (GMAC) that is inspired by game theory. In GMAC, multiple potential transmitters are first involved in an admission phase, which enables terminals to compute the transmission powers that achieve a Nash equilibrium (NE) for the given utility function. Subsequently, successful contenders can simultaneously proceed with their transmissions. Simulation results indicate that GMAC improves the network throughput over the 802. 11 scheme by about 80 %, and over another single-channel <b>power-controlled</b> MAC protocol (POWMAC) by about 40 %.

A channel-dependent <b>power-controlled</b> RCT scheme is proposed, using which the transmitter estimates the beamforming (BF) vectors required for the forward-link SM data transmission. Tight approximate expressions for 1) the mean square error (MSE) in the estimate of the BF vectors, and 2) a capacity lower bound (CLB) for an SM system, are derived and used to optimize the parameters of the training sequence. Moreover, an extension of the channel-dependent training scheme and the data rate analysis to a multiuser scenario with M user terminals is presented. For the single-mode BF system, a closed-form expression for an upper bound on the average sum data rate is derived, which is shown to scale as ((L-c - L-B,L- tau) /L-c) log logM asymptotically in M, where L-c and L-B,L- tau are the channel coherence time and training duration, respectively.

40|$|In {{wireless}} communications, {{a fading}} multiple-access channel (MAC) is typically used {{to model the}} uplink communication. Conventional MACs assume a centralized system, where the transmission rate and power are chosen centrally for every fading vector realization. On the other hand, there is considerable interest {{in the performance of}} distributed multiple access systems, where the lack of global channel state information (CSI) demands novel communication strategies. We consider a block-fading MAC where each transmitter is aware only of its own link CSI, which we term as the individual CSI MAC. The receiver has access to the full CSI of all links. This model was recently introduced in the information theory literature, and naturally leads to a distributed access system with several applications. An important utility of interest for this model is known as the <b>power-controlled</b> adaptive sum-capacity, whose evaluation is an open problem. This is the main subject of the current paper.
