The post property, now {{being used as a}} roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another <b>prospector</b> named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E

5|$|On August 16, 1896, an American <b>prospector</b> named George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate Carmack (Shaaw Tláa), {{her brother}} Skookum Jim (Keish), and their nephew Dawson Charlie (K̲áa Goox̱) were {{travelling}} {{south of the}} Klondike River. Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian <b>prospector,</b> they began looking for gold on Bonanza Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear who discovered the gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, but the group agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because they feared that mining authorities would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E

50|$|The Vermilion Lake Gold Rush {{was a small}} {{gold rush}} to Lake Vermilion, Minnesota, when <b>prospectors</b> found small specks of gold in quartz stone in 1865. It was not {{profitable}} to try to process this, so the rush ended in 1866, and the <b>prospectors</b> mostly abandoned their land by 1867. Nonetheless, <b>prospectors</b> returned, spreading word of all the iron that they found, leading {{to the development of}} the Minnesotan iron ranges twenty years later.|$|R

5000|$|The {{gold rush}} on the Ivalo River began in 1870, shortly after gold {{prospecting}} was made legal. During {{the spring and}} the summer, about 500 gold <b>prospectors</b> made their way through Lapland to the Ivalo River. The <b>prospectors</b> traveled hundreds of kilometers by ski, foot, or boat to the gold prospecting area, which was born to the confluence of Ivalo and its tributary Sotajoki. To regulate the rush, the government established a headquarters for the authorities and service point for the <b>prospectors,</b> called the [...] "Kultala Crown Station." [...] In Kultala, the officials issued licenses for <b>prospectors</b> and purchased their gold. There were also law enforcement officers and cartographers, {{as well as a}} restaurant and post office. At its largest, the number of government officials and gold <b>prospectors</b> was approximately 600 people. This was a significant community, as Lapland was mostly uninhabited wilderness, and the largest populated places contained only up to few hundred people.|$|R

Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.|$|E
5|$|The claim {{could be}} mined freely for a year, after which a $100 ($2,800) fee {{had to be}} paid annually. Should the <b>prospector</b> leave the claim {{for more than three}} days without good reason, another miner could make a claim on the land. The Canadian {{government}} also charged a royalty of between 10 and 20 percent on the value of gold taken from a claim.|$|E

He then lures Amelia to a mine in Colorado where a surprise visit from an aged Kanyenke, who has brought Cooper and the cavalry with him, reveals Beaumont {{as the leader of}} Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase Beaumont through the mines, where they find a map to the Lake of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|American {{exploration}} of the area began in 1851, when <b>prospector</b> Samuel Hancock was led by Indian guides on a canoe up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to logging after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 between the United States government and the Stillaguamish tribe, who were relocated to trust lands and the Tulalip Indian Reservation. The U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence.|$|E
25|$|By Christmas 14,000 <b>prospectors</b> {{were on the}} Tuapeka and Waipori fields. Within a year, the region's {{population}} swelled greatly, {{growing by}} 400 per cent between 1861 and 1864, with <b>prospectors</b> swarming from the dwindling Australian goldfields. Gabriel’s Gully led {{to the discovery of}} further goldfields within Central Otago. A second gold strike in 1862, close to the modern town of Cromwell, did nothing to dissuade new hopefuls, and <b>prospectors</b> and miners staked claims from the Shotover River in the west through to Naseby in the north.|$|R

5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar <b>Prospector</b> spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
5|$|Kinman {{claimed to}} have {{migrated}} to California in 1849 during the great Gold Rush {{and worked as a}} <b>prospector</b> in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but had little to spend it on.|$|E
5|$|Occasional trappers and prospectors visited, {{with one}} <b>prospector,</b> John Moss, making his {{observations}} known in 1873. The following year, Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon, {{at the base}} of Mesa Verde. There, Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling. Geologist William H. Holmes retraced Jackson's route in 1875. Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey, one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites.|$|E

5000|$|In 1880, <b>prospectors</b> Joseph 'Joe' Juneau and Richard Harris {{discovered}} gold in Silver Bow Basin. This brought {{waves of}} <b>prospectors</b> to the region, including John Treadwell, whose first move was {{to purchase a}} lode claim on Douglas Island from Pierre Joseph Erussard ("French Pete") on 13 Sept. 1881.|$|R
5|$|Of the {{estimated}} 30,000 to 40,000 people who reached Dawson City during the gold rush, only around 15,000 to 20,000 finally became prospectors. Of these, {{no more than}} 4,000 struck gold {{and only a few}} hundred became rich. By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before. The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new <b>prospector</b> would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.|$|E
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar <b>Prospector</b> mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} crater that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a Crater of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar <b>Prospector</b> spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater, which may indicate the presence of water ice. The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} oil <b>prospectors</b> travel to an outpost in a jungle {{on the island}} of Mindanao. A rough landing damages the plane. The two <b>prospectors</b> Robert (Massimo Foschi) and Rolf (Ivan Rassimov) find the {{abandoned}} remains of the original prospecting camp. Later, a member of the team goes missing. The two <b>prospectors</b> and their pilot go into the jungle, and the pilot is killed. The two <b>prospectors</b> then discover that the missing team member was eaten by cannibals. After getting separated in the jungle, Robert is kidnapped by a stone-age cannibal tribe. The tribe subjects Robert to various tortures, including tying him up, stripping him nude and fondling his genitals, and repeatedly dropping him with a bungee cord. The cannibals then imprison Robert in a cave, where he is starved.|$|R
