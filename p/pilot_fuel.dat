40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance and}} emissions contours of a hydrogen dual fueled compression ignition (CI) engine with two <b>pilot</b> <b>fuels</b> (diesel and rapeseed methyl ester), and compares the performance and emissions iso-contours of diesel and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) single fueling with diesel and RME <b>piloted</b> hydrogen dual <b>fueling</b> throughout the engines operating speed and power range. The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane. The performance and emission maps are experimentally investigated, compared, and critically discussed. Apart from medium loads at lower and medium speeds with diesel piloted hydrogen combustion, dual fueling produced lower thermal efficiency everywhere across the map. For diesel and RME single fueling the maximum specific NOX emissions are centered at the mid speed, mid power region. Hydrogen dual fueling produced higher specific NOX with both <b>pilot</b> <b>fuels</b> as compared to their respective single fueling operations. The range, location and trends of specific NOX varied significantly when compared to single fueling cases. The volumetric efficiency is discussed in detail with the implications of manifold injection of hydrogen analyzed with the conclusions drawn...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that dual-fuel engines at part load inevitably suffer from lower thermal {{efficiency}} and higher emission of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel. A quasi-two-zone com-bustionmodel hasbeendeveloped for studying the second-lawanalysis of adual-fuel (diesel-gas) engine operating under part load conditions. This quasi-two-zone combustion model is able to establish the development of combustion process with time and associated important operat-ing parameters, such as pressure, temperature, heat release rate, and species concentration. The present study is an attempt to investigate the combustion phenomenon from the second law point of view at part load and increasing <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> quantity is considered to improve the above-mentionedproblems. By employingdifferent quantities of <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel,</b> it is found that increasing the <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> quantity increases the work availability and reduces chemical availability of unburned fuels. Also, the results indicate that, compared to the baseline dual-fuel engine, increasing the <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> quantity in about 12 per cent results in an increase of 23 per cent in availability destruc-tion and 29 per cent in the second law efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{dual fuel}} engine, two fuels are used simultaneously. The primary fuel is usually gaseous forms the major {{content of the}} total energy {{supplied}} to the engine. The secondary fuel, i. e., <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel,</b> is injected after compression of the primary fuel air mixture. Much of the energy release comes from the combustion of the gaseous fuel and {{a small amount of}} diesel fuel provides ignition through timed cylinder injection. In the present work, single-cylinder, compression ignition, direct injection diesel engine has been used for the investigations of exhaust emissions when the engine is operating as a dual-fuel engine using diesel as <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as secondary fuel. The influence of major engine operating parameters, such as the <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> quantity, intake air temperature, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), intake air throttling and rate of injection on the exhaust emissions was investigated. Diesel fuel was used as the <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel,</b> while LPG was used as the main fuel which was inducted in the intake manifold. The experimental investigations showed that the poor exhaust emissions at light loads can be improved by employing larger <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> quantity, using EGR, increasing intake temperature and well adjusted rate of injection...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{the gradual}} {{depletion}} of petroleum and environmental degradation, intensive research activity has been {{addressed to the}} utilization of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines. In the present work, an experimental investigation is carried out to study the effect of eucalyptus biodiesel and natural gas under dual fuel combustion mode on the performance and the exhaust emissions of a single cylinder DI diesel engine. The natural gas (NG) is inducted with the intake air through the inlet manifold. The liquid <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> (eucalyptus biodiesel or diesel fuel) is injected into the combustion chamber to cover approximately 10 % of the maximum power output. Then, keeping constant the <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> flow rate, the power output is further increased using only natural gas. The combustion characteristics (cylinder pressure, ignition delay and heat release rate), performance and exhaust emissions of the dual fuel mode (NG-diesel fuel and NG-biodiesel) are {{compared with those of}} conventional diesel engine mode at various load conditions. The combustion analysis has shown that biodiesel as <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> exhibits similar pressure-time history, with highest peak, as diesel fuel in conventional and dual fuel modes. The performance and pollutant emission results show that, compared to diesel fuel in dual fuel mode, the use of eucalyptus biodiesel as <b>pilot</b> <b>fuel</b> reduces the high emission levels of unburned hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) particularly at high engine loads. However this is accompanied by an increase in the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which {{can be explained by the}} lower calorific value and the oxygen presence in the molecule of the eucalyptus biodiesel, respectively.
