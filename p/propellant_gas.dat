25|$|This {{chemical}} is an inhalational anaesthetic studied only {{in animals}} in 1967, and toxicology investigations did not acknowledge this fact. All hydrofluorocarbon inhaled anaesthetic agents have smooth muscle relaxing properties, so the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> produced by pMDIs using HFA134a and HFA227ea (which has no anaesthetic activity) {{will add to}} beta2-agonist bronchodilating drugs from that inhaler.|$|E
25|$|A {{suppressor}} or silencer is {{a device}} either attached to {{or part of}} the barrel of a firearm {{to reduce the amount of}} noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping <b>propellant</b> <b>gas,</b> and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet. Hiram Percy Maxim, the son of famous machine gun inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis gun was gas operated. A {{portion of}} the {{expanding}} <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> was tapped off from the barrel, driving a piston to the rear against a spring. The piston was fitted with a vertical post at its rear which rode in a helical cam track in the bolt, rotating {{it at the end}} of its travel nearest the breech. This allowed the three locking lugs at the rear of the bolt to engage in recesses in the gun's body to lock it into place. The post also carried a fixed firing pin, which protruded through an aperture in the front of the bolt, firing the next round at the foremost part of the piston's travel.|$|E

50|$|The bolt is {{not locked}} but is pushed {{rearward}} by the expanding <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> {{as in other}} blowback-based designs. However, <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays {{the opening of the}} bolt. It is used by Volkssturmgewehr 1-5 rifle, the Heckler & Koch P7, Steyr GB and Walther CCP pistols.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape of}} the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon {{propelled}} by air {{coming out of a}} tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. Using a convergent/divergent nozzle gives more force since the exhaust also presses on it as it expands outwards, roughly doubling the total force. If <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note {{that in the case of}} liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber -typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} half-hour, the French and British battleships shelled the forts indiscriminately, {{before turning to}} attacking {{individual}} gun batteries. In {{the course of the}} attack on the fortresses, Bouvet sustained eight hits from Turkish artillery fire. Her forward turret was disabled after the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> extractor broke down. One of the shells destroyed one of her masts. At around 15:15, Bouvet struck a mine with a [...] explosive charge, which detonated below the starboard 274mm gun turret. These mines had been freshly laid a week before the attack, and were unknown to the Allies.|$|E
500|$|The 28cm SK L/40 gun weighed , had {{an overall}} length of [...] and its bore length was [...] Although {{designated}} as , its actual caliber was [...] [...] It used Krupp's horizontal sliding block, or [...] "wedge", {{as it is}} sometimes referred to, breech design rather than the interrupted screw used commonly used in heavy guns of other nations. This required that the propellant charge be loaded in a metal case (usually brass) which provides obduration– it seals the breech to prevent escape of the expanding <b>propellant</b> <b>gas.</b> The 28cm SK L/40 was the last large German naval gun to load all its propellant in a single case; later guns required a fore charge {{in addition to the}} main charge in the cartridge case.|$|E
50|$|The M20 {{relied on}} a {{perforated}} artillery shell casing, combined with a rear vented breech using <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> from the firing of a shell, to greatly reduce the recoil of the weapon. It is this use of vented <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> that eliminated {{the need for a}} recoil system, thereby reducing the weight of the launcher and enhancing its use as a light infantry weapon.|$|R

50|$|In many cases, the body's {{absorption}} of the muzzle blast {{will act as}} a suppressor, trapping the <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> under the skin and muffling {{the sound of the}} shot.|$|R
2500|$|Electrothermal {{thrusters}} (electromagnetic {{fields are}} used to generate a plasma to increase {{the heat of the}} bulk propellant, the thermal energy imparted to the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> is then converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle of either physical material construction or by magnetic means) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Lee–Enfield bolt was {{shortened}} to {{feed the}} [...]45 ACP rounds; the Lee–Enfield's magazine set-up was replaced with a new assembly that held a modified M1911 magazine. The bolt operation offered an advantage in that the shooter could refrain from chambering the next round if absolute silence was required after firing. A semi-automatic weapon would not have offered this option as the cycling of the bolt coupled with rearward escaping <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> and the clink of the empty case against any hard surface would produce a noise with each shot. As silent as the carbine was, it was not very accurate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{armature}} may be {{an integral}} part of the projectile, but it may also be configured to accelerate a separate, electrically isolated or non-conducting projectile. Solid, metallic sliding conductors are often the preferred form of railgun armature but [...] "plasma" [...] or [...] "hybrid" [...] armatures can also be used. A plasma armature is formed by an arc of ionised gas that is used to push a solid, non-conducting payload in a similar manner to the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> pressure in a conventional gun. A hybrid armature uses a pair of [...] "plasma" [...] contacts to interface a metallic armature to the gun rails. Solid armatures may also [...] "transition" [...] into hybrid armatures, typically after a particular velocity threshold is exceeded.|$|E
50|$|As {{the shell}} weight {{increases}} {{it becomes more}} difficult to engineer the driving band without the <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> blowing past the driving band or blowing the driving band off the shell.|$|R
50|$|Gas-delayed {{blowback}} {{should not}} be confused with gas-operation. The bolt is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding <b>propellant</b> <b>gases,</b> as in other blowback-based designs. However, <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It was used by some World War II German designs for the 7.92×33mm Kurz cartridge, including the Volkssturmgewehr rifle (with little effectiveness) and the Grossfuss Sturmgewehr (with slightly more efficiency), and after the war by the Heckler & Koch P7, Walther CCP, Steyr GB and M-77B pistols.|$|R
50|$|The primary flash {{is caused}} by <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> exiting the firearm behind the bullet. Although amongst the {{brightest}} of the flashes, {{the heat of the}} primary flash dissipates quickly and thus is no longer visible.|$|R
50|$|Examples: explosive, rocket <b>propellant,</b> <b>gas</b> generator, squib, battery.|$|E
50|$|Some markers use force-fed loaders shaped as {{firearms}} magazines. These are preferred when a {{low profile}} is required, as in woodsball sniper positions. Even more unusual are fully contained magazines, incorporating both a source of <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> and force-fed paintballs.|$|E
5000|$|Electrothermal {{thrusters}} (electromagnetic {{fields are}} used to generate a plasma to increase {{the heat of the}} bulk propellant, the thermal energy imparted to the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> is then converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle of either physical material construction or by magnetic means) ...|$|E
50|$|Chambered for the 8×33 Polte round. It used special 5-round {{stripper}} clips to {{fill the}} internal magazine. The barrel is blown forward by drag of the bullet and <b>propellant</b> <b>gasses</b> and returns under spring pressure, chambering a new cartridge.|$|R
50|$|Two {{ancillary}} {{advantages to}} the suppressor are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash {{is reduced by}} both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of <b>propellant</b> <b>gasses,</b> which can contribute 30-50% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the <b>propellant</b> <b>gasses.</b> This can cause them to function somewhat like a Muzzle booster and thus increase the felt recoil. The weight of suppressor {{and the location of}} that additional weight at the muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due to the location of this mass.|$|R
50|$|Firearms {{featuring}} a direct impingement design {{tend to be}} lighter and shorter, but, are also dirtier, due to the exposure of the firearm's internal moving parts to fouling from cartridge <b>propellant</b> <b>gases.</b> Such firearms are thus potentially less reliable as a result.|$|R
50|$|High pressures, such {{as those}} {{commonly}} encountered in maximum loadings of magnum revolver cartridges or rifle cartridges, often result in significant problems when coupled with cast or swaged lead bullets. It was long thought that the high temperatures melted {{the base of the}} bullet, but this is no longer thought to be the case. Instead, the high pressures allow <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> to escape past the bullet, causing gas cutting, which increases lead deposits in the barrel and unbalances the bullet. A gas check provides a thin layer of harder but still malleable metal on the base of the bullet that obturates to provide a seal and prevents the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> leakage that causes gas cutting, and help the bullet grip the rifling.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound of}} a gunshot may have two sources; the muzzle blast itself, and any sound {{produced}} by a transonic or supersonic projectile. Suppressors help to reduce the level of {{sound of a}} firearm, by providing a large area for the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> to expand and cool before release.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Cross-section {{drawing of}} a US Navy Hush Puppy Mk 2 pistol suppressor, showing {{expansion}} chamber wrapped around inner suppressor assembly, and four wipes. The bullet pushes a bullet-diameter hole through the wipes, trapping <b>propellant</b> <b>gas</b> behind it entirely until the bullet has passed through the wipe completely ...|$|E
50|$|The XM1128 {{consists}} of a high fragmentation steel body with a streamlined ogive and a drag-reducing base burner. The projectile body is filled with insensitive explosive (IMX-101) and a supplementary charge. On gun launch <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> enter the base burner cavity and ignite dual tracer cups in the ignition assembly. The tracer cups then light a composite propellant to sustain the burning at muzzle exit. The roughly three pound base <b>propellant</b> charge <b>gases,</b> ignited during firing, fill the void {{at the base of}} the projectile—this reduces the base drag and results in extended range.|$|R
50|$|Measuring {{the power}} factor {{is a quick}} and easy way to measure recoil, but has some drawbacks. While the power factor {{measures}} {{the momentum of the}} fired bullet, it doesn't take into consideration the firearm weight or the contribution from the ejected <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> which together makes up for the total recoil impulse from the firearm. The contribution from <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> depends on the amount of gunpowder and the effectiveness of any muzzle brake or suppressor. The power factor also doesn't take into consideration any angular momentum or torque, i.e. any lever arm caused by an offset between the bore axis of the firearm to the contact point on the shooter. Also, recoil can alternatively be measured by recoil velocity or recoil energy instead of by recoil impulse.|$|R
50|$|Demetriades' {{proposal}} was further refined by Christopher Jones {{and others in}} 2010. In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> at around 120 km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of orbital power-beaming satellites, to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.|$|R
5000|$|The same {{forces that}} cause the ejecta of a firearm (the projectile(s), <b>propellant</b> <b>gas,</b> wad, sabot, etc.) to move down the barrel also cause all or {{a portion of the}} firearm to move in the {{opposite}} direction. The result is required by the conservation of momentum and is expressed in the formula: ...|$|E
50|$|The working {{principle}} involves electrification of the <b>propellant</b> (<b>gas</b> or water) which {{can then be}} directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical due to the slow speeds at which they generally propel a vessel and {{the large amount of}} energy needed to operate them.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetohydrodynamic}} {{drive or}} MHD propulsor {{is a method}} for propelling seagoing vessels using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts, using magnetohydrodynamics. The working principle involves electrification of the <b>propellant</b> (<b>gas</b> or water) which can then be directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical.|$|E
50|$|As the {{cartridge}} is rimless, the cylinder is fed via full moon clips. The SP-4 cartridges emit no report or flame because the <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> are {{retained in the}} case. The OTs-38 revolver is claimed to be effectively silent as the sound level of the live and dry firing is practically identical.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{cylinder}} is mounted under the barrel and {{fitted with a}} gas regulator with three fixed positions. The gas regulator opens corresponding holes to change the amount of expanding <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> bled off out of the {{gas cylinder}} into the atmosphere, thus varying {{the amount of energy}} transferred on to the long-stroke piston.|$|R
50|$|Bolt thrust or breech {{pressure}} {{is a term}} used in internal ballistics and firearms (whether small arms or artillery) that describes the amount of rearward force exerted by the <b>propellant</b> <b>gases</b> on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity.|$|R
