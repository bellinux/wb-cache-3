5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} the <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> {{power as}} a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in the <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

The selectors named him to lead an Australian Second XI to New Zealand—while the first choice team toured the Indian subcontinent—hoping that he was still good enough to secure a long-term future in the Australian team. The four matches against New Zealand were closely contested. In the first match, Australia were 7/201 in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> 22 for victory when time ran out. In the second fixture, Craig made 70 as the tourists struggled to 8/211 in <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> 262 for victory to hold on for a draw.
