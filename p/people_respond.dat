5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of an}} unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story information and to purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to him and ultimately determine which ending is received.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the sixth century, Pope Gregory the Great notes that there were {{differences}} {{in the way in}} which eastern and western churches sang Kyrie.

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>respond</b> to what {{is present}} – Despite knowing that the media merely provide a {{symbolic}} version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media appears to be {{as if it were}} real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy has consistently {{been shown to}} be the most effective line of treatment for people diagnosed with dysthymia. Working with a psychotherapist to address the causes and effects of the disorder, in addition to taking antidepressants to help eliminate the symptoms, can be extremely beneficial. This combination is often the preferred method of treatment for those who have dysthymia. Looking at various studies involving treatment for dysthymia, 75% of <b>people</b> <b>responded</b> positively to a {{combination of}} cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy, whereas only 48% of <b>people</b> <b>responded</b> positively to just CBT or medication alone.|$|R
25|$|Only {{a subset}} of <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to {{androgen}} signaling blocking drugs and certain cells with characteristics resembling stem cells remain unaffected. Therefore, the desire to improve outcome of people with CRPC {{has resulted in the}} claims of increasing doses further or combination therapy with synergistic androgen signaling blocking agents. But even these combination will not affect stem-like cells that do not exhibit androgen signaling. It is possible that for further advances, a combination of androgen signaling blocking agent with stem-like cell directed differentiation therapy drug would prove ideal.|$|E
25|$|A Post-traumatic stress {{spectrum}} or {{trauma and}} loss spectrum. Work {{in this area}} has sought {{to go beyond the}} DSM category and consider in more detail a spectrum of severity of symptoms (rather than just presence or absence for diagnostic purposes), as well as a spectrum in terms {{of the nature of the}} stressor (e.g. the traumatic incident) and a spectrum of how <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to trauma. This identifies a significant amount of symptoms and impairment below threshold for DSM diagnosis but nevertheless important, and potentially also present in other disorders a person might be diagnosed with.|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E

A total 485 <b>people</b> <b>responded</b> before treatment and 163 <b>people</b> <b>responded</b> after completing treatment. People have deep rooted convictions that the 'hospital' {{is the best place}} to be seen for the treatment of their accident or perceived emergency, together with a considerable loyalty and emotional attachment to it. Few people knew that Urgent Care facilities existed within the Emergency Department and fewer what they were for. Some were frustrated at the apparent speed of access to care by those with apparently trivial problems, not understanding that they were accessing a different service. On the whole people who attended were happy with the advice and treatment they received. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
500|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the yellow}} crystal, players can {{converse}} with Previously Living Sentient Beings or [...] "PLSBs". Conversations provide players with puzzle information, strategies for defeating monsters, and story background. Rather than relying on a branching tree of conversation options, players type keywords into a dialogue box. When a certain keyword (typically found in a previous statement by the dead person in question) is entered, the dead person will give a response. The manual gives a starting point by mentioning that all dead <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to [...] "name" [...] and [...] "death", by giving their name and describing how they died, respectively.|$|E

Salazar also disputed the PTC's official membership figure of 1.3 million and estimated that at most 12,000 <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to annual fundraisers. Although Salazar stated that he left the PTC in November 2009, the PTC said that it fired Salazar and that Salazar was trying to extort money from the organization.|$|E

Next, in [...] "Footing", Goffman addresses the way that footing, or alignment, can shift during a conversation. The fourth essay, [...] "The Lecture", originally an oral presentation, describes different types and methods of lecture. Lastly, in [...] "Radio Talk", Goffman describes the types and forms of talk used in radio programming and the effect they have on listeners.|$|E

500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that <b>people</b> <b>respond</b> to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts". [...] The film grossed over $115million worldwide. McAdams won an MTV Movie Award and four Teen Choice Awards. Entertainment Weekly {{has said that the}} movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses.
