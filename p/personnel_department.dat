40|$|<b>Personnel</b> <b>departments</b> {{often have}} {{particular}} responsibility for equal opportunities within their organizations. This paper explores equal opportunities within <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> themselves, {{in relation to}} the careers of ethnic minority personnel practitioners. Through primary research, it identifies a range of criteria which can affect personnel careers, of which ethnic origin is often one. However, although being categorized as of ethnic minority origin often hinders personnel careers, the paper reveals that it is sometimes possible for individuals who are so categorized to overcome that negative effect through demonstrating some of those other criteria. Thus, the paper suggests, it is not just organisational equal opportunities practices which may provide hope for ethnic minority personnel careers but also – and perhaps more importantly – the actions of the ethnic minority individuals themselves. Ways in which <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> might support these actions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between ethnic origin and inclusion in British <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> {{has never been}} fully explored or explained. This thesis draws upon an exploratory questionnaire survey of personnel practitioners of ethnic minority origin, and case studies of <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> in five organisations in Britain, to identify how and why people are included in British <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> {{and the role of}} ethnic origin in determining that inclusion. In order to do this the thesis draws upon a range of models of inequality, including both Marxist and Weberian. For various reasons, however - such as a failure to overcome the separation of action and structure, an inability to articulate change, and a failure to recognise that closure is an ongoing process - none of the existing models are found to be able to articulate or explain filly the processes and structures of inclusion identified by the research. The thesis therefore develops a new model, focusing upon the microlevel, which overcomes the limitations of those existing models. The research reveals that inclusion is afforded to those who are able to symbolise to those with power over inclusion the type of potential which the latter parties desire them to possess. The ethnic categorisation individuals are accorded, it is shown, can function as one such symbol. However, where ethnic categorisation would not symbolise the potential desired, individuals may win inclusion by ensuring that they are categorised according to other criteria. Differences in inclusion between different <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> are found to reflect the relative power of different parties in the organisations concerned to ensure that those included in <b>personnel</b> <b>departments</b> symbolise to them the type of potential which they desire of them. As a consequence, the {{relationship between}} ethnic minority categorisation and inclusion, and between other criteria and inclusion, can vary between different departments and different situations. The model thus permits explanation of who is included in a particular part of an organisation and how that inclusion has been achieved...|$|R

25|$|Following Laker's {{departure}} from BUA, Max Stuart-Shaw was appointed as BUA's new MD. Stuart-Shaw {{was a former}} senior manager at Central African Airways. His brief was to oversee the successful implementation of the board's original policy decision taken in the early 1960s to transform BUA into a scheduled airline. Although Laker had largely succeeded in welding the various constituent airlines that made up BUA into a single, integrated enterprise {{towards the end of}} his tenure while ensuring the business remained profitable, it lacked the quality of a frontline scheduled carrier. Despite the growth in scheduled activities during that period, the airline was still perceived as mainly a charter and freight operator. When Stuart-Shaw took over from Laker, he strengthened BUA's management organisation by developing the <b>personnel</b> <b>department,</b> expanding the planning unit, as well as reorganising operations and engineering. He also improved the quality of the airline's marketing.

25|$|The {{war ended}} in May 1945 and after nearly {{twelve years of}} exile, Ewald Munschke {{returned}} in September {{of the same year}} to Berlin, where there was no longer anything left of his parents' house. The eastern part of the city was under Soviet control: Munschke re-registered his Communist Party membership and was almost immediately given a job within the local party organisation before being appointed, in April 1946, to a position as Communist Party Secretary in the Berlin Police. He remained with the Berlin police department till 1949. In the meantime the German Communist Party was abolished later in April 1946 {{as a result of a}} controversial merger with the more moderately left-wing SPD (party). Within the Soviet occupation zone this established the basis for a return to one-party government. Communist Party members, along with those from the SPD, were invited to sign their membership across to the new SED party, and many did so. Ewald Munschke's own SED Party membership card is dated 1 May 1946.
