40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} the {{upcoming}} BIM based work paradigm and related technologies in the AEC sector traditional semi- and unstructured documents, like formwork or reinforcement drawings, will remain {{an essential part of}} the overall project information resources. Such kind of documents are still the basis of the daily work in construction projects and are, in contrast to a BIM, valid as mandatory objects of agreement and integral parts of contracts. Therefore <b>document</b> <b>management</b> will remain a crucial part of the overall project management. Based on the fact that in the frames of practical <b>projects</b> traditional <b>documents</b> will coexist together with model-based building information the existing technological separation between those different worlds of information is counterproductive and out-of-time since it may cause information losses, inconsistent information resources and hinders an adequate and project wide adoption of BIM technologies. The aim of this work is to develop a practical method that allows for the use of IFC building information models within a database-driven project management environment to make model-based building information available for <b>project</b> and <b>document</b> <b>management</b> purposes. The proposed method will establish an integrated overall project information resource constituted by a persistent linkage between elements of the building model and the associated documents...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Owner {{companies}} should consider {{all elements of}} <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> during a <b>project’s</b> life cycle, identify shortcomings and address them successfully to ensure successful completion of projects and ultimately to also ensure legal compliance as stipulated by contractual agreements. Proper governance during the execution of projects involves, amongst others, the establishment of structures and processes, with appropriate checks and balances built into these structures and processes, to enable all stakeholders {{to be in a}} position to have access to relevant documentation. Executing projects makes a huge demand on the flow and management of project related documentation through the different phases of these projects. The research, as documented in this dissertation, investigates and evaluates whether Sasol Technology, as the project execution agent for the Sasol Business Units, has efficient governing <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> processes and procedures in place to support the successful execution of capital projects. Sasol Technology uses a stage gate model, associated with project life cycles, as a systematic approach for the execution of capital <b>projects.</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> is a new business function that was established in 2008. Not all the functions involved in the life cycle of project execution are fully aligned with the central function managing documentation. There is thus a need for a fully integrated <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> System, involving all the functions of Sasol which are involved during the different phases of project execution. The literature study analyses existing world best <b>document</b> <b>management</b> and records management practices and procedures and points out that meticulous and strict <b>document</b> and records <b>management</b> practices form the backbone of organisational authentic evidence compliance. The research design method that was chosen to authenticate the research question is an Exploratory Qualitative Approach, combined with a Descriptive Approach. Results are obtained from a combination of three methods. Published and available existing data of how documents are managed in Sasol was gathered and secondary findings are established. Focused and structured interviews were then conducted with experienced team members from the different functions involved in project execution and lastly, e-mail administrated questionnaires were developed and distributed to relevant project team members within Sasol Technology to assess the current system and to determine additional requirements for an enhanced <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> System, specifically applicable to owner companies in the project execution environment. Whereas the scrutiny of the secondary sources provides a background and the progress iii made with regard to setting requirements for a standardised <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> System for the execution of projects in the Sasol Technology and some of the other Sasol Business Units, the primary data findings indicate how the project team members perceive the existing Sasol Technology <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> System to be. Key findings include, that documentation life cycle management is not fully developed and needs to be addressed in the Sasol Technology project execution environment. Furthermore, integration of the documentation management of the various departments, functions and structures in Sasol will enable better and improved management of project documentation. The specific output of this dissertation is the recommendation of an improved <b>Document</b> <b>Management</b> System to allow the different functions within Sasol Technology and some other Sasol Business Units to have access to an integrated system, included in it all relevant documentation requirements during the life cycle of projects. An added deliverable is a framework of requirements to be included in a <b>document</b> <b>management</b> philosophy, not only for Sasol, but also for other owner companies during project execution.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{maritime}} products {{is characterized by}} increasing product-complexity, price reduction, price transparency, company spanning offers and increasing competitiveness. For survival under difficult market conditions {{it is necessary to}} face up to these requirements. The suppliers are forced to re-configure their collaboration processes towards shipyards and sub-suppliers to achieve competitiveness. The shipyards and the major suppliers are demanding products with fewer interfaces and less coordination for implementation into modern ships and major products. Companies are changing their product portfolio and the ability to act on demand. Especially small and medium sized companies collaborate with other companies and are combining related products together. Analysing the collaboration process it has shown that the organisational and technological processes are badly coordinated. Project-workflow, resoruce-allocation and data-exchange have the main influence on coordination and are highly responsible for successful production. Supporting the main influence factors will achieve high economic growth. Therefore, companies can easily gain benefits by using Web-Based-Management-Tools. These management tools are standardised and provide a wide range of components, including <b>project</b> <b>management,</b> <b>document</b> <b>management</b> and purchase management. Adjusted to the requirements of maritime suppliers these tools can currently be used. The implemented web-based management tools are established and will be discussed in this article. The major opportunities for implementation will be derived and a way will be shown how these tools can work efficiently to achieve a huge benefit for maritime suppliers...|$|R

By drawing on the Luhmann’s theory of social systems (1995; 2000) as well as the distinction between media and genres of organizational communication (Yates & Orlikowski, 1992), it can be shown that the application of PowerPoint presentations in project documentation leads to the emergence of a genre conflict between consistency and contingency-centered modes of communication. From a knowledge management perspective, the focus on a consistent narrative can be considered as suboptimal if mistakes and alternatives to decisions are masked – all of which can embed highly relevant knowledge for future decisions on similar project matters...|$|R

Different studies investigated methods and models to optimize the operational management of the construction phase. Concerning workers’ health and safety protection most of them focused {{on the development of}} on-site and in real-time control systems. Therefore, the authors identified the exigency of a prevention information system based on workers’ involvement. To reach the aim three objectives have been identified: (1) the check of workers’ training, (2) the definition of works operational procedures and (3) the schematization of the assembly/disassembly/use of site equipment and temporary structures. The developed system is characterized by a synergic application of BIM model and QR-code and it has been applied on a case study. At the same time a questionnaire has been developed and proposed to different subjects of the construction sector in order to evaluate the potential use of BIM model and QR-code. The field test has allowed to demonstrate the practical use of the tool, enhancing communication between the Client technical structure, the General contractor and sub-contractors, improving workers’ integration and participation and allowing a better availability of on-site health and safety information and documents...|$|R

40|$|Design {{processes}} in chemical engineering {{are hard to}} support. In particular, this applies to conceptual design and basic engineering, in which the fundamental decisions concerning the plant design are performed. The design process is highly creative, many design alternatives are explored, and both unexpected and planned feedback occurs frequently. As a consequence, it is inherently difficult to manage design processes, i. e. to coordinate the effort of experts working on tasks such as creation of flow diagrams, steady-state and dynamic simulations, etc. On the other hand, proper management is crucial {{because of the large}} economic impact of the performed design decisions. We present a management system which takes the difficulties mentioned above into account by supporting the coordination of dynamic design processes. The management system equally covers products, activities, and resources, and their mutual relationships. With respect to coverage and integration, and with respect to the dynamics of design processes, the functionality of the management system goes considerably beyond commercial <b>project,</b> <b>document,</b> and workflow <b>management</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} {{industry is a}} knowledge intensive industry. Thousands of documents are generated by construction <b>projects.</b> <b>Documents,</b> as information carriers, must be managed effectively to ensure successful project management. The fact that a single project can produce thousands of documents and {{that a lot of}} the documents are generated in a textual/unstructured format greatly complicates the task of information <b>management.</b> Conventionally, <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> are organized based on classifying documents according to fixed/predefined classes and document metadata, e. g. according to <b>document</b> type, originator, <b>project</b> attribute, specification division, date, etc. While such classification method is easy to implement, it is only advantageous for document search and retrieval if the document seeker has prior knowledge of the content of the document corpus. In many cases and for various project management activities this is not the case, resulting in frustration of the search task with delayed or incomplete search results. ^ An alternative framework for organizing <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> based on document content is proposed. The framework takes into account important characteristics of construction <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> and leverages such characteristics to facilitate document search and retrieval. The premise for the framework is the fact that documents are not produced haphazardly, but are generated as a result of certain events or circumstances occurring in the <b>project.</b> As such <b>documents</b> can be linked to each other on the semantic level; a point that is overlooked by <b>document</b> <b>management</b> systems which generally manage documents in vacuo by disregarding or failing to utilize such semantic connections between the <b>documents.</b> Organizing <b>project</b> <b>documents</b> based on the semantic relations that exist between them (revealed from the document content and not just the document attributes) facilitates information retrieval and retains the knowledge of the actual project participants, thereby supporting knowledge reuse. ^ Another aspect of the thesis investigates the use of document content analysis to enable automated <b>document</b> <b>management.</b> If textual similarities between documents correlate with what human users recognize through their semantic abilities, then content analysis of documents can be used to automatically organize documents according to the proposed framework. Text classifiers based on machine learning techniques were evaluated to determine their performance in identifying which group of semantically-similar documents a test document belongs. Also, an unsupervised learning method was adapted and evaluated for the task of clustering documents based on textual similarity into sets of documents that are semantically related. The purpose of such evaluations is to equip electronic <b>document</b> <b>management</b> systems with content analysis capabilities that facilitate document search and retrieval. ...|$|R
