40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} production of cellulase in low cost medium by thermotolerant yeast. After screening, an efficient yeast isolate having capability of C 1 (exo-gluconase) and Cx (endo-gluconase) production was isolated and designated as strain R- 1. Maximum enzyme production was achieved at 50 °C, pH 5. 5 in the medium containing bagasse powder 4 % (w/v), and ammonium sulphate 0. 1 % (w/v) after 72 hours of incubation. The composition containing bagasse powder, 4 % (w/v); ammonium sulphate, 0. 5 % (w/v); and glucose, 0. 5 % (w/v) achieved better production after complete medium optimization. The yeast isolate was able to tolerate wide ranges of temperature, pH, and substrate concentration for higher enzyme production. The isolated yeast was able to produce C 1 (exo-gluconase) and Cx (endo-gluconase) enzymes in appropriate concentrations on a crude cellulosic substrate.

40|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of growing interest {{in the development of}} low carbon alternatives to petroleum derived liquid fuels, this paper provides an analysis of earlier experiences of the emergence and evolution of alternative liquid fuels. We argue such analyses can provide useful insights for future energy transitions and in particular the governance of such transitions. This paper focusses on two alternatives to petrol manufactured in the UK during the inter-war period (1918 - 1938). The two fuels were <b>power</b> <b>alcohol,</b> made by the Distillers Company Ltd. (DCL) and sold as Discol between 1921 and 1973, and a petrol-from-coal made by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (ICI), which was blended with petroleum derived petrol and sold between 1935 and 1958. Here we examine the background to the emergence of these fuels, the actors involved and their combined roles. We find both fuels received government support during a time of rapid growth in the motor industry, fluctuating economic conditions, fears of absolute oil shortages, and the desire to develop the UK’s chemical industry. Both fuels were considerably affected by changing political thinking around energy security and oil major hegemony; governance of fuel distribution in particular had significant effects on both fuels. We discuss how changing modes of governance, between market and state logics, created hybrid governance conditions. These conditions reflected state intervention to support new fuels and a failure to regulate the market for fuel distribution. Therefore, whilst hybrid governance provided government with the flexibility to respond quickly to changing circumstances, unresolved tensions between policies made it more difficult for alternative fuels to thrive...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the role of {{economic}} resources, status compatibility, and alcohol consumption on forms of nonphysical abuse, such as controlling and emotional abuse. Specifically, we focus on the connections between women’s employment, the employment of their partners, alcohol use, and women’s risk of abuse in intimate relationships. We hypothesize that women in intimate relationships with men will experience more emotional abuse to the extent that they are economically vulnerable. Moreover, abuse should increase if their employment status, in relation to that of their partner, challenges the man’s marital <b>power.</b> Moreover, <b>alcohol</b> use by women and/or their partners is also predicted to be associated with emotional abuse. We find some support for assertions that socioeconomic deprivation, as well as challenges to men’s masculinity, is associated with emotionally abusive male partners. However, the prevalence and amount of alcohol use by the male partner stands out as the most consistent predictor of emotional abuse in heterosexual relationships...|$|R

40|$|International audienceObjective: To {{identify}} {{the emergence of}} luxury as a marketing trend within the alcohol industry and discuss its implications for public health. Methods: Review of the literature regarding luxury marketing {{and the impact of}} alcohol marketing; monitoring of relevant marketing activities within the alcohol industry and systematic review of market strategy related documents. Results: The industry utilizes luxury as a vehicle and theme to construct promotional strategies in the French market. The specific codes of luxury branding techniques are used by marketers to design alcohol marketing strategies in terms of product design, packaging, advertising and public relations activities. Conclusion: Luxury appears as an Current marketing trend, in order to contextualize the alcohol offer. The literature has investigated and found evidence of relation between exposure to alcohol marketing and consumption behaviors. However this paper questions the role and effects of alcohol marketing contents on perceptions and intentions to behave, so far poorly explored.

40|$|Substituent {{effects on}} {{intramolecular}} radiationless deactivation and hydrogen-bonding-induced quenching {{have been examined}} for various fluorenone derivatives. In toluene, triplet formation is the dominant process from the singlet excited state when an electron-withdrawing group {{is attached to the}} fluorenone moiety, whereas an electron-donating substituent promotes internal conversion. There is a clear correlation between the internal conversion rate constant and the lowest excited singlet state energy, which can be explained in terms of the energy gap law. It is shown that both the electron-donating character of the substituent in the excited fluorenone and the hydrogen-bonding <b>power</b> of <b>alcohol</b> play important roles in determining the rate of dynamic quenching by alcohols. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding with alcohols in the singlet excited state acts as an effective accepting mode of radiationless deactivation for fluorenones substituted with an electron-donating group. However, 2 -NO 2 - and 2 -COOCH 3 - derivatives are poorly quenched by alcohols. The parallel change of the hydrogen-bonding-induced quenching rate constants and the dipole moment difference between the ground and the singlet excited states suggests that the electron density around the carbonyl oxygen controls the quenching rate in the series of 2 -substituted fluorenones...|$|R
40|$|The {{predictive}} <b>power</b> of <b>alcohol</b> abstinence self-efficacy on drinking outcomes {{has been}} widely studied, yet important questions remain {{about the nature and}} conditions of its impact. The present study evaluated whether the effect of alcohol abstinence self-efficacy measured {{at the end of an}} alcohol treatment program was moderated by reported utilization of behavioral processes of change. It was hypothesized that self-efficacy would be differentially important in predicting quantity and frequency of drinking post-treatment depending upon level of behavioral processes used, such that the relation between self-efficacy and outcomes would be stronger for individuals who reported low levels of processes. Data were analyzed from Project MATCH, a large, multisite alcohol treatment study. A significant curvilinear relation between end-of-treatment self-efficacy and 6 - and 12 -month post-treatment drinking outcomes was found, and as hypothesized, this relation was moderated by level of behavioral processes of change. Self-efficacy had a stronger impact on quantity and frequency of post-treatment drinking when low levels of behavioral processes were reported than when high levels were used. Individual behavioral processes were also examined, and the moderated relation was strongest for processes related to managing cues, reinforcements, and conditioned responses. These findings have importance treatment implications and highlight the complex nature of self-efficacy's impact on drinking outcomes...|$|R
