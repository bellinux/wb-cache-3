5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who <b>padlocked</b> the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Seymour {{arrived in}} Los Angeles on February 22, 1906, and {{within two days}} was preaching at Julia Hutchins' church {{at the corner of}} Ninth Street and Santa Fe Avenue. During his first sermon, he preached that {{speaking}} in tongues was the first biblical evidence of the inevitable infilling in the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, March 4, he returned to the church and found that Hutchins had <b>padlocked</b> the door. Elders of the church rejected Seymour's teaching, primarily because he had not yet experienced the blessing about which he was preaching. Condemnation of his message also came from the Holiness Church Association of Southern California with which the church had affiliation. However, not all members of Hutchins' church rejected Seymour's preaching. He was invited to stay in the home of congregation member Edward S. Lee, and he began to hold Bible studies and prayer meetings there.|$|E
5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart <b>padlocked</b> the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E
50|$|After April 13, 2007, couples had to {{stop this}} habit because that day the lamppost, due to the weight of all <b>padlocks,</b> {{partially}} collapsed. However, couples decided to attach their <b>padlocks</b> elsewhere. In fact, all around the bridge, road posts and even garbage bins {{have been used to}} place these love <b>padlocks.</b> As an online replacement, a web site has been created allowing couples to use virtual <b>padlocks.</b> In 2007, the mayor of Rome introduced a 50 euro fine on couples found attaching <b>padlocks</b> to the bridge. Similar love <b>padlocks</b> traditions have appeared in Italy and the rest of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>padlock</b> is {{composed}} of a body, shackle, and locking mechanism. The typical shackle is a [...] "U" [...] shaped loop of metal (round or square in cross-section) that encompasses what is being secured by the <b>padlock</b> (e.g., chain link or hasp). Generally, most <b>padlock</b> shackles either swing away (typical of older <b>padlocks)</b> or slide out of the <b>padlock</b> body when in the unlocked position. Less common designs include a straight, circular, or flexible (cable) shackle. Some shackles split apart and come together to lock and unlock.|$|R
50|$|On 17 May 1727, 66-year-old Smith (using {{the name}} John Wilson) was found {{stealing}} a <b>padlock.</b> Two watchmen {{had seen him}} and another man trying to steal the <b>padlock,</b> so they went up to investigate. The other man escaped, but Smith was found with eight picklock keys. Smith attempted {{to get rid of}} the <b>padlock,</b> although the <b>padlock</b> was later found in the 'Channel'.|$|R
25|$|An early form of {{advertising}} occurred in 1911 when Tetley challenged escape artist Harry Houdini {{to escape from}} a <b>padlocked</b> metal cask of ale. Houdini accepted this challenge; however, it proved {{too much for him}} and he had to be rescued from the cask.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Padlocks</b> {{have been}} used in China since the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). According to Hong-Sen Yan, {{director}} of the National Science and Technology Museum, early Chinese <b>padlocks</b> were mainly [...] "key-operated locks with splitting springs, and partially keyless letter combination locks". <b>Padlocks</b> were made from bronze, brass, silver, and other materials. The use of bronze was more prevalent for the early Chinese <b>padlocks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of <b>padlock</b> locking mechanisms: {{integrated}} & modular. Integrated locking mechanisms directly engage the <b>padlock's</b> shackle with the tumblers. Examples of integrated locking mechanisms are rotating disks (found in [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style <b>padlocks</b> where a disk rotated by the key enters a notch cut into the shackle to block it from moving) or lever tumblers (where {{a portion of the}} bolt that secures the shackle enters the tumblers when the correct key is turned in the lock). <b>Padlocks</b> with integrated locking mechanisms are characterized by a design that does not allow disassembly of the <b>padlock.</b> They are usually older than <b>padlocks</b> with modular mechanisms and often require the use of a key to lock.|$|R

25|$|Eventually, BAP hired Philippine senator Jinggoy Estrada, son {{of former}} Philippine President Joseph Estrada, as its president. One of Estrada's first moves was to try and {{convince}} the POC to reinstate the BAP and also asked the Philippine Sports Commission to open the <b>padlocked</b> BAP office. However, those requests were denied, but Estrada was given explanation by POC President Jose Cojuangco about {{the reasons for the}} BAP expulsion.|$|E
25|$|The locks {{are usually}} manned during the {{cruising}} season from Easter to October and <b>padlocked</b> outside operating hours. This {{is done to}} prevent water shortages due to misuse and to ensure a balance between those wishing to ascend and descend. There can be lengthy delays at busy times but the actual transit should take approximately 45 minutes to one hour to complete; it is made quicker {{by the fact that}} the locks are narrow beam and the gates are light.|$|E
25|$|On New Years Day, Benny has <b>padlocked</b> the apartment, but Angel {{breaks the}} lock with a garbage can. Mark takes {{a job at}} Buzzline, the {{television}} news program he sold his riot footage to. After another fight, Maureen proposes to Joanne; the relationship ends when Maureen flirts with another woman at the engagement party ("Take Me or Leave Me"). After being persuaded by Mimi, his ex-girlfriend, Benny gives the group back their apartment. Over the following year, Roger grows distrustful of Mimi, and their relationship ends ("Without You"). Angel's condition gets worse and she dies in Collins' arms. At Angel's funeral, the group goes their separate ways after a bitter argument ("I'll Cover You/Goodbye Love").|$|E
5000|$|A love lock or love <b>padlock</b> is a <b>padlock</b> which sweethearts lock to a bridge, fence, gate, {{monument}} {{or similar}} public fixture to symbolize their love.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{molecular}} inversion probes (MIP) originated from <b>padlock</b> probes, a molecular biology technique first reported by Nilsson et al. in 1994 [...] [...] Similar to MIP, <b>padlock</b> probes are single stranded DNA molecules with two 20-nucleotide long segments complementary to the target connected by a 40-nucleotide long linker sequence. When the target complementary regions are hybridized to the DNA target, the <b>padlock</b> probes also become circularized. However, unlike MIP, <b>padlock</b> probes are designed such that the target complementary regions span the entire target region upon hybridization, leaving no gaps. Thus, <b>padlock</b> probes are only useful for detecting DNA molecules with known sequences.|$|R

25|$|Despite being closed after fire lookouts were {{no longer}} needed in 1990, its {{staircase}} and cab remained easily accessible to visitors and it was frequently climbed to provide a 360-degree view not normally found in the Catskills. Later, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which administers the Forest Preserve, decided that instead of tearing it down matching funds should be raised from the nearby communities to renovate and reopen it, {{along with the other}} four remaining towers in the Catskills, to educate the public and enhance its understanding of the Forest Preserve. In 1997 it was further protected when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and after renovations it was reopened to the public in 2000.

25|$|Over {{the next}} several months, nearly 40 TWUA locals {{representing}} 20,000 members—about 2 percent of the union's membership—attempted to disaffiliate from the national union and join the AFL. The secession movement was a national one, involving locals in Canada, Maine, the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. Rieve accused Baldanzi and the dissident locals of dual unionism. Rieve induced CIO president Philip Murray to threaten wholesale raiding of AFL unions if the UTW accepted the breakaway locals into that union. Rieve suspended local officials, trusteed local unions, impounded local union funds and <b>padlocked</b> local union offices, and sent national staff into wavering locals to shore up support for the TWUA. By August, more than 50,000 TWUA members had left the union for the UTW. But Rieve's actions blunted the secession movement. High-level talks between AFL and CIO leaders eventually {{put a stop to}} the raids.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{greatest}} works from this period {{is a series of}} murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, he painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Along the opposite wall he painted what he called the “Seven Climates,” in the sense of “a belt of the earth’s surface contained between two given parallels of latitude.” The Gulf Coast—Ocean Springs in particular - is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Another, smaller mural, painted around the same time but discovered only after his death on the wooden walls of a <b>padlocked</b> room in his cottage at Shearwater, is inspired by Psalm 104. It is a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the 'Walter Anderson Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, if f is a trapdoor function, {{then there}} exists some secret information y, such that given f(x) and y, {{it is easy}} to compute x. Consider a <b>padlock</b> and its key. It is trivial to change the <b>padlock</b> from open to closed without using the key, by pushing the shackle into the lock mechanism. Opening the <b>padlock</b> easily, however, requires the key to be used. Here the key is the trapdoor and the <b>padlock</b> is the trapdoor function.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{protection}} to a personnel {{working in the}} depot was provided using <b>padlocks.</b> Staff would fit these <b>padlocks</b> onto the signal control panel before starting work.

5000|$|Die-casting {{became popular}} in the early 1930s among lock makers. Not only was it a very {{inexpensive}} way to make <b>padlocks,</b> but it allowed designers to design <b>padlocks</b> with {{a broad range of}} geometrical features and ornate designs that sand casting and machining wouldn't allow. Some lock makers, like Junkunc Brothers, augmented their machined solid body <b>padlock</b> products with the less expensive and more attractive die-cast bodied <b>padlocks.</b> The Wise Lock Company embraced this new medium in making a novel <b>padlock</b> that, with the key inserted, would split lengthwise along the body in order to create an opening in the shackle. Chicago Lock pioneered their new [...] "double bitted wafer" [...] and [...] "ACE" [...] products by installing them into a die cast body. With the advent of inexpensive machining done overseas and the overall poor perception of the security of die cast locks, they no longer dominate today's <b>padlock</b> market.|$|R

40|$|<b>Padlock</b> probes are {{effective}} tools for specific and sensitive detection of DNA. The main hurdle restricting their popularity is {{the difficulties in}} synthesizing them. This study was aimed to develop a protocol based on ligation and gene synthesis methods to achieve: Firstly, generation of <b>padlocks</b> much longer than 100 bases to enable incorporation of new functions, secondly simple and cost-effective protocol, thirdly high yield and fourth opportunity to incorporate repetitive and other functional sequences using module-like building blocks. 120 bases of <b>padlocks</b> in extremely high yield, phosphorylated and with sequence specific ends were successfully synthesized using ligation and polymerase reactions. Repeated sequences were introduced to realize the use of <b>padlocks</b> as a new DNA amplification system. Difficulties in synthesizing <b>padlocks</b> with repetitive sequences were confirmed as several modifications of the protocols {{did not lead to}} the desired result. But finally, hybridization and ligation reactions were used to construct 205 bases long <b>padlock</b> with a threefold repetitive sequence inserted in to the non-target specific part of the probe...|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, love <b>padlocks</b> {{appearing}} {{along the}} Wild Pacific Trail in Ucluelet on Vancouver Island, have caused controversy as some regard {{them as a}} distraction from nature.

Ottawa's Corktown Footbridge has also attracted love locks.|$|R
5000|$|Smokehouse locks, {{designed}} in England, were formed from wrought iron sheet and employed simple lever and ward mechanisms. These locks afforded little protection against forced and surreptitious entry. Contemporary with the smokehouse <b>padlocks</b> and {{originating in the}} Slavic areas of Europe, [...] "screw key" [...] <b>padlocks</b> opened with a helical key that was threaded into the keyhole. The key pulled the locking bolt open against a strong spring. <b>Padlocks</b> that offered more key variance were {{the demise of the}} screw lock.

500|$|Joseph T. Parkinson {{designed}} and built the houses in Montagu Square {{as part of the}} Portman Estate, between 1810 and 1815. It was named after the Yorkshire-born Elizabeth Montagu: a social reformer, patron of the arts, salonist, literary critic, and writer. She had lived nearby, in Montagu House, Portman Square, until her death on 25August1800. The square is an example of Regency terrace residential architecture that was popular in the 19th century, with a communal garden located in the centre; surrounded by iron railings and <b>padlocked</b> so its use would be limited to residents. No.34 was built as one of the square's many tall buildings which were originally intended for use as whole family homes instead of apartments. A Victorian writer was especially caustic when talking about the architecture: [...] "Montagu Square and Bryanston Square are twin deformities, [...] economical modern builders ... dispose of with profit to those who wish to live near the great".|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{presence}} was controversial in racially charged Florida. As {{he was not}} allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as [...] "Dodgertown" [...] did not open until spring 1948), scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach. In Jacksonville, the stadium was <b>padlocked</b> shut without warning on game day, by order of the city's Parks and Public Property director. In DeLand, a scheduled day game was postponed, ostensibly because of issues with the stadium's electrical lighting.|$|E
500|$|Within 48 {{hours of}} taking over, Butler {{organized}} raids {{on more than}} 900 speakeasies, ordering them <b>padlocked</b> and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, {{as well as on}} drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, [...] "I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns [...] in this city, go out and get some." [...] Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, the raids continued for several weeks.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{machining}} metal was {{a method}} that was available to lock makers since the early 19th century, it was not economically feasible to do so until the very early 20th century when electrical generation and distribution became widespread. Some of the earliest <b>padlocks</b> (c. 1905) that were made from a machined block of cast or extruded metal resemble today's modern <b>padlock.</b> Corbin and Eagle {{were one of the}} first lock makers to machine a solid block of metal and insert a relatively new pin tumbler mechanism and a sliding shackle into the holes machined into the body. This style of <b>padlock</b> was both strong and easy to manufacture. Many machined body <b>padlocks</b> were designed to be disassembled so that locksmiths could easily fit the locks to a certain key. The machined body <b>padlocks</b> are still very popular today. The process of machining allows many modern <b>padlocks</b> to have a [...] "shroud" [...] covering the shackle, which is an extension of the body around the shackle to protect the shackle from getting sheared or cut.|$|R
