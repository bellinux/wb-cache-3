40|$|Currently, {{the use of}} {{aluminum}} alloy which is light weighted is increasing. Extruded aluminum profiles are used as automobile frame parts for higher stiffness and light weight. However, {{few studies have been}} performed on die forming technology of extruded materials which productivity can be much increased with. In this study, die forming processes with precision dies have been designed to manufacture automobile control arm and subframe parts using aluminum extruded profiles. Computer aided analyses have been conducted for the designed processes by the commercial FEM code, DEFORM- 3 D. From the results of the computational analysis, process planning and forming analysis will be completed by using the extruded profiles. And then, forming dies for each process were designed and <b>pilot</b> <b>products</b> of subframe parts and control arms were manufactured by the verified forming process. In addition, some of the important features of design parameters in the die forming were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Like {{many other}} {{creative}} industries, the book publishing industry {{is experiencing a}} shift away from the physical into the digital. This fundamental change impels firms to examine their products and competences, and look at how they stand {{in relation to the}} new technology. Through a case study of Norway’s three largest book publishers; Gyldendal, Aschehoug and CappelenDamm, this thesis investigates how the Norwegian publishing industry think of, and respond to, the internet paradigm, high uncertainty and digitalisation. The data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with managers from both educational and general departments, and so reflects on both these markets, and their relation. The thesis finds that publishers in Norway have come relatively far in developing digital <b>pilot</b> <b>products</b> and distribution-systems. However, this technology-push approach is hindered by the lack of a dominant design. Diverging formats and aims have created an uneven knowledge uptake, and resulted in a split between educational and general literature markets. This divergence is enhanced by the educational system, which has taken on a lead user role. In addition, the internet technology imposes social and cultural values that go against the grain of existing business models and established industry networks, and as such still represents a significant challenge for individual firms and the industry...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the valuation and optimal {{timing of the}} launch of two complementary/substitute products (or projects), {{one of which is}} a pilot product. As a first step, we study the problem from a strategic point of view and analyze the ability of the pilot product per se to create shareholder value. Next we provide a model to evaluate the option to launch the pilot product in order to create the option to launch the key product. The model is designed to analyze the value of the pilot product and the optimal timing to invest as functions of the degree of complementarity/ substitutability among the two products. As a specification, we analyze under what conditions it is worth investing in a pilot product with a negative NPV, whose option to invest is worthless due to perfect competition. The pilot product and the key product are driven by two different but correlated sources of uncertainty. The case is enriched by the presence of a patent on the key product and by the related consideration of a change in the competition due to patent expiry. By resorting to numerical analysis, we evaluate the embedded options and determine the optimal investment policy for both products. Our analysis allows us to capture the value of the options to invest in both the key and <b>pilot</b> <b>products</b> (as a compound option) and shows how the investment decision is aected by a higher correlation among products and a higher degree of substitutability. The major outcome of the model is that a higher correlation and a higher degree of substitutability among products increase the option value and expand the investment thresholds of the whole investment project, thus making the investment relatively less likely in the case of either a lower correlation or a lower degree of substitutability.

5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of commodity markets, new exchanges opened with wild abandon, and speculative volume ballooned. Soon a directive titled The Notice of Firmly Curbing the Blind Development of the Futures Market was launched. In October 1994, the State Council rectified over 50 futures exchanges down to 15 futures exchanges, delisted 20 futures contracts (leaving 35), began issuing licenses to futures commission merchants for the first time while lopping their number by over 70%, restricted trading on foreign futures exchanges, introduced new rules and regulations, and shifted the control of the exchanges from local governments to regulatory authorities. DCE's market share then ranked No. 9 in China with Dry kelp as a <b>pilot</b> <b>product.</b> DCE traded soybeans and corn back then. [...] Continued abuse in the market brought forth the Second Rectification in 1998, most of the surviving 15 futures exchanges were restructured, and subsequently closed. Three national level future exchanges emerged: Shanghai Metal Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The number of futures contracts was cut back further to 12 from 35, and more brokers were closed, leaving just 175 standing from the early 1990s peak of 1,000. Margins were standardized and regulations further toughened. Trading on foreign futures exchanges was further restricted to a small number of large, global entities.

This data will allow the proteins from different alternative suppliers to be compared. As an indicator of WHC several ratios protein:water were tested. The greater ratio in which a gel behavior was still observed was assumed as optimum. To determine FHC several experiments with different protein:fat:water ratios were conducted, using the optimum protein:water ratio and pork backfat. The optimum ratio was the one for which the fat loss was less than or equal to 1 %. Whey protein exhibit the highest WHC and sodium caseinate exhibit the highest FHC. Pork collagen did not show any holding capacity since this was an enzymatically hydrolyzed protein. Soy protein concentrates (functional, non-functional and dispersible) showed the best cost-effectiveness due to their low price.
