40|$|ABSTRACT This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the thermostability of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase - SOD, catalase - CAT and ascorbate peroxidase - APX) and deteriorative (guaiacol peroxidase - G-POD, polyphenoloxidase - PPO, <b>pectin-methylesterase</b> - PME and polygalacturonase - PG) enzymes from soursop and cashew apple juices. Juices were prepared homogenizing ripe fruit pulps and submitting to different thermal treatments (55, 65, 75, 85 and 95 °C) for different time period (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min) then enzymatic activities were evaluated. The treatments at 55 °C for soursop juice and at 75 °C for cashew apple juice presented the best results, considering the low residual activities for deteriorative enzymes and the retained activity of SOD. Our results suggest appropriate technological condition to thermal processing from soursop and cashew apple juice whereby ensuring quality beyond their functionality...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a processive <b>pectin-methylesterase</b> (PME) {{treatment}} on two different pectins, both possessing {{a high degree of}} methylesterification (DM), were investigated. While the starting samples were purportedly very similar in fine structure, the intermolecular DM distributions arising from their PME treatments were strikingly different. Herein, a simulation that illuminates the origin of this phenomenon is described. It is concluded that: (1) very different low-DM samples (with the same average DM) can be generated using the same processive PME, simply by a judicious choice of the high DM starting material; (2) observing the intermolecular DM distribution of the products of processive-PME-processing is an extremely sensitive discriminator of the fine structure of high DM starting materials; and (3) for PMEs with unknown action patterns the processive nature of the enzyme is most simply revealed by studying the changes it induces in the intermolecular DM distribution of very-highly-methylesterified homogalacturonans...|$|E
