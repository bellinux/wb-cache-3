Though {{many of the}} products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas {{at a much higher}} than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure reducing valve to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.|$|E
40|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{very common}} in modern buildings. It was originally purposed to maintain thermally comfortable environments for people inside the building. So far, human thermal comfort {{is not only the}} criteria adapted to given the control and operation of a system. Most of the commercial buildings in Sri Lanka are sick buildings and having extremely high energy consumption of 50 % to 65 % of the total power consumption for air conditioning. The main reasons to have less energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems are over selection of the equipments, poor maintenance and improper controlling. Although having over selected equipment such as chillers, pumps and air handling units of particular installation, the energy usage can be optimized by accommodating a proper control system. The objective of this research is a conceptual development for air distribution cycle in order to improve the energy saving of existing variable air volume (VAV) system while maintaining the human comfort at a highest level. This will be only a functional modification of the system (programming concept), any additional sensing elements and or controlling elements will not be required to achieve the results. Any Specialized Building Management System Contractor can use this programming concept in their system with own programming languages or functional blocks. Only the requirement is that the VAV controller shall be connected to air handling unit controller via a communication bus and the few parameters from VAV controllers shall be transmitted to the particular air handling unit (AHU) controller. Generally in VAV air distribution system, thought-out the running period of the AHU, the duct static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is constant and Variable Speed Drive will be modulated by Direct Digital Controller (DDC) {{in order to maintain the}} duct static pressure at the set point. The research describes about the concept of the duct static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> to varying (resetting) according to the actual demand of the total VAV Units which are connected to the particular VAV AHU.

40|$|As for a {{variable}} air volume (VAV) system, the air duct static pressure {{is a typical}} control variable maintained by modulating supply fan speed. The static pressure equals to the summation of the duct pressure loss downstream of the sensor to the terminal box and box inlet static pressure. Typically, the air duct static pressure is set as a constant set point based on the system design information and sensor location. However, under partial load conditions, the terminal box dampers have to be closed more since either required airflow {{is less than the}} design airflow which directly leads to much less pressure loss. Thus the static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> should be reset lower in order to reduce fan power, avoid noise at terminal box dampers and box damper malfunction due to excessive pressure. Different static pressure reset schedules are reviewed and compared, considering the influence of outside air temperature on the building load, availability of the VAV box damper positions, the airflow ratio based static pressure reset has also applicable advantages over the existing constant static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and two typical reset methods. This paper present the theoretical models to express the impacts of static pressure reset on fan airflow, fan head, air leakage, fan power and thermal energy for both pressure independent and pressure dependent boxes.

Thus, improving efficiency of HVAC systems has gained more and more attentions. This concern has posed challenges for modeling and optimizing HVAC systems. The traditional methods, such as analytical and statistical methods, are usually computationally complex and involve assumptions that may not hold in practice since HVAC system is a complex, nonlinear, and dynamic system. Data-mining approach is a novel science aiming at extracting system characteristics, identifying models and recognizing patterns from large-size data set. It has proved its power in modeling complex and nonlinear systems through various effective and successful applications in industrial, business, and medical areas. Classical data-mining techniques, such as neural networks and boosting tree have been largely applied into modeling HVAC systems in literature. Evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence, have rapidly developed in the past decades and then applied to improving the performance of HVAC systems. This research focuses on modeling, optimizing, and controlling an HVAC system.

Something which has not yet attracted much attention is the energy consumption of the dry condenser fans in refrigeration systems. This is surprising as it has been shown for comparable installations that including the energy consumption of these fans when optimizing the system efficiency was beneficial. To address this deficit, _COP_ maximization has been compared to optimizing the Coefficient of System Performance (_COSP_). The simple refrigeration system used for this investigation was based on a commercially available R 404 A/CO 2 system comprising the basic components, with the condenser having extractor fans. The results show that, when the outdoor temperature is below about 15 °C, there is no observable difference between these two approaches. However, when the ambient temperature increases beyond this threshold, the control method which optimizes _COSP_ is significantly better for part load conditions. This indicates that maximizing the _COP_ can lead to a sub-optimal system in terms of energy consumption under part load conditions.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{generation}} of compressed air comprises 20 % {{of the total}} electricity usage in the mining industry, although compressed air is often seen as a free source of energy. There are however significant costs associated with generating compressed air and maintaining a compressed air system. There are several methods to optimise the electricity used to generate compressed air. The focus {{of this study is}} on one of these methods – the implementation of a dynamic air compressor selector. A Dynamic Compressor Selector (DCS) system was developed to fulfil this purpose. DCS is a system that combines demand- and supply-side management of a compressed air network. DCS calculates a <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> for compressors and schedules the compressors according to the demand from the end-users. End-users include shafts, plants, workshops and smelters. DCS takes all of the compressors and end-users into consideration while doing the calculations. This dissertation focuses on the DCS implementation process and on the problems encountered by previous authors while implementing the DCS technology. Additional problems were encountered while the DCS technology was implemented. DCS was however still successfully implemented. This study will expand the implementation procedure to ensure that the technology can be implemented successfully in the future. DCS was implemented at a platinum mine in South Africa where it was able to calculate pressure set points for the compressors. DCS was able to accurately match the supply of, and demand for compressed air closely, resulting in lower overall compressed air usage. DCS improved compressor scheduling and control, limiting compressor cycling. Improved compressor scheduling and control resulted in significant decreases in the electricity used to generate compressed air at the mine.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} thermodynamic operating parameter {{goals for the}} steady state operation of the control dewar/solenoid system. Specifically, how the control dewar pressure control valve, PV- 3062 -H and the magnet flow control valve EVMF are operated to give the lowest possible temperature fluid at the solenoid magnet. The goals are: (1) For PV- 3062 -H - The process variable is the helium reservoir pressure, minimize the reservoir pressure, provide only enough pressure plus a little margin to ensure leads flow; and (2) For EVMF - The process variable is firstly a manual setpoint of flowrate as read by the flow venturi, FE 3253 -H, and secondly the reservoir liquid level, minimize the pressure drop thru the solenoid cooling tubes, provide at least enough flow to maintain reservoir level and stable operation of the magnet. The thermodynamic states for the fluid thru the system are shown on the Pressure versus Temperature graph. Lines of constant enthalpy are also shown. State A is shown as two phase liquid entering the inlet of the subcooler. The subcooler subcools the fluid to State B. State B to State C {{is caused by the}} pressure drop across EVMF. State C to D is the estimated pressure drop from the outlet of EVMF thru the solenoid cooling tubes and back up to the helium reservoir inlet. To give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes, the two phase fluid in the reservoir should be at the lowest pressure (and thus temperature). This lowest pressure is limited by the required pressure for leads flow and if this does not dominate, the low pressure side pressure drop thru the refrigerator and suction <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> My guess is the lead flow requirement will dominate. I suggest putting the PV- 3062 -H set point such that the lead flow control valves operate at about 80 % open. The second parameter that will give the coolest fluid in the cooling tubes is a minimized pressure drop thru the cooling tubes. This can be accomplished by providing a minimized flowrate, sufficient only to ensure that the reservoir level is full and some liquid fraction leaves the helium outlet tubing. D-Zero Engineering note, EN- 338, 'LHe Flow Regime/Pressure Drop for DO Solenoid at Steady State Conditions' shows that even though the gas fraction increases at lower flowrates, the pressure drop decreases. This goal is ideal, and assumes good cooling at the magnet. Real effects such hot spots or quench experience in the magnet may necessitate a higher flowrate. The current design flow rate from Toshiba is somewhere around 2. 5 gls which is very low. Experience with the accuracy of the venturi flowmeter, coil characteristics etc. and some conservativeness will help determine the optimum flowrate. I would venture a guess {{that it would be a}} minimum of 5 g/s.

Because the process is costly and time consuming, precise and efficient pressure, temperature control and drying time estimation are required. It is the goal of freeze-drying to run at maximum capacity while staying within the safe zone by carefully controlling the sublimation rate. Currently, real time estimation of sublimation rate is still challenging. The technique available called Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) is invasive, and requires major modifications. The current study focuses on exploring a new method of measuring the sublimation rate by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and pressure sensors currently used.

While the capabilities of BASs have increased over time, many buildings still do not fully use the BAS's capabilities and are not properly commissioned, operated or maintained, which leads to inefficient operation, increased energy use, and reduced lifetimes of the equipment. This report investigates the energy savings potential of several common HVAC system retuning measures on a typical large office building prototype model, using the Department of Energy's building energy modeling software, EnergyPlus. The baseline prototype model uses roughly as much energy as an average large office building in existing building stock, but does not utilize any re-tuning measures. Individual re-tuning measures simulated against this baseline include automatic schedule adjustments, damper minimum flow adjustments, thermostat adjustments, as well as dynamic resets (<b>set</b> <b>points</b> that change continuously with building and/or outdoor conditions) to static pressure, supply air temperature, condenser water temperature, chilled and hot water temperature, and chilled and hot water differential <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> <b>points.</b> Six combinations of these individual measures have been formulated - each designed to conform to limitations to implementation of certain individual measures that might exist in typical buildings. All of these measures and combinations were simulated in 16 cities representative of specific U. S. climate zones. The modeling results suggest that the most effective energy savings measures are those that affect the demand-side of the building (air-systems and schedules). Many of the demand-side individual measures were capable of reducing annual HVAC system energy consumption by over 20 % in most cities that were modeled. Supply side measures affecting HVAC plant conditions were only modestly successful (less than 5 % annual HVAC energy savings for most cities for all measures). Combining many of the retuning measures revealed deep savings potential.

An oxygen removal system based on an electrochemical cell was chosen for the EDU due to it's low power, volume and mass requirements (10 W, 0. 000027 cu m, 4. 5 kg) and because of the minimal number of integration considerations. Unlike it's competitors, the system doesn't require post treatments of its byproducts, or heat and power intensive regenerations, that also mandate system redundancy or cycling. The EDUs oxygen removal system only requires two resources, which are already essential to controlled plant growth: electricity and water. Additionally, the amount of oxygen that is removed from the EDU is directly proportional to the cell input current via Faraday's constant, potentially allowing for a mol/electron measurement of photosynthetic rate. The currently operative oxygen removal system has maintained reduced oxygen <b>set</b> <b>points</b> within the EDU, and preparation is underway to verify of the accuracy of electrochemical measurement of oxygen production and hence, photosynthesis. This paper examines the working principles of the electrochemical cell, outlines the overall design of the oxygen removal system and its integration with other EDU subsystems, and summarizes test results obtained over crop growth cycles in the CTF-EDU...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) is used to predict two parameters of interest for high-pressure food processing: the maximum or minimum temperature reached in the sample after pressurization and the time needed for thermal re-equilibration in the high-pressure system. Both variables together represent in a reliable form the temperature evolution during the high-pressure process. The ANN was trained with a data file composed of: applied pressure, <b>pressure</b> increase rate, <b>set</b> <b>point</b> temperature, high-pressure vessel temperature and ambient temperature altogether with the parameters to predict. After a proper training, the ANN {{was able to make}} predictions accurately and therefore, it becomes a useful tool to design and optimize high-pressure processes in the food industry where the pressure/temperature evolution is an essential factor to control the microbiological and/or enzymatic activity of the products. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Minimization of {{uncertainty}} {{is essential to}} extend the usable range of the 15 -psid Electronically Scanned Pressure (ESP) transducer measurements to the low free-stream static pressures found in hypersonic wind tunnels. Statistical characterization of environmental error sources inducing much of this uncertainty requires a well defined and controlled calibration method. Employing such a controlled calibration system, several studies were conducted that provide quantitative information detailing the required controls needed to minimize environmental and human induced error sources. Results of temperature, environmental <b>pressure,</b> over-pressurization, and <b>set</b> <b>point</b> randomization studies for the 15 -psid transducers are presented along with a comparison of two regression methods using data acquired with both 0. 36 -psid and 15 -psid transducers. Together these results provide insight into procedural and environmental controls required for long term high-accuracy pressure measurements near 0. 01 psia in the hypersonic testing environment using 15 -psid ESP transducers...|$|R

40|$|High-pressure {{processing}} is {{an interesting}} technology for the food industry that offers some important advantages compared to thermal processing. But, the results obtained after a pressure treatment depend as much on the applied pressure as the temperature during the treatment. Modelling the thermal behaviour of foods during high-pressure treatments using physical-based models is a really hard task. The main difficulty is the almost complete lack of values for thermophysical properties of foods under pressure. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) was carried out to evaluate its capability in predicting process parameters involved in thermal/pressure food processing. The ANN was trained with a data file composed of: applied pressure, <b>pressure</b> increase rate, <b>set</b> <b>point</b> temperature, high-pressure vessel temperature, ambient temperature and time needed to re-equilibrate temperature in the sample after pressurisation. When ANN was trained, {{it was able to}} predict accurately this last variable. Then, it becomes a useful alternative to physical-based models for process control since thermophysical properties of products implied are not needed in modellisation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To {{anticipate}} the hepatic vascular response to portacaval anastomosis, we studied portal pressure during diversion of portal blood through a temporary extracorporeal umbilical vein to saphenous vein shunt. The relationship of portal pressure to shunted flow was approximately linear. In five schistosomiasis patients (controls) portal diversion to 1, 250 ml/min gave portal pressure-shunted flow curve slopes ranging from 0. 13 to 0. 57 cm water/ 100 ml per min (0. 31 ± 0. 18, mean±SD). In 17 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension {{a continuum of}} slopes was observed from within mean± 2 SD of control (type A) to larger slopes (type B) indicating failure of portal pressure regulation. When portal flow was augmented by shunting from saphenous vein to portal vein, cirrhotic patients who had slopes less than mean± 2 SD of controls during diversion (type A) exhibited a compliant system with small increases in portal pressure, whereas type B patients had significantly greater pressure increases. Selective investigations suggested that changes in portal pressure provoked compensatory changes in hepatic arterial blood flow that tended to maintain portal <b>pressure</b> at a <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Type B patients demonstrated failure of this mechanism to varying degrees...|$|R

40|$|As a large energy consumer, it is {{well-known}} that building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are highly nonlinear and dynamic. The primary {{system is designed}} to provide cooling or heating to the secondary system, such as the valve-coil system, to maintain the supply or zone temperature <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> Such complex systems may be arranged in a variety of configurations, and operated under different operating conditions in various environments. Proportional and integral (PI) control loop, which is designed for linear and time-invariant system, may cause valve hunting issues and temperature fluctuation when applied for HVAC system. One of the most significant challenges of this control problem is the presence of significant nonlinearities and dynamics in the response from the control input. Therefore, superior control is required at the primary system level to link the control of the primary system with the nonlinearities of the secondary system. ^ Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop an integrated primary system optimal control method which can create a linear environment for the secondary system. First, a thorough investigation of the variable primary flow chilled water system was conducted on the pump head and water loop differential pressure under differing load distributions. Characterization of the secondary system was conducted through theoretical modeling and simulation to reveal the key control characteristics and the impacts of such characteristics on the control and energy performance of the integrated system. This study concluded that the differential pressure in the water loop substantially impacts the control performance and stability of the secondary system. ^ The traditional primary system control method is constant differential <b>pressure</b> (DP) <b>set</b> <b>point</b> control. An innovative linearization algorithm was developed and integrated with the secondary system flow resistance to ensure that constant-gain linear PI control design can achieve desired system performance and conserve energy. ^ Both traditional and optimal control algorithm were implemented and compared in two full-scale real building experiments. Compared to the prior art, this innovative optimal algorithm created a system that was more energy efficient, given the desired control performance, and resulted in increased control stability. The linearization algorithm is advantageous in that it results in lower pump head and improves pump efficiency, better coil-valve control stability, and significantly reduces the frequency of control valve repositioning. ...|$|R
