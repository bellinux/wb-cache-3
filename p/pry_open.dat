5|$|The snout {{shape of}} {{crocodilians}} varies between species. Crocodiles may have either broad or slender snouts, while {{alligators and caimans}} have mostly broad ones. Gharials have snouts that are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are much more massive and powerful than the ones that open them, and a crocodilian's jaws can be held shut by a person fairly easily. Conversely, the jaws are extremely difficult to <b>pry</b> <b>open.</b> The powerful closing muscles attach at the median of portion of the lower jaw and the jaw hinge attaches to the atlanto-occipital joint, allowing the animal to open its mouth fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

All his efforts were in vain, {{initially}} using a fire axe to try to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the doors before finally resorting to beating at the turret with his hands. With Mynarski's flight suit and parachute on fire, Brophy eventually waved him away. Mynarski crawled back through the hydraulic fire, returned to the rear door where he paused and saluted.

2500|$|On July 8, 1970, {{a six-year-old}} boy, his mother, {{and two of}} her friends were trapped in a tram in the arch's south leg after the {{monument}} closed. According to the boy's mother, the group went up the arch around 9:30p.m. CDT, but when the tram reached the de-boarding area, its doors did not open. The tram then reportedly traveled up to a storage area [...] above the ground, and the power was switched off. One person was able to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the tram door and the four managed to reach a security guard for help after being trapped for about 45 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|That evening, on 25 July 1756, as the Konbaung troops banged their {{drums and}} played loud music to {{encourage}} Syriam's defenders into thinking festivities were under way and to relax their watch, the Golden Company scaled the walls. At {{the dawn of}} 26 July 1756, after bloody hand-to-hand fighting they managed to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the great wooden gates, and in darkness, amid the war cries of the Konbaung troops ("Shwebotha!" [...] "Shwebotha!"; lit. sons of Shwebo) and the screams {{of the women and}} the children inside, the city was overrun. The Hanthawaddy commander barely escaped the carnage. Alaungpaya presented the stacks of gold and silver captured from the city to the surviving 20 men of the Golden Company and the families of the 73 who died.|$|E

Development of the planktonic larvae is temperature-dependent and takes between 54 and 72 days at [...] During the larval stage the young crab looks nothing like its parents. It is small and transparent with a round, legless body and usually drifts as plankton at {{the surface of the}} ocean. The Japanese spider crab is an omnivore, consuming both plant matter and animals. It also sometimes acts as a scavenger consuming dead animals.

2500|$|Although rarely {{listed as}} an element, {{the common law}} {{required}} that [...] "entry occur {{as a consequence of}} the breaking". For example, if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar—but then notices an open door, which he uses to enter the dwelling, there is no burglary under common law. The use of the pry bar would not constitute an entry even if a portion of the prybar [...] "entered" [...] the residence. Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would not constitute an entry. However, if any part of the perpetrator's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry, the instrumentality rule did not apply. Thus, if the perpetrator uses the prybar to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window, an [...] "entry" [...] would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands.|$|E
2500|$|The Fremen have {{secretly}} mastered {{a way to}} ride sandworms {{across the}} desert. [...] First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device. [...] When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special [...] "maker hook". [...] The hook is used to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand. [...] To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so that the exposed flesh faces upwards, carrying the rider with it. [...] Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as [...] "beaters", hitting the worm's tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred miles and for about half of a day, at which point it will become exhausted {{and sit on the}} open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. The worm-riding ritual is used as a coming-of-age ritual among the Fremen. Worm-riding is used by Paul-Muad'Dib during the Battle of Arrakeen for troop transport into the city after using atomic weapons to blow a hole in the Shield Wall.|$|E

2500|$|The current Mac Mini is {{designed}} to be opened using a round cover {{on the bottom of the}} computer. Prior versions of the Mac Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a putty knife or a pizza cutter to <b>pry</b> <b>open</b> the cases of older models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a [...] "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal top case. While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, overclocking the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.|$|E
