50|$|The Dry Ash Removal System is {{launched}} of Tenova Takraf.September 29, 2015 — Enel Russia has today inaugurated the Dry Ash Removal System at Reftinskaya GRES one of {{its most}} significant environmental projects — and the only {{one of its}} kind in the Russian power generation sector. Overall, Enel Russia invested over 12.5 billion roubles in the project. For the first time in Russia, the traditional hydraulic treatment of the ash produced by a coal plant as a waste material, has been replaced by the new, dry method of transportation and storage. This new method will allow increase industrial use of ash: as long as it remains dry, it can be used in road construction, building materials, agriculture etc. The new Dry Ash Removal System is connected to the railway, which makes it possible to ship the dry ash to clients both by rail and by road. DARS potentially allows the shipping to clients of all of the ash produced by the power plant, namely up to five million tonnes per year. All ash that is not immediately requested by clients, is transported by a 4.5 km-long closed <b>pipe</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt to the ash lagoon, where ash stacks are levelled and compressed, preventing dry ash from flying away. Finally, a layer of loam is applied to the stack surface, and green grass is seeded.|$|E
40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt <b>conveyor</b> systems and <b>pipe</b> <b>conveyors</b> various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal idler roller support of the <b>pipe</b> <b>conveyors.</b> This allows an early prediction of the critical condition and thus any developing emergency situation can be forestalled...|$|R

Yet, continuous haulage offers considerable benefits, which are not always realized. However, there is now a resurgence of interest in these systems as coal mines seek to improve gate road development rates. As most market players are very reluctant to publish information, benchmarking continuous haulage systems can be difficult. This is {{to the detriment of the}} industry as a whole.

50|$|Instead of {{controlling}} with the D-pad, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis uses the touch screen {{to control the}} Mini-Marios {{in the same vein}} as Lemmings. To move, the player must use the stylus to turn a Mini-Mario's direction to move them in that direction. Swiping up enters pipes, climbs ladders, or makes them jump. Swiping across the Mini-Marios left or right causes them to move in that direction, and swiping down causes them to enter a pipe that is below their feet. Tapping once causes them to stop. The D-Pad and the face buttons move the camera (i.e. X and Up move the camera up), and in DK stages pressing L and R causes a line to appear temporarily showing the path the launched Mini-Mario will take. The timer does not start until the player either moves blocks or taps a Mini-Mario. However, the player may move elevators, change the direction of <b>pipes</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts, and scout the level out without starting the timer.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{focuses on}} the development of an innovative, low-cost sensor for the detection of ice formation in <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipes</b> of vehicles. The measurement principle is based on the contactless determination of the relative permittivity of a medium by capacitive sensors. In comparison to water, ice has a decreased relaxation frequency through crystallization below the freezing point. Capacitive sensor structures for permittivity measurement were applied on a polymer pipe by functional printing, which can be installed in the conveying systems {{in the area of the}} feed lines. Due to its low-cost and universal design, the sensor can be used in all applications where the integrability and costs of an installed sensor system play a major role...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into predicting failure of pneumatic <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipe</b> bends due to hard solid particle impact erosion {{has been carried}} out on an industrial scale test rig. The bend puncture point locations may vary with many factors. However, bend orientation was suspected of being a main factor due to the biased particle distribution pattern of a high concentration flow. In this paper, puncture point locations have been studied with different pipe bend orientations and geometry (a solids loading ratio of 10 being used for the high concentration flow). Test results confirmed that the puncture point location is indeed most significantly influenced by the bend orientation (especially for a high concentration flow) due to the biased particle distribution and biased particle flux distribution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a capacitive and a vision-based method {{for measuring the}} velocity of cryogenic hydrogen flows. The capacitive sensing principle exploits the spatial frequency signature of perturbations moving through a multi-electrode structure. This setup increases the sensitivity to dielectric permittivity variations compared to a simple two-electrode structure while preserving the ability to detect small perturbations. The vision-based method relies on a high-speed camera system that monitors the liquid hydrogen flow through an optical window yielding the flow velocity by cross-correlating subsequent images of the flow. Although a comprehensive analysis of the obtainable measurement uncertainty was not performed yet, current measurement results show the applicability of both principles for the non-invasive measurement of the volume flow of cryogenic fuels inside <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} find a link between results {{obtained}} from a laboratory erosion tester and tests carried out on a pneumatic conveyor, a comparison has been made between weight loss from bends on an industrial-scale pneumatic conveyor and erosion rates obtained in a small centrifugal erosion tester, for the same materials. Identical test conditions have been applied to both experiments so that comparable test results have been obtained. The erosion rate of mild steel commonly used as the wall material of <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipes</b> and pipe bends was determined individually on both test rigs. A relationship between weight loss from the bends and erosion rate determined from the tester has been developed. A discussion {{based on the results}} and their applicability to the prediction of wear in pneumatic conveyors concludes the paper...|$|R
50|$|In the S-lay system, the {{pipeline}} assembly is {{done at the}} installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: <b>pipe</b> handling <b>conveyors,</b> welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc. The S notation refers {{to the shape of}} {{the pipeline}} as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (touch down point). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support. But it may have to contend with severe sea states - these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding. Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.|$|R
40|$|In a {{wide variety}} of {{industrial}} applications, materials having diverse particle characteristics are pneumatically conveyed through enclosed pipelines. The main objective of pneumatic conveying is to transport reliably as much material as possible with minimal energy consumption. For abrasive bulk solids or fragile materials it is furthermore essential to maintain transportation velocities as low as possible to minimise damage to both the conveying system and the material. In dense phase flow, particles are transported in a non-suspended state. This type of flow is also known as plug flow. This flow regime consists of alternating sequences of dense material concentration (plug), followed by a section with no or very little material. In contrast to dilute phase flow, material velocities are comparably low in dense phase conveying, although higher mass transportation per time unit can be achieved. A stabile plug flow is characterised by a regular sequence of well shaped particle slugs with approximately the same lengths. Strong deviations from a periodical plug sequence and unstable material slugs are an indicator for conveying parameter maladjustment. For in-line monitoring of stability and sequence of material slugs in dense phase conveying, this paper presents two measurement principles. Both methods feature a non-invasive measurement technique from the outside of a closed <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipe</b> and are capable of performing quality inspection for the present material flow...|$|R
40|$|Plate-like {{structures}} {{are widely used}} both in scientific research and industrial applications. Understanding the mechanical properties of such structures is important for design, installation and operation of many devices and equipment. Although they are classified as a traditional topic {{in the realm of}} engineering mechanics, plates have some new applications and thus, problems do arise: e. g. large deformation problems of nanoscale plates and twist problems of long conveying belts. This thesis represents an effort to improve the understanding of such problems and provide possible solutions to overcome such problems. It employs a mathematical approach to investigate the static and dynamic behaviours of nanoscale beams, plates and films, and adapts a finite element method (FEM) to study the dynamic responses of complex large-scale conveying belts. To study the bending behaviours of multi-layered nanoscale plates or plate-like structures, an improved core-shell model with multiple layers is established, which takes into account the surface/interface tension and elasticity, size-dependent properties and geometrical nonlinearity. Modified governing equations are obtained and solved. Approximate solutions in closed form are also obtained. Based on these solutions numerical studies are conducted to further investigate the influences of surface/interface effect. The mathematical models are refined to consider the free and forced vibrations of multi-layered nanoscale plates with the focus on size-dependent properties and geometrical nonlinearity. The Motion equations and Duffing equations are derived and solved numerically. Based on the closed form solutions for different boundary conditions such as circular plates and rectangular plates with all edges simply supported or clamped, the nature of vibration of nanoscale plates is explored. To further understand the dynamic behaviours, different load and boundary situations are also studied. An FEM model is established to explore the twist phenomenon of <b>pipe</b> belt <b>conveyors</b> (PBC). This FEM model is validated by comparing the results of contact forces with those from a previous experiment. It adopts three realistic steps to assemble the PBC system and can give a credible prediction of the stress and strain in belts. The results demonstrate that this FEM model is able to reproduce the belt twist phenomenon and the twist is sensitive to many factors such as the effective centre of mass and shear centre of the closed belt. These findings offer a good guideline for the design, installation and operation of PBCs in industry...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} growth of energy consumption it is required that {{development in the}} energy sector is focused on renewable energy sources. Another possibility how to reduce the consumption of primary energy resources is also searching for new and non-traditional fuels. The biomass is the best and potentially expandable renewable energy source in geographic conditions in the Czech Republic. The energy usage of biomass has experienced {{a significant increase in}} recent years, however, even in the big energy power plant. This increase in consumption made mainly from wood biomass a shortage fuel, and it began to raise its price. The consumers of biomass fuel are starting to look for a different type of fuel at this time. Stalk and slightly contaminated biomass are representatives of these non-traditional fuels. Stalks are mostly annual plants grown primarily for subsistence. Waste parts of these plants can be utilized for production of energy. The characteristic temperatures of stalk ash have relatively low values. Sintering of ash in a device is one of the obstacles for energy usage of stalk. Sintering of ash brings a number of operational problems at power facilities. Therefore, the part of a research is dedicated to the melting of ash. The thermal gasification is one of the possibilities how to use biomass efficiently. Gasification can be understood as the thermo-chemical conversion of solid fuel into a different state, in this case the gaseous state. The combustion process is generally more manageable for gaseous fuels. Due to this process ower emissions of undesirable compounds at the output of the combustion device can be achieved. Thermal gasification process takes place under stochiometric access of oxidant. The gas with low heating value is on the outlet from gasification process. The main components of produced gas are hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. The final gas contains also a lot of undesirable constituents, which make this gas disadvantaged in energy. These constituents are neutral components that dilute gas only, and pollutants as dust, tar and compounds of sulfur and chlorine. These pollutants complicate further use of the generated gas. The tar compounds together with dust causing build-up on the <b>conveyor</b> <b>pipe</b> and also on the combustion equipment, which are using this generated gas. The quality of produced gas is increases by another reprocessing and cleaning. The purified gas can be used for cogeneration of energy and burn it in internal combustion engines or gas turbines. Other possibility is typical usage for heating according to the needs of technology. The atmospheric fluidized bed gasification reactor Biofluid 100 th was built for experimental purposes in the laboratories of the Energy Institute. The thesis is focused on thermal gasification of stalk and other non-traditional fuels in Biofluid device. The aim is to achieve a stable gasification process of stalk and thereby verify the possibility of stalk use as fuel for technology Biofluid. Subsequent aim is design of methods for cleaning the raw gas from the tar compounds. The research is focused on the secondary gas cleaning methods due to the requirements of high purity of the resulting gas...|$|R
