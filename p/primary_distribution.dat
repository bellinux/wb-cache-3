The hurricane destroyed more than 1,186homes and 77businesses, severely damaged 9,110homes and 333businesses, and left 107,908homes and over 1,000businesses with minor damage. Across the state, the hurricane generated an estimated 660,000dump trucks of debris. At least tenpeople were directly killed by the storm, and hundreds more were injured. A total of 1.8million electrical customers were left without power, with electrical damage totaling $128million (2003USD, $150million 2008USD).

25|$|These volumes, {{traditional}} British comic {{and story}} annuals, were published {{each year in}} time for Christmas shopping. They are cloth bound with full-color painted covers and probably came with dust jackets that duplicated the illustrations on the board covers. These dust jackets, however, are seldom found. Interior contents are a mix of original British material (often by McLoughlin) and reprints from American comics, usually Quality. <b>Primary</b> <b>distribution</b> came through the Woolworth's chain where toys matching characters and vehicles from the stories were also on sale. Little {{is known about the}} original pricing of the volumes although some are thought to have been priced at 7/6. No issues were numbered or dated and the order given here may not be entirely accurate. It is clear, however, that the order of issues presented in several British fanzines and publications is hopelessly wrong. It seems likely that the three Supercoloured Comic Annuals and the New Spaceways Comic Annual should be considered part of this series. This would give it an unbroken run of one annual a year from 1949 to 1959 which would nearly correspond with the Buffalo Bill series. Copies of each of these annuals with dated gift inscriptions confirm that the estimate of dates is fairly accurate. British collector Paul Annis' research confirms most of these dates.|$|E

40|$|A model {{explaining}} the pulsar nulling and phase memory phenomena is {{developed in the}} frame of the plasma model for the pulsar radiation developed by the authors during the last few years. According to this model after fulfilment of the resonant conditions the pulsar radio emission is generated in definite places of the magnetosphere. In addition to waves corresponding to the pulsar radiation, very low-frequency drift waves are also generated in the magnetospheric plasma. These waves propagate transversely to the neutron star magnetic field and encircle the region of the open magnetic field lines. These waves change the curvature radius of field lines and can affect the generation of the radio waves. If the frequency of these waves is about {{the same as that of}} the star angular velocity the subpulse drift phenomena can be observed. The particles extracted from the stellar surface form the <b>primary</b> beam <b>distribution</b> function. The particles with more energy radiate γ-quanta and produce electron-positron pairs. The positron accelerates toward the stellar surface and heats it and broaden the <b>primary</b> particles <b>distribution</b> function. This process continues until the density of the extracted particles exceeds the Goldreich-Julian density. At this time the negative potential appears screening the electric field and closing the gap. Simultaneously the peak of the <b>primary</b> particle <b>distribution</b> function moves towards the low Lorentz-factors and does not have enough energy to start the process of generation of radio emission. As a result the nulling phenomenon can be observed. Broadening of the <b>primary</b> particle <b>distribution</b> function can occur with different velocities, depending on the initial distribution function. If the typical duration of this process τ is larger than the period P of pulsar rotation (τ〉P) then nulling is observed. If τ<P - there is a short scale variation of radio emission. Decrease of the peak of <b>primary</b> particle <b>distribution</b> function not only stops the radio emission but also slows down the phase velocity of low frequency drift waves. This in turn results in the subpulse drift phase memory...|$|R
40|$|Presented isthe {{theoretical}} characterization f an {{electrochemical cell}} that is uniformly accessible to mass transfer and exhibits a nearly uniform <b>primary</b> current <b>distribution</b> {{over most of}} the electrode. Conceptually, the cell consists of two parallel, coaxial disks of radius R with a gap between the disks of length L. One disk forms the working electrode, and the other disk is a porous urface through which electrolyte isassumed to be injected with a uniform axial velocity V. The aspect ratio of the gap between the disks (L/ 2 R) is small compared to unity. Analytic expressions analogous to the Levich equation are derived for the mass-transfer-limited current density {{as a function of the}} physical properties of the electrolyte, the injection velocity V, and the gap length L. The approximate analytic results are compared to numerical computations and are found to agree within 2 % for typical operating conditions. The effect of gap aspect ratio on the <b>primary</b> current <b>distribution</b> is also explored. Numerical solutions how that the <b>primary</b> current <b>distribution</b> is flat {{over most of the}} electrode when the gap aspect ratio is much less than unity, but, because of the cell geometry, the local current density always becomes infinite at the electrode/insulator b undary...|$|R
