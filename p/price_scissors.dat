50|$|The <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> is an {{economic}} phenomenon when for a certain group or sector of productive population the overall valuation from their production for sale outside this group drops below the valuation of the demand of this group for goods produced outside the group {{after a period of}} reasonable equilibrium. A typical example is when changing world price levels cause a country’s exports to plummet in value, while the valuation of its imports remains relatively stable. This phenomenon draws its name from a graphical illustration of its effects over time. Plotting time on a horizontal axis against price level on a vertical axis, with agricultural prices and industrial prices shown in two separate curves, the graph should appear like a pair of opening scissors. Historically, the phenomenon has most frequently taken the form of falling prices for agricultural produce and steady prices for industrial goods. Thus, the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> is most devastating to countries that are net agricultural exporters and net industrial importers. Perhaps the most vivid illustration {{of the effects of the}} <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> and its potential effects occurred in countries throughout Eastern Europe in the early 1930s. The phenomenon is not exclusively of international scale: early Soviet Union had industry/agriculture <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> internally, see Scissors Crisis.|$|E
5000|$|This {{economic}} influence soon {{translated into}} political influence. Germany’s assistance did legitimately help the Eastern European economies {{out of the}} crisis brought by {{the opening of the}} <b>price</b> <b>scissors,</b> and public sentiment was therefore swayed in favor of the Reich. Here was Germany’s ulterior motive: as David Kaiser puts it, “the Foreign Office was determined to extend German influence in Southeastern Europe with or without any clear economic rationale”. German economic activities in Eastern (particularly Southeastern) Europe served as cover for the entry of Nazi infiltrators who spread propaganda and consolidated German political influence throughout the region. [...] The onset of the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> in Eastern Europe, which began as a mere fluke of the international economic system, had played a heavy role in the disintegration and realignment of the Eastern European nations. The economic hardship brought about by the deterioration of the agricultural states’ terms of trade had paved the way for increasingly radical right-wing governments, shaken their faith in the commitment of the Western powers, and shaped the entire region into a cog in the Nazi war machine.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve the}} <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> problem, China imposed {{production}} quotas on rural households, and urban wages were set low {{in order to}} maintain low urban food demand. In the 1950s, the grain rationing system was put in place, in which urban families were given grain coupons. The amount that the urban households could purchase was the relative price between grain and other goods, and was determined by the state. Any consumption that exceeded this could be purchased, but at the market price.|$|E
5000|$|Where the {{fragmentation}} of land reform had decreased agricultural efficiency, government response to the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> often exacerbated the problem. Any mechanization of agriculture would have meant an increase in rural unemployment, a move that, {{in combination with the}} dire conditions imposed by the Depression, would have been political suicide for any ruling regime. Thus, for example, Yugoslavia actually banned the use of tractors in the 1930s. [...] Although keeping agriculture inefficient may have kept unemployment nominally lower, it did nothing to help ease the burden on the peasantry in the long run.|$|E
50|$|Although the Depression was not {{as severe}} in {{relatively}} industrialized Czechoslovakia, the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> had disruptive political ramifications even there. The truth was that the Czech lands were far more industrialized than the Slovak, meaning that Slovaks suffered more heavily from the decline of agricultural prices than the Czechs. Worse, the Czechoslovak government raised protectionist barriers to shelter Czech industry, leading to a trade war with Hungary that was primarily damaging to Slovakia. The perceived indifference on Prague’s part deepened the rift between Czechs and Slovaks that would open wide {{at the outset of}} World War II.|$|E
50|$|The sharp {{deterioration}} {{of the terms of}} trade caused by the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> was devastating to Eastern European governments as well. The heavy international borrowing of the 1920s now became a serious liability. The debts, accounted in nominal terms, became increasingly difficult to service as the value Eastern European governments received for their exports shrank to almost nothing. Worse, the response of the government to this cut in revenues was to increase taxes on the peasantry. As Aldcroft explains, “In Romania, and Yugoslavia for example some 50 percent of the total cash income of the peasantry disappeared in taxation”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{governments of}} Eastern Europe simply lacked {{the funds to}} mount an {{effective}} response to the <b>price</b> <b>scissors.</b> Their {{failure to do so}} had political ramifications that would eventually realign the entire region. The political problems began internally. In Bulgaria, the economic impotence of Andrei Liapchev’s government was a factor in the public disillusionment that led to the absence of serious resistance to the Zveno coup in 1934. Zveno prime minister Kimon Georgiev subsequently gave the government a more extensive role in the economy. [...] In Hungary, economic hardships led to public protests in Budapest in 1931 (89). Soon after, the conservative right-wing government of Istvan Bethlen fell, to be replaced by the radical right-wing government of Gyula Gömbös.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crash of}} the United States stock market in 1929 heralded the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression, but the crisis in Eastern Europe began in earnest {{with the collapse of the}} Creditanstalt in Vienna in 1931. In the ensuing worldwide panic, agricultural prices dropped severely, while prices for industrial goods remained relatively stable as governments imposed protectionist policies. Between 1929 and 1934, agricultural prices received in Romania dropped 56%, while industrial prices paid fell only 19%. Across the region, agricultural prices dropped an average of 34% over that period. [...] Unsurprisingly, the opening of the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> was especially hard on peasants. As prices fell, peasants worked hard to increase their output of grain. Because of the highly inelastic demand for grain, however, this effort only further decreased prices and revenues, impoverishing peasants even more. Peasant incomes dropped by nearly 60% in Romania and Poland.|$|E
5000|$|While policy {{responses}} such as taxing {{the peasantry}} and banning mechanization may seem horribly dysfunctional in hindsight, the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> had effectively tied {{the hands of}} the Eastern European governments, leaving them with few if any options. The revenue drought brought about by the decline in terms of trade meant that governments had very little money with which to implement effective policy responses. Faced with the diabolical choice of sacrificing the well-being of their peasantry or defaulting on their international debts, governments chose to pursue long-term solvency at the expense of their citizens. Even within such limitations, though, some of the region's governments were able to implement reasonably successful policies to aid their peasants. Romania declared a moratorium on debt payments in 1932, followed two years later by a decree that all debts would be reduced to half of their nominal value. [...] As with a similar decree in Bulgaria, this Romanian policy gave some much-needed to the peasantry, which, like the government, was generally burdened with high levels of debt.|$|E
5000|$|Faced {{with few}} policy options and deteriorating {{political}} situations, {{the nations of}} Eastern Europe looked to the West for aid in fighting the <b>price</b> <b>scissors.</b> In 1930, the Yugoslav, Hungarian and Romanian governments joined together to request at the League of Nations that Western European countries buy Eastern European grain at preferential tariff rates—a move that would abrogate the Western nations’ obligations under most-favored-nation agreements (Kaiser 19). Although the Western nations had given nominal political support to the East, they failed to come through with material economic support. France, the military guarantor of the Little Entente, turned down the proposal. Britain likewise rejected the idea, {{in order to protect}} its largely agricultural Dominion protectorates. [...] The refusal of Western governments to come to the assistance of Eastern Europe opened the door for Nazi Germany to gain power in the region. Unlike the Western powers, Germany quickly concluded agreements to buy Eastern European produce at preferential rates. In 1935, Gömbös concluded a treaty wherein Germany agreed to buy Hungarian agricultural goods, giving the country an economic boost but also strengthening pro-German sentiment. In 1939, Germany signed the Wohlstat Pact with Romania, promising German assistance in agricultural development in return for greater economic ties, which would give Germany access to Romanian oil reserves. The Nazi government concluded similar agreements in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the 1930s. In so doing, Germany effectively brought all of agricultural Eastern Europe into its economic orbit, gaining access to foodstuffs and raw materials while opening a dedicated market for its industrial goods.|$|E
40|$|The Sah-Stiglitz "Economics of Price Scissors' model, {{concerning}} {{the political economy}} of <b>price</b> <b>scissors,</b> formulates the optimal terms of trade against peasants. In the present paper, by extending this model to an open economy and allowing agricultural rationing, we first check if the model stands up to China's data from 1949 - 1992, we find that the importance of peasants in the government's objective function is less than the importance of workers. In addition, the importance of consumption is also less than that of investment. Such findings are consistent with the reality of China.

The critical role of the economy's institutional features (e. g., external trade environment, wage and income determination, and wage-productivity effects) is emphasized. Certain aspects of the Soviet Industrialization Debate and subsequent collectivization are interpreted, (ii) It develops simple rules to delineate who gains and who loses (within agriculture) from changes in terms of trade, (iii) It presents powerful (and informationally parsimonious) rules for Pareto-improving price reforms for cash crops and agricultural inputs...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{starts from}} the {{theoretical}} {{premise that the}} business environment of the operators from the agri-food economy is, greater influenced by the behaviour of certain essential macro-economic variables of the market economies. For this purpose, our methodological approach investigates the behaviour of six macro-economic variables (GDP, prices, inflation, exchange rate, budget and credit) during time periods for which relevant statistical data are available. Starting from the incidence of economic macro-variables upon the agri-food sector, a series of factors are identified and quantified that generated a strong erosion of farmers’ incomes (relative instability of production and real prices and the “aggressiveness” of real prices of non-agricultural inputs). macroeconomic variable, agri-food sector, sectoral real prices, <b>price</b> <b>scissors,</b> relative instability...|$|E

The purpose of the article is to compare to what extend changes in the structures of agricultural production factors in the agriculture of selected EU countries (Poland, Hungary, Italy) in years 1999 - 2013 are the consequence of adaptation to price conditions on the agricultural products markets and production factors markets. The studies prove the low elasticity of production factor structures relative to the <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> index in the all countries. However, in the case of Hungary and Poland it is particularly low, which can be connected with low capitalization of agriculture in those countries, on the one hand, and the “path dependency” effect in the context of communist past of these countries, on the other...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general conditions —first inthe post-Soviet space as a whole, then in Romania— that led {{increasing numbers of}} Romanians to migrate from rural areas for temporary or permanent work in other European countries, {{after the collapse of}} socialism in 1989 / 1991. It explains the process of property restitution that recreated private land owner ship, as well as government policies that made it very difficult for new owners to make a living from their farms. Because of a widening <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> between the costs of production and the prices of farm products,by the year 2000 many Romanian villagers could no longer afford to work their land. As a result, they entered into large circuits of migration, chiefly to Italy and Spain. The larger process in which these villagers were participating was a change in the international pool of migrant labor, newly augmented by victims of the transformation from East European socialism...|$|E
40|$|This paper re-examines {{the current}} debate on <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> based on an {{extended}} framework, in which the production and trade of industrial consumer goods within the rural sector is incorporated. It confirms that in the economy considered by Preobrazhensky, consumer rationing, especially of industrial goods in rural areas, is prevalent. Under the binding rationing the price response of agricultural surplus cannot be determined theoretically. This finding reopens the field for empirical investigation. The paper identifies the conditions that guarantee the validity of Preobrazhenshy's two propositions: (1) the state can increase its capital accumulation by moving the terms of trade against peasants, and (2) the urban workers need not necessarily suffer therefrom. It demonstrates {{that in order to}} ensure the validity of these two propositions, besides the need to assume positive price response of agricultural surplus and of labour force input, food rationing in urban areas and the rationing of major industrial consumer goods in rural areas are essentially required. As a consequence, the paper suggests that the price-scissors type of regulation would induce the state's coercion on peasants to collect their food surplus...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>price</b> <b>scissors</b> {{difference}} between industrial products and agricultural products {{is one of}} the important problems in China. It impacts not only the living standard improvement of farmers but also the economic value of cultivated land, furthermore results in the direct and indirect loss of cultivated land resources. China's cultivated land area has decreased dramatically in recent years. An important reason for the decrease is the relatively low cost of cultivated land occupancy, which results from the distortion of economic value of cultivated land due to the existence of scissors difference. This study firstly analyzed the dynamic change of scissors difference and calculated the absolute and relative magnitude of scissors difference from 1997 to 2002, then computed the economic value of cultivated land before and after scissors difference adjustment in 2002, and finally discussed the inverted scissors difference. Results suggest that the scissors difference has a remarkable impact on the economic value of cultivated land, and the adjustment of scissors difference even inverted scissors difference to the economic value of cultivated land is indispensable...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{relative}} price of agricultural commodities versus that of industrial commodities is analyzed via domestic {{terms of trade}} during 1990 - 2009 when trade liberalization gained impetus in Turkey. The domestic terms of trade which are improved {{in favor of the}} agricultural commodities during 1990 - 1998 except 1994 which is acknowledged as an economic crises year are reversed against the agricultural commodities after 1998 and plummeted in 2001 economic crises. The domestic terms of trade which are improved during 2001 - 2004 are deteriorated against the agricultural commodities after 2004. In the paper, the factors that define the domestic terms of trade during 1990 - 2009 are estimated via Least Squares Method with quarterly data. The findings of the paper revealed that the domestic terms of trade in Turkey are defined by the market mechanisms like {{the relative}} prices of the previous year and the relative production of the current year. Although the domestic terms of trade is not improved in favor of the agricultural commodities during the examination period, it is evident that the trade liberalization affects the domestic terms of trade in favor of the agricultural commodities. This finding is explained by the current protectionist regulations in the liberalization of the agricultural commodities trade relative to the regulations in industrial commodities trade.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the reasons for}} the prices of milk and milk products in the Czech Republic for the period 2008 – 2009. In January 2008, the purchase price of raw milk was 10. 08 CZK/l, and in the subsequent period it began to decline. At the end of 2008, the price was more than 3 crowns lower, and still the decrease continued. The research determined that the essential reason for the price fluctuations is the impact of the economic crisis. A substantial portion of the article was devoted to analyzing the behavior of supermarket chains toward their suppliers. It was discovered that even here {{there is a lot of}} room for the creation of pricing policy. Margin trading networks up to 25 % of the delivered goods. Price negotiations affect the position papers in the manufacturing vertical. The power of suppliers and processors is based on the establishment of a strong integration unit. In the conclusion the author discusses possible future developments in price, sales policy, and the self-sufficiency of milk production in the Czech Republic.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the considerations of Polish economists {{about the economic}} crises and the business cycle in the interwar period. According to E. Taylor, {{the causes of the}} then crisis of overproduction, accompanied by the phenomenon of <b>price</b> <b>scissors,</b> included varied elasticity of demand for agricultural products and industrial products, as well as monetary inflation and new technical inventions. E. Lipinski believed that the crisis was a result of overinvestment. State interventionism in the economies did not ease, but aggravated the crisis on a global scale. W. M. Zawadzki pointed {{to the nature of the}} crisis in Poland as being due to economic underdevelopment, low consumption, and a huge shortage of capital. J. W. Libicki took the view that an analysis of the crisis in agriculture should be combined with an analysis of profitability of agricultural production. A. Krzyzanowski linked production fluctuations with changes in investment demand, and the latter with the assessment of profitability, which depends on the interest rate. A. Heydel explained the business cycle with an incorrect interest rate policy. At the same time, he postulated that the state should refrain from interference in economic life. On the other hand, M. Kalecki pointed to the excessive optimism of businesses, causing an increase in investment, which leads to changes in global demand, as a cause of fluctuations. He advocated the inflationary financing of public works by the state. history of economic thought; theories of economic crises; theories of the business cycl...|$|E
