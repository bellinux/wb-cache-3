40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{formative}} {{basis of the}} professional reflective practice of in-service science teachers through their reconstruction of their pre-service interaction with lecturing staff. The study reports through the voice of graduates of the Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Teaching double degree program of Avondale College, NSW who are currently practising in the classroom setting. Through these narratives the study focuses on mechanisms {{for the development of}} professional reflective modalities; and the levels of coherence between lecturers’ actual practice of reflective, critical thinking and in-service teacher’s conceptualisation of professional reflection that informs the development of their present <b>professional</b> reflective <b>aptitudes,</b> understandings and practices. Teacher participants report a gradual process of the development of their reflective practice in their initial training. This development lacked any consistent pattern amongst the cohort. A significant increase in the frequency and level of reflection occurred subsequent to their first major practicum, which also saw their first major engagement of mentoring by academic staff. Participants reported that other training activities and processes associated with reflective practice were substantially abandoned in practice once they left the course. The study reports a strong linkage of deep reflective activities and high personal connection with academic staff. Academics who significantly engaged their students cognitively, emotionally and spiritually also engaged their students in a participative community that involved them in meaningful dialogue. These relationships exhibit an innate contagion of modelling practice; a relatively unintentional and automatic mimicking and convergence of the practices of another. The voice of participating teachers reported in this study that the degree of personal connection with academic staff appears to be the central significant factor on the development of reflective practice in their undergraduate years. Participants in this study noted the significance of the mentor-mentee relationship in building repertoires of professional practice. Active modelling by academic staff was reported by teacher participants in the transmission of ethical values, lifestyle standards, and reflective practices. Most participants in this study reported a positive demonstration of reflective practice by those lecturers they identified as being significant in their development as a person and as an emerging professional teacher...|$|R

40|$|La nature des procédés modernes d'investigation de la {{personne}} humaine pose des problèmes d'ordre moral et social sur lesquels le Comité théologique de Lyon attire l'attention dans cet article. Une définition de la psychotechnique en soulignant les conditions actuelles de ses applications amène à l'examen des questions morales que cette nouvelle technique soulève, des droits et devoirs que possèdent le psychotechnicien, l'employeur et les travailleurs eux-mêmes dans ce domaine. The {{main objective}} of psycho-technique takes its inspiration from principles {{that have long}} been admitted, among which "the right man at the right place" is one. What this new technique brings that is really new is the methods that it mobilizes {{in the service of}} this old ideal, methods of investigation of the human personality inspired by the recent acquisitions of psychological science. The nature of these modern procedures of which more and more use is being made in the labour world, cause problems of an ethical order to which we must give consideration. I—What is Psycho-technique? The first ambition of psycho-technique was to give exact information on <b>professional</b> <b>aptitudes.</b> However, the field of investigation of the psycho-technician was widened by the force of circumstances. At this point all psychology was called upon to contribute to the knowledge of the individual as a whole. From a simple examination of work aptitudes, it has proceded to a 1 temps to probe all the constituent factors of the personality and this in connection with vocational guidance or selection. Even if we should confine ourselves to the ethical aspect of the question, in order to be realistic, the ethical judgment must take into account other aspects: scientific, economic, social, juridical, political and ethical. All these points of view overlap each other and each one offers angles of an ethical nature. II—The Ethical Problems of Psycho-technique 1. Psycho-technician remains in the first place the specialist who examines and measures the individual aptitudes, the capacity for professional work from the angle of their efficiency. The psychotechnician, being a man, must act in accordance to ethics. The scientific conscience thus becomes for him an obligation of individual and social justice. 2. From the fact that the psycho-technician penetrates further into the intimacy of the people he examines, further obligations are imposed on him. He is obliged to show discretion which is equivalent to the most strict professional secret. 3. An instrument as sensitive as that which opens slightly the secrets of the human subconsciousness, requires for its use, a highly-developed skill and preparation. Errors become much more serious in this field and more harmful. Whereas the one who spontaneously seeks out the psychiatrist of psycho-analyst offers himself voluntarily for examination and gives him of his own free will any information, no matter how intimate, in the professional sector, the situation changes completely when the psycho-technique intervenes at the employer's request. It violates a natural right of the human person, the right to the secret of his inner being. It {{is for this reason that}} there exists certain fundamental rights and obligations of the psycho-technician, of the employer and of society. Ill—Rights and Obligations of the Psycho-technicianThe professional conscience requires the psycho-technician to acquire sufficient formation; to study conscientiously his investigations; that he base his verdicts on tests which have been proved; that he does not formulate his observations which he communicates to others or the subject himself in such ambiguous terms that they may cause serious trouble; that he does not reveal to a third person condidential or intimate information; that he does not lend himself to interested calculation on the part of the employer; that he treats the exercise of his profession as a social service. The psycho-technician has therefore the right to refuse to help in certain circumstances, to insist in the necessary time to make thorough investigations, to establish such conditions as will permit him to live from his work, while keeping the necessary independence of judgment. IV—Rights and Obligations of the EmployerThe employer has the right to make use of the services of a competent psycho-technician for the professional examination of possible future employees, for a subsequent selection of manual or intellectual workers. He has not, however, the right to impose on his employees as a condition of employment, psychological examinations which probe their inner personality, to require from the psycho-technician, the communication of observations of an intimate nature, without the consent of those interested, to force the specialist to make too rapid examinations, to place the responsibility on the psycho-technician alone of hiring, refusing or laying-off the personnel. The employer has the obligation of assuming his social responsibilities as a human partner with the employees who are men and not machines, to make discreet use, respecting personal secrecy and only to hire competent psycho-technicians. V Rights and Obligations of the WorkersThe psycho-technique is made to serve the employee as much as the employer and the whole of society. Its inconsidered use may, however, cause serious injury to the workers, as its use by incompetent "amateurs", its commercialization by unscrupulous profiteers, its organization as a private service of enterprises in the larger industries. It herefore seems necessary to establish a legal basis for psycho-technique which is gradually becoming a public service. VI—Towards a Legal Basis for Psycho-techniqueIn fact, it would appear at present to be necessary to consider the interference of the State, for the workers:For the psycho-technician:For the employers...|$|R
