The extent of exchange averaged nearly 70 %, quantified by protein microarray of individual trabeculae. The uniformity of its distribution was verified by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence polarization, giving <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> and its dispersion {{relative to the}} fiber long axis, was monitored simultaneously with isometric tension. <b>Probe</b> <b>angle</b> reflects underlying cTnC orientation. In steady-state experiments, rigor cross-bridges and Ca 2 + with vanadate to inhibit cross-bridge formation produce a similar change in probe orientation as that observed with cycling cross-bridges (no Vi). Changes in <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> were found at [Ca 2 +] well below those required to generate tension. Cross-bridges increased the Ca 2 + dependence of angle change (cooperativity). Strong cross-bridge formation enhanced Ca 2 + sensitivity and was required for full change in probe position. At submaximal [Ca 2 +], the thin filament regulatory system may act in a coordinated fashion, with the probe orientation of Ca 2 +-bound cTnC significantly affected by Ca 2 + binding at neighboring regulatory units. The time course of the <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> change and tension after photolytic release [Ca 2 +] by laser photolysis of NP-EGTA was Ca 2 + sensitive and biphasic: a rapid component ∼ 10 times faster than that of tension and a slower rate {{similar to that of}} tension. The fast component likely represents steps closely associated with Ca 2 + binding to site II of cTnC, whereas the slow component may arise from cross-bridge feedback. These results suggest that the thin filament activation rate does not limit the tension time course in cardiac muscle...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound {{shear wave}} elastography is {{becoming}} a valuable tool for measuring mechanical properties of individual muscles. Since ultrasound {{shear wave elastography}} measures shear modulus along the principal axis of the probe (i. e., along the transverse axis of the im-aging plane), the measured shear modulus most accurately represents the mechanical property of the muscle along the fascicle direction when the probe’s principal axis {{is parallel to the}} fascicle direction in the plane of the ultrasound image. However, it is unclear how the measured shear modulus is affected by the <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> relative to the fascicle direction in the same plane. The {{purpose of the present study}} was therefore to examine whether the angle between the principal axis of the probe and the fascicle direction in the same plane af-fects the measured shear modulus. Shear modulus in seven specially-designed tissue-mimicking phantoms, and in eleven human in-vivo biceps brachii and medial gastrocnemius were determined by using ultrasound shear wave elastography. The probe was positioned parallel or 20 ° obliquely to the fascicle across the B-mode images. The reproducibility of shear modulus measurements was high for both parallel and oblique conditions. Although there was a significant effect of the <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> relative to the fascicle on the shear modulus in human experiment, the magnitude was negligibly small.

To overcome this limitation, we have used anatomical landmarks and compared live images with previously acquired baseline images. In addition, several sequences were obtained at each study point and only similar looking areas were retained for data analyses. Finally, we tried to locate ROIs at similar depth and distance from the focal depth to ensure a more uniform acoustic field as recommended by Averkiou et al. [25]. Motion artefact was partially tackled by {{the selection of a}} <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> limiting this motion and by the use of an advanced image stabilisation algorithm in the VueBox® software. Unfortunately, such compensation can only deal with in-plane motion and perhaps further studies should make use of 3 D probes [26].

30|$|Finally, {{the robotic}} drive system carries four main functions: scan, search, direction, and track. Scan is an {{automated}} algorithm which moves the TCD probe {{position in a}} square grid pattern, insonating at each spot, assessing for MCA CBFV signal intensity and providing a color code for its findings (black = poor/no signal found, red = good; with colors ranging from blue, to green, to yellow, to orange, to red). It must be acknowledged that the amount the probe can change in position is limited, so large position corrections still required manual manipulation. After completion of the grid, the proprietary automated algorithm then chooses the best position. The search function provides an automated circular search pattern around the initial starting point, changing both probe position and insonation angle. As with the scan function, it insonates each spot, finding the optimal signal intensity for a final position. The directional function alters the TCD <b>probe</b> <b>angle,</b> using an automated algorithm, {{with the goal of}} finding the optimal insonation angle.

Continuous-wave {{microwave}} Doppler radar {{has been}} used extensively in physiological monitoring, for wireless detection of respiration rate and heart rate, arterial pulse wave, respiratory tidal volume, sleep apnea, and fall detection. By taking the advantage of its non-contact and non- invasive features, physiological parameters can be assessed without obstructing the integrity of patient’s physiological activities {{as well as providing}} a continuous vital sign monitoring for event diagnosis. While physiological rates can be accurately estimated using various radar architectures and demodulation methods, a higher precision instrumentation is needed for accurate physiological waveform tracking and torso displacement estimation that may provide stroke volume and pulse pressure information. In this dissertation, high accuracy displacement estimation techniques were investigated. The goal is to obtain feasible methods in accurately estimation of torso displacement for applying to associated physiological parameters measurement such as stroke volume and pulse pressure. The challenges lie in limitation of accuracy in full signal reconstruction due to Quadrature channel imbalance and limited phase information associated with millimeter-order physiological displacements. To increase chest wall displacement estimation accuracy without compromising the computational complexity for higher precision cardiopulmonary activities reconstruction, quantitative analysis on the center estimation method used for non-linear demodulation of quadrature Doppler radar was presented. To address the issue, techniques that calibrate quadrature Doppler radar outputs for more accurate full waveform recovery and displacement estimation were proposed. Additional contribution of this dissertation presented a preliminary study on the mapping of chest wall mechanics due to respiratory effort.

DOPI does not always yield position accurately, but it is possible to switch back and forth between focused and defocused imaging, thereby getting the centroid and the orientation with precision. We have measured the 3 D orientation and stepping behavior of single bifunctional rhodamine probes attached to one of the calmodulins of the light-chain domain (LCD) of myosin V as myosin V moves along actin.

By capitalizing on existing hardware, the cost and time required for tunnel modifications were significantly reduced.

Newly designed miniature high frequency response total and static pressure probes as well as commercial thermoanemometric probes are suitable tools for this task. However, during the rotating stall cycle the probes are subjected to flow direction changes that are far larger than the range of probe incidence acceptance, and therefore probe data without a proper correction would misrepresent unsteady variations of flow parameters. A methodology, based on ensemble averaging, is proposed to circumvent this problem. In this approach the ensemble averaged signals acquired for various <b>probe</b> setting <b>angles</b> are segmented, and only the sections for <b>probe</b> setting <b>angles</b> close to the actual flow angle are used for signal recombination.

The effectiveness of conventional transverse wave techniques for inspecting artificial and real defects existing in austenitic weldments is experimentally investigated, the limitations are demonstrated, and possible solutions are proposed.

Detailed work has been carried out on the interaction of ultrasound with fatigue and corrosion-fatigue cracks in the weld metal and the heat affected zones (HAZs) of 316 and 347 types of austenitic weldments, together with the influence of elastic compressive stresses, defect topography and defect geometry. Practical applications of all results are discussed, and more effective means of ultrasonic inspection of austenitic weldments are suggested...|$|E

Recent techniques such as Magnetic Resonance (MR) Diffusion Tensor Imaging or Ultrasound Elastic Tensor Imaging (ETI) can derive the fiber directions by measuring the anisotropy of water diffusion or tissue elasticity, but these techniques present severe limitations in clinical setting. In this study, we propose a new technique, the Backscatter Tensor Imaging (BTI) which enables determining the fibers directions in skeletal muscles and myocardial tissues, by measuring the spatial coherence of ultrasonic speckle. We compare the results to ultrasound ETI. Acquisitions were performed using a linear transducer array connected to an ultrasonic scanner mounted on a motorized rotation device with angles from 0 ° to 355 ° by 5 ° increments to image ex vivo bovine skeletal muscle and porcine left ventricular myocardial samples. At each angle, multiple plane waves were transmitted and the backscattered echoes recorded. The coherence factor was measured as the ratio of coherent intensity over incoherent intensity of backscattered echoes. In skeletal muscle, maximal/minimal coherence factor was found for the probe parallel/perpendicular to the fibers. In myocardium, the coherence was assessed across the entire myocardial thickness, and the position of maxima and minima varied transmurally due to the complex fibers distribution. In ETI, the shear wave speed variation with the <b>probe</b> <b>angle</b> was found to follow the coherence variation. Spatial coherence can thus reveal the anisotropy of the ultrasonic speckle in skeletal muscle and myocardium. BTI could be used on any type of ultrasonic scanner with rotative phased-array probes or 2 -D matrix probes for non-invasive evaluation of myocardial fibers...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from laboratory experiments and simulations {{designed to determine}} the ability to localize and characterize fatigue cracks around fastener holes using spherically fo-cused ultrasonic (UT) probes for shear-wave inspections. In designing and evaluating inspection protocols, {{the number of cases}} that can be studied through laboratory experiments is severely limited by cost and time constraints. Simulations therefore stand to {{play a significant role in}} the design and optimization of inspection strategies for those conditions that can be accurately mod-eled. Moving from benchmark studies for relatively simple geometries toward more realistic conditions creates significant challenges. For shear-wave inspections of fastener holes these challenges include the complex energy field in the thin plates, reflections off the borehole, the complexity of making measurements in the near-field, material anisotropy, cracks as small as 1 mm square, and a sealant layer between aluminum sheets. To achieve comparable modeling and simulation data requires a very accurate experimental setup that allows the <b>probe</b> <b>angle,</b> probe height and scan path to be precisely set. For the modeling, care must be taken to match the applied gain and gates used during acquisition of the experimental data. Initial results presented include sensitivity studies to determine how probe variables (frequency, focal depth, diameter), crack variables (size, shape, location, angle with respect to the probe), and the experimental setup affect results. Simulated and experimental C-scan images for 5 and 10 MHz probes are shown in Figure 1 for a fatigue crack that intersects the back wall. This work is supported by the U. S.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of attention has been focused in recent years towards the development of probability of detection (POD) models {{for a variety of}} nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods. Interest in these models is motivated by a desire to quantify the variability introduced in the measurements during the process of testing. As an example, sources of noise in eddy current methods of NDE include those caused by variations in liftoff, material properties such as conductivity and permeability, <b>probe</b> canting <b>angle,</b> scan format, surface roughness and measurement noise.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{specimen}} tilt and <b>probe</b> convergence <b>angle</b> on annular darkfield(ADF) image contrast of Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 heteroepitaxial strained layers on(100) Si were investigated in a 200 kV scanning {{transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) for a TEM specimen thickness of 195 nm. With 0. 5 degrees of specimen tilt away from the exact zone-axis orientation, the signal-to-noise level of atomic columns was significantly reduced for both Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 and Si in high resolution ADF-STEM lattice images. When the specimen was tilted 0. 5 degrees around the axis, or the STEM <b>probe</b> convergence semi <b>angle</b> was reduced from 14. 3 to 3. 6 mrad, the ADF-STEM image intensity profiles across the Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 and Si layers changed significantly as compared to those obtained at the exact zone axis orientation, and no longer reflected the composition changes occurring across the layer structure. Multislice image simulation results revealed that the misfit strain between the Si 0. 8 Ge 0. 2 and Silayers, and strain relaxation near the surface of the TEM specimen, were responsible for the observed changes in image intensity.
